Wow there are a lot of people who don't understand national debt. IF Bitcoin became the global reserve currency, there still would be government bonds, which means nations will still run deficit.

Lol I mined that in the middle of the night on release with my 6700k, got 450 within an hour, hows mining it now?

Pretty much since last spring, and not much at all, my electricity bill didnt go up more that a few dollars per month. I have 8c per kilowatt and my 1070 is at about 120 watts.

Ha. Funny. Loans are funny.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:38:00
Youre thinking about this all wrong, you wouldnt mine while you playb but mine when you arnt playing. Ive made almost 1 ether mining on my 1070 (it has taken a loooonnngggg time) I did this by running the miner while I was sleeping and at school and when I want to game I just close it out. Because this method has been so profitable I am probably going to get 1180 sli, not because I want sli, but because mining has prooven pretty lucrative. (I also have a couple mining rigs but I got into and learned how to mine with the first, gamer method)

Do you work in a construction company? Do you work in any company? Do you even know what an invoice is?
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:33:17
People on this sub:  With Bitcoin we will get rid of banks!
*Bitcoin replaces Fiat
*Banks abolished
*Le new idea: if you give some of your Bitcoin for me to hold, I will loan it out to someone who needs capital, collect interest on loan, and give you some of the kickbacks
*What shall we call the institution that uses le new idea?
People on this sub: *shocked pikachu*

I would never send you a Bitcoin... Unless you get a regulatory body that entitles me to rights and puts you in jail if you break it, also has some sort of collateral to back up the debt.... Wait.... I know what this is called... A BANKING SYSTEM W0W
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:04:57
You know there's a reason nothing is paid up front? Especially in the construction industry? Would you also have any insight into how companies come up with costs? There's a reason that not a single construction company gets close to the top 50 companies in the US. Where are you getting the margin? How will you pay for overhead, mats, and labor?
AKA you cant just say "Bitcoin" and generate money out of thin air, it all comes from somewhere, otherwise that's inflation.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:50:59
Not to mention the entire business world functions based off of loans in the form a materiels/labor. You get contracted, given a down payment and then the rest once the work is done. Suddenly the bodies that 'govern' (not always government) these types of transaction are gone and the solution is pay up front? Yeah the entire economy ground to a halt have fun with that
@_date: 2019-12-26 10:26:19
It doesn't. This is just a circlejerk sub at this point.
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:34:23
Wait... Do you realise that Bitcoin has no "intrinsic value"?
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:45:12
Gold was not ever in a position of Bitcoin. Since the beginning of recorded history gold has been valuable and the preferred method of value store.
And Bitcoin is one unique method, visa is also instant (and ironically faster than Bitcoin)  method that can do fractions of cents.
Please try to like Bitcoin for it's real reasons not these made up ones. What is uniquely Bitcoin is; decentralization and public block chain.
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:31:47
In the most basic sense things with intrinsic value are typically defined by their utility or by the history of having great value. Of which Bitcoin has neither.
Gold has both of these, it has utility in it's physical properties, good conductor, and doesn't tarnish. But it also has been seen as one of the most valuable elements for many thousands of years, with few exceptions.
Or we can see that Iron has enourmous value because of it's strength and usefulness.
But both fiat and Bitcoin are a pure store of value concepts. Fiat has no value if people don't trust the government and Bitcoin has no value if people don't trust the block chain.
Otherwise I heavily rebut that source on grounds of practicality. In order for his argument to make sense you have to agree with his first premise that value is defined at value. While at the basics you can say you don't value food but that's not true. You can say you don't value steel, but that's not true. But you can say you don't value fiat and most people here will agree to some degree, and you can say you don't value Bitcoin and most of the world will agree with you.
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:30:17
Much less than that, how many people here have lost some? I lost some to my highschool self who wiped a phone with a wallet on it RIP.
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:16:27
Oh you mean the article that has your 60 million figure?
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:55:19
Alright let's debunk this using some basic math. 1.5/.001= 1500x50= 75,000lbs of gold PER YEAR in cellphones. 80% is wasted, so 75,000x.8=60,000lbs of gold wasted ONLY in cellphones PER YEAR. 60,000x17,500(rough price of gold)=1.05BILLION US dollars wasted in gold PER YEAR in cellphones ALONE. 
But we are waaaaay off topic. Gold mining is no where close to being comparable to Bitcoin mining, computers still rely on told being mined(why it makes money to mine gold) Bitcoin relies on computers to function. And the act of mining gold and mining Bitcoin are processes that couldn't be further from each other.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:54:08
So you don't disagree with anything I said, I was pointing out how nonsensical it is to compare Bitcoin mining with gold mining.
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:09:48
From above, 1.5 billion sold per year, 
34 kg gold in 1 million smartphones
About 20% of e waste is recycled
So my original math claimed 5lbs of gold per million handsets, this one says 75. Which puts the new estimate (at handsets alone) at 15 billion in wasted gold worldwide. (# sold x gold / cell phones x value in USD per lb gold) FURTHURMORE
This is supported as it is estimated that 20 BILLION of gold was thrown away from ewaste in 2016
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:46:35
Lol they both are sourced from the US EPA, do you not know how to click through sources?
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:32:49
If you read the article, it's the one with the same source as your 60 million figure lol, you discrediting it is discrediting yourself, it's also one of 3 sources so go ahead discredit them all, I'll keep pulling more up, your own source literally corroborates my side
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:49:38
It's almost like half this sub Reddit cant take an hour crash corse and figure things like this out
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:42:55
You realise Bitcoin will forever rely on computers and computers will forever rely on gold, gold is a commodity, Bitcoin is a currency, mining gold is... Mining, mining Bitcoin is a system of distributed trust to facilitate transactions. Bitcoin is more akin to fiat than gold, and electricity usage for all of these come from different objectives and different motivations. This is like me comparing bitcoins mining to electricity used to create t-shirts. T-shirts are a commodity, will not go away because Bitcoin, people who mine Bitcoin will buy t-shirts, and mining Bitcoin is electronic while t-shirts are physical.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:56:03
I mean there are lots of ways to do that, you can look up scaling systems, proof of work, different node tech. It's not really trying to be the best, but it likely is better than the current system of hiring hundreds of thousands of people to transfer fiat around the globe. I am always up for better solutions though and someday Bitcoin will be replaced.
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:34:19
20% of electronics are recycled. Mining gold will need to continue to make equipment for crypto and everything else. This is a fact.
But more importantly, you do realise the point is that mining Bitcoin is retarded to compare to mining gold right?
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:58:34
Hm well a quick Google shows tons of articles with "60 million in rare metals thrown away". Every single on goes down to an EPA research study for 60 million of gold and silver in smartphones thrown away in the US in 2012.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:39:22
This is such a terrible comparison, Bitcoin mining is not even close to gold mining, not to mention the implication seems to either be that Bitcoin mining is superior to gold mining? For starters, every electronic uses trace amounts of gold, so if you want to mine Bitcoin someone is going to be...... Mining gold. And the comparison of "randomly finding" is horendus. A) we have prospecting, surveying and sub surface scanning B) Bitcoin mining is more/less set up as a probability program and always intended to be so. New blocks MUST be solved for the currency to work and inherent unreliability would not work.
If your so focused on this currency can we agree to make a better comparison? Or actually learn how it works, compare bitcoins mining and node electricity usage to all the bank infastructure electricity usage. "Mining" v mining is so dumb on almost every issue.
/Rant over
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:32:36
About 20% of all electronics are recycled
1.5 billion phones are sold per year (and increasing)
And about 50lbs of gold are in 1m phones
And this is only the surface of the entire electronics industry, but you somehow think because of this gold used for electronics is miniscule and an accurate comparison of mining Bitcoin to mining gold. I think I lost some brain cells following your logic.
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:45:55
Your source is from 2012, and only for the US. My sources are current (2017) and global. AND
As you can see here:
Cell phone sales world wide have nearly tripped since then.
So to ram my point home, a billion wasted of gold alone IS a rough estimate but waaaaay closer than a 60 million that is 5 years old and only for a single market(US). Both of these statistics are only for cell phones. Gold is also used in, but not limited to, TV's, desktops, laptops, servers, data centers, airplanes and cars.
