Very cool, but that is not an ATM. It's a bitcoin vending machine. HUGE difference.

No prob. My information may be a bit outdated, so I suppose it's possible that these laws have changed since I last checked.
To answer your question though, in short it's due to regulatory reasons. I recently spoke to one of the bitpay execs at a payments conference who had a BTC vending machine (I believe it was an early version of a [lamasu]( unit). When I asked him why I couldn't get USD back out, he mentioned that the liability introduced by allowing a currency like BTC (which can be transferred worldwide, theoretically with a heavily obfuscated or even anonymized record) to be converted to fiat is too much to bear. In particular, the anti-money-laundering laws could really easily be leveraged to shut this down or put the founders in a world of hurt.
It does look like a lot of ATM manufacturers are passing the liability by [simply selling the machine]( and not operating them though.

It's not an ATM - poorly worded title. Money only goes in, never out, thus classifying it as a BTC vending machine and not a cash dispensary.
