This could point to stagnation in consumer-merchant transaction growth. Are only the early adopters (niche community) using bitcoin to buy stuff, and everyone else who's now entering the ecosystem doing it to speculate?

If bitcoin is a property, and all bitcoin transactions are taxed, and Stripe is gonna process bitcoin payments, isn't it going to be a huge hassle for Stripe to be compliant?
I understand that individual bitcoin users may navigate around that tax guidance, but Stripe as a company needs to remain fully compliant to stay in business.
If Stripe does somehow invest in systems to remain compliant and makes it really easy for consumers to also remain compliant, their processing fee is going to go up and probably eliminate any discounts provided by merchants that would have encouraged consumers to spend their bitcoin.
E.g. why wouldn't I just use fiat to pay through Stripe (which admittedly is really easy at the moment) in order to not go through all the hassle of keeping track of my taxes?
I don't see how this is going to work out for consumers or merchants if bitcoin continues to be treated as a property.

From the article:
A “tweet to send money to others” product was built, as well as other versions of “tweet to buy,” according to sources, but never shipped. Internally, sources said, support for commerce-related programs has waxed and waned over the years.

You can't make that up.

Well they're going to be holding some amount of BTC and using processors to convert it to fiat, etc. There will be some tax hassle there.
In any case, it's still a huge hassle for the me if I need to think about taxes every time I pay a merchant. It's like paying with company stock and all the hassles that implies. I'd just use USD.

Nothing new here. This was clear since FinCEN issued their guidance in 2013.

I've used Whaleclub since they launched. Probably my favorite bitcoin company. They're tender on the marketing but their product and customer support are top-notch.

But that still doesn't sound an alarm when price reaches the specified limit. Just a notification.

I can't set a sound alarm on ZB. It only vibrates (send a notification). That's not enough to wake me up.
