I'm CTO for a startup and those expectations don't seem too unreasonable to me

it looks like the printed code is from the original release by satoshi, not from any recent versions:
    git log --oneline --reverse -G 'BEGIN\\(pchMessageStart'

My goal is sometime this month.

bitcoincore.org is looking to be a nice alternative to bitcoin.org [1]

Mine is extra spooky

I store my wallet in a truecrypt volume on my Dropbox. Wallet.dat is symlinked to it and I have to mount the volume to use Bitcoin.
Safely secured and backed up!
@_date: 2011-05-13 20:01:11
I guess to take it a step further I could set up an rsync cronjob to sync the volume between all my servers. I feel pretty confident in the dropbox solution for now though.

Yeah I think they were only at $1 USD at the time he sold them
@_date: 2011-06-08 16:37:08
I bought 20 bitcoins at $20, they're worth $600 now O_O
@_date: 2011-05-12 04:34:12
I remember randall was in  at one point selling his bitcoins. He was talking about how he didn't want to promote it because he wasn't 100% confident in it yet.

I had the same concern. I've witnessed nuget dependencies switch out the release hashes without any way of noticing. satsbacker is written in Haskell with minimal dependencies. It also has minimal ops requirements. Its a standalone binary that uses sqlite.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:16:22
It's definitely a challenge, I think the importance of financial freedom and self-soverienty is important enough to tackle this problem in any way we can. Incentive solutions is just one idea but I've been talking to lightning folks about technical solutions as well. 
I think Anthony Towns has a procedure for making subscriptions a bit more user friendly by revealing the preimage in multiple layers of sha256 hashes, so you don't need to make an explicit payment each time.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:18:34
Luckily this will be configurable, I just prefer bits which is why I have it set that way on my node.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:33:51
satsbacker is lightning first with onchain payments to come later.
I'm currently using digital ocean. The actual lightning node is somewhere else to avoid vps side channel attacks. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:31:55
Thanks Rene! I think 3rd backer deserves a spot as an alpha tester. I'll send you a link when it's ready.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:36:06
The idea is to have an email with a payment request, with streaks in incentivise renewal.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:11:29
There may be a few hiccups, this is beta software. Luckily I've pinpointed the problem so it should be fixed soon.
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:55:43
satsbacker is not a third party. I am releasing it as an open source project that you can run with your own Bitcoin and lightning node if there's enough interest. Patreon is more than a PayPal donation button or Bitcoin address. There are incentive structures built in, such as backer-only perks.
One thing that I want to do is streaks to incentivise renewal of subscriptions. There are lots of things you can do to incentivise subscriptions with lightning. I have some listed as planned features when you visit the site.

If we're going to compete with solutions like patreon, it can't look amateur. This is what I got when I visited bitbacker on my phone:  we can do better.
I think btcpayserver is the right model going forward, it can't be closed source if we want lasting solutions. My goal for satsbacker is something similar to btcpayserver, but for backer and fundraising use cases.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:42:06
Perhaps you are not up to speed with ghcs runtime system? It is faster than your preferred suggestion (JavaScript at least). I also don't think C or C++ are realistic choices for web servers in 2018.
Given the number of security issues with nodejs dependencies, im happy to avoid that ecosystem. satsbacker.com is deployed with nix, which avoids many of those issues.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:34:49
Unfortunately bitpatron.com is like $3000 according to namecheap. I'm willing to change the name but this is all I could get for now given the many different ways to combine bit, backer and patron into a .com tld that isn't taken already.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:52:24
It's a fresh node, you'll need to open a new channel for now unfortunately.

We have a small dev team here at Monstercat, all Bitcoin nerds. We were thinking about ways to help the Bitcoin economy and incentivize spending. We came to the conclusion that discounts and the increasing purchasing power of Bitcoins would help that goal. 
When Black Friday came along it made us remember our previous discussion, so I spent friday putting together this simple app. It was pretty easy thanks to coinbase (last time I looked into doing this the tools weren't as nice as they are now!).
Eventually we will have a full blown music store, this is just the beginning!
We have 1 sale so far! :) Thanks!
EDIT: 50 orders on the first day! Amazing.
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:59:55
bitsbacker.com works as well, this is what it used to be called. I renamed it to avoid confusion with bitbacker.io which is a similar service.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:32:02
I hope one day we can pay out our artists with Bitcoin. Right now we have to manually wire transfer ($25 fee) or paypal (evil/annoying/human DoS). Running a bash script that pays everyone out with a click of a button and minimal fees would be amazing.
Everything is better on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:10:31
Yeah I noticed there was a bug with codes not being marked as claimed and I fixed it early on. I'll send you some working codes right now.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:14:18
Also I'm not sure where bandcamp's interface is sending messages to. If anyone else has issues with their codes, msg me on reddit or email me at bill with your order number and I'll send you fresh ones.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:39:01
You don't have to download them immediately, you will be emailed bandcamp album codes after purchase. You can redeem/download them at your convenience.
