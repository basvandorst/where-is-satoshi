The size of the blockchain would grow massively if every exchange were built on top of it. It would be unsustainable I'm sure, as we're already worrying about the size of the blockchain and it's growth and trying to find measures to limit its' size. Plus, it would be slow if you had to worry about confirmations, etc etc...
I think pretty much every place that handles money, (sort of) works like that. You pile up the stuff somewhere safe and just keep tight record of who owns what. I don't see how it's any more fishy and risky in bitcoin's case.

I'm really curious though, the amount of bitcoins being traded on MtGox is pretty massive, so they have to have (had, in your prediction) a lot of the stuff.
Where exactly would you say they all disappeared to?

From how I've understood it, a bitcoin address basically consists of three important details: The public address itself, this being known to others (or being "online") is fine and unavoidable. Then you have your public key, this goes "online" if you send anything from the address, and somewhat lowers the security of it. Lastly there's the private key which gives full access to the address and should never get compromised.
Your offline/paper wallet's address will show up on the blockchain as soon as any coins are sent to it.
About your second question. With your example, on Bitcoin-Qt it would send the remaining 2 BTC to a [change address]( in the background. I'm not sure if this is true for other wallet software.

You have to understand that mining requires power, and electricity isn't free. We're at a point where you pretty much need really specific type of hardware to actually generate more bitcoins than you're spending on electricity

From your own link:


Your reply brought nothing to the discussion

You should be able to run it from the source if you don't want to wait for pre-built binaries. Long story short, you'll need [Python2]( [PyCrypto]( [PyQT4]( [goxtool](git://github.com/prof7bit/goxtool.git), and the actual program from [here]( I hope that's enough research material to get you going

Relevant point in the source code: 
Apparently, if the transaction in question is being monitored for verifications and hasn't received any, it'll say -1. When would it not be monitored for transactions? Good question, I don't know. It might be a small bug.

I don't really understand the problem here.
mBTC or milliBTC is 0.001 BTC  
uBTC or microBTC is 0.001 milliBTC or in other words 0.000 001 BTC
Each is one thousandth of the previous. This seems much clearer to me as opposed to having to start think in millions of satoshis as soon as you go few decimal points lower than one BTC
Here's the wikipedia entry for metric prefixes for further reference: 
Are you perhaps from a country that still uses imperial units? :)

Yes, they are. Your own link only contained three sentences and you still missed the last one: "If necessary, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.", exactly like STEVERODGERS said

I was a bit annoyed at first by the weekly/daily posts about re-inventing the BTC naming scheme, but I'm actually starting to worry a bit that something like this might end up happening. As an European I can't but shake my head whenever I see imperial units being used. It's just a total mess.
Now there are tons of posts from tons of different people all suggesting their own way to call and divide bitcoins. Let's take this as an example:


So now, 0.001 BTC = 1 centiBTC (cents) = 1 "BTC dollar" (and inevitably) = 100 "bitdollar cents"
Totally destroying the relation to metric prefixes just to hang on to the word "dollar"?
What if in five years one bitdollar costs 2500 US dollars? Or 0.028 US dollars?
I understand the psychological aspect of the issue, because I was there when my local currency was turned into euro, and even though that was very difficult for a lot of people, (most) people actually did learn in the end, because we had to.
In the end, if people want to use bitcoins, they **have** to learn and adapt, whether they would use bitcoins or "bitdollars" or whatever else. Can't we just keep this one system that actually makes sense so we won't find ourselves with imperial-like system of naming [insert-cryptocoin-still-alive] 20 years from now on that no longer makes any sense whatsoever?
Anyway, that's just my two cent-^^^\*headexplode\*
