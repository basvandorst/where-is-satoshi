Pretty stupid to accept a piece of currency at proper fiat value with the potential to go down by 30% in months and has a massive downward trend for a year.
But in the case of selling drugs and accepting money? Well, I doubt drug dealers have much of a choice anyway.

And pay the fees to do so. If you're going to turn it into fiat immediately, then get paid by fiat. If you want to speculate with a currency and hope it goes up, then get paid in bitcoin, lol.

This is almost certain to be the answer. Peterson has taken *many* hard stances on topics in the past. Hell, his popularity stems entirely from his stance against the Left, comprised mainly of a religious audience that aligns itself with the christian god. It's be suicide to not believe in that very god.

It's not difficult to say one doesn't believe in *any* supreme being known as a singular god until the existence of which is proven to exist.
That is the actual, correct way of thinking. Not muddling about things that are not known to exist  and keeping one mind's open until evidence points to it.
I also do not think of people being "with me" or "against me" when asking that question, but I can't speak for everyone else. Too many people have some sort of agenda when it comes to asking personal questions.
