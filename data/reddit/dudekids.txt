How much did you lose this morning?
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:51:52
I looked into them before but shied away.  Have you had a good experience?
How long does it take generally to get verified, and how long after you purchase a coin (say, example, LTC), does it take to show up in your account?

This started kicking in last week. A 12 year BoA customer, and long time BoA credit card holder, I closed my account. 
I opened my free student checking with them out of necessity in 2006, my local bank wasnt available in college. Used them as my 2nd bank for years. At one point they changed it to e-checking, where they basically said "your account is free as ling as you dont come in and talk to any tellers"...ok, fine by me, its all online anyway.
Now, theyve eliminated the free account altogether.  I had $200 direct deposit going in (100 per check), use the account for sending money, and my BoA cc was tied to the account for rewards purposes.  They will not budge on the $12 fee. I went to branches and called their help line.  Even after explaining to them I have 200 monthly in d.deposit, and theyre making money any time I keep a CC balance, they just said they couldnt help a 12 year customer. 
Their requirements to waive the fee are honestly ridiculous, IMO.  A $250 direct deposit, or $1500 minimum.  Shit, if I had $1500 lying around Id rather throw it into BTC than a BoA account.  On my walk to close the account in the branch, I walked by 3 banks offering free checking...either completely free or a ridiculously easy waive requirement (i.e. Santander is free if you do ONE transaction in a month...and theyre cool with btc transactions!)
Sorry to rant, I know this isnt BTC related really, but shame on BoA. I work in banking, they are a laughingstock. They absolutely do not care about their customers, I highly advise banking anywhere but.

Doug, just wanted to send you a shoutout.  Your videos are awesome.  I pretty much got into this space with your videos as my guide.  Great stuff, very entertaining.  
Oh and by the way....GO BITCLAVE!!

My bigger concern is, I've been reading that you wont be able to purchase BTC or other coins with USD/Fiat...is this true? If so, what makes this any better than say, GDAX?
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:11:31
Pardon my newbie-ness, but is it available to me in the U.S.?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:48:43
Hoping someone can give me some advice...Is there a place to purchase BTC/ETH/LTC that is faster than coinbase?  I tried to verify my debit card but every single time it says "the amounts you've entered do not match our records" when I'm literally staring at them on my screen.  Then it shuts me down for 24 hours. I dont want to wait for 7 days for my coins to show up, that's apparently an eternity in Crypto trading.  Where do you guys recommend for quicker transactions?  Ideally I want to purchase something like LTC so I can invest in alts all in the same day

The shitposters are out in full force, I see
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:03:47
One way you could try to do it is sell the GC into Paypal...the online ones are able to do this sometimes, or maybe check out any website that does this or the GCX sub.  Exchange your GC into funds in your Paypal, use those funds to buy BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:25:53
I didnt know they even had support.  I've been waiting to be authenticated since Jan 22.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:32:24
That isnt the situation I described though...I don't "prefer to sit in fiat".  I prefer to buy dips of an alt coin whenever I see an opportunity, and I can't just do that without shifting my existing portfolio around.  Ideally I'd be able to buy $200 of BTC on the spot, have it immediately, and then use that BTC to buy whatever shitcoin I desire at that moment.
Yes, I know there is an option for CC or Debit card payments.  Not trying to go down a rabbit hole here, what I said was tongue in cheek.  In fact, Coinbase gives me an error every time I try to verify my debit or cc, so the issue actually still remains.  As it stands, I cannot on a whim purchase BTC using fiat and use that BTC immediately, which would be ideal.

Wait a minute though...are you SURE that Crypto currency applies to FBAR reporting?  I did a little digging, [this article]( is from 2017, but still:


Do you have anything that explicitly states that the IRS *does* require FBAR reporting now?
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:37:19
Wow, you aren't kidding.  It looks like someone is just spamming fake accounts underneath to make it look real.  All of the accounts have just 1 tweet.  Also funny that the post came from BitCOLN core...lol what a joke
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:28:57
If I could plan ahead for every coin dip I want to buy, I probably wouldn't be posting on reddit :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:54
I mean, on the flip side of that, couldn't someone have just held from 2006 to present and been just fine?  This could go either way
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:16:23
Have you actually tried transacting with LTC vs. BTC?  Maybe now with faster BTC transactions (not supported by many exchanges/wallets yet still), but LTC is literally 10x faster to send across exchanges than BTC.  I am a BTC guy and I'm sure they will get everything figured out, but any time I want to do trading, or send my funds to different exchanges, I always do so in Litecoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:01:56
Yeah, you could do that.  Or just transfer the paypal funds to a bank account and buy it through an exchange.

Not everything is this cut and dry.  How about this example:
I already have $1500 tied up in crypto that I've previously invested.  I get paid bi-weekly, and have a small part of that is budgeted towards BTC or crypto purchases.  I want to purchase a coin like DENT because it is currently dipping, right now, and I like the tech (just an example).  I'd love to buy BTC on the spot so I can use it to buy DENT, but unfortunately, I have to wait 7 days via coinbase.  By the time that 7 days is over, the price of DENT has changed completely.
It's not always possible to "plan ahead", and it's not always "investing more than you can afford to lose".  It is, however, always inconvenient to have to wait 7 days for your coinbase purchase to arrive, no matter the situation.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:49:09
Haha, well, I wish I had the problem of needing to file an FBAR for my crypto portfolio.  There are worse problems to have! lol
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:10:24
This....is brilliant
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:46:25
Got it, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:56:18
Awesome, now how do I avoid the 7 day waiting period to actually get my currency?
