There are two alarm bells that ought to be going off so hard you can't hear yourself think:
* this is *clearly* criminal activity. Not a bitcoin use case you want to be shouting about too loudly, if this is supposed to be the 'future'.
* if Bitcoin is the future, how come this guy wants out so badly? Surely he should wanto hang on to his 400k+ coins???

He's asking because describing something as 'contentious' means it is a contended point - there is not yet an agreement. It *in no way* indicates an opinion on the matter. It could, of course, be shown to be false by demonstrating a large consensus opinion on the matter, but then it is only poor commentary. It is fundamentally *not* a stance on a subject.

So, assuming I'm big enough, cunning enough, mean enough, or whatever else it takes, and mug you in the street for your wallet, clothes, keys, fillings and anything else I can take from you, that's fair play, huh? How far does that concept go? I assume you assume you'll be armed and able to defend yourself, but what if I ambush you and just shoot you dead for your shit? Is that *fair game*? What if I come to your home, with a few heavily armed friends, kick the doors in and take whatever I want? You failed to 'control' the sanctity of your home, right? How about I want to take you as my own sexual plaything? If we assume I can assert control over you (against your will, of course) then that's okay, right? That is a magical ideology you got there.

When that value is expressed in terms of the dollar - or whatever other fiat currency you wish to use - your entire statement is a nonsense. You realize that, right? In this scenario, BTC is simply subbing in for dollars, much like store gift tokens have a value expressed in dollars on them. Just because you're talking about what is effectively a second order currency, doesn't, in *any meaningful way* separate you from the first order currency, and any statements reflecting its value. We are so far away from a purely BTC based economy, it might actually be closer to you if turned around and walked back the other way.

Moving from where to where? This doesn't represent currency speculation on the markets, so I don't understand what your compariosn is supposed to mean? Every transaction in bitcoin 'moves' on the blockchain, but that doesn't even mean any other goods, services, or currency was involved. To compare 'movement' of bitcoin with any other currency, you have to account for literally every positional change of every coin and note and ledger entry in the economy; give your kid his allowance? Movement. Make a withdrawl from the bank? Movement. Take physical cash from a small safe and put it in your wallet for going out tonight? Movement. 
This post is conflating the movement of entries on the blockchain with the market term 'move' for buying or selling stocks, bonds, currencies, futures, etc. it doesn't mean anything.

A 90% ROI means you get back *90%* of what you invested. There are two amounts of money here, the amount you invest, and the amount you get back. Once you invest the first amount - it's gone. The return (the second, independent, amount) is then some proportion of the first amount. if it is 100%, you get out what you put in. If it is a 50% ROI, you get back *half* what you put in. If it is a 150% ROI, you get back what you put in, plus 50%.

These comments contain no significant information. Several of their assertions are frankly wrong. For example, exchanging money between devices for the "IoT" is a trivial matter. It's so trivial, I'm confused as to why anyone would think you'd need *dedicated hardware* for the task. 
"I'm fairly sure this is not an end user device..." - wishful thinking.
"Links your 21 box to your twitter account, and any paywall website lets you read anything you want without pop ups, ad, or subscriptions." - the Raspberry Pi could take on that task, at 1/8 the hardware cost.

I'm not sure what you *are* saying. What I'm saying is that if all you have is faith, you don't have very much, and if you've done your homework properly, faith shouldn't be necessary. Holding faith on Bitcoin, because it *seems* like a good idea is a poor investment, when all the viable economic indicators don't look good for it. People are too willing to hold 'faith' in a bad investment for all manner of personal reasons, and very few - if any - valid, empirical ones. 
Pay attention to doubt, allow it to make its case, and then try and close it down with reason. Or keep 'blind' faith that you're on the right path until it is impossble to deny that you aren't.

so, you don't *know*? You don't have proof? If someone stole from you, usually there's practical, viable recourse of some sort. Not just vigilantism.
And how do we know what the story is? From just *your* say so? How do we know you aren't spinning a line, and screwed the other guy? "I ran out of bitcoin" sounds fishy as hell; if the other guy got concerned and backed out, I might well support that, based just on what *you're* saying. Who only knows how they see it?

The Bitcoin price isn't fixed in bitcoin. Until that starts to happen, it's not really money.
Also, not anywhere near me, that I'm aware of. I live in NYC; I think I actually *could* get a coffee for euros round here, before I could get one for BTC.
