Being able to save for later without losing value is a critical characteristic of a good bank.  When the same requirement is applied to a currency itself, you tend to have problems.  I don't think the problems caused by bitcoin are going to be quite as big as the gold standard, but it's a poor currency to use if you're planning on basing a community on it.  Even most capitalist economists agree that inflation is an essential feature of good currency.

I'm not a bitcoin user, bit it seems you can limit the amount stolen by keeping two wallets, and keeping the balance of the one on your browsing computer to the minimum amount needed - kind of like a checking account and a savings account at a bank.

Yeah, I agree that the number of Bitcoins is increasing, but at some point it is designed to stop, and individual currency losses like the one you stated will make the currency "monetarily deflationary" as well as "price deflationary."

Most economists seem to think that deflation and recessions are strongly correlated, and the idea that any connection is a myth is a minority opinion.
You could help the discussion by listing those historical examples, as I can't think of any.  I'm going to take a jump a guess that they are in a different category than Bitcoin and depression-era Dollar.  In some cases when a currency is expected to inflate, or eventually inflate, and the deflation is a short phase, the economy may continue without significant interruption.  But when the currency both deflates and is widely expected to continue deflating, money hording and other market poisoning activities can become self-reinforcing.  The latter case explains the Depression well, and also describes the current state of Bitcoin.

Good article.  But it points out the difference that sets high heels and colleges apart - there are social penalties for cashing out.  The game theory rules for Bitcoin and tulips are different than fashion and education.

This is true to an extent.  But the longer they held onto their money, the better off they were.  The rich are able to hang on to their money much longer, making deflation extremely regressive.


I think you have the direction of this feedback loop backwards.  As the expected purchasing power of tomorrow's money continues to increase, so does the incentive to save it one more day.  I think most economists consider this period to be a deflationary spiral.

Yeah, the bit about iTunes etc. made me cringe.

Look at it this way.  There are certainly people doing illegal things with Bitcoin right now.  They're doing illegal things with dollars too, but what's important is the U.S. Government's [view on alternative currency](






They will almost certainly some day challenge the legitimacy of Bitcoins, and when that day comes, you want the best lawyers available on Bitcoin's side.  The EFF are those guys.  Consider a donation to the EFF an investment in the future value and tradability of Bitcoins, as well as a hedge against potential terrorism charges on your record.

I'm not an economist, so I'm going to clarify some things.  I assume you mean by "price deflationary" that the prices for goods in Bitcoins steadily decrease.  And you mean by "not monetary deflationary" that the total amount of Bitcoins in circulation does not decrease over time.
