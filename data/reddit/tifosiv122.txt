I can confirm this does work. An employee of mine was bitten by this virus on a Friday. All his network attached drives were infected as well. Backups on Friday, Saturday, &amp; Sunday were all infected. 
On Monday we reverted back to Thursday, losing only a day's worth of work. Wiped his PC and went back to normal. We did keep a copy of all infected files just in case this day ever came.
I submitted a single .xls file via the website and about 3 hours later got the decrypt key with instructions. It's file by file command line, but it works. 
Ultimately this will come in handy in case we need a file done on that one day and we don't have another copy - either way, I'm very thankful. Thanks OP for bringing this to my attention.

I got one today. The word "FREE" was hand written. I guess not a lot of takers at $500.

Well we assumed it would be the 'solution' - ideally people would buy BTC on their CC and the provider would make either the spread or charge a fee. My buddy's shop would decrease the price of the item to offset that.

That's why I couldn't find anything...makes sense.

I don't know - it could. He is not interested in Bitcoin himself, he's interested in accepting it as a payment type. The problem, as he sees it, is that most of his customers would not know / understand what bitcoin is. If he had a method to convert on the spot, he thinks they may try it. It was an idea to spread the use, not really anything more than that. Unfortunately it seems as if it will be more work/hassle to implement than to not do it at all.

Does circle release the BTC immediately so you can transfer them out?

I tried this last week to rent a car I was considering buying. It's a fantastic service, went smoothly. The owner told me the first renter of the car got into a major accident and turo paid to fix it immediately

I stand corrected. But TD Bank follows this policy as well.

Not sure where you are from but in the US it is illegal to store cash in a bank's safe deposit box.

I saw this too, wondering the same thing. Not far from my office.
