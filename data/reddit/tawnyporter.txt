Lol. Just lol.
"Spending and having no savings is bad for the individual but good for Big Business. "
Spending moves the economy. Economics 101 buddy. If you spend money to create a business/buy ASSETS instead of hoarding, everyone benefits but especially the individual. Don't know why you mention big business.
"Decentralization IS inefficient, but its more secure from people doing bad things without consensus(audit the fed anyone?)."
The crypto exchanges are anything BUT secure. There is NO legal security in Bitcoin. The developers decide (aka 51% Jihan Wu/Bitmain), you follow. Plus, How many exchanges are hacked? 
"After 10 years, bitcoin still works. It will have absorbed Dozens of Trillions of dollars and many institutions will have an incentive in maintaining the ledger and mining the daily transactions. "
Nope. You see, market cap doesn't equal real dollars in the market. It is estimated 10-15 billion dollars have entered the market in total.
Despite that, bitcoin is not accepted by any Fortune 1000 company, save your indie coffee shop started by your friends using real dollars (not BTC).
"I do not plan on selling my Bitcoin to the next bag holder for more. I plan on trading my Bitcoin for Items I really desire. Just recently I sold 38 Litecoins at $250 each to buy a New(to me) Lexus. It was a private sale and I asked him if he wanted the Litecoins or the cash. He made a good choice and asked for the cash. lol. "
LOL. Jokes on you, dude. The seller didn't want Litecoin. He wanted USD. Plus sounds odd since no private sellers don't sell new Lexus and new Lexus do not cost 38x250=9500$. 
Point is, leave crypto. Y'all can downvote me if you please, but I urge you to play devil's advocate and try to understand the other point of view, of someone who believed and held crypto before.

The Bitcoin shills brainwashed you. Now you buy the BTC they mine every month with part of your paycheck. Ka-ching!

You can't be serious! He's saying Bitcoin will reach higher ATHs because it's done it before! Well, so has Bitconnect, for that matter!

You need to understand. Do not buy and HODL Bitcoin! It's antieconomic. It's like buying gold. You'll do better in the stock market, bonds market or other productive assets. Bitcoin doesn't work after 10 years and will not work. Decentralization comes at a huge cost which makes it extremely inefficient. The only way to profit from Bitcoin is to sell it for a higher price to the next bagholder who expects to do the same.

Of course they can. See India and Pakistan. Trading bitcoin is illegal now, so no bank access to fund your account at an exchange.
