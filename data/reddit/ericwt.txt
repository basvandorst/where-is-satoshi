I understand your argument. However the original beauty of Bitcoins was no controlling authority.
Now that the Bitcoin foundation has jumped into bed with regulators a lot of that magic is gone and it will never come back.
Sad for Bitcoins but it opens up the door to other Cryptocurrencies who will go beyond what Bitcoins has done.

No it is not if you do not understand the Ripple system.
Ripple has failed to educate people on how to use the system.
I will take bitcoins over an over hyped US corporation that created it own alternative currency.
I do think Ripple is a great alternative to the SWIFT System.
@_date: 2013-07-12 02:19:31
Litecoins are worth paying attention to.
For my own speculation purposes..
Feathercoin and PPcoin

The problem here is Ripple has not done the job of educating people about what Ripple is and how to use it.
Do I need Ripple? No way, I have no problem collecting and cashing out Bitcoins.
The gift that Ripple is as an alternative to SWIFT. A significant improvement as far as the cost of the SWIFT system.
The Bitcoin market is chump change and why open coin is going after this market is beyond my understanding.
The real money for Ripple (if they get their act together) is non SWIFT banking 
Does it provide a needed service at a good price? For banks and finance companies, yes. That is all that matters.
The market will ultimately give the answer. Including all the things that Ripple does not do right.
All you people bitchi8ng about Ripple...keep bitching, the market will eventually hear you and provide what you want in an alternative currency
Open coin is marketing to the wrong market. A foolish mistake that might destroy Ripple in the end. 
Do I care? 
Nope, until Open Coin starts paying me, I do not give a hoot.
I am quite content to not use Ripple and will wait for another company to come up with a real solution.

The article was comparing apples to oranges. They are two different things.
Ripple is an alternative to the SWIFT systems. A cheaper alternative.
However until Ripple can get gateways that the average user wants it is not necessary to have Ripple to possess Bitcoin Transactions.
Also there are questions about Central authority when an US company controls the Ripple currency.
Nice idea, great for banks and financial institutions that are not connected to SWIFT.
For the average user Ripple is not necessary.
There are still lingering questions about Ripple that have not been answered in my mind.

The dollar is in serious jeopardy.
The difference between assets and liabilities is the Central banks equity 
The Feds have $54 billion in capital on $3.57 trillion in liability, roughly 1.53%. 
In December they had 1.875% equity in capital so the trend is getting worse.
If the US Federal Reserve's assets unexpectedly lose more than 1.5% of their value, the Fed's equity would be wiped out.
The government could not afford to bail the Federal reserve out.
Their is no way to stop this, the dollar is already worthless. The writing is on the wall.
Don't say I did not warn you.
I will take Bitcoins. ;)

Hello...people are taking Tide in the USA for payment.
Barter has been around for years.
In any city or town you can exchange gold or silver for products and services.
Regardless of what any government requires, it everything goes crazy, it does not matter what a government requires.
Little risk? How about the German Mark at the end of World War II?

Usually I ignore posts like this that are vague with what the subject is but in this case, I am glad I looked.
Absolutely hilarious!

They will never get rid of cash.
Politicians need cash for bribes and kick backs.
A corrupt society will always have cash.

Makes no difference the Bitcoin Foundation has willingly jumped into the bed with Federal regulators.
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:34:54
I did a due diligence check on BTCe a few days ago. There is no way in hell I would put my precious Bitcoins there.
Just my opinion. 
I wish you luck.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:45:27
Strange I have had no problem buying/selling and using bitcoins as payments.

Another satisfied customer.
So will you be recommending MtGox in the future? ;)

There is no banking center where offshore bank accounts are bullet proof.
The banking system is controlled.

Read the disclaimer on the website. 
I live in Belize. If you loose your bitcoins there is no legal recourse.
You are not going to come to Belize and use the court system to get back your bitccoins. 
They will laugh in your face. 
Belize has privacy laws. That is why people incorporate here. A good deal of bitcoin companies smartly incorporate here.
I would pay to see someone try to explain Bitcoin to a Judge here.
It is funny people down vote me and yet I did not put my bitcoins in danger.
 All I gave was a personal opinion that is based on the fact I understand Belize corporations and how the system works here.
@_date: 2013-07-18 05:24:38
So this is a template or theme? ???
I am not sure exactly what you are selling or offering and I spent time reading your site.
That is not a good sign.
@_date: 2013-07-20 14:28:00
Excuse me, the world did not realize it was not necessary to exchange dollars for gold.
Nixon knew we couldn't actually pay for our out of control spending, so he removed the requirement to back the dollar with gold.
As the US dollar was the major trading currency the world did not have a choice.
Not impressed with the article or logic.

How much is the price after the free trial?
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:34:20
But that doe not cover FINCEN laws that require financial companies to verify the identity of the person.
This is law. Not the Guidelines for Bitcoins they posted recently. 
Don't believe me, open up a Solid Trust Pay account.
Unverified you can earn up to $400 US a month. (from memory, see their terms and conditions)
But if you want to go to an exchange and get $5.00 out of your account the exchange will not do it until your identity is verified.
I realize it is a British company, but the USA tells other counties what to do, what they can't do and how to do it.
The other counties are more than happy to comply.
@_date: 2013-07-24 20:07:52
You are right if you are a US citizen.
I was thinking of starting an investment company based entirely on Cryptocurrencies, but after legal counsel from my US attorneys I would not even consider it.

It sounds great in theory. The government has your best interest at heart. LMAO, again.
The funny part is a good deal of you have bitcoins in accounts that are corporations owned by Americans who incorporated in Belize.
When your accounts get frozen by  Big brother you will be the first ones crying.
They already know these corporations are violating US and Belize law. It is just a matter of time now.
So remember it is a good thing trusting the SEC when they lock your accounts and you loose your bitcoins.
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:07:39
I do not blame them. 
If I had an exchange or Bitcoin investment company, I would not even consider selling to US citizens.
Way to risky and the laws are changing fast.
What was legal one year ago may not be legal today.
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:56:08
They can dance all around the disclaimers on the website, but when the US has an axe to grind it does not matter.
Liberty Reserve had all of its assets frozen. We still do not know if they are really guilty of a crime.
No due possess, the assets were frozen without proof of guilt.
What is going to be real interesting is when Belize figures out what is going on...Financial companies that are pretending not to be financial companies.
Then Belize is going to be all over them because the they were not incorporated as financial companies, nor do they have the expensive yearly Financial services license.
I do not like the way things are. In fact I hate it.
But adding a disclaimer on a site is not going to protect them. 
I wish them luck. They need it.
@_date: 2013-07-16 18:55:53
What an idiot.
Kind of like the confidence the world has in the US dollar? 
I am sure that confidence in the dollar will stop it from falling.
Typical brainwashed sheep media.
They will be the first ones crying when the dollar collapses.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:39:05
I have never had that problem. Buy from an individual.
Or set up a business with a product or service and have others send bitcoins to you.
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:29:33
Interesting wallet.
@_date: 2013-07-24 05:15:22
Bitcoins has a controlling authority.... The US government. 
Everything the US government gets it hands on they screw up.
Look at Banking in the USA.
There is nothing wrong with a difference of opinion.
I just do not believe the answers are in regulation. 
No, I have said my piece here.
Nothing else to complain about regarding Bitcoins.
It was a great experiment.
@_date: 2013-07-28 15:25:30
I have tested Ripple and I do not think it is in any way a threat to Bitcoin.
If you want to buy, sell and use Bitcoins as a payment method you do not need Ripple.
But good luck with your plan. ;)
@_date: 2013-06-10 12:43:43
Hilarious, thanks for sharing. :)
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:39:37
Interesting points, cute article but not relevant.
The US government and Federal Reserve bankers only have the illusion of power right now.
When the dollar collapses and it will the US dollar will not be the dominant currency and the USA as an economic power will be severely limited.
Granted they could still launch missiles but the world as a whole is getting sick of US aggression.
Winks at the gentlemen in the Utah data center. ;)
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:13:51
This is what the media does. It blows things out of proportion.
FATCA is stupid and there is no reason any country should agree to do it.
However there are still places on earth that US citizens can open offshore accounts.
There will be countries and financial institutions that will not comply with FATCA.
There will be places that will comply and will allow US citizens to open bank accounts.
Until the rest of the world grows some balls and tells the USA to take a hike, it is going to be harder to open accounts for US citizens.
When the dollar collapses, and rest assured it will, the USA will have no leverage in this matter.

I like your idea.
Do you actually subscribe to the big three credit reporting agencies?
I do not think equifax is going to take a credit report on a  Bitcoin loan payment from a private individual to another private individual using Bitcoins.
Again, I like your idea  However, I am not sure how it is building credit..
