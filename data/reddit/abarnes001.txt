Coinbase is gonna cancel orders again. Calling it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:57
You don't say
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:45
is it live?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:31
I pooped a little bit when I saw it hit $14.2k
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:03
We were at $19,199 and then out of nowhere someone puts up a 100+ order at $19,190. Price drops immediately. Some whale is pissed that we passed 19k
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:19
Manipulation is the only reasonable answer
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:17:12
someone bought 80 BTC  holy fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:01
Click bait at its finest
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:34
It's a pump and dump. Wait for that money to trickle back to us.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:40
have u been under a rock?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:29:24
They're pussies. Don't want their precious BCH to drop like a brick.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:50
was this just announced??
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:18
Couldn't be happening to a more honest group of people
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:12:19
This B-cash craze is pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:11
 as of 18:30 PST
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:26:31
This manipulation is awful. These fuckers know it's gonna explode and they don't want it to.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:12:52
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:49
Coinbase has happened
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:46
yeah who the fuck is giving away 3 BTC for 1 BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:49
♫ You've got to dig bitcoin holes.
Diggin up up holes. Diggin up up holes.
You've got to dig bitcoin holes. ♫
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:03
fucking scam
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:19:37
My guess is that it will "magically" go away when the next futures begin trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:01:36
443 wall at $19,000
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:13
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:11
You sound like a likable person
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:44:51
Absolutely. Don't trust them at all to do the right thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:59
Probably won't open again for weeks
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:51
it's halted
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:15
it's unregulated
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:16
fuck em
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:43:20
You'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:50
Wouldn't be surprised if these Coinbase pussies cancel existing orders again. Order book looks like a blood bath.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:07
Title is misleading
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:19
Did you download the whole blockchain yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:07
Coinbase "spontaneously" announced that they were going to open Bitcoin Cash to trading tonight. Many theories going around about insider trading. I would imagine that people are getting sketched out with Bcash now because of what is currently going on with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:49
I asked myself the same thing at $9,400. Bought over $600 worth of BTC, and I'm now up about $200 and counting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:33
uh it's already 10:30 am PST
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:29:12
Dilly Dilly!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:56
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:47
Coinbase can go to hell
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:37
I meant that in terms of CNBC sucking his balls dry. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:19:04
[fuck these dumb walls] (
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:13:59
It's absolutely justified. Their credibility is now in the shitter.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:15:36
guy at  $17,737.42 is a fucking prick 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:28
still showing up for me
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:39
I hope so
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:50:11
I tried the bank transfer initially and I got an email like 2 minutes later saying that Coinbase automatically cancelled my transaction. I was pissed because I was locked in at $9500. I had to resort to a USD Wallet transfer that I am still waiting on.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:09:32
no it didn't
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:10
Yeah I started a transfer two days ago. Sucks watching BTC skyrocket in the meantime.
