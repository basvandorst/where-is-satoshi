Yes please do...If there are any new vulnerabilities if good to let the community know so a fix can be implemented.  As far as I know if you use 2 factor the only way you could get hacked was if he tried to log in to a fake blockchain site and gave away a 2 factor code..With the second password to send btc it near impossible to get hacked from the user side...and blockchain does not store passwords or private keys so if they got hacked users would be safe

Tell him download the Google authenticator app and use it anytime coins are stored online. I personally think all sites that deal with bitcoin should make it mandatory for user protection. Bitcoin can be stored securely with no worries but you have to do it right. If he's storing them ling term use an encrypted paper wallet with a backup. Keeping a small amount in a smart phone wallet is pretty safe as well as long as you set a pin and keep a back up somewhere else. And never leave coins on an exchange if you don't control the private keys you don't control the bitcoin and that's sort of against the whole point of bitcoin. Good luck

Coinbase is a decent place to buy. but don't use it for a wallet. Buy your coin and transfer immediately to a wallet you control the private keys for. Remember to always use 2 factor authentication and back up your keys
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:22:04
Does he use 2 factor authentication? How about a second password for sending bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:44:16
You should be good. Looks like you control that address

Ok so he was logging in on his pc? It may have been that his wallet synced when he logged in and the transactions already happened.
If he was not using 2 factor at least there could be a number of ways his log in password was compromised. Rule  in securing btc is ALWAYS use 2 factor and do not trust any exchange or online wallet that does not offer 2 factor authentication as an option.
Securing btc online is more than just a password.  People have to get used to taking more steps to secure accounts because hackers have alot more incentive to hack btc wallets than say your Facebook account.
In the future (if he doesn't just give up on crypto) make sure he knows how to secure it. Also, make sure his email account is secure. Gmail has a 2 factor option. I personally have a separate gmail account for any btc related online services and I keep it segregated. I'm a little overly paranoid but hey I've never lost any btc in over 2 years.

Bitstamp has topped gox volume several times. But it has fluctuated. Either way its still in the top 3. You can't discount any exchange with loads of volume. Now would I choose to buy Btc there with fiat? Only if I didn't have another choice. But I trade there a lot just to try and gain Btc and many other day traders do the same. They have a great trade engine. I just hope soon that we have more banks allow Bitcoin businesses in and then we will see how high the value can go with seem less liquidity. Thank you for accepting my opinion. Don't get much of that here lol.  Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:07:29
I'm hoping he has at least heard of it. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:41:44
It hasn't been falling for a couple days either...look I'm not blind to the fact that trends can change and bit kin could lose a lot of value very quickly. But so far the only trend we have is upward. The last downtrend was for about a month after april. Bitcoin has been in a strong uptrend for 4 years now.

The guy accepts vanilla reloads and netspend reload cards and usually has my Btc in my wallet within minutes. I've been using him for a year he's a good guy and very trustworthy he used to sell on eBay. Cheaper than gox usually also

"These sell-offs" I'm describing are the reality of the market price at mt.gox. anyone who looks can confirm what I wrote. Wait.....
I just realized how much of an idiot I am for even continuing to argue with a person who obviously either has an agenda to inject fear or just refuses to accept that he may have spoken before he knew what he was talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:54:52
You just spoke the truth.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:04:07
Maybe I misunderstood your point. I apologize if that's the case. But honestly I still disagree.
 It did trend downward for a few hours before the bigger drops, but the pattern matches the previous 2 dips this month. Once again it bounced off the 100 day ema on the 4 hour chart. 
I guess the difference would be that we didn't see a huge surge just before the big drop. It was slower building up to a few fast drops. I can agree to the pattern being different. But IMO it's still a good thing and at this point no reason to think the overall uptrend will not continue. This is, of course, my own speculation as well.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:10:27
So do you honestly think you should sell now? As a newb I'm sure it makes you a bit nervous but this is completely normal occurrence. Especially after a very successful black Friday. I'm sure many merchants are cashing out Btc earned from sales. Then people see a drop and panic. By tomorrow the price will probably be back over 1k or higher. Look at bitcoins price history. It is more likely to be worth more in a year than not. I look forward to dips. Gives me opportunity to increase my holdings and it shakes out all the weak hands who panic sell so easily. The price drop will strengthen the support and help us push past 1200 soon. This is not a get rich quick investment.

I think its a mistake to disregard gox price. Yes there is a premium and its likely due to fiat withdrawal but we see the same effect at other exchanges. The cheapest exchanges are harder and more expensive to deposit fiat. This is how markets work.
An "average price" is useful for some things but an average price means nothing for buying an selling. 
Mt gox is still one of the top exchanges in volume, and many people trade their without any need to cash out or withdraw fiat. 
Coinbase price is higher than mt gox a lot of times as well.
As long as gox stays in the top as far as volume the price there is very relevant whether you disregard it or not

Long term downtrend? Are you kidding? So far it hasn't even fell below the price is was at 4 days ago. All time high yesterday morning. What exactly do you consider long term 12 hours? Not trying to be a dick just seems a little ridiculous to say its any sort of trend at this point. So far just looks like a normal selloff. In fact almost 2 weeks ago it dipped 50% and broke a record two days later. Zoom out to a longer term scale would ya lol
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:55:35
Well he wasn't interested yet. But he has heard a little about it. He's said he wanted to learn a little more about it and maybe we could work something out in the future. I'm calling this a win.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:43:28
I think this guyay be more of a fudster. I don't think any reasonable person could look at a chart longer than a day and think this is a trend lol
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:08:32
Agreed :) but the last month or so has given many people the impression that they can expect huge gains every week. Those of us who have been here longer know that these surges come and go.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:24:00
*You are right
Sorry for my grammar. I did not realize I would catch so much hell here over it. Lol I will make sure to proof read my statements from now on.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:08:52
Thank you much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:09:01
yep that also seems to be a pattern.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:04:21
I don't understand why everyone is making such a big deal over this dip in price. Like no one has ever seen the price drop 20%. Shit it dropped almost 50% last week. 3 days later all time high. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:27:06
Fake. Anyone can generate as many key pairs as they want. Not one of them has ever been used. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:14:31
Thing is we've had a huge inrush of newcomers trying to make quick profit. They never intended on holding long. So they sell in a panic when they see their first big sell-off. But these sell-offs are exactly what we need to push to new highs. The only reason Btc made it to $1243 so far is because there were sell offs this month that shook out the weak hands, the ones who sell in a panic. The people left over after a big sell off are willing to hold through the volatility... and this is what pushes the price higher. So congrats Bitcoin! It will continue to push upward to new highs!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:47:21
Your right. But you have to understand that Bitcoin is in the very early stages of development. This isn't a ready for consumption payment system that some company released to the public. It has to be develop end over time and its up to us to nurture this development. If it was 100% consumer ready there wouldn't be much opportunity to invest. Bitcoin is trying to find its value on an open market. We have yet to see how large the markets are that it will serve. We can only guess. But we know how many Btc there will be eventually so we can speculate...and trust me if you do the math you'll see that its gonna be worth at least 100 times what it is now
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:22:57
Agreed. Anyone who has taken time to do some research and studied the price history is waiting for the next dip to buy in. The low price will bring in the next wave. And itlk be a touch climb as the price moves back up because some people who are panicking right now will probably cash out at the first sign that they can break even. This is all a natural process of price discovery that the experienced have seen over and over. If your new, and bought in higher price than now I understand your fear. But realistically history has showed us that the best way to profit is buy some Bitcoin, make sure its secure, and leave it alone regardless of the volatility. If all you do is what the chart all day you will likely gibe in to fear and sell prematurely. If your that scared you probably bought too much for your budget. Which is always a mistake. But remember FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:52:47
lol Thank you. I tend to make mistakes in grammar like that when I'm typing from my phone.
Also, I agree 100%. Don't just hide them and forget about them. Spend them. Support bitcoin as a currency. Spread the word. Help people get started. Help people understand the reasons for volatility. 
What I like to do is keep a certain amount in cold storage and a couple hundred bucks in my blockchain or coinbase wallet. 
People like to think about how they spent 0.25 btc for a t-shirt and that now looking back they spent $250 for it. This isn't really true because at the time, that 0.25 btc could have been easily replaced for market rate at that time, which is what you paid. 
If I was going to spend $100 shopping today, I could easily buy $100 worth of btc just for that purchase. If you never planned on saving the btc you bought than you didn't miss a thing.
I don't feel that the word "fortune" implies luck personally, but I see your point. It has taken a long time and a lot of work to get where we are today. Personally I have been involved in the community in many ways for about 2 years now. Bitcoin is the tool, it's up to us to support and develop it. I just wish more people would stop worrying about the price and realize that this could change the world is many wonderful ways. The price will continue to be volatile until there is a solid economy for it where the value is apparent.

Downtrend for 18 hours tops. Let's take a look at this month. November 1st-price at gox $210. All time high of about $394 before falling 30% on November 9th. 24 hours later uptrend resumes....all time high of $900.97 at gox November 18th before dropping 50% to $453.20 within 24 hours. Uptrend resumes immediately after that low...another all time high of $1242 November 29th..slight 10% dip and then rebound...price bounces around 5% for almost 48 hours...today we see some slow downtrend with a few big sells that pushes the price down about 25% to a low so far of $840.32.....could drop lower or could bounce back before I'm done typing... currently $1000 again....what chart are you looking at?
