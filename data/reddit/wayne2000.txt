Don't buy bitcoins, it's a scam. Tulips, etc. - bitbat99 (3 months ago)

Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
Does that mean the 98% of coins can't be hacked?

This is bullshit, for one you are comparing stocks to crypto, which in this case is like comparing a business life cycle to the value of gold.
Also you literally have no idea where bitcoin is right now on this scale.

Stupid graph, this implies that all the comparatives have the same volume from 2013 to 2018.

Does that mean the other 98% can't be hacked.

Yeah when an investment has underlying assets. I hate how investing terminology is thrown around over here when talking about purely speculative cryptos.

You can not compare the short life time of bitcoin to stocks and shares. Pointless task. 
Its like how does buying shares of Netflix compare to your bitcoin investment since December 2017.

To be fair, is he not right? However, what idiot wouldn't want to capitalize on it?

Bitcoin isn't censored though? And even if it was, why does the price of each coin matter. If I was to buy something for $x I would exchange that amount and pay the amount in BTC. The price of one coin is then irrelevant, unless you are suggesting people will price items in BTC, which wouldn't make sense as the price likely does not relate to anything longterm and the movement in BTC is too unpredictable.

How many institutional investors are buying Bitcoin? When the majority are, then its a boom.

Whats the annual return of the debt when invested in the US economy? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:57:39
You think the US will be the next Greece do you?

What do private companies who had false accounting practices have to do with government debt?
Also you mention crashes in the economy, if you haven't noticed the US has recovered from them. Also the housing crisis has nothing to do with government debt. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:58:13
Well you are saying what it costs the US but you aren't saying what return the invested money has made. Like you say, you don't know what return the debt has created. Its hard to calculate, but without that investment we also don't know what position the US would be in. Countries who top the list for GDP also top the list for debt. Borrowing is a very beneficial if used correctly.

Debt should be expressed as a % of GDP. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:02:01
I dont have a clue what this means, I have my BTC in Xapo, should I move them. I only bought as a speculative investment and don't research bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:15:45
Exactly this, got to look at the deficit as a % of GDP

You still sure about that?
