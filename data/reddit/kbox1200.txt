Ouch! Sending from GDAX.com is free with no fees or from Coinbase to Coinbase's account. Or even use Litecoin... the fees is in the pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:35
buddy, Bitcoin can be broken down to the 1/100,000,000 of 1.
The smallest unit is called "satoshi" which is = 0.00000001 of 1 bitcoin. The unit of mBTC does exist, which equal to 0.0001 of 1 bitcoin. 
People can invest whatever amount of money into bitcoin, whether it's $10 USD or $1,000 or $10,000 USD. The exchange which they buy it from will calculate the exact amount automatically.
Check out this site for the conversion: 
Any mobile wallet app will be able to display your Bitcoin almost to any unit of denomination you want. 
Coinbase only display as BTC.

This can be done within 30 minutes if you are technical, here's how to do it: 
- Pay for it using your credit card (5% fees) on Coinbase.com
- Go to GDAX.com and pull your bitcoin from Coinbase to GDAX (under the "deposit" menu). It's FREE and instant.
- Go to  and generate the paper wallet address, then print them out.
- On GDAX.com, you can "withdraw" the Bitcoin to the paper wallet address, FOR FREE WITH NO TX FEES and usually pretty quick.
- DONE.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:15:06
i think they would go cash it out for local fiat and use that.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:16:11
go to "withdraw" in the BTC menu, then copy &amp; pate the "receiving" address from Samourai. I dont use that app so I dont know where in the app to get that but it should be a standard address.
Make sure you copy &amp; paste that from the app to your computer by text or email.

Coinbase required ID for verification that you are indeed what you put on the sign up application. Also, it is to comply with Federal law, Anti Money Laundering (AML). 
If you want to remain anonymous and still have Bitcoin, you have 2 options.
1. Buy it locally by searching this site for buyer and have cash ready: 
2. Find a Bitcoin ATM machine near you and buy it with cash/card.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:14:45

Litecoin is much faster and cheaper for small transactions. The fees are a few pennies or less.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:06:20
explain in details on how you cracked it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:56:06
YES.  click "BTC/USD" on the top left, next to the GDAX logo, to select the pairing currency you want to trade, then watch this video to learn how to play a "limit" order that will have no fees for you!
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:26:17
that's why you only pick the wallet recommended here from the Bitcoin Foundation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:01:06
what if you are using Bitcoin to pay for something like restaurant dinner or shopping mall, and you send it with a very low fees like 1-10 sat/byte. Then it will never confirm and get kicked back to me, will the seller lose out and accept the lost? 
This seem unreasonable and i can see a lot of fraud can happen with this.

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:51
think of Bitcoin as a gold bar. Using a gold bar to buy a drink at the bar is nonsense, but using a gold bar to buy a house is way more convenient since the fees are still low considering the total value. People are buying Bitcoin as a saving for future due to limited supply and high demand, making it very valuable, just like a gold bar.

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:26:34
you need to pull your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX's "deposit" menu (FREE). It's an instant transfer. If you sending it from Coinbase -&gt; GDAX using the "send" option in Coinbase, you are doing it WRONG and wasting money on fees.

seems fishy for sure.. Also BTC is irreversible, and there's no customer support like the actual Amazon.com site where you can get your money back. I would take this $100 as a lost if you never receive it. If you do, update us and let us know.

Use any digit wallet that is recommended on bitcoin.org. When you first open it, Select "Recover wallet". Type in the private key on the paper wallet. That will import all your money from it to the app. Then send it from the app to Coinbase. I'd recommend Mycelium if you are on Android.

yes, GDAX is the trading platform of Coinbase. Nobody can explain why its free on GDAX and not Coinbase but from other assumption, Coinbase is for beginners and easier to use so they slap a fees on that. When you transfer from GDAX to your wallet, they actually pay the transaction fees for you so its free.
