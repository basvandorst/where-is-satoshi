a market cap is the total worth of the commodity. So the market cap for bitcoin (total worth of it in USD) is 2 billion.

because I didn't think "fuck it i'm special and it won't happen to me".

Yes, I fcked up... sigh... another reason why bitcoin is superior and needed. third party system ruins everything

do I need an internet connection to do this? if so, then would my wallet be an offline wallet?

What happened to the fund?

Did you manage to get your money back?

try taking off the fan cover, it'll reduce the noise greatly, just remember to screw the fan back on and you'll be fine

so how do i go about installing the packages? it feels like a catch 22 here. I need internet to get the package, but once i touch the internet, I can't have a offline wallet anymore

So what are you going to do? Are you going yo refund your seller? I thought there was a way too or are you just going to let PayPal deal with it.

but wouldn't that defeat the purpose of having an offline computer? I thought I can't go on the internet at all with it

I'm having trouble getting my computer to recognize my usb

no i knew it was a risk but there were still people selling them on ebay and I thought that was the fastest way for me to get rid of them. I didnt think they would close my account entirely and keep my fund.
