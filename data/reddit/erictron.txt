3 million altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:11:10
Up 2%. So far so good.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:41:25
That's 30 bitcoins per a subscriber! Supply is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:19:30
We want to know what happened to it. Did it go to an old girlfriend? Did you spill coffee on it? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:32:07
I don't know why you got downvoted. You were right.

!remindme one week
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:17:29
Hell yeah. I love these. I'm going to get so many reminders in a year
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:16:39
 is really great too, and it updates automatically. Also tells you if there's been gains in the last hour and the last day.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:46:52
That's the buying vs selling price. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:07
2.65% to be exact. These people will never know the fury of a 30% dip.

We should start a poll. Winner gets to start the next prediction thread after the event.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:47:07
Live coin watch my friend. Just let it run in the background.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:53:54
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:56
It's skyrocketing right now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:42:38
Pretty easy. There's an instruction book that comes with the ledger. It'll tell you how to get the address of the ledger. Move it to that address, and you're done.

I'd like to subscribe pls. Do you think we could cast Liam Neeson in this?

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:39
Huh. I went to bed, and when I woke up I'm like, "Oh hey we broke 15! Nice!" 
  Made some coffee.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:30:13
If it's an elliot wave, three times. You'll notice the resistance line on the bottom of the waves is higher and higher. That can signal a breakout. This is way more exciting than watching any sport.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:42:54
Bad news. We hit 4k a looooong time ago.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:31:56
Huh. I went to sleep last night and it was 15, and when I woke up it was a little over 15. Missed the whole thing. First I'm hearing about it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:16:36
I think they decide. In another four hours
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:54:30
This. We're so damn close. Tomorrow evening I'm going to buy some nice scotch and just soak in 20k memes for hours. Nothing the money could buy could compare to the enjoyment I'm about to take part in.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:12:29
Seems to be going up.
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:25:38
IT IS A FINISHER CAR! A TRANSPORTER OF GODS! THE GOLDEN GOD!! 
I AM UNTETHERED AND MY RAGE KNOWS NO BOUNDS!

im gonna use that
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:09:53
Is that in USD? Tallest I've seen is 9,848

Most human constructs do exist. In fact, many of our constructs are identifying and predicting natural events, such as the tide, the phases of the moon, and time.

!remindme 4 weeks
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:14:46
Yeah, when I buy or sell bitcoin it's usually around a 15$ for 1k

Quadriga is one of the most expensive ways to buy bitcoin. There's a subreddit dedicated to it:
Long story short, with the exchanges, quadriga becomes quite expensive indeed. That being said, one of the easiest exchanges to get started on IF you're Canadian. I recommend it.

Yeah, it's broken 8 a few times. BTC has always been bullish in December.

@_date: 2017-11-07 17:43:57
I'm not sure. I think the original bitcoin will continue as b1x, and we'll get an equal amount of b2x.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:56:29
I hear you. I'm a wedding photographer. I'm looking around for ways to tell people that they can pay me in bitcoin. It just makes so much sense at this point.
What would be really amazing would be a square-like system that deposits bitcoin into my wallet from the client entering in their credit card information, rather than into my bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:29:36
They are. There's a little spike, then business as usual.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:41:20
I was actually hoping for a dip. Six hours. No dip. :-(
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:37:44
It isn't dead.  A few minors went rouge and are now mining s2x.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:03:48
So how about we do 4% until we figure out the safe annual withdrawal rate?

[Fortunately, we can revisit it all in the Nov 28 10k thread](
Edit: Seriously guys? Downvotes? I thought it was cool to see how similar the questions in that thread are to the questions in this thread.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:52:28
Downvoting my comment. Speculation is bad, m'kay?
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:38:52
The comments would be paved with gold.
