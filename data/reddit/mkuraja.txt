I found an employer that agreed to pay me in crypto. I directed them to Gemini to open an account but Gemini responded they're not interested! So, now I'm telling them to try Coinbase/GDAX. I hope this legitimate business doesn't get turned away there too.

I disagree. I don't do direct deposit. Read carefully.
When you grant someone permission to direct deposit into your account, you "implicitly" grant direct withdrawal also. Ask your bank if you can only grant one without the other. They'll tell you no.
What's the consequence? I know someone that worked at a company rumored to be going out of business. Nobody believed the rumor except him. Right after payday, he withdrew all his money and closed his account. A few days later, the company officially declared bankruptcy and reversed all deposits from the last 2 week paychecks!
Bankruptcy law says a company has to pay everyone they owe with whatever money they still have but the order of who they pay is prioritized. Banks and stockholders come 1st. Employees come last. If there's no more money left over by the time they get to their employees, so sad; too bad says the law. My colleague was the only employee that kept his last paycheck because of what he did. Everyone else worked their last 2 weeks for free. 
When you give someone direct deposit permission, you give them your bank routing/account information.  But when they pay you by check, they're giving you their bank routing/account information. That's why I always ask to get paid by check. Assuming the check clears, if someone wants their money back, they must seek me out for consent and cooperation. No going behind my back with a transaction reversal and all my outbound checks bouncing because the funds were there when I wrote those checks.

This post tortures me. I learned of bitcoin in 2013 and thought it was brilliant. I went to get mine straight away but got frustrated with how long it was taking to download the blockchain and have my own full node. I walked away with the notion that I'll come back to it later but I never did. Bot until bitcoin news was in my face in 2017. Wow, I thought. What if I stayed on task back in 2013 as intended.

I need an account to cash out the crypto I earn. My clients need an account to acquire the crypto they'd use to pay me in crypto. 
Why not just have them pay me in dollars and go buy crypto myself? I have multiple reasons that would make this a long comment but, in short, I'm trying to do my small part to help nudge the world through the fiat to crypto transition.

I will leave the burden on the IRS to show me the evidence of why I owe what they claim in taxes. Show me proof about this alleged time I bought coffee with Bitcoin. What was it's market value at that time of purchase compared to when I acquired the crypto so they can justify the suggested capital gains. 
I don't think the government can just make up numbers and it is impractical that they can track everyone's every crypto transaction. They have a trail to follow when we convert dollars to crypto and back to dollars. But not when we pass along some Satoshi from one unnamed wallet address to the next.

When Americans won their independence from government, it wasn't the majority of them that fought the Red Coats. Those that did are known as the 3% because that's how few of them stood up for their liberty. The other 97% (you'd call the vast majority) said they didn't want to pay the tea tax or other such thing either but, like yourself, they also we're complacent, thinking the desires and plans of the 3% was an unreasonable objective. Still, when America won it's freedom to begin new things like their own currency, the same passive majority went along with that too, as you will after we overcome this tyranny once again.

You don't understand. 
If I'm getting less Bitcoins over time, that's because it's rising in value. My $10,000 in the next paycheck can't buy as much crypto as it can in this current paycheck. But so what? Each Bitcoin is 100 million Satoshi's. Each of my Satoshi's will be more valuable and capable of buying more for me than before. That's not depressing. 
This month, my $100 phone bill I have to pay may be, say, 10,000 Satoshi's. Next month, it may only cost me 5,000 Satoshi's whereas other people still paying dollars for the same phone bill are still paying $100, and that's awesome for me I got out of dollars!

I'm confused. Why would anyone in the crypto space celebrate a fiat backed coin? The emergence of crypto is due to the lost faith in fiat. The dollar is already digital in addition to paper. The buzz word stablecoin is just a marketing gimmick by the big banks to bring people back to them. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 00:27:52
Bad advice. Satoshi was inspired to make Bitcoin to free us from the banks. 
Yes, the banks used to be about storing wealth but that was when we didn't want to walk the streets with our gold. We don't need steel vaults to secure our crypto. The banks don't have a purpose anymore. Not the modern banks, not the old skool banks either. 
Don't let anyone hold your crypto on your behalf. Nacho keys, nacho Bitcoin.

They initially bought 11 million worth of Bitcoin. If they think cashing out is a smart move, they need everyone else to think buying in is the smart move. It reminds me of Enron. While the CEO was bailing out on his own company stock, he was telling all his employees to invest all their savings into it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:26:12
I'm not a tax guy but my simplistic understanding is I have to pay tax on capital gains. Whether I earn bitcoins and soon after spend them in my daily life or I buy them and hold them for years before cashing them, I'm paying a capital gains tax on them.
But then if I spend them instead of cashing them, then there's no capital gain to tax, right? I "pass the buck" of capital gains tax to the person that accepted my Bitcoin as payment. And they only pay tax if they cash them, unless they also find someone that accepts Bitcoin. Then the tax burden is passed even further down the road, no?

We didn't have the technology back in the day but why not make EVERY public funding project be a government sponsored style of GoFundMe? Hey, if there's something that nobody wants to contribute to, then it shouldn't be funded, no matter what propaganda the media peddles to us. 
What if we we're told we all must contribute 20% across some basket of funds of our choosing from a long list. We still have to support public funding but we're in complete control where our money goes. I think taxation is theft but this would be an excellent compromise.

I heard the term FOMO meaning fear of missing out. People are using it to describe why some of us are investigating bin Bitcoin now. As it grows, I expect businesses to suffer FOMO. 
Some places accept credit card in addition to cash because if they don't they may lose business with customers not carrying cash. The same will happen with cryptos eventually.

"Former IRS senior executive Lois G. Lerner told a federal court this week that she faces the possibility of death threats if her role in the tax agency’s tea party-targeting becomes public, "
The IRS will be trying to discourage us all here to get out of cryptos also. One by one, they'll target us for harassment and even do illegal things because it won't be in the spotlight, unless it does eventually get the same attention by the courts, Congress, and the media as what's happened to the Tea Party.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:06
Right. I asked this YouTube author why bother reporting transactions in Bitcoin if the occurrence of that transaction can't be verified. He only replied that we all volunteer full cooperation to the IRS.
The government is covering all of the dollars-to-bitcoin gates (and bitcoin-to-dollars too). Whether using an online exchange or local crypto ATM, we give identifiable information so we need to acknowledge this much. 
But if a business accepting Bitcoin doesn't ask for ID, even if they report their sales, for the anonymous customer it's like we were never there. So, to your point, it seems the more we all transact directly in Bitcoin, the more we effectively reduce our known taxable money.

What do you mean "how will they handle the fluctuations"? I told them "just pay me whatever the exchange rate is from Dollar to Bitcoin at the moment you pay". That simple. 
I also told them to not buy from Coinbase until they're ready to pay me. That way they don't risk a Bitcoin drop. But I said I accept the risk of a drop after I get paid. In fact, I told them I'll accept a lower hourly rate if paid in Bitcoin to incentive them to do this. They're saving money but my trust in Bitcoin's rise means I'll recoup that wage discount I agreed to.

As seen in this post's comments, a lot of people are confused about Bitcoin and taxes, and I think the IRS wants it that way. Paralyzing us with doubt and fear slows Bitcoin's adoption. I think we need to plow forward as honest citizens and we'll be okay. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:20:45
Before when fiat was abused and people took shelter in gold, the US government passed The Liberty Act, making it illegal for citizens to be in possession of gold. Sure, they could hide it but they reveal themselves if ever they come forward trying to spend it. So, people were complicit with turning it over to government.
When the dollar fails, will we see another unjust law with a patriotic name telling everyone to cooperate, turning over their Bitcoin to the government/banks? 
People think a $1 million Bitcoin is crazy but privately wonder if it will happen. As crazy as this forfeiture mandate is to imagine, I wonder if people will "be a good citizen" and "save their country" by reporting any and all crypto interactions they see their fellow citizens attempt to transact in.
Remember those TSA posters with the slogan "If you see something, say something". Did you know the government trademarked that slogan, like they're a business?! They dropped that slogan after Snowden supporters mocked it but I see another statist rally to help reign in all those criminals that are criminals simply for not wanting to turn in their crypto savings to government on demand.

What's funny is when you make your 1st Bitcoin you'll likely have left over satoshi from when you cross that finish line. Then you'll decide to round up and settle on at least 2 Bitcoins.

Hi, Carlos. I didn't see the notification that you wrote me. 
When I say "invited to upload lots of money", I'm saying Ray has visited at least three different outlets I watch, wanting to be interviewed and to tell the world to come trade money at [Paxful.com]( The business of this site (soliciting everyone that visits the site) is to upload BTC for sale. The buyers aren't posting requests for $10 worth of BTC. They're usually stating a minimum that's thousands of dollars worth.  My remark is an honest assessment of what a BTC seller should expect if they engage the site.
I could have "quietly" written into [help but I am of the belief that if [Paxful.com]( is grossly negligent over the quality control of their site, the users both current and prospective should know about it. If someone else already uploaded money to prepare a trade and then saw this locked out message, I'd definitely want to know before I upload any of my money. You should recommend users reach out discreetly when they need privacy but you should welcome public discussion otherwise to help keep Paxful honest.

Ray has been a guest, promoting [Paxful.com]( on the The Crypto Lark YouTube channel. Also, two other YouTube channels but I forget which. In one of them, Ray apologizes for all the background noise heard from birds chirping because he's interviewing from a resort hotel room in Hawaii. In the other YouTube interview, Ray chose to conduct the live video while nearby his staff and we can hear the background chatter of (maybe you) and other Paxful staff instead of just clearly hearing Ray. That's what I mean by his campaign tour. Do you want me to cite more interviews conducted in which the audience is led to believe they should trust using Paxful?
You're wrong about the bottom right screen having any content at the gray BLOCKED screen. Paxful has since resolved this defect so I can't go back and take a FULL SCREEN snapshot but what I saw was just this BLOCK message shared here and nothing else. The remainder of the page was just gray background color. Paxful needs to improve their QA process. Next time test any client-side or server-side coding changes on you DEV server before deploying to the PROD server. This reminds me how careless Mark at Mt Gox was when administering to his site. Don't you also trifle with people's money and trust too.

Whenever someone tags a Reddit user, like u/Ray_paxful for example, that user gets a notification. Your comment was 10 days ago and still no Ray here. I think he saw the message and ignored it. Too bad he didn't help recover lost user confidence with a public assurance here what happened will not happen again. Maybe someday I'll catch him in another live video interview and ask him again about this. I think then, when on camera with the whole world watching, he'll profess his most sincere apologies and a sworn promise to deliver a more reputable user experience. But not until then, it seems.

Yes, I know Paxful is in the USA. I knew I was looking at a buggy site when it said I can't use the site because I'm allegedly in "US Washington" it says. Just look above at the screen capture I posted here. And I'm not in Washington nor New York. 
I'm a senior software engineer. Let me know if you want my professional help. I want to see Paxful do well but I have to call it out when users aren't taken seriously. I've seen multiple bugs on your site; some more serious than others. But all of them are unnecessary. You don't have the right technical people for such an important job.
Thanks again for at least acknowledging the customer.

People argue that an ongoing problem with Bitcoin education is this misunderstanding that Bitcoin is a physical gold coin. An image which we keep perpetuating. Someone needs to imagine a new illustration for something that is not tangible. 
Attention artists - how about some beautiful/curious/intriguing way to represent 2^160=1.46150163733E+48. Remember, E+48 means to add 48 more numbers to the end of the number 146150163733 to see how big this number really is. This is how many possibilities there are for Bitcoin wallets. 
Consider this - imagine your high school hallway where that long wall of lockers are. Imagine none of them have locks but you trust your stuff is secure in your locker because the hallway is long enough to have 1.46150163733E+48 lockers on the wall. Anyone can walk up to your locker, open it, and take what they want, only if they knew which one was yours and didn't have to check them all, one by one. 
That's how Bitcoin works. No locks protecting your money. But safety in numbers.

I'm not clear on this. 
Even if price keeps dropping, I'll keep buying because I think price will eventually rise again and see new highs. I'm prepared to wait years for the big turnaround. But for miners, aren't most of them about immediate gains? 
Speaking in economic terms, why would someone (not motivated by the ideals of crypto-currency) mine something if its value is less than the cost to mine it. In the real world, be it real gold or drilling for oil, or other, if cost is greater than reward, a business does not invest in such things. 
If price continues to fall, why would miners keep mining at a higher cost? What's the incentive?

What you're speaking to is the activity of people coming in and trying to get involved. But the transition from "I got some Bitcoin" to "your latte comes up to 100 satoshi, please" requires transacting in Bitcoin. Not just collecting them like Pokémon cards.
Or maybe Dash will replace cash and Bitcoin will replace gold, whereby we spend the cash we earn and hold gold for the bad times. We'll see. 
I suppose I could've asked my employer to pay in Dash instead but I anticipated I was already overwhelming them when I named the crypto that has better name recognition.

Likewise, I'm willing to walk away with less money for the principal of trading my home without the dependency of the bank.

Real Estate Agents are, unfortunately, one of those professions where 98% percent of them give the good ones a bad name. Most are GED graduates moving from one hustle to the next. They do the minimum effort and later sing a song they made up called "Easy Money" as they do a victory dance in the privacy of their home after each closed deal.
I used to think they were important. But when I found this house for sale by owner, he told me the price goes up if I involve a realtor. So I agreed to buy it from him directly. I got a home inspector, we both headed together to the title office, and then it was mine. That's when I realized realtors are typically parasites exploiting our fears &amp; ignorance about what's involved in buying a home. It went smooth for me as the buyer. I think it'll be smooth again. I concede it won't be just as straightforward because I'm selling it for BTC instead of US confetti.

I love bitcoin. This is not a scam. If you "really" try to buy the house, you're going to learn who the owner "really" is. You're going to meet me and learn who I really am. I'll be showing my ID to you, to the title company that will process the official county paperwork, to the lawyer who will review our contract as legit that says you'll pay me the bitcoin if I put my house in your name, etc. To accept dollars and then buy bitcoin with it more likely means involving the banks. I would like to show the world the sale of a home with no such 3rd party parasites involved.

People assume if I sell this home that I have that Bitcoin waiting for them when they come for me? I'll probably pay off my car and buy a 2nd new one for my spouse. Then there's the big down payment for the next new house elsewhere. I may be right back where I started with my wallet within a week of selling this property.
Besides, in Arizona, I exercise my right to carry a firearm. There's too many reasons why bothering me for my bitcoin would not be worth it.

I'll go first. I'll put the house in your name but we'll have a contract in place that stipulates the deal is reversed if you don't follow through afterwards with payment.

You make it too hard. 
I'm not desperate to unload. I'm just a bitcoin enthusiast and, like other goods &amp; services, I'm interested in using "real" money, not govt confetti, to make this transaction. Bitcoin's price does keep moving but the buyer and I can go forward with best intentions. Once all the paperwork is ready for final commitment, I would sell the house priced in dollars but transacted in BTC. Whatever amount of BTC that is at the moment of transaction is the trade. I already do this now with direct BTC sales. When someone asks how much for my BTC, I tell them "after paying me I'll send that much dollar worth of BTC to your wallet at whatever market rate it is at that moment".
Even if there's bumps in the road with this, I'm cool being one of the pioneers that let's the herd learn from first time experiences like mine so they can do it more smoothly as Bitcoin keeps going more mainstream.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:18:12
Right. I'm selling it for BTC. We'll agree on a dollar price and then, at the moment of on-chain transaction from your wallet to mine, you'll give me "whatever" amount of BTC is the market value of the dollar price we agreed to. Thanks for the luck. This will be cool if someone takes me seriously.

What risk is unacceptable? If I wanted to give my home away to a relative, I'd do the same paperwork to make it official. The county doesn't even have to necessarily know whether I'm receiving money for the property or if I'm gifting it to someone. They'll process it just the same. However it's done had I sold my house for fiat with realtors and the bank involved, the paperwork is the same if I do so for bitcoin or for free.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:05:26
I just assumed the buyer with 34 bitcoins would make this an extra, side, getaway home for when they want another place of their own waiting for them. Like I said in another comment, this is the best place to be during the winters. You'll leave with a soft tan.
And even if you want the tenant to stay and keep paying, I still thought the new owner would decide their own price.

It's not important to me whether the buyer bought bitcoin just for the sake of getting the discount. I am willing to sell my home, and I'm willing to sell it for less if I can do it without the bank having any part in it. The thought of it makes me happy. I want to leave behind the example for others to also consider excluding the bank from their property affairs also.

I know someone who had agreed to a higher rate and then, one day, their landlord said they're dropping the rent. Of course my friend asked why.

I'll arrange to have a lawyer write up the paperwork so that you have....say....4 months after purchase to pay for it. And if that transaction doesn't happen, then the contract makes clear that any/all other paperwork turning over the house in your name is null &amp; void.
Whatever the small details are to make this happen, we can figure it out. As long as you and I both have the same "good faith" intentions in the transaction, everything will be fine.

You said a lot but I'll try to keep my comment short.
If you've used Bitcoin before, you know it works right, assuming the address given is correct. We'd both make sure of this. 
As for what if something still goes wrong, we'd spell out fall back plans in the contract before we begin. Maybe you failing to pay me means the house is not yours. The burden is on you to show on the public blockchain that the address I provided you has indeed received payment (from anyone!).
Here in Maricopa County, Arizona, the sheriff's deputies don't play games. If you fail to pay for the house and the attorney-stamped contract decides the house is still mine, but you've tried moving people in anyhow, law enforcement comes with electrocution torture instruments, aka tasers.
If the buyer has the same "good faith" intentions that I do for the deal to go well, that all will be fine. But all the same, the contract we put in place, approved by lawyers that can imagine bad outcomes, will protect everyone and motivate each party to see to it that all goes as planned.

This is a significant purchase. We wouldn't start and finish this on Reddit. We'd likely meet and get one another's information. I'll go first and put the house in your name. You can ask the county register if "this is for real?!?" and they'll tell you it's legit. Then you can pay me. Of course, so I don't get screwed, we'll both sign into a contract that says if you fail to pay me, all paperwork associated to the transfer of the property is null, void, and reversed back to me. We'll figure out the details as we cross the bridge together. We're among the first to do this sort of thing. People will watch, listen, and learn from us so they can do it better than we did.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:45:10

Here's my best guess but I'm still guessing. 
It's unlawful to evade the IRS by depositing money less than $10k on purpose to avoid the rule whereby banks must report deposits of $10k or more. To make smaller, incremental deposits is known as "structuring". When the IRS thinks you're doing that, they seize all your money with the bank's full cooperation. They didn't have a warrant and you're not under arrest but the IRS will keep your money anyhow.
My clients pay me bi-monthly and, based on my hourly pay rate, that ends up getting close to $10k but not reaching $10k or going over. So, repeatedly, I make deposits of almost $10k. I'm not trying to "structure" deposits. I just don't earn enough to make deposits over $10k. 
Because I don't trust the banks to give me my money whenever I ask for it, I don't keep my money in their custody. As soon as I can, I withdraw the deposits I make and keep the money in a private vault elsewhere. Also, I can't stand the idea of being one of those victims we read about that committed no crime yet the IRS refuses to return money unjustly seized.
I may be repeatedly tripping the alarms of systems spying on us all. Maybe Chase Bank got tired of the unending false positive reports and banished me as less, ongoing federal paperwork for their staff. 
I wish they'd just tell me so I didn't have to speculate how to avoid being treated like an outlaw again.

I saw 2008 coming back in 2005 so, unlike friends and family, I didn't upgrade to a bigger, better house. I stayed in the more modest one I was more sure I could keep affording. I thought, when the housing crash happens, everyone will be forced to downsize to a home like mine and I'll get the upgrade at a steal.
Instead, everyone that bought homes they couldn't afford were treated with programs to help them keep them, even with debt forgiveness. And the good citizen like myself that didn't contribute to the problem is still stuck in the start home.

Just giving my fellow man a heads up to not trust Chase Bank. If you don't leave them, at least get another bank account elsewhere so, unlike me, you don't suddenly have nowhere to cash a check.

I have wondered if my social media memes I post at the expense of Jamie Dimon are a cause.

Even if they're not making money off me, they could (should) have given me a head start to open a bank account elsewhere. Not blitzkrieg-freeze all my accounts and have me scrambling to open a new account somewhere.

I think the timing of some very impressionable YouTube videos by Andreas Antonopoulos, Amanda B. Johnson, and the like that were rolling out in early 2017 caused the price to climb. Then, more excitement about the exciting price rise fed on itself.

These ATMs usually provide contact info. I called the operator of the one local to me and asked to trade in person instead. I argued that, by meeting him at a place of his choosing at a time of his choosing, I waivered the conveniences of using the ATM and , by not using his ATM, I shouldn't have to pay for his costs of operating the ATM. He agreed and we always meet now, trading at a lower cost to me because we don't use his ATM to facilitate the trade.

I exercised the terms and conditions of my veteran account to have a zero balance. My business is a legitimate LLC filed with the State and in good standing since it's inception several years ago. 
I never had an issue with Chase either....until this came out of nowhere. I was incredulous when it happened. Just as much as you'd be if they drop this suddenly on you too someday.

I've spoken to people that owed the IRS. They said, including a CPA I know, that as long as you proactively reach out to them when money is due to tell them you need to begin a monthly payment plan, that they receive you as well intentioned and will oblige you. They don't have you tell a sad story and decide if it's sad enough to work with you. If you aren't already previously behind and show initiative to make payments, then you're still a good citizen, the IRS concludes.

From what he showed us, whenever the value of Bitcoin climbs back up into the area of approximately halfway from the last bottom to the previously last high, the acceleration starts again. So, around 12k - 15k may be when we see the bull run towards 100k.... And then the big, subsequent correction with 25k being the new, next bottom.

The guy that routinely sells Bitcoin to me said banks have done this to him 9 times already!

I don't see where the discount code is asked for.
The site accepts Google pay but not crypto?
Too bad it's not a magnet backing. We have to make holes in our clothes to wear this pin backing item, huh?

Are you referring to me, OP, as the troll? If you are, I'm just raising awareness about someone that may be hustling us. If he does, I'm not saying Bitcoin itself is a scam too; just this guy.
