Well the stock market was at 6k around 2008. It was at 26k recently. If the market plummeted back to 10k, you wouldn't hear everyone talking about how the market almost doubled in 10 years. You would be hearing about how much money everyone lost.

Losing almost 3/4 of your value would normally use a different word than "dip"

Incorrect. You can swap stock certificates just like anything else. You are free to request stock certificates for any stocks you own. Then you can sign off those certificates to anyone you want in exchange for anything you agree on. The thing is that the government taxes transactions. If you exchange Van Gogh paintings with someone, the government will definitely ask about it. Technically everything is taxed at fair market value. If I exchanged 10 pounds of butter for 10 pounds of flour, this should be reported too, but it's a small enough amount that the government doesn't care. I think they even have an official threshold where you don't need to worry about it. Because it would be too difficult for the government to track values of anything that can swapped (flour, bitcoins, magic trading cards, etc), they just evaluate the value in USD.
Just think if this wasn't the case, there would be a huge industry based around swapping assets without going to cash first as a tax loophole. Want to buy a house? Just swap stock certificates for it. The government would assign fair value to your stock certs, evaluate the cost basis, assign capital gains, and tax accordingly.

Well also consider that the majority of Bitcoin investors are new ones. It's kind of a like a pyramid scheme. The early people made money, but they were a small population. The later people lost money, but they were the vast majority.

The government taxes all capital gains and losses. If you're just against that, well that's a separate discussion. (Some people think all taxation is theft) Investment gains and losses are taxed. Now the government could try to assess the value in whatever currency you sold, but it doesn't have the means to do that. So it assigns based on the USD value at time of sale. If the currency wasn't so volatile, it would be the exact same thing to you.

It's like exchanging stocks on the stock market. Of course it's taxed.

Warren Buffet said this wasn't going to end well. The man went from 0 to richest man alive by calling investments correctly. (he's usually top 5, only one year was he the richest man)

The investing term is "catching a falling knife".

Well that's what we don't know. Bitcoin has a scaling problem with the block chain. The technology couldn't handle 1/10th of the transactions that visa makes, and that's a problem. Ethereum scales better, and I could see it over taking Bitcoin soon.
