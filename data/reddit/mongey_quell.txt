What do mean by on paper? I'm new.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:38:24
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:31:32
That's because they had just deleted a post with over 500 upvotes because it said fees are too high. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:31:47
Isn't that more secure though?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:04:21
Wait, how can you be negative?
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:14:02
Thanks you, I have looked into different wallets and my bitcoins are no longer on the exchange 
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:38:43
Yes, but I needed to send some today
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:47:29
Oh yeah, duh 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:36:20
If pointing out that the fees associated with bitcoin are very high is considered a spam attack... I'd hate to see a real spam attack.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:28:35
Yup, I've done that. Is blockchain necessary tho? There is conflicting information with some other responses. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:16:01
How low can she go? How low can she go?
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:15:41
Would you recommend a wallet such as bread wallet then? Because that's what I have downloaded right now. I'm on iPhone.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:57:04
Teach me daddy
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:04:48
I haven't transferred yet, just want to know if I understand the basics.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:23:54
If you sold all your BTC then shouldn't it be at 0?
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:02:58
August 17th at about 4:27 US eastern time is when it's scheduled to be at $3500
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:28:25
It's not FUD if it's the truth
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:16:16
lol how many comments are you gonna leave that provide no argument other than "I'm an idiot".
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:45:18
I just read [this article]( and wasn't exactly sure what to make of it
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:50:50
well, you're not wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:15:21
I thought it was 2140
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:23:30
I've been a redditor for over a year, and definitely not getting paid. This is just my personal account that I've used for everything, not just crypto related stuff.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:26:09
If bitcoin isn't capable of sending small amounts of money then it has no hope of ever being as common as fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:05:53
[Not making it up]( That's the fee to send ~$92 of btc. So it's more like a 6.2% fee
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:04:58
Thanks �� 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:32:25
I blame bitcoin. They hit max capacity in the blocks like 2 years ago. 2 years and now they are finally doing something about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:45:44
I just read [this article]( and wasn't exactly sure what to make of it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:44:32
Would alternative solution to this be to trade all BTC for say LTC and just store it in LoafWallet until this all blows over?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:13:30
Pics or it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:47:29
You know hammering? Lol okay
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:08:44
Best time to buy is right now 
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:13:22
Might as well sell and never buy again. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:41:21
The more forks happen the more people realize that it’s just another way to create a shitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:58:05
Yeah it does depend on the number of transactions going through. Back when that spam attack was occurring I saw it go up to $8. 
Also, you can change fees after funds have been sent using RBF or CPFP. The fee you see is a recommendation based on the number of network transaction. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:47:59
It happened already in private, but Bitcoin Gold goes live to the public on the 25th. So the fork already happened but you’ll get access to your bitcoin gold on the 25th.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:07:07
Bet. I can see 10k by Christmas but 20k is a reach.
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:57:13
Yeah I think I found the last remaining copy of it
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:21:36
I just checked the fee for my bread wallet. 30 cents for economy.
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:43:22
u better not
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:04:32
Well, it’s at 6k now so maybe OP isn’t as dumb as everyone thought
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:37:54
Down the rabbit hole you go
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:51:42
I posted the same exact thing in r/btc too.  And I know what is does I just wanted to see what each subs thought were
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:05:10
Technically already happened
