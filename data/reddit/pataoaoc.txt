It's bad news for hodlers, yes, but it's not FUD... Unless you consider all bad news "FUD" and not just intentional smear campaigns.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:48:27
I agree that it would be interesting, and any numbers are speculation. But anecdotally the only people I know personally that are interested are only interested in the price, and I'm even a developer / hang out with devs.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:00:37


What does this even mean?
And your basket of investments is incredibly risky. You're going to get destroyed at the first sign of bad weather. 
You know how people call USD a shitcoin because of inflation? The point of investing in bonds is that you keep your savings and don't get impacted by inflation, while being exposed to next-to-zero risk.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:31:53


This is not at all rational. You might, or you might lose a lot too.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:39:50
In a sense. If you risk 100% on roulette and come out 3% ahead, sure, you came out ahead. Great... but was it really worth it? You could have made 0% and not risked anything. Or, of course, you could have made 100% which would be a lot better. But I wouldn't put 3% in the "pretty darn good" category of outcomes.

I'm no 2011 or 2012'er, but as a developer involved since 2013, it has always been about getting other people to buy the coins, it doesn't really matter if you can understand the white paper.
For a while it seemed like it might be viable as an actual payment network, but in the end there's no reason that needs to be done as part of BTC and not a better designed altcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:35:07
How is this *remotely* FUD?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:31:59


in other words "you can't say anything negative about my investment, because its value is entirely predicated on convincing other people that it's going up. so be quiet"
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:02:23
You can sell 1 BTC for $10000 at the moment, but do you think you can sell 10000000 BTC for $10000 each? That should be a starter thought experiment on why the "market cap" is ridiculous
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:04:08
I think you'd better reassess if you think most people aren't simply interested in Bitcoin to make money. Even the ones that want it to 'succeed' mostly care about that to make even more money. If you include altcoins the number of people that care would go up, it's true.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:34:00
Why was it a good decision?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:32:05
Haha I find it hilarious that you're facepalming and it's your comment that is completely ignorant. You need to learn about market depth.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:37:16
At some point I became confused what is a joke and what isn't
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:45:20
I actually thought you were referring to the term investment vehicles, investing in actual cars and driving them is certainly a bold move. Again, another ultra high-risk investment that only works in bull markets, like art.
You're still not grasping that the point of bonds is to not *lose* money/value when things go south, not to gain it. Look at what happened to Enron holders in 2002 if you don't understand why having some percentage of your net worth in something incredibly safe is a good idea: 
Edit: but yeah, like kickopotomus said, enjoy.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:35:16
Still, the point is that what this guy really needs is a stablecoin. It's great that his speculation has increased in value (or at the minimum decreased slower than the Bolivar) but in essence OP is doing the absolute opposite of "invest what you can afford to lose"... It may very well be their best option but it's not good.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:28:43
Not for a three-month investment that had an incredible amount of risk attached.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:38:21


It may also be in December 2018
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:20:20


Depends on your definition of detrimental... I could "afford to lose" a lot, but I'd certainly consider it detrimental to lose it.

If you work with good people and they all retire, that could make your job an absolute disaster. I don't think it's necessarily spite.

Having basic knowledge and having read both, your analysis was indeed vastly better, OP's doesn't even seem particularly relevant to these cash settled markets
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:44:25
When did you buy? Because for me $15 seemed really high

What are you trying to get out of this? Almost all the responses are going to depend entirely on your sample of users. X-post this to and you'll get exactly the opposite results.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:45:17
Also lots of exchanges are actually BTC/Tether pairs and not BTC/USD, so when Tether takes a dump the BTC/USD calculation starts showing a spike.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:36:08
Do you understand that Tether is supposed to be immune to people coming or going?
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:41:53
It's amazing that crypto fans are watching this as "good news" fireworks when it might be the Titanic scraping the iceberg
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:52:36
You're doing it wrong if you're losing money on real estate. With BTC you're betting that the value will go up. But with real estate, the value can stay the same and it can be highly profitable, because you can simply rent it out.
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:51:18
There are so many things wrong with this comment that I don't know where to start.
Real estate has a vast amount more utility, in the economic sense of the word, than Bitcoin or any crypto at the moment.
It's also one of the oldest investment vehicles in the world, and is just as strictly non-expansionary as Bitcoin... with the tiniest of exceptions, nobody's making new land until humans become an inter-planetary species.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:33:09
Of course they're not guaranteed success. But there's no reason they're not viable.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:52:55
Lol ever see the current Bitcoin bubble?
I'm simply saying that RE should be net positive without appreciation of the underlying asset unless you're doing something very wrong.

Hire a management company that charges 6% of rental income. They handle everything; getting renters, arranging maintenance, inspections, etc. Sorted. That's what I do at least.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:49:53
Real estate is by far the most popular asset class outside of stocks &amp; bonds. Do you think self-made millionaires are overwhelmingly stupid? 35% even own REITs which sidestep all your bullet points entirely, at the trade-off of less return.

You think he just placed a ~$360 million market sell order a while back and nobody noticed until the legal documents were unveiled recently?
He said he sold the coins over a relatively long period of time (at least December through January), trying to maximize their value using some strategy.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:01:56
You do realize this is entirely possible if the miners decide to as a group...

So you're in favor of allowing the free ownership and distribution of CP? Because that's what you're saying.

The same reason a democratic majority requires the ability to interfere with any other thing of value. Trust me, I'd love to not pay my taxes, but it's not a good idea.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:56:35
You're operating under two assumptions... (1) that Bitfinex is doing everything they say they're doing (with tons of red flags and no audit) and (2) that even in that relatively legit scenario, that traders spend all their Tethers on the same day that they get them.
Most of the idea of Tether pump is that Bitfinex is not doing everything they say they're doing...

Regardless of who you believe holds the power, the bottom line is that the only reason there is a cap is community consensus, which is subject to change. The people mocking Bloomberg are IMO the ones making a fool of themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:54:08
This seems really naive. Let's suppose for a second that Bitfinex is printing magic Tethers and using them to buy BTC. Are they going to spend $100M on the *same day* they print it? IMO no, that's crazy. What better to spend it consistently over time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:22:08
I don't think you understood.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:03:16
So first the value prop of Bitcoin was anonymous transactions, now it's *preventing* anonymous transactions?
I understand it's not truly anonymous, but it's hardly possible to prevent or detect unwanted transfers either.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:51:53


Which was?

Allowing the free ownership of CP doesn't mean you support the content, I understand your position. Vitalik Buterin actually said the same thing. I find the strategy untenable, but I understand the point, and there is logic behind it.
