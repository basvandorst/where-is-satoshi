The story about this documentary is following: Huge national TV channel paid for creating really outstanding Bitcoin content for their centralized national TV for wide audience. This commercial company is 2nd largest TV channel of Russia and has something like 100 millions of viewers (80% of population of Russia watching them - this one  But something went wrong on their bureaucratic level (probably due to upcoming criminal charges promises from ministry of finances, basically banning Bitcoin), and inspite all of the investments into this documentary movie, they decided to shutdown the whole project and delete all 90% paid and accomplished quality video-materials. And since many Bitcoin-community members of Russia (including Roger Ver who even came to Russia for an interview in this movie) driven people participated in this process, when they faced this kind of news, the whole Russian community gathered enough donations to buy out the whole movie project out of this scandalous shut down. Now they published it under the name of other TV-company, but with that good old initial controversial content!
Enjoy watching this quality movie with great stories! Would be really awesome if someone could make a professional voiceover in order to include this movie into the list of full-length Bitcoin documentaries.

no Bitcoin mentioned + at 45 minutes they start talking about some e-card shit, and it was said "I feel globally connected when I have my identity card"
