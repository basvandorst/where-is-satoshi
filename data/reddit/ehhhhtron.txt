I'm sorry, but this post is over the top. Reminds me of @_date: 2018-09-25 05:03:04
Lol. I'm honestly too lazy though.
@_date: 2015-12-09 21:55:59
A good laugh?

Wow, I didn't even realize there was such a thing. This tech moves too fast.

Open one in nyc.
@_date: 2015-12-12 04:10:25
Yeah, but there are other ways of informing readers about the true value of the technology without revealing SN. Though I guess the point is that it doesn't hurt to have an interesting tale, like this one, to tie it to
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:55:39
Is there documentation of this occurring? I'm interested in reading about it...
@_date: 2014-08-22 03:51:27
I'm so confused.

Maybe I'm late to the game, but it suddenly hit me that credentials don't necessarily mean much
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:44:15
This is old news. 
Also, the headline is pretty sensationalist given it's based off of a single line from a power point. The author is just copying Beautyon's analysis

The markets? Anyone care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:35:33
Maybe, though devs/community only seems to support a PoW change in a very specific circumstance - if bitcoin forks and old chain is attacked. Doesn't seem so extreme.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:12:56
How old is this chart? Just curious.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:27:25
Agreed, I would have opposed it... hard enough for me to run a node already
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:46:28

English? Does it require SegWit?
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:57:30
I keep hearing this idea, but it doesn't seem likely to me... We've seen two years of intense block size debate due to a ploy to pump altcoins? o_O
Idk, somewhat tangential, but the debate reminds me of basically every other political debate. No one makes sense. My personal theory: Humans are weird.
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:25:21
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:20:51
Eh, this idea was written by Olivier and hasn't been approved by the Bitcoin Classic developers so it's probably a *little* early to say that Bitcoin Classic is splitting off.

I understand that CoinDesk was in the wrong in this case, but the anti-newsite rhetoric in this thread drives me crazy. It's pretty messed up that they deleted that comment. But... it's one thing to point out errors, and quite another to trash media as a whole. There are a lot of great journalists that are working hard and trying to be as objective as possible when writing about an exciting new technology that they love. 
As a journalist, I am 100% biased.

Who's the source?
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:22:00
Reminder: He's talking about BIP 148 specifically. He does favor using UASFs...
From the email: "There have been some other UASF proposals that avoid the forced disruption-- by just defining a new witness bit and allowing non-upgraded-to-uasf miners and nodes to continue as non-upgraded, I think they are vastly superior. They would be slower to deploy, but I do not think that is a flaw."
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:36:12
It's possible he's trolling.
... right?

@_date: 2016-05-22 19:21:58
If it's newsworthy, it's cryptocurrency related, and people want to read about it then I don't see why they shouldn't write about it. 
But yeah, one-sided = not good. The article I read was fairly skeptical (e.g. lines like "While the project may seem like a last-minute idea meant to capitalize on public interest in a new technology"  and seemed to just be telling the story of someone working on an interesting project
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:14:06
Yeah, I don't know if it really matters much at this point. It would be nice if more women were involved now, but more will join up. I'm a woman. I can't get enough of Bitcoin. I show my boyfriend videos and he finds it's cool, but he never explores it on his own.  
Female interest in the tech industry seems to fluctuate, and that indicates, in my opinion, that it could depend on cultural expectations (or whatever you want to call it). It's all speculation as far as I know, but for anyone who cares about why the number of women software engineers dropped over the last thirty years, this article/podcast is an interesting starting point (because you know, they use data and facts and stuff). 
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:12:39

@_date: 2017-06-04 15:46:23
"However, given Core's past behaviour and total unwillingness to compromise on a higher block-size, I tend to regard Segwit2X as the safer solution."
Hmm what do you mean by that? Why would Core's unwillingness make it a safer solution?
One complicated thing, it seems to me, is that many developers do support a hard fork at some point... many have been researching how to do it safely.  It's hard to group all of the volunteers under the name "Core" and say that "they" want a certain action taken. Even if some want an increase to 2MB, for example, they can't force the rest of the group to follow along... Plus, even if they *did*, they can't force users to go along with it. Users will run the software they want. 
The impression I get though (might be wrong) is that the consensus among devs is to try increase the block size in a backwards-compatible manner as much as they can before a hard fork. SegWit was the first. If that goes through, they can push through other changes like MAST and Schnorr sigs which will boost capacity (not sure by what amount). Then perhaps others will come up with other ideas. But once they run out, then an increase to the block size parameter might be in order.
Just saying. Interested to see how Segwit2x plays out though. Personally I like the idea.

"It turns out the most viable attack on bitcoin is social engineering a science-minded community into religiously feverish factions of extremists."
I was with you until the end there. Where's the evidence for that? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:59:57
Only miners not *running* SegWit will split the chain... Right?
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:53:19
What website are you getting this from?
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:11:57
Oh, well, now I'm even happier I began using them a few months ago.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:26:14
He says a lot of things
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:18:57
Yeah, that's my thought too. On the other hand, it seems like the current timeline for Segwit2x is rather short, the technical details are still unclear, and it will likely lead to a network split.
