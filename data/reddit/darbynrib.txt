Gotcha. I thought if I show that number anyone can just nab the BTC off of it?

Wow. Karma will take care of him.
EDIT: wow guys. I'm sorry my opinion clashes with your fragile reality. I didn't say, "karma is REAL and you must believe this!" did I?
Hey, I have some bitcoins! I've been following bitcoin for 12 months. Maybe we all have more in common than you think.

Later, not sure if I want to sell or not. I'm entertaining offers.

Very blunt, I like you.

Who said anything about religion? Jesus fucking christ.
I was referring to this definition of Karma:
"Destiny or fate, following as effect from cause."

Right? This is seriously boggling my mind. I'm in I agree that this dude is a shithead for draining OP's faucet. 
I mention "karma" and EVERYONE LOSES THEIR MINDS. 
Wouldn't they WANT karma to kick this dude in the teeth? Regardless of your beliefs, it's a nice thought. 
It's not like I came over here commenting shit like "HEY YA'LL KARMA IS REAL, AND IF YOU DISAGREE YOU CAN JUST EAT A BAG OF DICKS"
Thankfully I give no shits about upvotes or downvotes. However, I certainly won't be sharing my bitcoin wealth with any of these close minded pricks.

You wanna start an existential debate? This is Go somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:02:54
Why would you like to know? and what is that exactly?
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:17:05
AH I see. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:58:22
I'm well aware the world is unfair. The world we live in is absurd. I personally believe that Karma plays a big part. Believe what you want. I was stating my OPINION.
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:42:29
Oh is it?

Thats what I'll probably end up doing if I decide to sell.
