Yep, always best to do this while setting it up just so you know it works. Set it up, wipe it, and try to recover it just so you know it works 100%.

They're partners, so there's not much difference.

What is going on with Coinbase? It's taken nearly a week for them to verify my bank account, it's meant to take 2 days or less... I'm annoyed to say the least.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:38
Don't send it, save it as a draft. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:54:22
So the volume has nearly halved since a couple days ago, how is the price still going up?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:45
50 to test the water, all I could afford to throw in at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:00:45
I have no idea but I like it
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:20:20
I can't get over the fact that should I potentially invest $1000 at 9k and BTC hits 100k next year, I'd have made a tenfold profit. That's crazy to me.

1) No experience, but if it's allowed to be there then chances are it's safe.
2) An offline wallet (called a ledger) is Tue safest way to store your bitcoin. The Nano Ledger S seems to be a popular choice.
3) You can sell your bitcoin whenever you want for real money. It's generally not worth selling unless you've invested a lot and will make a big return as the future is unpredictable. It could go even higher and you would have missed out. If in doubt, hold as you won't lose any money until you sell.

How low do you see it dipping when it corrects?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:58:43
Commenting because I'm also interested.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:10:37
This, where is the best place to sell from a ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:59:52
That 34 BTC sale though
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:46:59
Right, so I've sent a SEPA payment of £1 to Coinbase to verify my bank account. Is that all I need to do to verify it?
Also, once it has been verified how long will it take to withdraw my money from my Coinbase GPB wallet into said bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:09:07
I have a bit invested already, managed to get in during the dip so I'm not missing out too much. I was going to throw a significant amount in for the long term though, so I'll be scouting for a dip around the new year.

What the fuck is happening on GDAX 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:11:29

I was being sarcastic, you used "your" instead of "you're".
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:04:50
Tis the joy of being a Redditor, friend :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:01:48
Yup. Write down the 12/24 word pin and keep it somewhere safe. If anything happens you can use that to recover your wallet. DO NOT store it digitally in any way.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:49
Hold man, hold! I'm in your boat, us Brits will brave the storm together.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:12:18
Officially made $10. I am a happy chappy.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:53:07
My 1 hour late what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:37:37
Yeah, I did mine almost immediately after making my account
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:59:46
I have to wait until January before I can buy. It's killing me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:33:06
How long do withdrawals from Coinbase take usually? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:54:23
This is the golden rule I'll always play by. At the moment I've got some surplus money so I feel safe investing a little bit in something like this. One thing I'm unsure of, I've invested in GBP, is that independent of the USD market? IE, if the USD was to go up to 10k, will the GBP market also go up the same amount?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:34:26
It's gone above 10k already today, a couple of times actually. May be automatic, but I doubt it. Probably people panic selling before another dip. I see it going up overnight though tbh. Buckle up for an interesting weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:30:11
How much do you personally feel safe investing at times like this? I'm relatively new to this sort of thing, so I've only chucked £50 at it for now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:18:03
just bought £50 worth, now seems like the time to do it
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:12:31
Where can i see it go up/down in real time?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:36:34
Most likely lag. From what I can tell, GDAX is the most reliable.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:13:02
We buying bois?

Lose your phone = potentially lose your all of your bitcoin. You'll have a hard time losing a desktop.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:58:42
Basically you don't make or lose profit until you sell. Therefore, it's best to hodl until you're happy with the profit you've made. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:20:57
Smart, it seems to be hovering a bit at the moment. I see it passing $9,600 by the end of the day.
