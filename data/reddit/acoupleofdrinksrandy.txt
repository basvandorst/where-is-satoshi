I'm in contact with them. Just wondering if this happens a lot with them or not...

I'm specifically interested in finding out countries of origin of these transactions.

I don't think this is the first time people have pushed their agendas in a loud way.

Come on guys, there must be something out there that shows this information. All my keyword searches are failing me.
@_date: 2016-01-01 01:59:53
Alright then.

I always pay a standard to high fee. It's been pretty hit and miss lately with transactions being processed quickly or in any reasonable kind of timeframe, seemingly regardless of the fee amount.
This has been the case with me sending and also receiving transactions from many places with different amounts being paid as the fee.

@_date: 2016-10-25 17:57:11
I've found this isn't always true, but alright
