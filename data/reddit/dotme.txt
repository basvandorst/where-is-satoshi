Bought a little. I did transfer in some USD 4 days ago, so it was alright timing. I am transferring more in but won't clear till another 4 days. Oh well, no rush, after all 4 years gone by.

It is going sub 10kUSD.
Edit: According to my calc, and yes I am buying, because I didn't do s*hole with crypto in the last 4 years. Never too late to lose hard earned money.
