You’re moving goalposts. The fact remains that once you identify a serial number as having come from a drug dealer or bank robbery, it can forever be identified as such. Cash is not fungible yet it’s still clearly a currency. Therefore, fungibility is not a necessary requirement for being a currency.

The key step from spam to money was the realization that normal people wouldn’t want to run software that stressed their computers, made them hot and run slow. They would prefer to just outright buy the “digital stamps.” That’s when the light bulb clicked on for everyone. That would be a market and it could be used as money. Years later when Bitcoin was announced, I knew that it was finally a working version of that concept. I bought several thousand BTC and mined a few hundred as well.
P.S. That’s not the only reason I’m rich though. I made a million bucks selling software I developed and I also bought Nvidia stock at $20 a share. I have a long history of picking winners. ;)

Good luck with that. Your market is niche and there are already established services that you seem to be incapable of finding before building your own. Crypto owners are rare. Crypto owners that pay taxes are rarer and crypto owners that will pay you to help them with their taxes are like a handful of people. All QuickBooks has to do is provide historical price data and you’re screwed.
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:01:28
You are correct. In order to show that there is waste they would need to show us a version of Bitcoin that has the exact same properties minus the waste. Such a thing doesn’t exist. Therefore there is no waste. The closest contender is PoS but it has different security properties and it “wastes” liquidity rather than electricity.

Calm down. Most people aren’t Winklevoss twins. Most people don’t need a bank. They just get their direct deposit and then spend it with a debit card.

No, the smart move is to invest because the technology is solid and THEREFORE the price will eventually go up. The technology is getting better and THEREFORE bitcoin is an even better investment, regardless of current price action. If you are worried about the price then you probably don’t believe in the technology and deserve to lose money for investing in something you don’t believe in.

The only way OTC can’t affect the rest of the market is if those 2 people would have never bought non-OTC if OTC wasn’t an option. That is a complete fantasy. The reality is, if you can’t buy OTC then you’ll buy from an exchange. That means that OTC takes away exchange volume and therefore changes the price from what it *would have been otherwise*. You’re an idiot acting like taking water from a lake instead of an ocean doesn’t affect the global water supply. I’m sorry if that hurts your feelings but just because I’m an asshole doesn’t make me wrong. That would be an ad hominem fallacy to say otherwise.

We need people earning in Bitcoin until it makes sense to spend in Bitcoin. Otherwise, it’s just pointless churning.

Short term and long term aren’t defined. You are talking  out of your ass.

Anyone that gets big off Bitcoin and tries to bite the hand that fed them, should suffer.

Exactly, his argument loses all its strength when you say the equivalent “buying bitcoin is like buying gold”. He’s playing on the fact that average people use “invest” to mean both investing and speculation.

No, shit-tier service. Literally all they have to do is click a button to unban your account but they can’t even be bothered to do that.

He’s not wrong or right because his argument is poorly defined. Does he mean gambling as “game of chance” or does he mean “risky action”? Does he mean invest as in “expend money in hopes of future business dividends” or does he mean “expend money in hopes of material gains”? He only answers one of those questions. We don’t have enough information to evaluate his argument. Even then it’s a stupid argument that revolves around semantics rather than anything of intellectual merit.

I have equal amounts of both so I don’t give a shit which one wins. I just hate lying retards.

You know what’s even better than admitting you’re wrong after talking out of your ass? Not talking out of your ass in the first place.

Being a libertarian means respecting the NAP. That’s all. It doesn’t make you a nice person. It really just means you adhere to the bare minimum which is rarely anything to brag about.

It doesn’t matter. A rose by any other name. The longest chain with the most work is what matters. Also,  vagueness is something you have to deal with. For example, if you’ve ever flown in an airplane through some clouds, you learn that they don’t have clearly defined boundaries. At some point you are definitely outside the cloud and at some other point you are definitely inside the cloud but near the edges, it’s vague. You need a better functional definition in those cases. Also see: sorties paradox.

It doesn’t matter what 99% of the finance world calls it when talking about average people. Go look up “argument from ambiguity”.

Sure he’s right but it’s still misleading because that’s not how average people use the word “invest”.  If all he said was that “buying bitcoin is like buying gold because both are speculation” then it would be a more positive spin.
