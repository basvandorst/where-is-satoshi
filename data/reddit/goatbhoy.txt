As mention by others - blockchain.info
Also - bitbargain.co.uk - payment by PingIt or bank transfer. I tend to buy using PingIt. Once you have PingIt set up purchases can be completed in less than an hour (from moving money to your PingIt account until receiving coins). 
Localbitcoins.com looks quite good but unlike the other 2 I mentioned I haven't personally used it.

Thanks for the reply.
Surely the current volatility of the market is what the eff are concerned about? For better or worse 1 USD/GBP/EURO is worth roughly the same on a day to day basis? Whereas BTC still move around with (sometimes) very large percentage changes on a daily/weekly/monthly basis? 
Do payment processors protect clients with a guarenteed return on coins (I should probably go investigate that myself....) or is the return based on current market rates?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:02:10
Yep, but there has been people posting that pre-placed orders were not picked up during lag. Won't cost you anything, but you won't be making any money either

Market has grown and crashed many times over the last few years. If you had a large amount of coins sitting around from when they were worth next to nothing you could use them to crash the market. 
Anything is possible but running around screaming about conspiracies and insider trading with no proof isn't doing anyone any good...

People with tech skills called you out on it. You didn't properly defend yourself, you provided no proof and your "discovery" was at a point in time and not repeatable. So they weren't fooled. 
People who aren't as technical, well done. You threw some buzzwords around and hoped they stuck. 
Dont be patting yourself in the back about the PSA. You've done nothing more than bog standard trolling. The fact that you created a throwaway to do it shows how little you think of the people in these communities you profess to like. 
If you do work in the NetSec industry you should think carefully about doing stuff like this. It doesn't tend to help employment prospects. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 17:23:25
Thanks. So they charge a changing BTC so the USD value remains static (or at least at a minimum level)? 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:29:36
Agreed! Wish I had some money in Gox to pick up some coins and blockchain aren't taking any more uk deposits.

A good point, but it depends how you define a DDoS. Not all attacks are designed completely knock the site off-line and as has been seen the main site stays online during all of the laggy periods.
To me it looks like a volumetric attack of legitimate traffic. "The attackers" know what level of trading activity will cause the site to lag out and apply it at the correct time to then trigger a panic amongst nervous coin holders. This creates a feedback loop where more and more people try to sell and the site just becomes progressively slower, causing more panic, more sell offs, more lag, more panic, etc.
The short term solutions for Gox would be to raise the level of minimum trades (making an attack more expensive to start) or as has been suggested by many others today shut the site down once the lag hits a certain point. 
Of course both of these fixes will damage Gox's already damaged reputation but until they sort out their DB problems I don't know what else they can do.
EDIT: should have said that around the time that they first cause the lag there will probably be a couple of big sales to set some nerves on edge.

The values required to run SR are very low though. If the coins aren't being spent anywhere else there will be enough coins to go round even if the value is negligible.
I helped set a friend up with TOR and a BTC account to get on SR and when we set it up BTC was around £6. Even that was a big increase over the previous 6 months values...

You are now tagged on RES as strange little fellow.

Weird. The first mix listed is a Scott Hardkiss Essential Mix. 
So, none of the mixes are authorised for sale by the DJ's or any of the artists whose music appears in the mixes? Not trying to bust your balls about this but it caused Soundcloud a lot of trouble a year or two ago....

Have mailed them to ask if they will support it in the future, so thanks for the heads up!

And none of this rang any alarm bells? If he wanted to sell coins he could have went through localbitcoins.com or bitbargain.co.uk and got market rate (or well above on bitbargain).
Anyway, I really hope you have some success getting your cash back.

The (much smaller) uk market on gox dropped £5 in about 10 mins. Was ready to drop 75% of my coins but the lag stopped me. Has climbed back £3 in 2 mins. Glad I waited! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:18
The value on each exchange is defined by the values people are willing to buy and sell at. There is no banking commission setting a USD/BTC trade rate. 
Arbitrage, definitely possible but there is no way of telling how everything will go once Gox re-opens. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:41:15
Da Damned Illuminati! :D
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:56:31
I dont think anyone would disagree with the fact that the current exchange model is a busted flush. But I still think its a big leap to say that its insider dealing thats caused all this. 
For the last 15 years I've worked in off-shore banking (with a heavy emphasis on Forex) and e-gaming. 
I did a lot of DDoS mitigation work in e-gaming and the last couple of crashes have shown some distinct signs of volumetric DDoS attacks caused by legit traffic (Gox being flooded by small transactions inducing lag after a big sell-off). Couple that with a lot of people who dont know much about trading and thought that BTC was a way to easy money and it makes it very easy to trigger panic crashes (IMHO)
All I'm saying is its all up in the air at this point and with no access to inside information from Gox we are all just throwing shit at the walls and seeing what sticks. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:13

Gox is under a DDoS after being offline for maintenance. Dont trust any graph data from them as its at best out of date and at worst totally inaccurate.

I dont think you understand what pikeadz is saying. 
He's suggesting you take the money you have for the Avalon and instead invest it into a mining pool with someone who has received theirs. Its not the same as owning your own but gets you in the game. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:40:25
There was a post yesterday with a screencap showing the flurry of 0.02 transactions from a laggy point a few days ago. Clearly an exploit has been found and it's being tested against whatever Gox put in place to mitigate it. Once they find the volume needed for the attack they wait for a good price and kill the site. 
In a previous job I did DDoS mitigations for e-gaming firms and have seen this kind of behaviour before.
Gox know all about this and are unwilling or unable to fix it. As they still get their percentage of every trade it's all gravy to them.
Hopefully this will get everyone moving to other exchanges and spread the coins around a little. I will definitely be moving my coins and funds from Gox tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:03:44

No need to apologise mate, emotions are running high at the moment :)
Just take a look around at some of the BS being spouted around here at the moment - I've read posts saying its a CIA plan, other ones saying the Gox "Mods" were in on a big sell off before the crash.

I like your optimism, but go read up on botnets and see if you are still as confident. Also, do you really think people are hanging out on IRC discussing the plans of their botnets?
Its not just about talented people, its about having the legal and financial clout to shut down servers and pull legal strings across multiple countries. This is why the most success in this field has came with Microsofts backing.

My point is that as its distributed. Probably via a botnet. 
Botnets tend to get taken down without the owners being identified. The owners are free to create a new botnet and start again. 
AFAIK the only successful takedowns have been carried out by Microsoft and other firms (Symantec, Kaspersky) working together using teams of lawyers to get things going. 
Who is going to fund the lawyers? Who is going to manage and co-ordinate the search and takedown? 
Better to vote with your feet and move funds and currency to exchanges with a better infrastructure and proper DDoS mitigation. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:36:34
Yeah, I used to use Intersango until they closed the UK account and have been with Gox ever since. Never investigated a euro FX service as I thought it would work out more expensive. Will take a look now though, thanks!

Apart from stoners on SR what else can you buy with BTC right now? Web services like VPS, Wordpress, etc. Average Joe has no interest in any of that. 
Amazon and eBay already exist and take Average Joe's pounds, dollars and euros just fine. 
Even if cheap and easy methods of purchasing BTC exist why would Average Joe want to swap his fiat currency for something that goes up and down quicker than a cheap whores knickers?
To me, the growth of BTC as a day to day currency will come from the 3rd world where banking is difficult and the possibly failing euro states (Spain, Cyprus). 
What we have seen over the last 3 months is completely disconnected from reality. Just look at the posts on here - 99% of the people getting on the bandwagon were looking to make easy money, not support a movement.
