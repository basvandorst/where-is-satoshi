Can we give TOR project some love
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:42:46
I agree. I am a core fan boy but we need to increase the block size by at least double. I try to send friends a couple buck to show them how it works and I cant even do that.

Why a bubble? Bubbles pop, and I want the price to stay as high as possible for as long as possible.

The best time to buy bitcoin was in 2010. The next best time is now. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:06:37
They were on no fee exchanges with wash trading bots. If I'm not mistaken they started trading fees around that time so all the bots shut off.

Circle charges a premium of about 1% that is why they are always higher then spot on most exchanges.   
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:16:04
I think once we break 10k we will shoot past it to 12k and go back and settle around 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:16:01
I'm fine with Bcash. it's the trying to take the name bitcoin that bugs me and I'm sure most people. If they just gave it a different name and stopped trying to confuse people I don't think anyone would care about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:44:34
What would you expect them to say? Hey guys we are not solvent but now you know. Happy trading! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:49:06

Over there everything is a conspiracy against BCash I mean everything. 
Lose the  Twitter handle: it's Jack because he is in a romantic relationship with Stark. 
BTC keeps the block size 1mb: it's the bilderberg group. 
BTC higher price: tether manipulating the market. 
Lightning network: again Axa bilderberg controlling the network via watch towers.
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:52:22
Nope Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:57:18
Usually you will do better just investing the money into bitcoin instead of mining gear. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:45:16
Anyone else find this useful feel free to send what you feel it's worth. 
2nd edit no Bcash. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:49:08
Spend like 20 minutes over r/ BTC and you will see how legit crazy they are. Everything is a conspiracy against BCash I mean everything.
