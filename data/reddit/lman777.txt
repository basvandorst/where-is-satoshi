Not sure if you are serious or not but it has crossed my mind. Maybe not in the next couple years, but in 50 years I wouldn't be surprised if we've arrived at a worldwide (mainstream) currency precipitated by current cryptocurrencies.

I think this part really answered the question in my mind.  So long as they can tax it, I don't see it being a problem.

noob question- wouldn't world governments NOT want bitcoin to succeed?  Doesn't the ever increasing value and adoption of bitcoin hurt fiat currency, especially if it were to really get mainstream adoption?  Serious/honest question, I'm just getting into this and the thought has crossed my mind a couple of times.

Wouldn't that look like structuring though?  Sounds like an invitation for an IRS audit.

I think there are a lot of CPA's out there, I would just make some phone calls.  I'm sure not all of them will be comfortable handling this, but without a doubt someone in your city will (unless you're in a really small town).  I live in a pretty small town and there are several CPA's operating here.

just a minute.

Yes.... I'm in the same boat.  I was able to buy but I don't think I can sell until verified.  I don't even want to sell though, just want to exchange some of my coins for one another on GDAX.  Frustrating.
