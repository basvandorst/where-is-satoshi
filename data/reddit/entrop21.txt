Honestly, I sold enough to recoup my initial investment.  Now it’s all profit, less concerned about short term, long time hodler

Totally popped

I took my initial investment out.  For me, psychologically it's easier to hodl when you're playing with house money.

Seems dangerous to play the swings.  Might miss big legs like today.

His single argument is that bitcoin is losing some of its market share.  He must have said that 10 times.  Seems like a correlation proves causation fallacy-there are 100 other reasons why this could happen as we are seeing a surge of alt coins and more adoption of cypto as a whole.

Worked on me.  I'm new to this btc stuff, panicked today with a sell then immediate regret rebuy.  Result: lost 40 dollars in coin value and 40 dollars in transaction fees.

Gemini - no fee.

I get that.  I just forgot for a minute.

No fee for deposits or withdrawals.  Fee varies for purchases but it's been ~10 dollars for a bitcoin

If Bitcoin crashes it's w sentiment and profit taking in my mind.  
Sentiment starts dropping because of:
1) increased regulations 
2) controversial fork
3) major security breach
Small dips lead to selling, which leads to bigger dips, then profit taking starts kicking in.  Those that are riding the train as a trade (not as committed to the long term of the coin) start selling to capture profits which can downward spiral.
My plan is if this happens, use it as an opportunity to get more on sale.  I'm not going to stress about the daily fluctuations, I'm excited about where we'll be at 3 years from now, not tomorrow.

Correct me if I’m wrong here guys, I only have a very limited understanding.  Segwit was a transaction format change off of a soft fork.  So currently bitcoins can be moved in both formats, but segwit will became more adopted over time, and hopefully faster.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:35:44
They weren’t related.  Segwit is intact and healthy and the future of bitcoin.

Ok!  I just did that, now what should I do?  Thanks for the heads up market predictor stranger.  Wish there were more fortune tellers like you in the community.
