Not true at all in the case for TELCOIN... They have a mass adoption route using the telcos in current un banked countries... this is a great plan and are currently testing the concept  with telcos.. there on roadmap is ontrack for great Q2 and 2018.... best undervalued coin right now in my opinion...
