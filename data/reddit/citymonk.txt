Also true. Yet the combination of not having stop loss/take profit and the errors/lag makes it an impossible platform to do day-trading on, despite the fancy features.

You can't seriously be thinking this hands-on support is helping your public image? Whenever there's a big shift in the market, your servers get overloaded and can't handle the traffic.
