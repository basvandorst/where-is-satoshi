 [DO NOT USE THIS BANK!](
I sent Euros 10k to Bitwala and then sent the whole amount to a trading broker. I was lucky I got the funds out of Bitwala account very fast.  
After a couple days I got an email stating that my account was blocked. No other explanation.  
There is no way to contact customer service other than email. You can not speak with anyone.  
I sent an email asking for a reason.  
I received an answer the next day. Mail is in English and a lot of questions in German. They require all kind of details about my employment, my monthly and disposable income, how will I use the account, what is my experience with crypto, when was my first transaction, what is the purpose of my transfer.  
They could have asked all these before blocking my account.  
I think this is another example of how intrusive banks want to be.  
As I said I feel lucky I was quick to move my funds out of Bitwala account before it was blocked and I will never use their app again.  
Beware!  
========================  
Follow-Up  
I see they are much more prompt in answering my review here on TrustPilot than answering my E-Mails ;)  
They keep asking "How high is my monthly disposable income?". I am not asking for a loan from this bank and I do not want to share this info with Bitwala.  
Also they keep asking for a second proof of residence ("maybe a letter from your town hall - official registration document" - they imagine I will send them proof of my house ownership?) after I've already sent a bank statement where my address is clearly stated.  
Remember that all this dialog by e-mail (they take about one day to reply) is taking place while my account is locked and I have no access to my funds, not even my history.  
Imagine how that would feel if you had a consistent amount of funds locked into Bitwala account.  
They could have asked all these questions when I opened the account and locking the account without warning is certainly an abuse.  
Of course, in their wording "this serves my personal protection".  
Waiting to see what happens, but I imagine they know I won't be using their services for long.  
I think I still have a small amount in the account and I'll try to get that back.
