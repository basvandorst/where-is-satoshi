It's not economically viable in the long run to spam the network. In this case, the users are the ones (unknowingly) paying the spam fees, not Coinbase. As such, Coinbase will most likely eventually end up being replaced by a better alternative if they don't fix this.

So how's Moore's Law working out for ya? The future doesn't look very bright.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:11:56
That has nothing to do with what I said. I didn't say anything about what Ronnie's intentions are, or how knowledgeable he is. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:04:56
If you want to make decisions based on misinformation (or hope), go ahead. It probably won't hurt you for a few years. But if you're betting on Moore's law being alive in 10-15 years, the odds are HEAVILY against you. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:00:34
It's too technical for most people to understand, which is fine. Bitcoin right now is like a construction site; nobody is going to care when you install the plumbing.

Sure, and that's part of what I'm basing my argument on. However, Amazon and Alphabet etc. do a lot of things "alt companies" do as well, but you don't compare one of these companies to all the other companies combined though, do you? And more importantly, you don't define their success based on how well they do against all other companies combined.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:46:41
Wow, I had to wait a while, but it was worth the wait!
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:29:33
It really is irrelevant. If bitcoin needs a single leader who dictates the direction bitcoin should take, it is not truly decentralized. Satoshi's opinion should matter more than most people's because of his expertise, sure, but in the end,it should just be one of many thousand opinions.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:00:08
The thing is, a lot of the competition with significant market share is just pure shit. When people come to their senses and the mania subsides, a lot of these coins will go to zero. Others will have their true value reflected in their price. Bitcoin will be the only "digital gold," while other coins will be treated as stocks and tokens. Their value will primarily be derived from the whatever their actual utility is worth.
Can Bitcoin hit 88% dominance? Unlikely. Can it hit 75-80%? Absolutely, but it has to do so after the altcoin market crashes, and before there are tons of actually useful coins/platforms.
Honestly though, comparing the market share of one entity to thousands combined is a stupid way to determine success. It's like expecting one company to fulfill all the roles of every other company.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:46:55
What am I trying to make you buy? I'm simply saying that Moore's law isn't "law" anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:32:25
Absolutely, but remember also that we are still in a very early stage of cryptocurrency. Coinbase has very little quality competition, and the scaling of bitcoin is a work in progress. But you are right, right now, in the short term, they can make shitloads of money doing shady shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:53:14
No, that was a prediction for *Bircoin*.

Absolutely. I'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing, I'm just saying that, if the goal is decentralization, there shouldn't be one.

There are a few ethical issues. First of all, most people have no idea how much their personal info is actually is worth, nor in exactly what ways the data is used. Also, people don't know exactly what data these companies are collecting about you.
Secondly, you are assuming that the data they have on you is only used by people with good intent. You say that you don't care if they know about you. Sure, today you might not, but consider a future where people with not so good intent know everything about you. Consider a scenario where everyone knows everything about you. Would you still not care?

It's not a religion. It's an open source decentralized community. Hence, the community decides where bitcoin goes.

I'm talking about how Ronnie's OPINION on Trump is unrelated to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:52:54
Ronnie's opinion on Trump is irrelevant to Bitcoin. If you ignore someone's opinion and advice because their opinion in a completely non-related matter doesn't match yours, you've completely lost track of what you're doing and what you want.

Well usage IS voluntary. And SegWit IS opt-in. If users want SegWit, then it would be in these companies' best interest to implement it. If users don't want SegWit, there's no need to implement it. As such nobody is forced to do anything regarding SegWit.

I sort of agree, but try to explain cars to people who've only used horses. These people don't fully understand it. They understand that blockchain is a revolutionary technology, but that's about it...and they like their horses (for now).
And in the end it's actually a good thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:22:30
I never said it was. The point I was trying to make was that with or without LN, it's still too confusing, meaning we need layers and services on top of the blockchain to make it user friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:14:13
If there are 1 million users on the sideline, they would each have to invest an average of $1000 in order to make it 1 billion. But it's probably wayyy less than 1 million users, and I think the average amount of money people are looking to invest is less than $1000.

You can see it as a symbol of denial considering what they're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:35:38
It's not difficult. It's just confusing on many levels unless you have someone to explain in detail what is going on and what they need to do. You can teach a six year old how to do it as long as you know how to do it yourself (which is a problem because many people aren't comfortable enough to understand what's actually going on). Furthermore, and perhaps the most important thing, people don't feel like it's secure enough, especially with having to secure their keys along with the fear of being hacked. It's extremely easy to fuck up in crypto, and no one will be there to save you when you do.
And by "people," I mean like your mom, your neighbor, your retired physics teacher from high school etc. 
With all of this said, this is already being dealt with today with services like Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitflyer etc. In the future, your bank will probably be doing it as well. As such, when it comes to LN, while confusing, most people will never have to deal with the confusing part.

Most coins are pretty useless as currency right now since it's hard to find places to actually spend them (aside for using them to buy other coins). Also the price just keeps going up, so there's little reason to spend it over fiat, unless you're forced to (like in certain countries). As such, you can create a completely decentralized cryptocurrecy that is free of charge and allows for instant transactions, but people will still be using their credit/debit cards to purchase their coffee, and PayPal to buy things online for years to come. 
Bitcoin will be ready way before the world is.

For facts about what Bitcoin is and how it works, there are tons of information available and easy to find. Read a few articles and/or books, watch some youtube videos and you'll be able to distinguish opinions from facts. 
When it comes to the price and the future of bitcoin, the process is the same as with every other type of investing. Read the news, consider opinions from multiple sources and form your own opinion. If you can't distinguish "good" advice from "bad" advice, you either didn't study the facts well enough, or you lack the necessary understanding of economics. 
My point is that, if you need people you shouldn't trust to tell you whose opinions to trust, you're starting at the wrong end.

Sorry bro, but your Reddit profile tells a different story. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:40:01
You're right, Trump did what Ver is struggling to do. My point, and yours as well from what I gather, is that the best thing to do is simply ignore him. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:32:23
You might want to look into his point though. While it's too late to ignore Trump now, I'm gonna guess that you were one of many who clicked on every article and news story about how Trump said or did something awful, even though you needed no further evidence about what kind of person he was. Simply doing that created financial incentive to write and post even more about him (and no, it doesn't matter that you used adblock).
Sharing your thoughts about him on social media (assuming you did that) was even more counter-productive. That's basically creating and publishing ads for him for free.
With that said, now that he's president, trying to ignore him would be the wrong move. Basically, when you have a considerably larger following than your opponent, your best move is to simply ignore them (complete opposite of what anti-Trumpers did). If you have a much smaller following, your best move is to be as loud as possible so that people start talking about you (exactly what Trump did). If you're about equal in terms of the size of your following, you attack them harder than they attack you.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:31:19
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:59:21
And just like Trump, he's the ultimate fix for your confirmation bias, so you can't help yourself but to read and talk about him. Why do you think Trump was THE headline of basically every major media outlet in America almost every day for over a year prior to him getting elected? 
Say something loud, stupid and controversial, and you'll soon find yourself surrounded by a bunch of cirkle jerkers fluffed by feelings of superiority and self-gratification, completely oblivious to the fact that they are actually the low-hanging fruit they think you are.
