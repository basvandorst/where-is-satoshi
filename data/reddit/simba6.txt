If you had your own answer then why ask the question in the first place &gt;_&gt;

Hey I understand you are a bit frustrated, however the entire Crypto Currency scene as a whole is still so new and mainstream adoption has not even occurred so how can you expect that the new innovations will be at a point where even grandma can figure it out at this point? About the only thing in the space that easy is getting a bitcoin wallet in general. 
I'm sure the space as a whole and all peripheral technologies will be at a point where you don't have to feel like you need a degree to understand it in the future but right now you are literally trying to ask why a brand new technology (that was only theoretical just months ago) can't be spoon fed to you...Relax..

Looking forward to the future of this company :)

"there's nothing fundamentally preventing people from building Counterparty directly into Bitcoin at some point in the future."
Except that through consensus the bitcoin community as a whole will most likely not vote to implement a counterparty type system directly into bitcoin since the functionality will already be in widespread use by an existing protocol...counterparty...  (Assuming as you said counterparty proved successful then why fix what's not broken)

Umm they've said multiple times that BTC cannot directly provide these functions which is why (like how ethereum has ether) a token that is not BTC must be used. XCP is there for a reason.

I would imagine the answer is because most "alt coins" are crypto tokens run on their own blockchains. Counterparty runs on Bitcoin, counterparty tokens (XCP) can be sent to Bitcoin Addresses....In other words everything on Counterparty is ON bitcoin.

You have that reasoning, but will 51% of the bitcon mining network agree that this would be something worth implementing? This is again assuming as you said that counterparty proved successful right? So your question involves first that counterparty is probably widely spread (within the communities desiring this functionality) and secondly, that 51% of the mining network not only feel it would be nice if counterparty functionality was implemented directly into the blockchain, but that they would all feel that it's a "necessary" thing to implement....It's HIGHLY unlikely they will vote for this to happen if there is already a workable system in existence.
(Edit) the biggest thing you have to understand here, is that implementing ANYTHING new directly into the blockchain is something so serious, it would require 51% of the miners to not just have a passive interest in implementing, it would require that they really believe they NEED to implement that...
