@_date: 2019-07-18 15:56:36
Well... Your not wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:10:34
tell them to rock up a decent transaction fee and wait for atleast one confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:20:50
all our fingers are crossed.  
twas a risky bet and i hope it pays off.

The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:52
exchanges left right and centre are crasing,  price is rising faster than i can keep track
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:52:19
im waiting to withdraw some coins from coinbase,  which i believe is the same thing as gdax.   there website reports a partial outage for bitcoins. 
guessing high traffic.   sleep on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:26
10300 now going for the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:42:44
How low?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:13
Yeah after looking at the options I have already purchased some ledgers.  The steel plates might also be a viable option too.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:53:33
I've put a transaction through for 15sat/byte.   Not paying £13 in fees!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:52:40
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:54:06

Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin using Windows Explorer.
In that folder, hold shift and right-click and select Open command window here (picture).
In the command prompt, type bitcoin-qt.exe -rescan and hit enter (picture).
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:19:43

@_date: 2017-12-07 10:34:45

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:42
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:29

I tend to just impulse buy bitcoins at random times during the month.  I probably should transfer funds to pro and take advantage of the lower fees.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:41:17
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:47:26
Risky bet, but I think your right.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:20:10
Coinbase back fellas.  buy / sell to your hearts content
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:52:55
Someone care to explain how about doing this? Currently I'm still on segwit address.ive got a ledger nano.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:43:51
should have bought yesterday really but today is also a good day.
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:39:32
Don't paid a target on your head by announcing it
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:19
update,  was up long enough to get a purchase off on my mobile app.
bitcoin Christmas sale :D

"The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 190 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 42,940 satoshis."
you paid 10 satoshis per byte, could gonna take a while.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:47
got a generic "over 9000" image saved for the occasion?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:03:18
more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:51:05
Yes. Typo.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:34:29
Yeah, I see your point there.  Those scenarios do seem bizarre. 
I guess the kicker here is your significantly more likely to be the target of cyber crime than car theft or a mugging.
