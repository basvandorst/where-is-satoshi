People seem to read only the title but not the content.
I said "until the major exchanges make their system bullet-proof". In case you haven't noticed, short selling for certain coins was temporarily banned on some exchanges before hard forks. Unusual times call for unusual means.
What I fear is that hackers are moving faster than us, and soon the whole field might be overwhelmed by cyber attacks. I don't care whatever you call me, trolls.

You forgot that gold has no scalability issue etc.. BTC at some point will simply strangle itself.

My goodness, you really believe in a theory with infinity as result...
Any scientist would tell you if a theory gives infinity, it's wrong. The model must be over-simplified or naive and can't be used to describe reality.

Sure, creating anything requires energy. But it doesn't make that thing possess the same value as the energy spent!
I can spend energy to create a screwdriver, which I can use to make furniture that has new value. That's a good use of energy. What can you do with a BTC?
You can't change the fundamental fact that investors' money is constantly sucked away by this coin-creating game that has no potential to produce new value.
In this game, the only way to increase the value of your investment is...getting more investment.

So what does mathematics tell you about the value of BTC? Is it $20k or $3k or $1k?
My suggestion: don't take those unproven theories too seriously.

What a typical answer from a believer.
