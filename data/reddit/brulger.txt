Well I mean my method might be complicated, but when I say that I want it criticized I don't mean that I want a method that might be inferior.
I believe this is inferior because it involves a higher level of trust in a third party not to fuck up, it is less secure because the device could be stolen and obviously I'm looking for a brain wallet like alternative, otherwise I would just use Armory

What about the MPK? Do you think that there is some way to keep it private?
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:20:50
Maybe. I mainly mean buying The Pi and NOOBS SD card from there as it is more safe than burning it yourself

Buy a new NOOBS SD card from the Swag store

Why would a paper wallet be better?

The reason that I destroy the SD card is that I'm afraid of it being stolen. How would a Trezor help me?

By this logic mining could be done for free. Altruism is never a reliable motivator

2 million wallets != 2 million users

What do you mean verify that my system still works?

I very confident that I won't forget it. As for cost vs labor, let's just say that I have enough BTC to want the absolute best method regardless of the labor necessary.

Just feels like an unnecessary security risk. The likelihood of me fucking something up and infecting the live cd is far greater than the likelihood that a noob SD card from the raspberry pi company is going to be infected, an SD card that costs less than $10 mind you

Shut the fuck up and check the FAQ!

How is that better in any way? I can reuse my Pi for other things afterwards, the Trezor I would just have to destroy.

The likelihood of a Bitcoin enthusiasts computer being infected with bitcoin malware is far greater than the likelihood of the company behind raspberry pi being infected.
