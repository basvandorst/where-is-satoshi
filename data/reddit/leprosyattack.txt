No that's not true at all. Keynesian economics is to spend and cut taxes during recessions and to cut spending and increase taxes during times of positive economic growth. And this is at a state level not an individual level.
Individual spending driving the economy is economic fact. Without consumer and business spending, there would be no employment or economic growth. If consumers don't spend money, businesses can't stay in business, which means unemployment skyrockets

No to fight severe deflation
Edit: and hoarding

No disrespect to you but you really offered no insight with those comments and didn't critique anything about what I said. And again you're confused because what I said has nothing to do with Keynesian economics as I'm talking about basic macroeconomics. So can you please offer an actual critique?

You don't have to type an essay, type a couple paragraphs or even a few sentences outlining your critique and why these basic economic concepts are seemingly wrong. I'd love to here an argument from your own words

Glad to hear a voice of reason, because truthfully these concepts of deflation and consumer spending are seriously basic economic concepts that a lot of people in this sub seem not to understand or prefer to ignore their existence

I'm well aware of the Austrian school of economics. That being said, I don't understand how you can disagree that deflation and low consumer spending is good for a healthy economy. Deflation leads to hoarding and low consumer spending. Low consumer spending means businesses aren't making any revenue. No revenue for business means they can't stay in business which leads to mass unemployment. I'd like to hear your critique of this. And to be clear, this isn't Keynesian economics, this is low level macroeconomics

The economic growth was mostly due to the mass industrialization in that time frame. And there's a reason almost every major currency dropped the gold standard during the great depression...

Not true. If the intended effect is to spur consumer spending then it certainly has the intended effects quite often.


That is exactly the intent, to be able to afford loans due to lowered rates. 


I don't see how this is true, care to explain further?


When you consider deflation as a whole and not in one industry, this rarely happens.


Sure, they dont have a contracting supply, but in nature they are deflationary. Since there is a finite amount it promotes hoarding which dis-incentivizes spending. 


It seems to have worked pretty well for almost every developed nation since the Great Depression as we've seen continued economic growth

It's not insane at all, its actually economics 101. Spending drives the economy. Deflationary currencies promote hoarding and dis-incentivize spending. So by that logic, deflationary currencies are bad for a healthy economy.
