Which part of the scientific method do you refer to? Do you think that indirect observations are invalid per se? Or would you suggest better experiments than those that have been carried out so far to prove or disprove evolution? I'd like to encourage you to get cracking. Testing any hypothesis as thoroughly as imaginable is the best toolset we have to separate truth from falsehood.
