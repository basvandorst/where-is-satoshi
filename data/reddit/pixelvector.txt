They don't have a clue what to do. And to be fair, that's pretty understandable. 
The reddit 'hivemind' is an ever changing entity. And the only reason reddit is the 'front page of the internet' is because of their users. 
The site itself is nothing special. It's actually pretty awful design wise. Their algorithm for voting works pretty well but there's no stopping any other site/company from using a similar system with better features. Nothing at all.
All it will take is once instance of upsetting the hivemind in a big way and *poof* their status is gone. With that consideration it's pretty apparent that reddit *will* die one day. There's no stopping that. And they'll most likely go before facebook does. 
If not for a specific negative reason, users will eventually see a shiny new site with more bells and whistles and slowly trickle into it.
So if Reddit's design is outdated and lacking, why don't they change it? They can't. Or rather, they're afraid to. Because if they change their design in a radical way the hivemine *will* get upset about it. It's too risky since their business model depends on being the most popular 'font page' site to an extremely finicky group that only flocked to them due to exodusing another site. Unfortunately at the same time it will damage them eventually. And they know it. 
They released a survey with a question about the design. And I can promise you that it was the entire point of the survey. They wanted to see if they could get a lot of people saying they don't like the design and then show it as proof to not upset people. The top comment was someone saying that the design sucks but don't change it. So. . . they're still stuck.
The cryptocurrency thing is similar. Another attempt to do something, anything, to both stay relevant and trendy while not upsetting the reddit userbase. But they're not married it I think. Never were. It was just something they were throwing at the board because they truly have no fucking clue how to permanently keep reddit users happy; which is their only goal.

And making a post about it just makes it more likely for it to continue.

Agreed. Rather than trying to shape up a strong user-base from the pile though; I fear they may just see the ship sinking, panic, and decide to sell while their price is still high. That will be the tempting thing to do. 
The irony is that if they sell that will pop the bubble for sure.

This only applies if you're hiding important or useful content inside. Otherwise, if not overused; it's just a background feature that doesn't actually have to be interacted with, it just becomes a personal preference. 
Shoving it into dropdown navigation definitely takes away more than it gives, and is what I have to fight with clients on. 
Another example are 'top 10' sites that put each topic on a separate slide. In general you shouldn't put in any content that the user came there for. Just aesthetics; images and quotes. And I guess you can hide the infamous 'letter from the CEO' in there.

The worst aspect of web development is the design being critiqued by a full board of directors instead of one or two representatives. It gets nowhere because they derail the meeting with the smallest and stupidest crap, each trying to outdo one another by pointing out something that they don't like or want added so they feel like they've done something. Competing visions for the brand. 
You'll get questions about that crazy 'lorem ipsum' language and clarification that the company will be using English for the final design. 
If not using Lorem they obsess about minor text content that is better worked out after the design and development stage and not during the comp finalization: That's why Lorem Ipsum is generally used for comps by the way, to help avoid people reading and critiquing the dummy content when they should be looking at the overall design. 
Some will be concerned with why standard vector apple-style graphics were used to show the different device states, or why they don't have the apple logo like a real mac (which of course has nothing to do with the design or product; just standard frames for comp use).
"Can the logo be bigger?"
"Yeah. I think it should be bigger. I can't read it from here."
"That first rotating image in the back should be [insert object, e.g. 'a tree'] to better represent our stance on [insert topic, e.g. 'the environment']." 
"Can we do something about all that. . . empty space?"
Showing a design to reddit can be pretty much the same thing.
