Eh, overall it is generally positive for Bitcoin, but it does move a lot of the market volume to ETFs that are futures based where let at least some of the demand get soaked up by naked shorters. It's like the opposite of how the normal world works. Usually you have a huge market of Apple shares and a tiny market of apple options / futures. You can't really game the futures market. But if all the volume is on the futures side because mom and dad want to put Bitcoin in their Roth-IRA or RRSP then it seems like shady market behaviour is possible, especially because Bitcoin itself is unregulated.

I bought them at $3. You probably would have sold them, just like I did, at $200 or $500 a coin. It's called a bear trap for a reason.

With Bitcoin it is so easy to say you sold some, but a hacker stole it or that you fucked up a transfer. You can even actually transfer your balance to a different unaffiliated, never online wallet. 
Just start lying to people, including your blabber mouth parents.

It's more akin to M0 than market cap. The current USD M0 is roughly $4T, and they are probably around 25% of the world's currency in terms of relevancy / use. The tricky thing is understanding what Bitcoin's M1 will be, since people generally don't like borrowing when price deflation is happening. I dunno, I could see this going to $500k a coin if they don't ban it.

Haha, I SODL far too early (~$200-1000), but borrowing money off my credit card in 2010 to buy Bitcoin was fox crazy fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:51:08
Yep. But the downside is that you do the math every now and then and realize how much more you would have made. 
I think I would be happier if I'd ether bought more when I bought (I was pretty poor at the time, put it on a credit card) or if I'd held on longer. If I had done either I would have easily made millions. Now making a couple hundred grand out of nothing is fine, but some of my friends are driving Porsches.
On the other hand, I'm in better physical shape than they are. So I dunno. Can't win them all.

Provided you generated the address a normal way (ie, you didn't generate it as a brain wallet with simple words) and you always kept your wallet on a computer that never went online giving out the receiving wallet address is 100% safe and can receive as much as you want. Note that everyone will be able to see all the transactions, so don't receive money from your employer and money from your pimp at the same address if you don't want them to potentially know about each other.

I got in at $3, and _nobody_ was calling it a bubble back then. They were calling it monopoly money or a scam, but not a bubble. You couldn't even reliably buy this stuff online.

Bitcoin is just a long story of how authoritarians discover that individuals with the absence of communication blocks with threats and violence freely fix the problems that would otherwise cause them harm. Just watch as people reassemble to solve this problem all without a single damn committee.

Sorry, I'm all for egalitarianism, but how is global finance patriarchy? I can open a bank account without specifying my gender. I can IPO a company or wire money or write a cheque or buy stocks or do any number of things. If anything global finance is the most amoral and least gendered industries.
Saudi Oil money is, the military usually is, but finance?

You got downvoted, which is understandable, but wrong. It is a fair question.
In order to create a bitcoin address that had a high-value word like counterparty you would need more computing time than the entire world has. And even then, you would need to be incredibly lucky. Just getting a 5 or 6 character "word" takes a long time. That plus the long string of exes makes it essentially impossible.

I was pointing it out 2 years ago in HN threads and I just kept getting downvoted. I even prefaced it with "I own bitcoins and I think that this is a problem that is possible to overcome" but nobody cares.

So there is the other side to this that most people don't talk about. I know a couple VCs (partners) and angel investors. Many of them personally put in  between $10k and $1m when Bitcoin broke $100. The thing is while they may personally believe that the upside is worth the risk, besides Andreessen Horowitz, nobody is really willing to bet the farm on it because if it ends up being a fad, it will really look bad. Easier to fund wearables, or finance software, or VR stuff.
If Bitcoin does take off, the guys that bought 1000 coins for $100k, are going to be up around $10m, more than most of them would get from their portfolios if they hit the right company. And worst case scenario, the US government makes it illegal, the price collapses, and they have a small loss.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:07:31
I dunno. I kinda like the simplicity of blockchain.info, plus it is way more secure to keep your Bitcoins there than Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:47:07
That is cool man! You should do it! Be sure to save at least half in bitcoin though.
As for the site, remove the ads. They arn't making you any money yet anyway. Make the place better and cooler first. Best of luck :)

The thing is he called it long before it was ready to pop. So did I, but I knew that it was going to continue on for a couple more years so I invested accordingly, and it did. Then in 2007 I sold every share and bought up put options on an S&amp;P 500 index fund.
My point is this: you can't just call something a bubble and then 3 years later when it pops be like "I'm the oracle of modern economics, listen to my Keynesian ways" because there are others out there that got it even more right that you did and they might hold Austrian views.
I actually think bitcoin will enter bubble territory. I really do, and when it does I'll be happy that I own a non-trivial amount, but let's face it, bitcoin isn't on the cover of time magazine and it is always mom and pop retail investors that get hosed by this type of thing. It's a bubble when they get involved. And it is probably another 3 years before the pop and correction (and I'll be buying bitcoin on the cheap then too).

If you are going to do this fucking take out an ad in the New York Times to show people you are real. Just like Apple did. Otherwise this is just cringeworthy.
I remember when my previous employer FreshBooks did this:

When it hits $30k is when I’m really going to cry. It’s one thing to make 100x when you could have made 3000x, but when it could have been 10000x or more you’re not even making the half way mark on a log graph.

I was in at $3 USD. I sold almost all of it between $200 and $1k. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:48:09
I just kept thinking they'd ban it. So every time it hit a new high I'd sell half. 
You can only sell half so many times. If I'd only had sold like 25% each time I'd be in such better shape. Like millionaire shape. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:43:14
Eh. Lots of startup founders funding via bitcoin gains. It's stressful trying to decide when to sell a couple coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:48
Haha, yeah, I bet half the people here have more than 50% of their portfolio in Bitcoin at this point. 
Can't hardly blame them though, the only way to rebalance would be to sell more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:01:12
There is one possible drawback though: You could end up dying in the 80s in something routine like a car accident long before your Bitcoin or domain names are worth anything. Whereas you're guaranteed to be a 50 year old with $10m.
Also odds of you blabbing from being from the future are much higher than you might think. And if you've got the insight / investing track record to back it up you're probably going to get arrested and studied. Then the future changes so much that your investing isn't as guaranteed as you might think.

I tried buying bitcoin at $1 and eventually met someone in person at $4 CAD / $3 USD. With a cash advance on my credit card. I was broke after a failed startup, but I was sure Bitcoin would be a thing.
The moon to me was $200-400, where I sold 80% of it. The next moon was $1000, where I sold 10 points of the remaining 20.
Then I forgot about it for a while, holding only 10% of my original investment. Then I woke up one day last month, checked the price and sold 8 points of my remaining 10, figuring the ICO crackdown would lead to at least a temporary pullback.
All in all I've already made 250 times my money. To any sane person this would be the moon. But every now and then I do the math as if I would have not sold a thing. Could have been a bitcoin millionaire.
Still, I'm not complaining. If everything goes perfect and it goes to $50k a coin I'll still be happy.
What's kinda weird was back then I realized I could just get a job at Google or something and plough all my money into Bitcoin and on the (what I thought was) 50% chance that it went super big I'd be set, but at the time I thought "oh whatever if it goes big I'll have made enough money".

You must not be a developer.
Problems like this are best approached calmly. They have time and they have a plan. If a bunch of devs were all wound up, I'd be fucking scared that they'd inadvertently fuck something up.

If I hadn't bought bitcoin right now what I'd try to be doing is to own a single bitcoin just in case it goes huge. Do that first. If it crashes, buy some more, but don't mortgage your house to buy bitcoin.

I sold the 220/190-140/160 window for a long time. But you know what sucks? Selling at 220 and watching it break the window. After it hit 440, I re-evaluated and bought in. I barely made any more money than I would have just ignoring it. Maybe 50% more, which is not much in bitcoin terms.
