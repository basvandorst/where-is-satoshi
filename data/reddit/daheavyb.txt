I agree with this, in that many more people will acquire BTC because of ease of entry vs. gold.  When gold has a rally, I’ve never heard of anyone saying “well hell, I need to get some of that”, I’ve always taken it as more of an indication the dollar is hurting.

My ledger setup: (works the same for trezor)
24 words with &lt;$200 value in wallet
25th word temp passphrase wallet has the true bulk of value.  25th word is a lifetime known word, impossible to forget without injury.
24 words, stored in airgapped TAILS USB drive (strong passphase for persistent storage).  This USB is imaged and stored in multiple cloud accounts.  Also stored in secure locations on paper at home.  Lawyer has copy of 24 words.  One buried in backyard for fun with a desiccant (crypto steel be damned)
Wife and best man know my 25th word, they have no access or knowledge of where 24 words are stored.  Law firm has instructions upon my death.  I also have a deadmanswitch email service.
No one has pin but me, the hardware device is a convenient method for signing transactions only.  It’s not the true ‘storage’, the words are.  Hardware wallets just make it convenient and safe to use.  
If I’m MIA or dead, my wife will eventually get my coins, but not without assistance.
The 24 word wallet value is a canary in the coalmine.  If that value alters, I know my 24 words have been compromised.  It’s also my $5 wrench buffer, which really would most likely be border control or attempted civil forfeiture.
The beauty of this system is the TAILS OS comes with copy of Electrum installed and is audited code.  If my hardware is compromised and I need access before I can get my hands on another ledger or trezor, I can download my image from the cloud and have access somewhat quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:05:04
Because the 24 words are something that needs to be physically stored. (I’ve never understood how someone thinks they can remember 24 words). The 25th doesn’t.
There’s always trade off between security and convenience.  The online storage of the Tails image adds another level of redundancy that expands the geographical availability.
If my house burns down, I have the backyard and the lawyer, but it’s much easier and secure to just download it then ask my lawyer to open my envelope and read it to me.  It’s also easier and more secure than digging up my hidey spot in the backyard, once I do, that scheme is burned security wise.
If I’m abroad and need access, I can buy a usb drive and a used laptop and I’m in business.
Since the 24 word wallet is the canary account, it can afford a little exposure for ease of access.  I get much more ease of mind knowing it’s there compared to the concern of that Tails image being compromised.  It has a high entropy passphrase that is unique to only that login.
The odds of finding the 24 words in my home is much higher than LUKS or my Tails passphrase being cracked.

Keep a copy of that .dat file safe, offline, multiple places (burn a cd, usb, etc).

Anything amount under what you would be devastated to lose is fine, having nimble funds is great.
You’re only blatant attack vector is the keyboard, especially any 3rd party keyboards that do dictionary search online.  If your wallet uses the iOS keyboard for your pin or password, that’s not good.

Each has their advantages. Properly generated bip38 wallets on a secure device (think live OS) is extremely secure as a deposit address, but the moment you want to withdraw, it’s only as secure as the device signing the transaction.
Hardware wallets do the key generation and signing ‘offline’, making them very solid for regular transaction use, but there is a very remote possibility in a vulnerability in the hardware itself.
If you’re not a security professional, I recommend the hardware route.  It’s all about odds, I believe the odds of human error is greater than hardware vulnerability.

Then use the method I laid out for encrypting existing private keys.  BIP38 encrypts your private key to a key that is password protected.  This allows for digitally storing your keys without fear of hacking or theft. (vs solely physical storage).
You asked how to digitally back them up securely.  That's how you best do it, in my opinion.

I totally agree the ramp up to Paypal and credit cards/debit cards takes effort, time and 'approval' to be usable.  I also agree the 'current' demographic of bitcoin doesn't really require this service.
But the demographic Circle appears to be going after has those accounts, use those accounts and will have the ability to get &amp; use bitcoin with the least amount of friction utilizing those accounts they trust and are familiar with.  
The philosophical argument that it's against the 'spirit' of what bitcoin is about is moot if bitcoin can be used in a method that is contrary to popular opinion of what that spirit is. 
If someone owes me $40 and I tell them 'pay me in bitcoin', they may ask how?  I can point them to Circle and have my coin within minutes.  I know of no other service that offers that ability.
I'm not sure that is a 'good' thing, but I'm damn sure it's significant.
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:52:25
Despite all the complaining people do about Circle and their delays, I don't think we realize how important their service will be.  I'm sure the main reason Proton got numerous requests for taking paypal was the convenience of payment.  When a user can instantly buy bitcoin and instantly transfer that bitcoin, paypal will need to change their practices quickly or die trying.

I'm not a circle apologist, but was Allaire wrong about anything he said about the pace and method of bitcoin development?
Everyone here gives the usual advice to hit up localbitcoin or coinbase when a request is posted regarding acquiring bitcoin quickly.  Neither of those options are remotely 'quick' compared to using a credit card or paypal.
Merchant adoption has been nothing short of amazing this last year, yet it drives speculation of downward pressure on the price of bitcoin as sales are converted to fiat.  I believe Circle will be the inverse of that effect.
Lastly, in regards to their delay.  Circle is the heavy in the room.   It CANNOT be compromised security-wise or operational-wise.  The press would have a field day if there was a complication and it would, without doubt, convince many bitlay people that bitcoin is too risky.

It's terrifying to think you were targeted then grafted.  I'm sorry for your loss!
I'm surprised localbitcoin doesn't force SSL.  Since you mentioned using TOR, I don't think the insecure wifi was the culprit.  It appears a malicious TOR exit mode was being monitored, looking for non-SSL connections to localbitcoin.  I think it's important to point out that even with a VPN, the connection is only secure to the first TOR connection, the exit is just as vulnerable.   Using a verified SSL connection in this instance wouldn't have been successful to the thieves.

To make your wallet persistent in Tails, before powering off, copy the amnesia\.electrum folder to your persistent folder (you'll need to check the box for viewing hidden files in the file manager to see the .electrum folder).
When you reboot, copy that folder back to your amnesia folder before loading Electrum and your wallet will be there.
Edit: This is instructional towards saving your wallet in Tails in the future and reference for others running Tails, not recovering your already deleted wallet.

GitHub repository has protection measures you can look up in regards to the code being original from the author.
Verify the SSL cert being used to connect to github is valid with your browser and I'd say you're pretty damn safe.  If you trust the code, which based on your attempts to build, would seem that you do, then your fear would be a man in the middle attack.  If the SSL is valid, then there's very little chance the code has been spoofed.
I'd concern yourself more with your windows system being infected and the private key being exposed when you copy it to the clipboard.  At the very least, you should copy only a portion and manually type the last 10 or so characters.
All this said, vanity has a price.  You simply will not be as safe as using a well trusted client or key generator. (electrum or bitaddress.org come to mind)

The QR code is arbitrary, meaning you can make a QR code to say "Ethel Merman" if you chose.  When you scan that QR code, you see "Ethel Merman" on the reader.
In this case, the bitcoin client reading the QR code is looking for a URI as described earlier.  The base need of the client is the address and nothing else.  The "amount" is added as a additional feature to pre populate the amount field of the bitcoin client software.
The amount isn't affixed to the address, it's simply passed along with it in the URI, which is being represented graphically by the QR code.

I would strongly suggest you BIP38 protect those wallets.  Either by transferring your existing wallets to newly generated BIP38 addresses, or at least protecting the ones you have now (the latter would support not having to put them on a hot wallet to transfer)
You can use  to BIP38 encrypt your existing keys.  Then put your existing paper wallets back in your safe and put you BIP38 protected keys somewhere digitally backed up (I use Dropbox and Evernote)
I cannot stress enough not to do this BIP38 generation of your existing keys on an insecure system.  Download TAILS, burn that TAILS CD, boot using TAILS, download the bit2factor site, disconnect from the internet, then generate your keys.  Once you have your BIP38 keys, you can reconnect and send them to yourself using online services.

A VPN is not 'only TOR'.  DPR accessed the admin interface via VPN.  His employees did as well.  When an employee was caught by the Feds in a sting operation, the employee cooperated.  They were likely able to trace the employee's VPN connection to the server.  Once they had the server location, they made a copy and likely monitored it closely.  When DPR made connections to that server, they had him.
I believe the details surrounding his mistakes with his insecure posts are after the fact, designed to scare people or exaggerate the Feds abilities.

A couple questions:

Yep, Mycelium on the Z10 here.  Works well, but there's a few issues.  The QR scanner sometimes freezes the camera and the backup feature has issue sending the generated backup PDF.
As a workaround, I imported a BIP38 wallet vs using an app generated key.  I prefer this backup method anyway, as the BIP38 wallet is more accessible and I can create my own entropy for the key.
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:09:39
Based on everything said so far, I'm highly confident they will attest it did.  I suspect the custom rom had spyware built in or was installed at one point.  The timing of the theft after a large amount was transferred is too coincidental to not have some kind of monitoring involved.  The complexity of hacking the Mycellium app also seems unlikely for this single instance, I believe we'd be hearing more about this exploit if that were the case.
If we wanted to get elaborate, one could theorize that a monitoring app watched for connections to Mycellium's servers and forwarded screen caps of the balance for review when this happened.  The wife and business partner may have been the only ones to know about the large balance, but based on OP's other Reddit comments, this was likely for a miner (which also supports the business partner angle).  If that's the case, it's not a stretch this was discussed with others, making OP a ripe target.

Mycelium's ability to import BIP38 wallets is perfect for mobile solutions.  My 'mobile account' is a BIP38 paper wallet generated on bitaddress.org.  I import (not the BIP38 spend option, but a key import), the paper wallet, then put the physical wallet in my desk and a PDF copy in Dropbox.
I run a Blackberry Z10 and have reinstalled many times.  Never a problem.  I also had to replace this phone over a month ago.  Again, not a problem; just reimport the key!
This gives me high availability, security and convenience.

I haven't looked at the full list of apps running on your phone, even if I did, I don't run an android myself so I wouldn't know them all or how they work.
But, if the private key was generated by Mycellium and the key was never exported, except with the built in backup, which is encrypted.  It's only logical that your Mycellium app on your phone was used to send your coin.  There's no other explanation, unless there's a flaw in the Mycellium app itself, which would likely have been exposed by now (isn't the source code available?)
The theft would have been done locally on the device, or remotely via an OS exploit.  Since you're mostly sure the device was physically secure at the time of transfer, the remote control of the device to launch Mycellium seems most feasible.  If a pin had been set, this exploit wouldn't have been successful.
I'm sorry for your loss.

True enough.  In my case the 12 word holders just know they’re holding my ‘keys’ and are not aware of the 13th, hence the canary amount.  The only real danger is if my wife or sister collude with a 12 word holder, which is extremely unlikely.
Sweeten that canary amount if you really want to suss out the bad actors or make it convincing it’s *the*  asset.
If divorce is around the corner, to generate another 12 words is trivial.
The point is the make a system with the least amount of friction for the most amount of security when playing with others.  
I can’t think of a better one, do you have any suggestions to improve?
@_date: 2019-11-05 08:13:54
The solution needs to be as hardware and software agnostic as possible.  My example below is with a Ledger wallet, but could be restored with software or another hardware wallet.  Here’s my best setup:
Ledger generated 12 word key wallet (BIP49) utilizing the 13th word “secret” word feature.  The bulk of the savings are placed into the secret vault account, a minor amount (approx $200 as of today’s BTC value in my case) is placed in the 12 word account.
Save copies of the 12 word account with the lawyer/will.  Bury one in the backyard, give to trusted family &amp; friends, but inaccessible to my immediate family. (Read: wife)
The 13th word is custom (non generated by my ledger device) and it’s one my wife knows very well.  My sister has knowledge of this word as well.  In the event of my passing, my wife has instructions to work with one of the 12 word key holders.  In the event my wife and I both perish, my sister has the same instructions. My will has these instructions as well.
I fully trust my 12 word holders to act accordingly in my absence.  (For instance, if my wife survives me, they won’t be sharing any information with my sister)
The low amount in the 12 word account is like a canary account.  I’ll know the 12 words have been breached if the amount is modified and I have watch only monitoring enabled for that event.  If this occurs, I’ll regenerate the keys and reassign the 12 words.

aaaand he/she hits me with the tip!  Time to pay it forward and carry the word.
Thanks hardleft121!

8000 Yuan = 1313$US
8 is China's lucky number and us Americans love the number 13.  Coincidence?!
Hang on....

I sent a Casascius 5 BTC coin to a long time buddy for Christmas.  He has a 6 year old daughter.  The card simply said:
"This is 5 bitcoin, it will either send [daughter's name] to New Eurasia for a well deserved college graduation gift or its novelty as the first viable virtual currency will fetch a few ration packs on eBay.  Either way, Merry Christmas"

Thanks sp00kyh00ky!
I figured something along those lines, in this case 20,000 gates doing some operations.  Now I know which kind.
I've read Butterly Labs released a FPGA product, so I figured this would be worth asking.  Programming this to work with a bitcoin miner app likely won't be trivial, but hey, it's cheap and I love the idea of an open source hardware/software product to do something along the lines of what everyone is waiting for.

Six of one, half dozen of another.
