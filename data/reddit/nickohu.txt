What program would I use to do that. Because all I did was put a Linux distro on it and stratum proxy with GUIminer

Fuck. Didn't even think of that. The closest specialist is in San Fran and I don't have any PTO . Maybe I'll wait till I have time off, you raise a good point.

Lol someone bought when it was 1000 a pop
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:42:25
None so far. I'm going to send it to a specialist on Monday. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:09:16
I'm going to. I realised this last night. The second I get home that's what I'm going to do.

I was a freshmen in highschool. It was on a PC I didn't use and I just left it on for six months. Wasn't super into it and it was worth what like 10 bucks back then?

Depends where you are in CA, anywhere in the middle valley or nor Cal most houses have 1 or 2 guns in.

Well I was more looking for a site like kick starter or indie gogo but with bit coin. Also never hurts to ask. But my main question was if there is crowd sourcing/btc loan site

Fucking awesome! Thanks man!

People still pay tithes? I thought that died out with blood letting and witch burnings. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:53:58
Not dumb enough to believe in a mystical sky daddy that loves everyone but still condemns them to torture. Not dumb enough to pay the people trying to make money with the worlds oldest scam, religion.

Hard to find a non corrupt church. Grats to you. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:22:47
That is damn good. And if you have a church that does public documentation of where the tithes actually go and it is going to charity then amazing. My problem is I know many churches accept tithes and most of that money goes to paying pastors or expansions. I mean look at the super churches. They made that with money you people gave. I may not be a believer but I do base my life on the teachings of Jesus, he was a good man, but the church as a whole doesn't follow those teachings, let alone those of common morality, my fear is that money meant for good is poorly allocated or even blatantly misused.

Or those of us cashing out to buy up and maintain a profit
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:35:56
Yea I know, I just figured most religious folks had figured out if their sky daddy was real he wouldn't need cash

It matters to the people you could actually help with it. If you give away 10% of your income why not give it to a real charity? Or add it to a savings account for your children when you pass away? What comforts could you afford with an extra 10% annual income? You could improve your families life style. There is a lot of good you could do with 10% income. That's the biggest issue I have with institutionalized religion. Belief doesn't bother me, but brain washing, misplaced empathy, and poor allocation of money disgusts me.

Thank you, hopefully it all goes well.
