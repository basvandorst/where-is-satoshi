Yea it’s abundantly clear, they don’t want anyone owning something they cannot control and give to their cronies!

Want to buy a drug smuggling boat from JPM anyone?

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck... it’s probably a duck!

Mnuchin was on CNBC this morning talking about our anti money laundering tools and that he doesn’t believe money is laundered through fiat!  Funny stuff, amazing how people who don’t know or understand Bitcoin wants to regulate and brand it the root of evil.

Funny this guy is blaming Crypto and Bitcoin of facilitating illegal behavior.  Meanwhile back on planet Earth, he’s virtually been acting illegally for most of his life!  
Move over, irony train coming through!

That’s funny! People who don’t understand it are going to comment and try to regulate it!  Because that worked out well for healthcare right?

The irony here is that a guy who assisted in running Sears into the ground AND has been accused of fraud in that same act is telling the nation that a currency other than what he controls is a national security issue!
These acts he cites happen everyday through our banks.  Drug boat owned by JPM?  Fines to banks for money laundering? Selling bombs and weapons to countries that participate in terrorizing countries?  Chummy up to dictators? Election fraud?  Please tell me about national security issues, I’m listening!

So Crypto and Bitcoin are a national security risk.  
Running the country into the ground giving tax breaks to corporations, drug boat owned by JPM, money laundering in many of our large banks, the DB ongoing debacle, and accusing other countries of currency manipulation while devaluation of the US dollar to get the feds to cut rates; all are not national security risks?
Trade war anyone?

Don’t forget Jamie Diamond trashing Bitcoin then being hit with a fine for money laundering!  Look at what is going on with DB right now.

He apparently knows what he is doing.  This is the guy who with a buddy from college ran Sears into the ground and pillaged assets from the company!  They are currently being sued for doing so.
He also used US assets to take his wife on vacation. O and how about that picture of him holding up a sheet of money, next to a printing press, to impress his girlfriend.  Nothing nefarious about any of this!  
I wonder if in 5 years are we going to be reading about him money laundering too?
