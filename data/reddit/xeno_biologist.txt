I can’t hack your garage and make your lambo disappear. Why take the risk?

If we divide btc even more is that not the same as increasing the supply?
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:13:35
Good points, even great points on BTC relying on the current financial system. 
So what you're telling me is that we're just really really far away from widespread adoption, as in we're in the early stages!!! Gotta buy more BTC!

If you could arbitrarily change the amount of decimals by which btc is divisible. Then what’s to stp us from arbitrarly changing the position of the decimal point? That would definitively change the supply””. I would argue these two changes are one in the same.
If you change the minimum amount which people can buy then you impact the demand thus the price changes. 
I read somewhere in this thread that lightning will allow for the exchange of fractions of a satoshi is this true? Seems like a biggggg deal to me.

Institutional investors will play with bitcoin and litecoin. More btc though in my opinion. Both are good buys and either way price action is mostly coupled so buy whichever you like.

Of course! This word is really annoying! Should we change it? Just use it differently eventually other have to follow if we’re enough.

See my reply to the other guy above. It’s an important discussion to have!
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:58:11
Yes what is this word? Who made this up and what exactly does it mean? I’ve heard it over and over recently. It’s an age group right?

Maybe he wants to dump give clients money and at the same time buy cheap btc with his own personal funds. When you’re a whale and not your money the market is a playground!
Dumbest guy in crypto? How about genius!

If I bring a pizza into a room of 6 starving individuals and have no knife and auction it. It could easily reach 1000 dollars by bidding war. 
If I however only cut it into 6 pieces and sell. Then they may all be satisfied at least in part and the total auction may net me less than 1000 dollars. I would prefer to bid off a whole pizza to the highest bidder.

Bitcoin is not a religion guys calm down! Sure it’s called bitcoin, but some of these comments so angry! Think about your blood pressure they’re not worth it!
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:39:45
So this! I’ll never sell. I’ll just eventually buy whatever I want in crypto!

Steam accepts litecoin now. Although I haven’t bought anything recently. 
Western union still makes money because bitcoin etc is still unknown to the mass public especially the uneducated. I never used it for a few years had to do bank wires and they are expensive and take 3 weeks. 
Now I receive my either DGB or litecoin which I transfer to btc then sell as needed either on an exchange or to friends who are wanting to invest which is growing more and more. Local bitcoins works well as well. 
Plus there are a few businesses whom accept crypto in my city so that’s nice.

Buying goods and services. Splitting bills with nocoiners more frequently as of late - give btc/ltc/dgb instead of fiat. Having my family send me money and sending money to them across continents - live in different countries. Buying video games on steam. Selling/buying goods on craigslist. Cryptocribs used it once. The list goes on. But there are maybe I would say one or two which are truly transformative especially sending receiving money internationally.

Yes deposited a non negligible amount to atm in cash got no receipt (machine bugged out) and bank claims the machine never touched any money. It has to be in the machine even if shredded. 
Can see me on camera depositing but they won’t credit my account. 
Don’t know what do anymore. Fought them hard but now they basically told me to buzz off...

Heck try DGB UTXO 0.00001cents per transaction and instant sends. I really don’t know why anyone would want to step away from the safety of a UTXO and go off chain.
