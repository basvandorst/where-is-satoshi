Still possible it's currently a fad which is what I'm afraid of. In my opinion a big reason people are buying is because it can be traded like stock and as the price continues to grow they can sell causing bitcoins to flood the market causeing more to sell and so on and so on. It's value comes from it's scarcity and if that's gone the price will drop just as fast as it rose.

It's possible this just a fad for a majority of buyers or seen a s a get rich quick scheme. I'm saying that it's possible for the price to drop just as fast as it rose.

Not usually but since the buying power fluctuates so much special measures would have to be taken to compensate. And keeping your liquid assets as Bitcoin for to long wouldnt be wise.

It is how that works bitcoin is a bit special in how much the price can fluctuate. This would effect employee pay, product prices ect. Any bitcoins you have saved in the company could dramaticly loose value of the course or a year or two. Which would effect the growth and size of the business. Currently the American dollar is much more stable and only fluctuates a few cents to dollars of worth
