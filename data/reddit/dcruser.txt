If the new system is technologically the same, your concern is valid.
If the new system is different from that of Bitcoin, there are grounds to have faith in it. There exist at least a dozen decentralized virtual currencies different from Bitcoin known as altcoins but not clones or forks of Bitcoin code.

Linux is a kernel.
The equivalent is a blockchain.
There exist multiple implementations of Linux, as well as future is multiple virtual currencies, some even not based on the idea of a blockchain as long as they strive for decentralization, censorship resistance, p2p, public open-source models.

Decentralization is in many competing currencies, commodities acting as money. Bitcoin alone can't do it.
*As farfetched as it may sound today, I suspect there will be a ruthlessly Darwinian sorting of currencies within the next 10 years.*

Bitcoin opened the gates of decentralized money creation.
Bitcoin may be good enough for a while but it stays vulnerable and not really scalable.
Decentralization^2 is coming, in the form of altcoins. There are a few established coins among 700+ that are not based on Bitcoin code or forked from it, with the similar ideas of blockchain consensus. Most of these can be found in the top 50 at CMC. Bitcoin maximalism serves rational investors no good.

Still not trust-less.
A trust-less dead man's switch is when you fail to renew the lock say once a year, the control over your key *decentrally by the power of protocol* goes to the designated heir's account.

Well, the old system is going down the drain, economy's at the brink. So no, it wasn't fine, no trust left for the old system. More and more people are starting to realize this.

Trustless transactions is what Bitcoin stands for, isn't it? If it takes a lawyer, well, it reeks of the old system.

I thought it was common knowledge that Bitcoin came into existence to let people be their own bank, not rely on institutions to store money for them.

If you don't hold it, you don't own it.

Who still believes any other group but miners make decisions for Bitcoin? Chinese miners specifically.

The mining pools distribution is about the same it was with 600 petahash. It's very likely one entity is controlling this recently added hash power and pointing it to different pools to make believe Bitcoin is still decentralized, and we can keep our collective heads in the sand and pretend nothing is happening.

Many users will now switch to altcoins, because Bitcoin can no longer be relied upon for microtransactions, being only a settlement network expensive to transact on.
