It looks like you are rich and out of touch.  You don't appear to know the feeling of finally being able to invest in something with real potential without having to be rich first or get permission from someone in order to have a stake in something.  For the 99% of us who do not have access to the ability to invest in hot startups, we finally have a way to to stake a claim.  It is exciting and worth bragging about!

It would be hard to convince existing people to change the limit on the number of bitcoins, but I disagree that it would be hard to convince people too change the number of satoshis.  Most people will jump on that bandwagon because it enriches them in a way that doesn't not take from someone else, whether perceived or real.

This is the most plausible theory I have seen.

No, it would be 200 cents.  I'm not saying it makes sense, but it is an example of how we can collectively inflate the supply of smaller transferable units that comprise a larger unit without creating more of the larger unit.  We just have to agree. :)

I agree that in the context of my example that a cent would be worth half as much, but that is because my example is using fiat.  :)

It would actually be easier to reach consensus on this issue.  There is a commonly accepted solution to increasing the supply of transferable units and that is to just make existing coins more divisible.  This does not take anything away from people who already hold bitcoin and instead increases their holdings, so it is hard to imagine arguments against in a climate where it is needed.  The real argument will be consensus on the need to increase supply, not the method.

It's based on the amount of wallets\users across exchanges.  Now that most every exchange adheres to KYC, we can get a better idea about individual users.  For instance, the largest wallet service, Coinbase.com, has 2.4M users and 3.1M wallets as of July 15th: 
  
It's still a rough guess, but a much better one than a few years ago.  I have a co-worker who has bought 45 bitcoin over the last 2 years who has made zero transactions.

Are any of those for sale?

The US does not have a history of doing this for financial crimes.  So you're wrong, it's not surprising at all.

It is if you want someone to shut up about something.  He is under no obligation to do anything the US government says.  They've asked him to come to the US to testify and he refuses.

The polarity is not what XT delivers in terms of larger blocks.  The polarity stems from embracing a solution other than Core.  If XT gets consensus, the code base and power associated with it will shift to Michael Hern and many people do not think that is right.
  
Many people, myself included, are waiting for the Bitcoin Core solution to larger blocks.

You are wrong.  Changing 1 dollar to equal 200 cents is what we are talking about here.  Except we don't have to strike more coins with bitcoin to match the $1 = 200 cents rule.  We just move a decimal point.  Much more efficient than fiat.

I wish I knew.

There's just no evidence of it and the evidence we do have shows that Karpeles could give a fuck what the US Government says.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:45:12
So which is it, he has a gag order or he's not speaking out of fear? lmao
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:47:57
The US Government has no jurisdiction over Mark Karpeles.

More like 25 years.  The block reward will be very small by then.

No one, it is not possible that any one person could represent all possible interests in the bitcoin ecosystem.
  
Some would consider Gavin to be the voice since Satoshi handed over the keys to him, others would say it is a collection of the core devs.  I am hesitant to embrace any one person and would lean more towards someone who isn't directly involved in developing but has a good history to back them up and is generally accepted by the community, like Andreas Antonopoulos.
