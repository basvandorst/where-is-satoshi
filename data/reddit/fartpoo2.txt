Interest my ass, it was full blown horror and rejection.
Why doesn't the state of NY make its own coin, and we can see just how popular it is.

''Regulation'' is when the compliance officer can copy your business model if he so decides.

the notion of getting paid for your art is laughable. you get paid for work, period. piracy brought on an onslaught of concern about art from people that hate art, or what do you think ronald reagan was thinking of art? you think nikita kruschev was worried about art? no ofc not, only recently do they claim to be talking about art when its really about work. go back to that shithole called sothebys and long life to tpb

Whoever paid him might be dead and might not be ready to sign a transaction to show bitstamp bla bla bla. The very idea that we have to all go anal probing each other's ID on the internet just to please bitstamp's ''compliance officer'' is more orgasmic than anything the NSA could have wet dream underpant fished in its wildest dreams.

Bitstamp is getting concerned-trolled by its compliance officer-- this is the UK, why wouldn't it be worried about money leaving its overcrowded mud turd of an island?

Actually it's diluted because the poor are envious of the rich and keep getting fucked in the ass by them. So lets say they have to pay rent to some property owner, they say fuck it I'm not gonna vote for this bullshit system like a moron, I'm gonna vote socialist.

Its remarkable how coindesk disallowed comments on that turd.
Anything that prompts a state cock licker like Circle to block it, or that brings up comments like ''its like regulating email'', is a fucking disgrace.

Is that work, labor or capital?
Whatever kind of agreement you can spring up between those two to condemn filesharing, you're trying to erase the origins and nature of work. Work is a shithole inherited from that Marquis de Sade in heaven, carried out by naturalistic darwinism and extended like a plague by religious lack of ethics. You have plenty of that in other areas why would you want to extend it to cyberspace. The current place you're in right now was fostered by tenants in 17th century russia treating their serfs like shit, or english teens exported to australia in the 18th cetury for stealing an ounce of butter.
Not only is it about free speech, its about memory, access to knowledge, and having a humanity worth a damn.
Because I'm not hearing an ounce of self-criticism from you on the subject of capitalism or socialism and their ridiculous agreement on the morality of work.

The ''compliance officer'' is all out attacking an internet where you can do things like gamble or share ''copyright'' material etc etc. The divide is vast and the confrontation was bound to be inevitable.

Well there's a wolf and he's happy he controls the water supply. We don't say he's being peaceful just because he gets to shag the wolfess with the biggest tits in exchange of a portion of the water. We do however say capitalists are non-aggressive because its no longer productive to show the hardline version of the ideology, unlike in the beginning of the 20th century. Now, socialists deny they're communists, and capitalists deny they're fascists-- that way more evil shit can be done. Most of these gun-masturbating 'exceptional americans' are in Texas anyways and wouldn't hesitate to blow buildings up if their creepy architectural vision wasn't fulfilled to the letter, like in Rand's Fountainhead movie. Politest society ever existed btw was and has always been Japan...

Lol-- that ''compliance'' officer, will he accept business models like Wikileaks and the pirate bay, the whole reason why bitcoin is popular in the first place...

War happens more often with deflationary value supply than it does with inflationary value supply. Any cursory lookup of biology or history allows one to realise that fact.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:30:52
Funnily enough the only hope that bitcoiners can keep themselves Bahamas style is by following the lead of filesharers, in many ways an opposite ideology.

Value/accumulation/deflation are the same thing.
Which is why God-namedroppers like it, like aristocrats, white american militia, Louis the XIV, or Islamists.
Money makes you feel like a King, like God. You control nature or other people with it.
Wars are started to dominate the gold standard, or the oil standard, to find lebensraum. Things get chaotic and to keep everyone in line, they resort to inflation. But its still at the behest of the deflationary folk. Deflationary thought is also pretentious, it often needs a lot more resources than it has to keep the hope for a deflationary future, and to stop the place being overrun by totally obliterating inflation it has to print money to buy guards to protect its deflationary towers. Like the Cold War.
The real reason we're having this exchange, though, is because in usa the right wing has gotten so pretentious it now thinks it's more peaceful than Gandhi. There really was a thread recently in this sub with a bunch of people that thought bitcoin was peace, that it would end war. Right out of the fifth column head in his ass Alex Jones bullshit manual.

This country is a shit hole for two reasons:
1. Just sentenced Asia Bibi to death for drinking the same water as a bunch of degenerate followers of some weird paeodophile named Mohama or Mogambo or something.
2. The country's gay porn searches on the internet are off the roof way higher than midamerica bible belt, because of how the Mogamba followers persecute gays.
Mogambu followers of the Islamibooboo faith hate fiat currencies because they feel it's an insult to Mogambu  and Islamibooboo makes them feel kings of the prairie, so I'm sure bitcoin should have a good future there.

Well it keeps the masses off the grid on a communist or anarchist twist... bitcoiners would hide and get away with their capitalism under the noise of all the communist traffic.

Lol, whatever ever nonaggression principle really means is probably a franciscan harmony with nature where the franciscan assisian lives by eating the oranges that fall off the trees-- movies that show this are Roberto Rossellini's. Not Ted Nugent getting into his gas guzzling shitfest with a gun, or a bunch of karate twats getting all muscular in the gym on the premise that it's self defense.

Only in america does ''libertarian'' mean the far right. In the rest of the world it means the far left.
Socialism destroys value, and capitalism accumulates, mkay? Don't get your knickers in a twist. Value is like looking at a lion ready to eat another gazelle.
Couldn't make head nor toe of your third paragraph, you lost me at However. You complete me!
Oh I see. You seem to be thinking deflationary folk and inflationary folk are speaking to each other honestly. Fapper's tip: they're not. Someone who likes inflationary economics deep down doesn't care if the economy grows because he's angry that value is being extracted from the weaker worker by the asshole customer. While the deflationary folk don't give a rat's ass about other people, they're just bought off by capital. So they both tacitly agree to talk politely and the inflationary folk have to speak as if they care about a growing economy while the deflationary folk have to substitute their preferred words like lebensraum for growth while waxing lucid about morals.
Deflationary folk always need more guards than they can afford, otherwise they'll be overrun by the inflationary folk.
Deflationary folk also need to expand because it's grinded into them to compete and fight with each other they're so busy ''teaching a man to fish rather than giving him a fish'' that their natural progression always leads to something like tamara ecclestone and her recent daily mail ''interview'' where she milks her kid in her 70 million quid mansion.

Oh don't be such a fucking demagogue.
An atheist, a state, a god wielding, any kind of thinking brings war.
War is conquest of ambitious person, and who can be more ambitious because they think they're the shizz. And what can be more shizz than right wing concepts like accumulation (money is god) or godliness (god is god)
Just because the working classes always vote every 4 years to debase scrooge's money worth, it does not in any way shape or form stop war.
War is when you need living space to ''defend your property''. Of course property is never defined totally and is always subject to laws imposed by the winners of wars, so there's always going to be disagreements where both sides are fighting to ''defend their property''.
Debasing gold or oil stops an ambitious species from trying to wage more wars, its biology 101.
