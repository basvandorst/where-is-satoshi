Even though I might have not ever communicated with your node, I am thankful that you are able to support this project.
But really, you're completely right. Bitcoin and the community keep stating over and over again that a decentralized cryptocurrency is the future. Mining is important, but so are the nodes that are willing to stake out bandwidth and space so everyone one else can enjoy. I am sure the Bitcoin developers won't forget you guys when this project becomes more popular throughout time.
Don't know if this official, but this could help give you some Bitcoins.
Also, if you send a private message with a Bitcoin receving address, I will give you some also. 
Again, thanks. :)

Doubt that any government will suppress Bitcoin. I am thinking it will make Bitcoin even more popular and more valuable, so all the hoarders are content that the government tried to get them, but helped them instead...

I see, thank you for shaking me awake from my dream.

I only use Blockchain.info for info on transactions. Though, it's sort of awkward that they use a red button for unconfirmed transactions.... I thought you can press it and the transactions wouldn't take place...

:( I gave you some bro.
Not a whole lot, but some nonetheless.
But, really, that's a dick move. Exploiting charity for personal gain.

Thought you were disgusted because of the label. 
Thank goodness for context.

Man this is amazing! I bought $40 worth of bitcoins and now it's worth $47!
Best Christmas gift ever.

ELI5: Why does the size of blocks in the blockchain matter? Like, what would happen if the block size increased/decreased?

While this is indeed great, it sort of weird Hollywood picked up Bitcoin, but haven't tried to redesign movie distribution for the digital age. 
Considering how they complain about the revenue lost from digital movie piracy, I find it surprising Hollywood pick up Bitcoin but not services like Netflix.

I still wonder the reason why people dislike the private blockchain. ELI5 anyone? :(

Looks like a great site. Thanks!

Ah, okay. That sounds reasonable. Thanks for the explanation, drcode.

Ah, right. I meant Coinbase. Thanks for the correction and the list of sites.
