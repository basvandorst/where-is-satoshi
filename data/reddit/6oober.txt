Sounds reasonable. I think the most cost effective way for you is to set up a segwit change address for the next time you move coins.

It's only become news because the US is in the lead for currency devaluation.

Transactions per second capacity on LN will be more than the Visa network. After the opening of a LN channel, sending btc would be about as fast and as computationally demanding as sending a text-only email.
It clearly increases the value of Bitcoin, but it may not affect price or it is already reflected in the price.

The Chinese usually respond by devaluating their Yuan. The Yuan increased in value by about 7% relative to USD from last year. This is hurting both American consumers and Chinese manufacturers.

Buying only Bitcoin is a good idea.
Buying Bitcoin and Litecoin is a good idea.
I don't know which one is better.

Volume is an indicator. I wish they taught this in school.
*Edit: There is no way to be 100% certain way to answer your question without a range. I think it may even be difficult to get a meaningful answer. 24 hour volume is about $9.6 billion, I'll guess that the money floating around btc is greater than that, but some whales trading back and forth could mean less than $9.6 bn is "floating around".
I'm sure there is less than btc market cap floating around because I lost some btc in a wallet once.

No, it makes me want to fuck people out of their Bitcoin.
-do cocaine
-fuck hookers
-fly a helicopter
-throw fun coupons
-try quaaludes

I'm pretty sure you could do it and claim the fees too.

Algo switch. Possible, yes. Probable, no.
Reversible transactions, no.

Paper wallets seem like they are one time use things and you have to boot it from an offline machine anyways. or am I missing something?

We know. I feel that this feature could've should've been implemented a long time ago, but Samourai Wallet, from what I can tell, is the first Android wallet to do batching. It's best to stay positive when there is progress.

bitcoin actually does produce "things" that would be counted in as GDP, in the USA. Speculative value.

I don't understand all this fud about LN centralization. There's going to be some nodes with tons of channels open. That does not mean control over the network is centralized. LN is trustless and permissionless. As the network grows, everyone with an internet connection and Bitcoin will have access.

The android is a stock LG distro. I meant to ask which one is a more secure hot wallet. Both are used for surfing the web and other such things. Is it the norm for people to have dedicated bitcoin devices?
