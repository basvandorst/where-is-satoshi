Depends on how wealthy you are. If you've got a spare ten million lying around, and are like, "hm, this seems interesting and potentially promising; I guess I'll invest one thousanth of my wealth and hope I get lucky," that seems reasonable to me.

"Oh, did we say three *billion?* What we *meant* to say was *zero.* Sorry for that minor miscommunication."
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:54
So you came to this subreddit just to say that? That's quite nice of you, mate.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:49:35
That's kinda ridiculous advice, given that you don't know how much Bitcoin he has.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:03:07
You should see some sort of "Backup" option in your Settings for the wallet. If not, try Googling how to backup your wallet with a pass phrase, for the specific wallet you're using.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:14
You can view your passcode from your wallet at any time.
If you lost *both* your wallet *and* your pass phrase, then you're out of luck.

Someone should've told Barack Obama.

Does it really drive the price that far down, though? I mean, you can't short anything unless someone else is willing to essentially take you up on the bet, right? So doesn't it mostly even out?
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:19:52
Doesn't this need to be fixed, then? Bitcoin can't become a universal currency until everyone is able to safely use it.

IANAA, but I'm pretty sure that if you have &gt;$20,000 worth of ground beef, in industrial freezers capable of holding &gt;$20,000 worth of ground beef, you do indeed have to declare that.

Yeah, watch the Project Veritas video on Google (you might need to use a different search provider to find it). Regardless of what you think about Trump, or social justice, the very fact that they're doing *absurdly* dystopian shit to enforce their beliefs is scary as fuck.

I wasn't even aware there was $3,500 of DogeCoin *in existence.*
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:30:23
But, they're the *same* investor?
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:46:16
Come on, a fucking grade-schooler can troll harder than that.

Yet another reason I'm glad I bought a Trezor...

If you bought $1,000,000 in BitCoin at $1, hodled, and this happened, you'd literally be a *trillionaire.*

At the same time, I would recommend you do *not* short gold, because:
1. There's no guarantee NASA will pull it off, and
2. Other people are aware of this possibility, so you wouldn't multiply your money as much as you should for such a gamble.

The bad need is that this means Western Union and MoneyGram are gonna be ~~bribing~~ lobbying Congress like crazy to make Bitcoin illegal.

I mean, people pay $2 to withdraw $20 from an ATM. Not saying that's smart, either, but people do it.
@_date: 2019-06-10 05:51:37
Potentially? Yes.
*Likely?* No. If it was likely, then they wouldn't be selling for less than five figures right now.
(A lot of people on this subreddit will say I'm wrong, and they'll point to the fact that Bitcoins were once worth mere cents, and now they're thousands of dollars. But that's a post-hoc observation. It wasn't likely for Bitcoin to get to this point, either. The fact that an unlikely outcome occurred doesn't change the fact that it was unlikely.)

Can't he turn to the left and put both his legs out? It looks like he had room to do that. And then he'd just have to stand up.

And the fine will probably be 20% of what they laundered, so their punishment will be keeping a mere 80% of their profits.

That's about a tenth of the price of a Bugatti Veyron. Not bad.

Is he better at designing things when being locked in rooms?
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:32:17
Depends. If he spent &lt;5% of his Bitcoin on a Porsche, I'd say that still qualifies as hodling.
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:37:08
And they'd be right.
Does Bitcoin have the *potential* to become a global currency, accepted everywhere in the world? Yes. But it certainly isn't one *right now.*

Not sure if that was the point he was trying to make, but it's a valid one.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:50:02
Yeah, whereas nobody would expect that he might have a lot of money if he opted to put a standard, randomized license plate on his new BMW.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:50:28
Yeah, this problem is totally exclusive to cryptocurrencies. It's not like anybody has ever stolen dollars or euros.

If a subreddit is shitty, wouldn't the better solution be for the subreddit to improve, instead of everyone leaving?

Glad to see Bloomberg found a completely impartial source, that has unquestionably conducted perfectly unbiased research, without any possible conflict of interest whatsoever.
Journalism at its finest. A pinnacle of integrity all publications should aspire to emulate.

No shit? If one currency drops to 1/3rd its value, and the other drops to 1/100th of its value, the former retained more of its value.
