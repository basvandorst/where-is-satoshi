I stand corrected then, but my original post is asking if, theoretically, this method would be the same as compound interest.

Understandable. I have most of my portfolio in long term holds so I got rekt this past month. But what I'm doing with this 3% rule is just strictly growing BTC exponentially over time regardless of what alts I use to make the 3% return and reinvest.

I guess everything is a risk, but I would hope ADA and XLM would bounce back seeing they're strong projects.

Totally agree. The thought here is to strictly accumulate BTC over time. I'm just trying it out in a systematic way, just starting with a couple hundred dollars. Trust me, I'm no day trader. I just came across this method on YouTube.

The thought is that I always have my initial investment spread across 4-5 alts. I try catch them on the upswing, obviously. Some sell right away and then I immediately reinvest 100% of it. Some take longer than others. I'm actually trapped in a couple right now, but they are solid so they'll bounce back eventually. By doing it like this, I'm reinvesting a couple per day.

Thank you. I'm sorry.. could you clarify. For example does that mean:  .00000625 Sats divided by 1+3% multiplied by 1 year?
If I buy at .00000625 Sats and sell at 3% and the reinvest that total amount and repeat.
Similar to a compound interest calculator but would like to plug in Satoshis instead of dollars.

Oh I'm not saying that. 99% of my crypto is long term hold. I agree with you there. I started with a couple hundred dollars and spread it out over 4-5 alts to make 3% on each and then reinvest that total amount and repeat; always across 4-5 alts. The alts I choose are ones that are trading at high volume at the time of purchase. This method is just to strictly accumulate BTC slowly but surely. Basically I'm just playing with a couple bucks to see what I can turn it into while following a 3% rule increase.

So if I started with .00250000 BTC, then using a compound interest calculator I would plug in $250,000 as the initial investment at 3% daily for example and move the decimal back 8 places after the calculation? Thanks again.

I'm not sure I follow. I started with a couple hundred dollars and am not adding any new money. The alts that I'm trading are irrelevant as long as I'm making 3% and then reinvesting with the end game of just accumulating BTC. I could be wrong, but would it not compound over time?

I'm wondering what the optimal settings are for the Pivot Reversal Strategy.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:37:08
My thought is I want to accumulate BTC and not worry about the dollar amount since it fluctuates. Essentially I'm looking for a formula that I can calculate compounding Satoshis.

���� I'm trying man! Just giving it a test run. I've doubled my BTC so far. It will be a long process, but I got nothing but time.
