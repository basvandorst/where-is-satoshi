is this the new updated version? Going to greece on holiday soon and will leave some flyers around!
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:29:52
correct, thanks :)
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:31:31
takeaway.co.uk also down :(((((

Localbitcoins.com is no problem for 5k ish and also the easiest. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 10:42:39
all these bitpay cam sites are scam. 
Send the BTC directly to the performer. They can use them directly to buy drugs anyway. Most of them just don't know it and are to stupid to put 5 min research into it. I know some camgirls, but when I try to talk to them about Bitcoin they tell me they are too drugged up for serious talk. Every time. 
So my suggestion is to go to the girlsgonebitcoin section here on reddit.
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:15:47
how can this only have 67% upvotes? There is clear evidence. Did other people here try to send more than 3k? I'm not in the US but am scared to ever use coinbase now and will warn all my American friends I guess.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:14:54
Yeah, it's really unfair. 350£ here without xbox live. I want that deal too! 
@_date: 2014-06-21 09:19:20
This guy has no idea what he is talking about. How would you regulate Bitcoin? It's already regulated by the miners and the protocol, isn't it? He talks like he is the first one coming up with the idea but has no solution how he wants to regulate it. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:32:38
research a bit about him. His whole life is leading towards Bitcoin. Here is an interesting watch  
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:00:52
That must be satishi. He didn't release bitcoin until 2009 because data storage might have become a problem. Also bandwidth in case the system grows. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:51:19
How about altcoins? Doge is cheaper. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 10:55:55
Es gibt ein deutschsprachiges subreddit fuer Bitcoin. r/bitcoinDE
Dort habe ich auch schon einen aehnlichen Artikel mit dem gleichen Buchauthor gesehen.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:51:42
I like mycelium better too. The only advantage of the blockchain wallet is that you can change the miner fee. Also the QR reader in the blockchain app is not working too good. I usually have to scan a couple of times. In the same conditions mycelium works fine.

Aren't Australian company's scared of the double tax atm?

Not "Next we need Amazon", it should be "we need the next Amazon" which should be overstock!
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:21:38
Bad timing. Price will rise 10% today. Maybe more. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:31:21
Mmd! Where can I buy this in black? 
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:22:32
transaction fee: 5,99? seems like they don't want customers to pay with Bitcoin... they should give discount instead!
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:59:52
Why don't you guys accept the payments directly in bitcoin? That would be much easier and you save the 5% fees! 
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:50:35
The very first week was much higher in sales. Since then is what he is talking about.
@_date: 2014-12-26 15:01:57
What do you want to know? It's a American Football and the commentators are talking about bitcoin afaik. What do you want to know about tipping? You can read about it on changetip.com. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:48:22
The market will regulate itself with the rating system. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 04:30:36
Yes, probably for 55 years or so. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 04:54:34
haha, I wrote them a mail yesterday too when I did the ALS challenge. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 06:09:35
Nice to hear! Good luck! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:22:24
WOW! This is huge! I hope it comes for euro customers, too. I'm still waiting to book my holiday on expedia :( 
@_date: 2014-05-26 23:18:07
Do I understand this right? You give 20% discount on Bitcoin payments? Permanently?
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:55:29
Haha 1000 bits 
@_date: 2014-09-26 11:33:28
It's not used a lot. These guys just didn't make any trades yet. Noone really has more than 2-3 stars. I would use them.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:45:31
Imo not gonna happen. Hdd size is growing quicker than blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:39:35
It's easier with browsing and Hd streaming imo

Spend them somewhere else. Or buy vouchers from gyft, you even get cashback. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:06:38
It's normal. If you write them in Russian you will get a reply within a day. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:28:57
Ask when you enter that you want to pay with bitcoin. Half of the time the staff is not educated and you have to use fiat. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:42:44
How do you know? 
@_date: 2014-10-25 10:56:34
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:10:12
TL;DR he payed for a class in BTC, canceled it and didn't get a refund. It was not mentioned to him that the transaction would be non refundable and he never signed anything.
@_date: 2014-02-23 03:08:12
found :) 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:50:46
incredible, please show some proof. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:12:08
Is easyhotel connected to easyJet? 
@_date: 2014-07-10 09:23:04
if you try to use places on coinmap... call them ahead to find out if they still exist and still take Bitcoin to save some disappointment. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:32:51
I think that place is no longer in business. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:20:24
Had the same mail and my auction was cancelled. I was selling a phone and mentioned that I would accept Bitcoin -5% of the auction price as payment method. I'm not using ebay any more since.
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:30:54
what's his email or business? With sharing info you have some hope or at least warn others from this person.
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:59:32
Yeah they are cool. Definitely worth a watch. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:22:01
incredible, to your son as well from me, $2 @_date: 2014-09-26 11:20:00
Localbitcoins, mycelium local trader or Bitcoin ATMs are alternatives for small amounts. Depends on a couple of factors what is the best way to do it for you. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:19:00
NXT too? Really? Why is there so much hype then? I should try to understand these things better but have no time to research it :(
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:53:01
Give the savings to the customer. 3% discount when using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 05:17:28
I disagree for now. People are used to central authorities, it's hard to understand the concept of decentralization at first. I think they are doing the right thing here. In the long run I agree, in a couple of years they will hopefully be irrelevant or at least fully transparent.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:13:06
this makes so much sense. Thanks for the report!
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:33:45
What are you talking about? Are you saying you don't understand why bitcoin is cheaper than credit cards? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:08:54


As a pro gambler I can tell you it's more of a myth. I have lost money to regulated sites 3 times in 8 years. Never had any problem with unregulated sites. Didn't use too many but they seem to care even more for their customers from my experience. Just do some research before you cashin.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:00:33
I got my Bitcoins from sealswithclubs.eu (Bitcoin Poker)
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:47:37
They have these mycash cards. Hard to scam with them imo as they are like vouchers? 
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:55:31
is this similar to the mycelium app? 
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:14:41
I ignore it... I'm too lazy to record such things... The blockchain records it for me anyway for my frequently used wallets. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:55:28
Have 1000 bits 
@_date: 2015-05-05 03:50:07
no! It's voucher cards that you load directly into your account. So the money goes straight to your account, not from another account.

At least we will have clarity now if the theory is correct. Seems to me like we lost 4 of the smartest people on earth in one car crash.

how did this end up?
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:53:30
I hope that was a 2011 or 2012 yearbook :)

nice, I see this van sometimes. I'll post a pic of it next time I see it, too! It's always parked at the electric vehicles spaces.

Trade with someone who has a green button and good reputation. Usually takes 5 min for me. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:21:03
I tried to use it twice in the Brighton store. Ended up with having technical problems ect. both times after they tried for 5-10 mins each.

I heard it's probably a guy who had his walls untouched during the last two bubbles already? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:51:11
I got money back from them when my cc was abused for about 3k$. Using them since 2007. I have to admit that I prefer skrill in recent years, especially because Neteller never had 2 factor authentication. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:24:35
Sorry to hear your boss is an idiot. You handle it well. You seem smart so you won't have a problem finding another job. Good luck! have 1$ @_date: 2015-04-21 12:27:29
I was asking here specifically because there were several blockchain.info hacks that were connected to Teamviewer.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:23:47
I know, but I have a cores from a couple of altcoins running on my computer and don't know how to store these offline :( 
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:15:33
Yes and that's what I'm scared about. I have bitcoin core on the machine as well. Not encrypted. That's why I'm wondering if uninstalling is enough.
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:35:52
disgusting. Will this be a similar case to Charlie Schrem? I hope not. Such a waste of taxpayer money. And the judges will probably be as qualified as the silk road process ones...
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:00:03
what, free bitcoins? I will forward them :)
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:42:47
What if shops offer discounts for bitcoin payments? I would prefer it over cards/fiat then, too. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:52:44
looks nice, but no video there seem to have more than 10 views :( i'll keep an eye on their development. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:53:23
oh yeah, even made it to the front page already :) 
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:22:27

Lol right both stupid things I said. No idea why I wrote such BS tonight. ISO higher. Usually I don't suck at photography... 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:48:09
what do you mean?
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:19:12
Maybe there is someone who has a backup of the database?
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:35:06
nice. More and more products I use accept bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:24:26
they are offline for 2 years. But they say they are working on coinpunk 2.0 as soon as they have time. So maybe the bitcoin arent lost after all?
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:03:13
GOGOGO swc poker, best poker site!!! your background is too bright, that's why your face is so dark. You have to set the ISO of your camera lower or put a ND filter over the lens.
