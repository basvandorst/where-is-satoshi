He attempted to have people murdered, he is now going to jail. I only feel a little bit sorry for him because his defense attorney seemed to be pretty incompetent.

Honestly, I don't understand why his nginx config wasn't a main part of his defense. His nginx server only accepted connections from the tor server, so the cop's "we found the server by the catchpa" is complete BS. There is no way that server would allow anything other than his other server to connect to it.

I must be missing something, because the whole point of Tor is so that people can't pin what comes out of an exit node to you.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:04:40
It's per line. However when you get throttled it's down to 2G, not 3G. However you can bump lines up to a 2.5gb cap for just $10 more per line that you want to raise the cap on or $20 per line for unlimited 4G. Overall much cheaper than any other carrier and a great option assuming you live within their coverage area.
You can easily estimate your cost here:

Paper wallets are the best for long term storage. Make multiple copies, keep one in a safe at home, one in a safety deposit box, something like that.
As far as backing up in more than one location I assume you mean a digital copy. For that I'd recommend putting an ENCRYPTED copy of your wallet in a cloud storage solution such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft Skydrive. A reliable service that you know will be around for the forseeable future. Your wallet will never be lost this way even if your house catches on fire and you lose every computer in your house.

1. (21000000 / 0,00000001) = 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis which is divisible enough for the forseeable future. And because it's software, if in the future that isn't enough the bitcoin protocol could be updated to divide a bitcoin even more.
2. People will pay because it's easier and/or cheaper than other methods such as bank transfers. Not to mention you simply need things such as food and housing. You can't buy nothing forever.
3. How do you define "lost coins"? Coins that haven't moved in X amount of time? How do you know that people haven't just put them into storage?

2. They use their wallet software to generate a new address to receive the payment.
3. They send you the address and the amount of BTC owed. 
4. You send the correct amount of BTC.
5. They verify they have received the BTC and send you the painting.

That uses Google Cloud Messaging and requires a phone number as your identity. [ChatSecure]( is a drop-in iOS app compatible with the Tor Messenger because it does the exact same thing: XMPP+OTR over Tor.

@_date: 2015-10-30 07:36:32
I can appreciate that they're trying to bring it to the masses but this still has the metadata leaks that XMPP does. [Ricochet]( is a bit more interesting and there's [Pond]( for asynchronous encrypted messaging.

In the United States any asset the government *thinks* was gained via crime can be seized without any sort of proof or trial; they don't even need to arrest anyone. The burden is upon the accused to prove it was gained through legal means (aka: Guilty until proven innocent). 
It's called civil forfeiture, and [it is totally fucked]( It encourages police to go after criminals that will net them the most cash rather than the ones doing the most harm to the community.

You don't have to allow auto updates on anything on android.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:06:23


The author clearly hasn't dug into this subject very much.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:44:54
I'd suggest staying away from btc-e unless completely necessary.
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:14:31
You will get screwed by carders.
@_date: 2013-04-29 11:30:55
Android malware is rampant, especially among people who pirate apps. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:52:58
When you use it it's decrypted.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:20:50
Its disabled by default and is controlled per-app. If a new version of an app needs more permissions it has to be manually updated too.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:44:22
Its been about a week and a half, pretty unprofessional to not get back to me in that time frame even if just to say "We don't have the specifics on that yet"
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:41:23
How would this work with SR's tumbler? As soon as coins were depsoited they started getting moved around to different addresses. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:41:03
No. This malware encrypts images, movies, word files, PDFs, and other files that people want back either for business or sentimental reasons. Windows system restore points don't include personal user data like that, only changes made to the operating system itself.
This is why all important data should be backed up to a 3rd party location, or at least a dedicated backup box on your home network.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:29:13
Just because they can send data to your device doesn't mean they can automatically get remote code execution and root it. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:30:23
Care to expand on the current problems with the protocol? I'm unaware.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:38:54
If anyone here has ever had a tracked piece of mail lost, please post here. I have never had this happen or know anyone who has.
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:39:50
As much as I'd like to agree with them, they're wrong. Sure, low-level people vend on SR but who do you think they buy from? Organized crime.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:04:06
Should have been more clear, sorry. If I understand his concept correctly he's suggesting everyone should have access to everyone's data as it passes through the internet in order to filter out immoral things.
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:08:32
I like this idea. It would probably be funded almost entirely by donations though.
@_date: 2013-10-19 07:30:07
The host can see anything the guest does, encrypted or not.
@_date: 2013-04-22 06:25:40
Totally understand, don't expect you to. I appreciate the service anyway! Bitcoinity is my favorite graph. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 02:11:35
They exist, but they're few and far between.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:12:54
You just went full retard.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:15:23
It is using Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:06:45
No, it doesn't. You can send transactions with no fee whatsoever, it will just take longer to get processed.
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:01:21
Made me laugh in class haha
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:23:32
People who steal credit card info will use it to buy bitcoins from  you and by the time the actual owner of the card sees their statement you will have already sent the BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:26:11
Easily faked.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:55:33
According to bitcoincharts we're only at 91.946THash/s right now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:46:07
It should be merged into the Bitcoin protocol as it offers real anonymity instead of just pseudoanonymity.
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:05:11


Also typically you just link to the article.
@_date: 2013-04-22 06:03:30
I can understand why someone would DDoS an exchange, but why bitcoinity?
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:47:45
I would assume he deposited the cash in his bank account and the serial numbers on the cash matched some from a back theft.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:28:01
But without using a computer/smartphone you wouldn't be able to verify that the private key on the piece of paper that was just handed to you actually has the btc at all.
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:40:05
No real reason, just much more convenient to access that my local wallet. Plus I can use my phone to pay if I ever find some store that accepts BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:49:14
How is it not free?
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:36:32
If you want 75%+ nothing will ever happen in legislature.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:06:40
Advantages over blockchain?
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:01:01
That's SR's coin tumbler in action. Your balance in your SR account should reflect the deposit soon enough. I don't use SR though so I really can't say how long it takes on average.
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:32:05
Oh it does, credit card fraud is a $190B/yr industry. However, companies selling physical goods can verify that the shipping address matches the one that is on-file with the issuing bank. Most payment gateways that accept credit cards have some way of freezing accounts or reversing transactions in case of fraud but that's impossible with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:15:13
Would be better to have a smartphone so you can see that coins were actually sent, but yes.
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:54:02
Err, what? BMR was the first SR clone and has been around MUCH longer than any of the others.
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:29:13
ZeroCoin to the rescue!
@_date: 2013-05-21 03:18:53
Sell 50 for cash, give away 25 to raise awareness, hoard the other 25.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:53:24
And all they want from me is my name, address, DOB, and phone number!
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:32:00
I despise the Keep Calm and X thing so... no.
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:51:00
It's a 2% fee.
@_date: 2013-04-29 11:36:56
Well written malware doesn't log your keystrokes, it hooks the functions within your browser so whenever you submit data it just steals it. This also has the advantage of being able to inject fake form elements (such as asking for your SSN or whatever) to gather even more data.
@_date: 2013-07-25 06:53:13
This project is completely independent from pidgin.
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:07:48
The host can access every part of the guest, memory included.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:12:29
I think the Zerocoin block chain (a current WIP) will be important as the test bed for the Zerocoin protocol, so that if a flaw is found it won't damage the Bitcoin network. Once tested thoroughly Bitcoin will probably adopt the protocol.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:04:26
If it goes down for whatever reason you're without your coin.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:51:47
If you login to your account on Slush it should list how many shares you have submitted and your balance in BTC. From there you can send your bitcoins to another address, but a lot of pools have a minimum amount needed to withdraw.
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:00:18


Uh, what?
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:15:59
ALL OF THEM

Nothing is worse than a comedian who laughs at virtually 100% of his own jokes.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:37:48
Why? The person clearly wants their data back since they're willing to pay over $300 for it, why would you deny them access to it?
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:53:06
He could have sent it from another client, he's just showing the transcaction on blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:33:31
So. Fucking. Awesome.
@_date: 2013-05-18 13:50:56
Regardless, it drives me crazy.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:36:19
Can always send it with tracking for a few extra bucks.

LTC because Scrypt and faster confirmations.
