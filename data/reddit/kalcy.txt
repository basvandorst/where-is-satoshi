[its happening](
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:49:49
back in 2011 thats like saying "I have this money exclusively for drugs"
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:07:14
so what you're doing then is textbook gambling? if you have no idea what the price will be and have no entrance or exit strategy besides "Buy Low Sell High", you're setting yourself up for failure.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:17:10
its much better to buy high and sell higher, than to miss your opportunity to buy or to follow the downward trend all the way out. he has no entry plan and no exit plan. its just poor investing.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:57:29
his logic seems to be "ill make more when it drops lower, because it will rebound so high", this is very stupid, because it can either not get down to a target price, or it can drop below his target price after he buys. its like buying Enron, at 50, saying WOW, such good deal, then it going down to 25, buying again, saying WOW, even better deal, and having it drop down again. its just not a good strategy.

yes, the TSA performs a lobatamy in this case.

yeah, ive never had paypal take more than 24 hours. this guy is just trying to glorify bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-07 09:31:46
new paypal account
@_date: 2015-04-07 11:06:04
eh, i dont like using btc as a currency yet. stability is shit, and I have to buy it with USD, and at exactly 100% of the places i shop at i have to use USD, except while in Sweden, which i have to use SEK, I have not run into any place in the greater stockholm area that accepts BTC yet.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:56:28
oh my god youre right I didnt even notice that mistake until now.
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:05:47
också nej
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:03:31
run the downvote train on my ass! i enjoy it fuckers.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:04:03
you might be able to buy stuff with it but that is not an exhaustive trait of a currency.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:58:05
why? everyone knows that bitcoin is just an investment vessel at the moment. its not a real currency.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:30:42
and pam!
@_date: 2013-05-12 14:44:58
gooby pls
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:06:04
So it's like driving A car while looking in the rear view mirror..... 
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:41:18
I'd do it if it weren't so expensive.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:17:07
wait... BFL does shady shit? hm. weird.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:49:44
Heh, beat me to it
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:42:03
Obviously if you use an exchange
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:09:44
are you fucking sorry?
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:33:59
about $30k a month worth of obnoxiously loud "who gives a fuck"?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:42:38
BTC isnt a stock, its a currency. If we treat it like a stock, it will never be stable enough and get the backing it needs to be taken seriously everywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:11:17
Honestly, that's tin foil hat level paranoia, paying for any kind of flight training is very not anonymous, the only reason to do it in btc would be because you had them laying around anyway
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:11:18
"Digital currencies are a threat to current financial systems" . GOOD, FUCK YOU
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:41:48
Who really didn't think this was happening? bitcoin is the perfect platform for laundering
@_date: 2013-05-12 06:01:27
what would we do on this meetup?
