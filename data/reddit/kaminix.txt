This is me right now, but in a totally different sense. :P Friend told me to get onboard when they were around $15 each but it was too expensive and troublesome (mostly the troublesome-part I think) to actually get hands on.
And I was THIS close to buying a few just a week or so ago.
Well, it's decided anyway. Making a major bitcoin investment as soon as I can afford it. I wouldn't want to be without them when some large western company like Google starts accepting them...

Really? Does that go for relatively small amounts of just a few hundred USD as well?
I've never exchanged currencies other than for travel etc, how is it different when you do it for profit?

I asked because it's obvious it shouldn't work. Thought that much should've been very obvious...

Hey, you never know... Maybe lots of people in my vegan cooking group are interested in 30k euro loans from Facebook strangers.... (one of the most recurring spams I encounter)

We'll have to buy soon. We can still be millionaires. :-) Most people still don't have a clue about Bitcoin. Just imagine the value increase when mainstream stores start accepting them... this is just the beginning. Someone else said most people won't be able to afford an entire Bitcoin in the future and while it sounds a bit surreal, I think it's right. 21 million bitcoins in total, worldwide currency? That's going to be some very expensive coins...

lol, I noticed it was a comma. But I didn't realize it wasn't a decimal comma (that part of the world...) until you said it now. :P

What's the point of encrypting it if you're keeping copies of your unencrypted wallets anyway?
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:44:53
LOTS. Especially in large groups.

Oh. Sorry, misread...
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:08:56
Perhaps the risk of losing ones password? But I agree, encryption all the way.

From what I understand, they have pretty good access to computers and Internet connections. While at the same time, as jdeath says, it's full of poor people.
IIRC, the government has spent very large amounts on digitalizing the country. A smart move.

Interesting! So it's a china specific problem then? I was thinking since I still need to convert USD/EUR to my native currency it wouldn't matter all that much. But if it's a problem strictly with yuan I can see how it could get messy.
