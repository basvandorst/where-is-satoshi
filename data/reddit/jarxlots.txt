I was aware of hard work, at that point. But it wasn't "hard work" until I was 14, the lowest legal age I could work at. I've worked since then (2 decades) 


What are you talking about? I had 80% of my college tuition paid via grants and scholarships. I worked full time all through college so I could move out, and still survive, at 18. At 19 I was already working in my field, at an ISP. I have $0 debt, currently, and my own business.


I believe it's "feel the Bern" and no, I know better than to think voting changes anything in the US, at the federal level.
You know what they say about assumptions, don't you?
Just because my situation is different than the majority, doesn't mean I don't understand what they're going through.

It can be difficult to learn about hard work when your education system does everything it can to keep you a child as long as possible. Then you enter a highly competitive market place without a proper understanding of reality, usually saddled with debt because you believed the lies about college. Now you need a job but you have no experience, you act like a child, and you are in debt.
TL;DR Hard to learn what "hard work" means when you can't find a job.
