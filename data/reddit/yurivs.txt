Muhammad already has a lot of oil. He better stay away from Bitcoin.

Yes, using it to buy things and to pay for services. Speculators are treasure hunters... They use Bitcoin and then exchange it for dollars... Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, but as money, it should be an end (money par excellence), not a means to profit in another currency. (Sorry for my bad english...)
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:54:33
If they canceled the purchase because there was a difference between the amount expressed in dollars and the amount expressed in bitcoins, then they do not trust in Bitcoin. I usually buy at Fasttech and pay for my cell phone at Bitrefill and I've never had this problem.

lol... 
Well, actually, I'm relaxed now. The shitcoins have become the carrion of speculators...

Sometimes I ask myself the same question...

My dad is 80 years old and he holds bitcoins since april 2016.

I saw it. :^)
And I payed this guy:

So... Bran Stark is Andreas Antonopoulos, Joffrey Baratheon is Roger Ver and we are Hod(l)or.

Let's test then... Could anyone send 0.00002 tBTC ($0.32 tUSD) to my Lightning Payment Request below?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:29:39
Done. :-)

"The Bitcoin Group on the possible Fork, smashing BTU into pieces with humble arguments" 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:31:14
I agree with that. I've already sold all my BCCs.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:44:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:35:23
You mean "bribes", right? He is not a muslim. :^)
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:29:39
No, because an incentive is a value you receive after striving and a bribe is something you get before any effort. Moreover, in the case of a company, when it receives an investment, it only occurs because the company proved, through hard work, that is capable of achieving greater goals.

There was a Brazilian writer (Millôr Fernandes) who told the following story: a man was lost in the desert accompanied only by his dog. After a few days, hungry and thirsty, he killed the dog and ate it. When he was gnawing at the dog's bones, he was moved and began to cry, saying, "Poor Toto! He would like to gnaw on those little bones!" Moral of the story: "The awakening of beautiful feelings once satisfied basic needs." In my country, Bitcoin helps meet basic needs. And then we can kiss the girls and enjoy nature in peace, without feeling hungry.

Sugar is a drug. It's the first drug in the Drug Dictionary I have in my library. And wheat has the same effect as a weak opioid. (Well, I had a botany teacher who, upon being asked about overdose, replied that even the water kills by overdose: "Do you think drowning is what?")
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:45:40
Indeed... :-)
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:31:14
Sorry... "Roger".
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:57:23
Go back to Bitcoin, you shitcoin fools!
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:46:15
Opa! É pra já. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:01:03
We can't eat or consume bitcoins. We will invest bitcoins in companies. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:40:37
BCC... Do they also accept BitConnect or Bcash? lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:45:55
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:36:44
Well... someday we will buy stocks with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:02:00
Sim! Em bitcoins. Mas tenho de resolver uma questão antes com a editora. Coisas do departamento jurídico: eu não sabia, mas talvez eu não possa traduzir apenas uma parte do livro. Estou aguardando a resposta.

At this moment, Bitcoin's market capitalization is US$ 59 billion and not US$ 4 billion. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:41:35
Yes, it's real.

In June, there was a purchase of real estate with bitcoins in Brazil. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:49:15
Next time, let us know in advance when you will buy or sell.

In my opinion, I believe this would only cause confusion. It would be much easier to use, once and for all, "satoshis". You, who grew up in developed countries, seem to be afraid of big numbers. In Brazil, in the 1980s, we already had chewing gum that cost 100 cruzeiros and bicycles that cost 1,000,000. For me, it would be normal to pay 605,980 satoshis for an electronic cigarette.

Another point that I found interesting: the short sellers can act as destroyers of fraudulent companies. Are they doing the same thing to shitcoins?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:01:23
Don't forget, guys: George Soros has Itaú -- "the biggest bank in Brazil" -- in his hands: 
There is another interesting detail: I had an Itaú account and the bank did not allow the transfer to bitcoin exchanges.
