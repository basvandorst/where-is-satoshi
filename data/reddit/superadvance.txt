I'll be there tomorrow. Maybe the owner will bring the car for the monthly car meet.

Ha 340? Try 355 over here.

At least that purchase was only a partial coin. But I do also have btc purchased at 17-19k so rip for now.

Yikes..... Got me beat.

Yea I mean I do get where you're coming from, especially since it's not like the photo proves anything or directly connects any form to another.

So your bank doesn't have your social security number? Because that sure is a form of verification, much more than just uploading a photo of an ID.

Use a 3d printer?

If you've had it less than a year, it's short term capital gains, if you've had it longer than a year then it would be long term capital gains. I'd sell on gdax or coinbase.

This morning. It's moving quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:54:13
Gdax is owned by coinbase.

You would only pay taxes once you sell it back for usd. And if he has had it that long he would only pay long term capital gains. He would keep the majority even after taxes, it would be absolutely ridiculous to just get rid of it because you might pay some taxes. Also there would be no need to sell it all off at once anyways therefore he wouldn't even pay all the taxes at once.

Sure you can make tons doing this, but with no technical analysis skills or knowledge you're more than likely going to lose more than you gain. Learn and read, maybe someday attempt it. Maybe even practice on stocks first which move slower than btc has as of late, try small amount on something like eth or ltc to get a feel for it. But definitely still wouldn't just jump in with no knowledge or practice.

Correct capital gains are not the same as income tax, you are taxed for both separately at different rates.

Actually the captcha's have to do with the underlying advertisement. Never heard of anyone using it to hack, but then again I wouldn't be surprised since the majority of faucet users are from Russia.

I agree, it does make you reconsider the motives of the sites/owners
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:54
Interesting. I would assume they would be possibly assuming your email password is the same as the password for their own website, and the captcha is just used because they are logging in from a new location.

Sigh just wrote an entire college paper based around bitcoin as an investment and never saw your article... Could have really benefited from your work...
