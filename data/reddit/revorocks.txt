I don't get this viewpoint. The dollar has not suddenly dropped in buying power. You can still buy the same amount of stuff with it as you could 6 months ago. Yes they are inflating it but not at the rate you're implying.
BTC has just become valued much much higher lately....

Been waiting all day trying to sell some of mine during this madness...

Pretty sure when your boss sees the actual power usage of your new miner they will end up changing their mind, by the point your miner or miners will have lost their value and you won’t have recuperated enough to cover their cost. 
I don’t think it’s wise going down this route, you would be better off just buying the crypto you want.

Yes 1 machine can but you need quite a few to actually make some decent money off of it. 
Honestly if you aren’t fully serious about mining, don’t bother. It isn’t for everyone. It is very competitive, requires constantly upgrading hardware to be able to mine at a decent rate due to difficulty adjustment, is very noisy and requires tinkering of settings if you want to get the maximum profitability 
If you want to go for it then go for it but I have a strong feeling you’ll be back in 6 months saying it was a waste of money lol

Have a look on the royal mint bullion. It's official royal mint so top service and legit obviously

You have to bare in mind how the global money supply is always inflating though, so what is unimaginable today will not be so in the future.
$1m per btc may also be at a time when all goods cost 4x what they do today, so would technically be equivalent to $250k per btc today.

11k now, that didn’t take long

If they detect this even if you send it to a bunch of different wallets, that means they penalise you for what others have done with your coins. 
If you buy a coin that has been owned at some point by someone that uses gambling sites then you still have this problem. That is completely ridiculous. It’s like not allowing someone to use cash that was previously owned by someone who used it to buy drugs...

What you are saying already exists though. That’s just what buying shares is. 
A loan is also when someone needs to borrow money. Be it to buy a house, a car, overdraft, or to start a business. You can’t give them a share of the car they want to buy... it’s not exactly going to make them a profit is it. 
A loan gives people access to stuff they cannot afford and does enhance economic expansion in the short term. However long term yes it does cause interest to pile up and is why you get boom and bust cycles

Held its value over the past 2000 years tho so pretty good store... at least until asteroid mining becomes a thing

Yeah but just because bitcoin exists doesn’t make gold useless now. You can have both exist together and serve different purposes each with their own advantages. 
I support bitcoin and crypto in general but it doesn’t have to be them vs gold. They can exist together

Honestly what is with these posts.
I am sorry but a few days of trend differences and 3 lines drawn over the top of coincapp line charts is not worth posting. 
This subreddit a few years ago used to have some good insight, good articles and discussion posted where as now it's just flooded with stuff like this. It's a shame...
Bitcointalk is the same now too..

If you were a creditor and you didn’t earn interest on your money, why would you bother lending? You assume all the risk for no reward. The reward is the interest you get. The problem is yeah the moment interest is added, there is instantly more debt than there is currency. Only way to remove it is to inflate the currency which lowers purchasing power.
