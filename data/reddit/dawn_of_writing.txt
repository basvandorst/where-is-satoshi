So,  I've been wondering.  With all the early adopters potentially and some literally millionaires and billionaires 5 years from today,  there's going to be a ton of them with so much money... won't that itself potentially hurt the economy and increase class divide?
 I'm a believer in crypto and wish I had prioritized more time last  year to research on how to get in  but I'm ok with getting in this week

Makes sense. 
What about price of good and services going up on line with bitcoin, and those without bitcoin gets left behind,  making them power, could something like that happen? I don't know if anyone could follow what im trying to ask

Grammar filled article.  Why should I bother following such facts? And these are hardly facts to begin with.
