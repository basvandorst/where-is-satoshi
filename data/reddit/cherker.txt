But would adoption really slow down? Some people are scared to buy into Bitcoin because they don't understand that they can buy smaller amounts, they don't need to buy an entire Bitcoin. If the price was lower, this wouldn't be a factor.

Why would those people care about the price? As long as it's something stable, they won't care whether it's $10 or $5,000. Bitcoin can be divisible to really small amounts, so it doesn't matter at all. The only people who truly care are investors (who invested money, not necessarily time).
@_date: 2014-11-03 04:13:51

Just more examples of journalists not having any idea what they're talking about. If the "investment" were made in anything else, it would've been his fault. But no, since it's a volatile currency, people encouraging adoption should be responsible for it.

It's not forced. It's one thread in which I specifically told them that if they post, they will be given a few bits. They got something that they value by doing something that I value - which is playing around with the protocol.

I don't know much about Ryan. Care to elaborate? I'm not necessarily hitching my project to him, I was just offering some assistance since we seem to have a common goal.

Okay cool I'll get in touch with you and see if there's anything that I can offer.

Hey Ryan,
That sounds awesome! I'm afraid my skills working on a decentralized service are not very good (not something I've ever done), so I'm really not sure how much help I'd be. My idea was more of a Reddit 2.0, a big improvement but remained mostly centralized.
Do you think users will understand how to use a decentralized social media site? Could it get as big as Reddit? Right now most people don't even understand how to use Bitcoin.

It's fun watching the gradual transition in other subs. They used to tear it apart, and now it seems they almost support it.

No, sometimes they would just tear it apart. There are a lot of valid concerns raised, but also a lot of people just shitting on it entirely.

Just never thought of it. Setting up a VPS now to start running one - thanks for the little push.
