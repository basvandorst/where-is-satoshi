Thank you! I appreciate the positive words. I am really shocked the heat we are getting for this. We aren't asking anything from anyone else, in fact, we turned down offers of donations. We can't be sure that we will be successful in our attempts, but I can assure you, we will fight for this. For those saying we need to fight "fire with fire"...we are going the other way...fighting fire with water.

Ironically I had a Western Union advertisement play before I could watch the video.

Great video! It will be exciting to see how this develops.

I am Brett from the article mentioned. Thought I would join in and communicate directly with everyone. You are right, from what I see, the most productive thing at the moment is to get involved with your local government. I have found they are surprisingly approachable and very curious about the topic of Bitcoin. Just my thoughts from my experience this far, if others have thoughts we would love to hear them as well. Cheers, Brett.

Great post from Peter Surda!

(This is Brett from the article).We see this as a key step of getting Bitcoin to the mainstream level. Open for thoughts and working with anyone else wanting to get involved! Brett

I had the pleasure of seeing this in person. Fantastic talk! Great lessons that we all need to understand if we want to propel Bitcoin into the mainstream.

That's appreciated but we could not accept donations, we are going to fund this ourselves for now. I would encourage you to use the funds to begin the same process locally though! I think backing with support will be more than enough!

Great example of a scenario where bitcoin can benefit the world.

I am not promising anything as this is our first attempt, but I do feel we have the best of intentions. We are meeting one on one with these politicians and walking them through all the basics of Bitcoin. It is exciting to see the looks on their faces when they finally "get it". We are also working with organizations that make contributions and asking them to do it in Bitcoin. I really hope that others will join us because you are right, as just a lone lobbyist, we aren't going to get very far!

Enjoyed the webinar last week, GM. Thanks for that. Here is a link to anyone who wasn't on for the event:

Interesting and makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to respond. Is this the same with other companies though? What would happen if for example, Coinbase or any of the other Waller providers that aren't decentralized were taken down?

Cool article but if the US gov wanted to, couldn't they just shut down the airbitz servers and take down their wallets?
