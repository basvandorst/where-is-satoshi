Seriously? Satoshi planned a block size increase of 10 and later 100 MB back in 2011 (Besides saying that a limit isn't intended and it should be raised whenever blocks are full). 
The 1 MB limit was for the beginning of BTC (With no fees and no real value behind it) so someone couldn't break the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:07:41
It's not the early days, we've already used BTC to pay for stuff for a long time. Steam, online stores, real stores, ...
Then core came and decided to not follow Satoshi's plan to raise blocksize when blocks were getting full.
Now instead of adoption you have one merchant after another drop BTC, the last big one being Steam.

That's what I meant: The last big merchant that dropped it is Steam. Maybe I didn't make it that clear in my post \^\^

[But the transaction fee has been climbing since March, even though BTC had 100% of the hashpower?](

[There, one of my smaller transactions. At that moment worth around 70€ with a fee of around 0.0048€.](
Isn't the concept of LN that users freeze some of their BTC to use on a certain hub to avoid on-chain transactions? You make one transaction to freeze your BTC, everything after that happens off-chain. How is that not centralization and dangerous?
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:32:05
Which means you don't have any private keys and the coins no longer truly belong to you. We'd be at a system similar to our current banks again?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:15:12


Setting up a new channel requires an on-chain BTC transaction, fees included. If the fees keep going up (And they will when adoption rises) then opening a new channel will be very expensive and not something you actually want to do..
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:12:48
Really? I don't care which coin 'wins', I only want to use a cryptocurrency with low fees and fast transaction times. Like BTC was a few years ago. If BTC can fix its issues then I'll continue to use it. At its current state I cringe at the fee of every single transaction I make, it's no longer fun to use BTC and it's sad.
For now BCH fixes these issues, but LN may also help. The current state of BTC is unacceptable, but as long as it gets fixed I'll come back. Fucking politics.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:30:49
0 tx is the minimum, but it's ignored by most nodes. So spamming would be a high amount of tiny transactions with the lowest free that will still be picked up. It's pretty expensive to do so, in the case of BTC due to extreme fees, in the case of BCH due to the mempool being able to get empty again with 8 MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:29:08
Paying around 2-3$ in fees I must say a few days ago I always got one confirmation in 5-20 minutes or so. So the speed was okay, but the price is ridiculous and against everything Bitcoin stood for a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:47:56
Or we think about on-chain solutions that allows more tx/s to alleviate the fee problem first?
You also have to use huge nodes for LN, as they need to have at least the amount you want to pay frozen. So if you want to send 1 BTC somewhere the nodes you connect to (EACH hop) also need at least 1 BTC temporarily available to route your transaction. In addition to that the node you connect to must be huge with many connections (Meaning a ton of BTC freezed) or you wouldn't find hops to anywhere.
If this isn't centralization I don't know what is. It's the banking system 2.0, the only benefit you have is that you can force transactions on the blockchain if someone does you wrong (But you may pay a huge fee for it).
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:13:32
Look into BCH, I sent 150€ for a fee of 0.0035€ just a few days ago (And it got confirmed in the next block).
Later on I sent 2000€ with it for a fee of 0.0271€, so still barely 3 cents, which I can definitely live with.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:32:25
That's my point, even though there are more merchants for BTC, you still don't use them anymore.
And nah, Steam only takes BTC.. but I may actually write them and ask for them to add BCH (Probably won't happen, but it's worth a try). A BitPay service for BCH would be rad.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:03:08
The fee is already 2-3$ per transaction and the Bitcoin Core team talked about fees up to 1000$. So 50-100$ sound quite reasonable should there be high adoption (Due to LN) for the near future.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:54:06
Hell, I'm not poor, but even I couldn't afford using Bitcoin for day to day transactions with the current fee and I live in western Europe.
I already cringe when I move BTC between wallets, paying 1-3€ each time, it's awful. I don't even want to touch my wallets anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:36:45
But we're at a point now where Bitcoin is simply unusable for any transaction below 100$ or so. I just paid 2$ per transaction for the last few I did, that's absolutely unacceptable.
When it comes to hardware Bitcoin is already not very open. You need ASICs, so mining is already out for 99% of people. When it comes to Nodes, 1 MB or 8 MB won't make a difference for current hardware and bandwidths, you can rent a very cheap virtual server in a datacenter and get 100 mbit up/down without a problem. Private internet connections also get faster by the year.
Future technologies may help BTC to get back to cheap and fast transactions, but it's long overdue. The last few times I used Bitcoin it started to piss me off, one time I picked the fee a tiny bit too low (But still paid over 1$ for a 100$ transaction) and the confirmation took half a day. Then I went no risk with the next one (Because I urgently needed it), went high with the fee (Nearly 3$) and still had to wait an hour. Bitcoin is no longer fun to use and I dread every time I have to move my coins around.
With the current state I've thought about pulling out several times now, at least for now I actually transferred some BTC to BCC (And sent BCC around with 0.001$ in fees without a problem). It's not the same as BTC though due to the missing adoption :-/
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:08:38
There is nothing to check, my numbers are coming out of my arse.
You also can't expect exponential growth, there is a clear realistic cut-off point. Just because Bitcoin gets more popular doesn't mean it will be used a hundred times a day by each user. Even cash, credit cards and bank transfers aren't used that often, I'd say at max about 10 times a day per person? Coffee in the morning, breakfast, lunch, grocery shopping, cinema, an order from Amazon, ... and you don't do shopping every day, so 10 is still relatively high (As far as my own habits are concerned).
So let's find out the 'worst case' scenario for the blockchain..
Let's say everyone currently on earth uses only bitcoin and that around 10 times per day. That's 10*7,500,000,000 = 75,000,000,000 transactions a day (I just saw that based on [this source]( we currently have 433 billion non-cash transactions a day, so this is probably extremely off.. though most of those transactions are automated I guess..). It's a bit difficult to find the average transaction size for Bitcoin, but based on [this site]( it was around 600 bytes in 2015 (If I take the current blockchain size and divide it with the total amount of transactions I get around 420 bytes, but let's stick with 600). So we would get 41,909.5 GB per day. Mh okay.. at that point we're fucked.
To really future proof Bitcoin something actually does need to be done, even when taking the current amount of actual non Bitcoin transactions into consideration then holy shit, this won't work out at all if everything switched to the blockchain.
So yeah, you're right, regardless of how much hardware you throw into the equation, Bitcoin has absolutely no chance of replacing the current systems with the blockchain even in 2017. The 'normal' every day transactions of people would already be too much and when you add in automated transactions (Banks, stock markets, ..) then it's absolutely broken.
If we want Bitcoin to replace current systems (And I do think we want that?) then there is no way we would be able to continue like this. So yeah, taking coffee purchases and more importantly automated small transactions (interest payments, shorting stocks, ...) off the blockchain may be necessary.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:27:59
Not really, the difficulty shot up by nearly 400%, so even if the hashrate remains exactly the same you'd still see those spikes (As the time between blocks is now higher).
Miners are switching now though, as can be seen [here]( Let's see if the trend continues.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:27:05
Your country will get there sooner or later.
Should Facebook, Google, or any other huge infrastructure provider design for your country or for the current hardware and internet standards?
It sucks for now, but you can't design based on the lowest common denominator. The average user needs to be able to run it and that should keep it stable and working for everyone else.
Of course they could try to make it even more efficient and they probably will, but it's not the goal that literally everyone around the globe can run a node right now, be it in the middle of the rainforest or in the Arctic.. 
If you really want to run a node yourself, you can always rent a cheap virtual server in a datacenter for now.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:28:19
Having a third party provide off-chain transactions is like you using your current credit card company. Just with the addition that your credit card company claims it's consolidating all its transactions on the blockchain.
It's no longer Bitcoin and it aids centralization.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:27:31
LN is off-chain as far as I know and uses the blockchain as a back-end. So not really what Bitcoin should be because you have to trust third parties.. then I can just go back to my credit card again.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:25:00
With all the options you list, you could also start to decline transactions. Or force customers to use a certain node or their payment won't get accepted? What would hinder a few big fish to create large nodes that only communicate with each other and they are then used by apps and services like BitPay? As you say you can create an app that will prefer (or connect only) to certain nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:59:41
What has difficulty to do with it? Difficulty always aims for roughly 1 block every 10 minutes. Yeah, it's a painful transition period right now, but difficulty won't have anything to do with increasing the possible transactions per block / how fast those blocks are actually mined. Even before BCH the fees were already high, when the whole thing with BCH is done and things go back to normal then we'd still have the problem when BTC adoption rises (If it doesn't then LN also wouldn't make much sense).
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:56:00
What the article forgets: Bitcoin Cash can scale blocks up to 8 MB max size. So even if blocks per hour slow down to a crawl (Let's not kid ourselves, it's unlikely that every single last miner leaves), transactions should still get through. That this works was proven when BCH was spammed with transactions in an attack and got the mempool down again in one full 8 MB block.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:36:01
EDA keeps BCH alive while at the same time being an obvious attack on BTC. BCH can clear its entire mempool even with 6 hour blocks, meaning transactions still all go through (Although slowly) while after every EDA the mempool of BTC is exploding (And it's getting worse with each swing).
If this keep up BTC will drown in transactions (Even worse than it already is) while BCH keeps chugging along. Interesting times at least.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:35:49
Only problem they say in the video: Bob needs to be rich (Every node between two participants needs to have a large amount of BTC in the LN to handle bigger transactions). So if you want to run a node you'd have to put in quite a bit of money? Of course you get it back when the transaction is complete (Or timeout is hit, or you put it on the blockchain), but during an incomplete transaction your funds are locked/given away.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:49:16
I got in around 2014, so rather late, but Bitcoin got pretty annoying to use by now. Very high fees and extremely slow. I'm skeptical of BCC, but actually using BTC for transactions is a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:10:02
It can definitely work, but with all the "high fees are good for Bitcoin" talk and some devs even saying fees could go up to 1000$ per tx LN won't be a good idea.
It all stands and falls with on-chain fees, if they remain reasonable (1-5$) it'll work fantastically. If they spike (10-100$ or even up to 1000$) then I can't see myself using LN. The only way to use LN is never go on-chain, but that would mean as soon as you want to cancel a channel when someone does you wrong (Basically steals from you), it wouldn't be worth it to broadcast to the blockchain because of the fee. At that point the only people able to use this security feature would be companies and millionaires, so you'd just stick on the LN network, receive new coins on LN, spend coins on LN with very well connected (As in huge) nodes and the whole idea of BTC in the background is history.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:15:02
Depends on the person. For me? I'd probably grab 1000€ in BTC, make one transaction, open a channel and be done with it.
What about the average US citizen though? A lot live paycheck to paycheck, if they can't even afford a surprise bill of a few hundred bucks, how would they open and fund a LN channel? Doing it with just 10$ or 100$ would eat up most of their funds in transaction fees (Besides being slow if they want to save on it).
LN truly sounds awesome and like a great solution, but even then the 1 MB block size and the fees are a problem :-/
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:58:50
I'm not a big fan of LN as far as I understood the concept. You're adding in another layer that works off-chain and that is rather expensive to set up (So not a ton of LN nodes, or only people with a lot of money make nodes). It seems too much like added centralization for me.
For now I'll stick with Bitcoin Cash, paying 0.005€ for a transaction that clears with the next block is refreshing.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:47:41
I just set up a full node on my linux server (Besides the other things running on there, the requirements are so low that I just added it on). The main problem I think is upload speed right now, with my speed I could download the whole blockchain in 3 hours, but the old blocks seem to take far longer (Got most of them in 2 hours, now they start to trickle in for the last ones).
My 17€/month virtual server already has 4-8 GB (At least 4, up to 8. I do have 8 available most of the time) Ram, 300 GB disk space and 100 mbit up/down bandwidth. And that server cost is already a few years old again (I could get a slightly better one now, but it's a hassle to migrate..).
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:05:57
Wait 5 years, lol.
What's the current size? A bit over 100 GB? I'd say in 50 years everyone has at least 1 Gbit internet speeds (Probably a lot higher), so about 125 MB/s. With that you could download the current blockchain in 13 minutes.
It's difficult to say how much the network will grow, but let's take all transactions for the last years (100 GB) and say every year from now on we add the same amount (Adds an extreme increase for the first years and not enough for the last). That would be around 5000 GB in 50 years. Storage wise no problem at all, bandwidth? With 1 Gbit still only 11.11 hours to download everything.
Even if Bitcoin gets far more widely used I'd say we're still only looking at days, maybe a week, to put up a new full node. Nothing close to years. I can easily get a server with 1 Gbit right now, in 50 years that will be peanuts.
Of course the scaling is unfortunately not in our favor, but I don't see any risk that Bitcoin would fail due to that anytime soon. There are far more important matters to think about.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:38:19
Yeah, it seems to be around 5% of the BTC network when you multiply block difference per hour and tx per block. But as I said: No merchants, slow adoption and a lot of volatility. It needs time. And of course BTC has a huge backlog, the transactions per block isn't coming down..
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:07:30
It sounds pretty great so far and gives me a bit of confidence in BTC back.
One step I'm still unsure of: How do you get your BTC into LN the first time around? You'll have to touch the blockchain to open your own channel, right? Doesn't that mean you'd have to pay extremely high fees for that (They aren't getting any lower.. with some Bitcoin Core people talking about 1000$ fees in the future)?
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:08:30
Are you actually buying things with BTC right now? Like in the last one or two weeks? The fees are so damn high, the last things I bought were 100€ for my steam wallet and another thing for 180€. Even then I cringed at the fees.
Besides the extreme fees the current vendors that accept BTC are quite limited still. At least here in Europe. Sadly no Amazon :-/
So huge fees, still not a lot of vendors, if all you do is buying 100+€ items then yeah, BTC works, but it's far more expensive for me than my credit card or a normal bank transfer. My credit card and my giro account are also faster when it comes to transaction time than BTC right now, so why should I keep using it? (And if you now come with sending money around the world.. PayPal also does that and sadly cheaper than BTC if the sum isn't huge)
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:05:21
I think he means: How do you get your Bitcoin onto LN the first time around? Especially when fees are going to skyrocket even more in the future.
For example a new user wanting to put 0.5 BTC on his LN channel, he may have to pay hundreds in fees to even get started (Based on "Bitcoin fees may go up to 1000$ per transaction in the future"?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:24:35
But it's no longer Bitcoin, but a third party payment system. Where's the difference to my current credit card then?
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:03:52
Hmm.. isn't this per block? BCH had vastly more blocks per hour than BTC, so you'd probably have to multiply those values with the rate?
BCH is still small though and needs merchants behind it. For example a service like BitPay would be nice.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:05:34
I sent 150€ worth of BCH with a transaction fee of 0.0035€ (Didn't want to go that low, but the new wallet software fucked up). It went through with the next block.
Edit: Had to change BCC to BCH, shit's still confusing for now.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:30:47
Current hash rate in relation to current difficulty!
If the difficulty remained the same then yes, you could use this to see the hashrate, but it didn't.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:54:09
I have that one from the "High transaction fees are good for Bitcoin" post. We're already at an average of 5$ per transaction and no scaling solution has been implemented yet. LN will help, but even with LN, comes major adoption of BTC the fees will rise.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:24:52
"Crap txs", who decides what a crap tx is? I bet with you there are a ton of real transactions in there where users just used a fee that's too low. The system shouldn't crash just because someone spams.
But yeah, the situation sucks for now.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:15:42
Well, here it's like this:
You get a free bank account and a free credit card (Depends on your bank, but you can usually find free products) and.. now it comes.. you just use them. No fees, no strange cash back things, it's just for payments with your money. You get a tiny bit of interest on your bank account (As in they pay you, not you them), but with the current rates that's pretty much zero.
Cash back has nothing to do with a currency or transactions, that's just your bank making a promotion. It's like your supermarket having a friend's card that gives you a few % off each purchase. It doesn't exist here and it missing from Bitcoin is irrelevant (And some merchants actually give you a lower price when you use Bitcoin.. at least back then with low fees that was the case..).
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:03:04
Lol.. our Credit Cards in Europe don't have cash back (And that's hardly a feature..). What are travel points? Universal acceptance doesn't depend on technology, but on merchants. Cash flow management?
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:55:24
A few years ago Bitcoin was about replacing FIAT, credit cards, bank accounts, everything. One of the first BTC transactions was buying a fucking PIZZA!

@_date: 2017-08-23 09:45:48
You'd have to pay another transaction fee I guess? So yeah, massive fees don't seem to work well at the entry/exit point of the LN, at least not for individuals.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:17:36

Ehh.. I did exactly that last time the price was this high. It started crashing a few days after and went all the way down (Bought at around 900€, price crashed to 400€). Now a lot of time later I'm back to where I started.

@_date: 2017-08-23 06:21:09
Of course it's fast, it's no longer relying on the block chain.
Isn't this comparable to creating a giftcard? You load BTC on it and then can use it for services with other people that use the same network (And it's fast because the actual blockchain isn't used)?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:38:08

We can always do a worst, average and best case scenario for growth, but it's mostly number wang. The next 20 years or so should be no problem at all and as far as we know the technology in 50 years will look like magic to us. Think 50 years back, that's 1967, the smartphone I'm holding in my hand has 8 GB of RAM, 8 CPU cores and 128 GB of storage, something that was unthinkable even a bit over 10 years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:27:26
Ah, that cleared a lot of things up. It's actually pretty clever. They sadly didn't touch fees (The nodes will probably want to earn something for their resources?).
But yeah, it can work :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:08:43
Very low? They are still around 1-3$ for a "crisp brand new transaction".
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:57:34
Nobody actually switched yet, look [here]( The hashrate took a little hit, but that was mostly miners with old equipment switching it off again (As it costs more electricity to run now than they'd get out of it). BTC didn't get a rise in hashrate yet.
Let's see how it develops in the coming days.

Well, if you keep your private key safe it's safer than anything else.
Try to calculate the odds of someone bruteforcing your address to your private key.

The only problem would be a fault in the system, but we're already at 1000+ $ and nobody seems to have found anything.

Ahhhh, alright, a bit strange because I was still in the metric system (millibit and so on) and thought it's 1000*1000 :-)
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:51:53
And going up again, I'm getting already sick of this rollercoaster!
Just joking, I need better seat belt though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:42:41
So uh… if the private key has to be kept a secret why can others see it then?
Is there a password behind it?
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:03:39
I still always have to look back to the times were it was really cheap. 10000 BTC for a Pizza? I bought in, yes, but it feels like I'm paying a fortune compared to even a year ago.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:13:40
Proof of payment, yes, but how can I make a secure transaction?
Sure, there are tons of assholes out there (paypal scams for example) but without any protection there is the same problem:
I pay BC, they are gone, the guy on the other end won't deliver any goods. What should I do then? When there is a problem with real money I can talk to my bank, when someone scams me with BC I'm sitting there thinking: Shit.
I'm still very unsure about that.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:23:48
Vanu master race! But if we start playing and bit coin crashes be prepared for my whine D:
\*laughs\* shit, now I really have to play again, got time this weekend?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:25:24
+all verify
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:18:10
Or spend it directly :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:49:56
But it fluctuates that much, even several hundred dollars in days!
It could be 600 $ tomorrow.
Ahhh, I hate playing with real money :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:04:25
Well, about 1,12 BC, that's over a billion satoshis, right?
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:05:52
I'm already late again, maybe I should buy some :-/
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:17:31
My accountant slapped me on the head for buying in at 1200 :-/
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:26:58
$1200 here, you're cleverer than me :P
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:05:10
Well, I want to get started with BC now but I'm terrified to buy in.
Like: 1000 $ now, a crash tomorrow and I just burned my money D:
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:47:58
Or kick myself in the nuts, we'll see!
Rich I'll get neither way, for that it's too late.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:44:31
Well, I already booked my flight to Wales…
I just asked because there is so much computation power behind it, if they can mine bitcoins why can't they start to "mine" a public key with a lot of BC to find the private key?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:09:00
Mh okay, could be :-)
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:21:32
Wait, when mining offers the processing power for transactions…
What will happen if there are no more BC to mine or if most miners quit (It gets too hard)? Wouldn't the whole system crash?
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:34:49
Well, I bought a tiny part at 1087 and the biggest part at 1114.
So I guess it's okay till it totally crashes.
And nah, I won't sell \^\^

The tile-text is when you hover over the original XKCD image, every single one has one.
Hey, welcome to the 10,000!
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:08:49
Hey, the tip bot says there is a fee (0.00012 BC). Is this fee for the bot or is there really a fee every time you transfer bitcoins somewhere?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:42:16
There is a bot for tipping? How does that even work with a reddit username?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:38:07
We already have those systems when trading fiat to bc and back.
You start a trade, your BC get locked in the trading wallet, you confirm when the money arrives and the buyer gets the BC.
If you don't confirm that any money arrived (but it did) it's a case for support (Which will transfer your BC after the buyer proved he paid you properly).
Hmm… it gets more complicated with real goods of course :-/ but then you are back to the same problems fiat has.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:53:23
Where do you get a price of 1224.60?
Everywhere I look it's more around 950 to 960 USD/BC?
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:42:59
ELI5 please?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:52:29
Oh god, I just bought 0.099 BC.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:21:39
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:43:43
Up that to a billion now, down into the abyss I go.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:35:05
Oh my god it arrived! :D
Well, I guess I'll buy in next time it gets a bit cheaper \*desperately starts looking at graphs\*
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:08:40
Hehe, I should get back to Planetside 2, but it's so much pay to actually play :-/
Or play for a hundred hours to just get one or two updates :-(
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:43:51
So, how do I get a private key? Do I have to open some kind of account?
