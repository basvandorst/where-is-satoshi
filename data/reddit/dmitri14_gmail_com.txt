The problem with these kind of "educator" videos as the above linked one by Andreas Antonopoulos's, they are full of personal speculations, with no clear attempts made to justify statements by hard facts. 
Proper education must be based on facts, not speculation. 
Proper education must include clear steps people can practice to achieve concrete goals.
Proper education must contain lists of reliable sources, where people can go and learn the topic deeper.
Don't get me wrong, the video is interesting and entertaining, but it is not quite the same as "education".

I've thought this was a joke, but there is indeed quite a list of real papers. But why there is nothing for 2017?
