We are in contact with the merchant.  Our guess is that he left the default settlement in BTC - and the BTC is just sitting there.  He will need to switch settlement to 100% USD and have BitPay convert at market rate.  Then they will deposit into his bank account.

First and foremost, we would like to thank the Bitcoin community for making this happen! Thank you BitPay and ChangeTip for being active in the community and being great partners for Bitcoin Pizza Day!
Here's hoping we can have all Papa John's on board next year!

Mt. Gox was a company holding bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is an open source technology so you can actually store and protect them on your own. Ask the Greek citizens what they think about the banks.

We would also love to thank the Bitcoin community for their donations and helping out a great cause!
