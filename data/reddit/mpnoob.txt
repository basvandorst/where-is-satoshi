 had this same conversation last week with a pal, I just delete the entry and keep a record(s) of the number of coins I buy at the price I paid. That pal of mine suggested to just track the transaction id, that has all the info.  I think that is a maybe too much for a phone app though...  
Tldr I only use the watch or buy options up until now, alarms are sweet too, the sell option adds a level of complexity that I don't want to engage in..
