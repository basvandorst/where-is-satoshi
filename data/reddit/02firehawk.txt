Can't shove a Bitcoin into a strippers thong

I myself would love to start. But I've seen so many articles about how people are getting ripped off it's very intimidating.  A bit overwhelming on where to start and what is safe and wow it makes my head spin.  I'm fairly tech savvy and by no means closed off but I've read articles and tried to learn a little but it seems no one can agree on a safe place to begin.  I've seen articles of services holding their deposits and transfers and people losing money because of the wallet they chose.  That being said im open to suggestions.

I understand what bitcoin is and I've watched it rollercoaster for years.  I just never researched how to actually buy it and keep it safe. Ty for the info

I didn't think Banks were supporting bitcoin purchases.  I remember seeing a few people get their accts closed for admitting to trading in questionable currency

I've got some expendable cash id like to turn to Bitcoin for the investment but I'm clueless where to begin.

I've read that it costs almost as much in electricity to mine a coin as it's worth.  Can someone confirm or deny this? I've been interested to learn about mining but all the things I've read say it's not worth it.   Is this their way of trying to prevent others from starting? I would love a true evaluation of things.

Would they not just create their own coin?
