Not yet. Perhaps in 40 years, if bitcoin is mainstream.

Thank you very much

That's what is refuted by my game theory argument : The best strategy to defy the expectation is to choose his real name as pseudo only with a very little probability.

and is address compressed or not ?

The assumption behind selfish mining is that there is only one selfish miner and that the others are honest.
But if there is more than one selfish miner, the advantage is less striking. 
If everybody selfish mines, nobody gains.

I get that a selfish mine with 35% of the computing power, can still obtain 41.6% of the blocks. That's worrying me.

When bitcoin will be the main world reserve currency, 21 millions bitcoins will be worth something like 10'000'000'000'000 $. So what do think of 476'000 $ a bitcoin ?
@_date: 2014-08-05 06:07:06
169 BTC !!? 
Too expensive meal.

The values for alpha and gamma have nothing special. You can change them as you want.
We can try now to change the strategy to see if another type of selfish mine could be more efficient.

Good idea, I will try to do this.

I have the same understanding as yours : Bitcoin will be hodled and so will less circulate than USD.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:56:16
How many rounds of SHA256 do you perform on the passphrase ?
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:57:07
I reread the law and what I understand is that the bitcoin will be hodled and USD will circulate. Do you have another conclusion ?
@_date: 2015-05-12 10:11:33
I prefer not have any discussion on the number of bitcoins. The big point in using bitcoin for me is to have no inflation.

An aggreement is an aggreement. The 2x will happen because Segwit happens now.
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:00:35
The first principle should be : There never ever will be more than 21 millions bitcoins.
In my opinion that's the most important one. The second should be "decentralization".
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:03:11
it's a typo. The final result is correct (I hope).

There are 2^160 bitcoin addresses (because of RIPEMD-160 Hash). The number of Satoshis is 21 * 10^6 * 10^8 = 2.1 * 10^15.
So the number of hashes you need to have a non negligeable probability of finding one of the addresses containing a satoshi is 2^160 / (2.1 * 10^15) =~ 6.959 * 10^32 hashes.
Currently the network makes 3.85 * 10^17 hashes /seconds (source : blockchain info).
So it will take 6.959 * 10^32 / (3.85 * 10^17) seconds = 1.81 * 10^15 seconds to have a non negligeable probability to find a satoshi. That's 57.3 milions years.
The non negligeable probability is exactly 1/e ~= 37 %.
EDIT : 6+8 is in fact 14.

Thanks a lot

So he can force the closing of the channel without Alice aggreement ? 
If yes, consider the other case where it's who Alice wants to close the channel. She broadcast that no transaction happened and close the channel without Bob's aggreement ? That also would be theft.

"ready" as in "production ready". When can everybody use it for real time payments ?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:47:44
Do you have an idea when LN will be ready ? Is a 18 months horizon reasonable ?
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:34:44
I didn't "demand" LN be "ready", I asked if someone had an idea of the time horizon. Don't twist my words.
