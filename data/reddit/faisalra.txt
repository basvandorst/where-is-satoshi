visit for a day, no bashing on bitcoin, if anything, calling for people to stop bashing on BTC

No no no no, criticism is one thing, hate is another.. "Dogecoin is a lameass knockoff" is hate, criticism is "this post is poor and vague, you should add some details to make it better". And the poster probably just wanted to draw attention to the rocky relationships between Doge and BTC. It made him upset because of how the Bitcoin community think about Doge. I can actually find many "Screw doge" "fuck dogecoin" posts, I'll link them if you really want me to.

is a fun-loving community.. Take a look, I think your opinion might change.

The dogecoin post did not actively call people to attack this person. If you're upset that the comment you intentionally posted on the internet is broadcasted to a wide audience then you shouldn't be on here.

We apologize for the rare few, we want nothing but to get along. To the moon. **TOGETHER** ( ͡º ͜ʖ ͡º)

you realize what's flawed about your statement, right? People on **r/bitcoin were bashing Dogecoin**, someone saw it and posted it, who's the bad guy here? And don't give me that "criticism" bullshit. That was hate, not criticism.
