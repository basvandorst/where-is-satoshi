Heh build a mining farm in Scottish Highlands, infinite wind energy, and surface temperature of the sea water is roughly 7-11 degrees.

I'd love for you to donate some money to an organisation called 'take three for the sea' here's their website  
Our oceans need a hand! 
This is really amazing and wish you all the best in life!

Comment and upvote for more exposure. I hope you get your coins back mate!

Hindsight is a bitch dude. I'd say just forget about those coins. 10 to 1 you would of sold them in the first spike anyways.
What you should do is work at improving your future. Im gonna take a guess that you are in your 20s. Go take some online courses and look at getting into a better work situation. Also start buying bits of BTC. Even 0.03btc now would be worth 30k if it ever hits $1m.
Learn from the past but don't dwell on it. 
Good luck

Travelled for a year on £8000 as long as you not wasting cash on pointless stuff or booking 5 Star hotels. Asia and most 3rd world countries are cheap to travel comfortably in. 17k a year would be great for traveling.

You can't know a lot of good investors is that's your take on most of them...
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:11:05
Correct.

Please update us on this when it's all done and dusted!

Why not cash in half and leave the rest to hopefully grow more in value?

I'd love to do India and Sri Lanka. Nepal also but untill in BTC rich it's only a dream. The worst thing is that when I did this in 2015 I actually considered buying coins when they were around 250usd... I don't regret not buying them but dayum how different my life would have been.

Venezuela, Colombia, and a Caribbean island owned by Colombia, then Mozambique, then Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and back to Thailand as I was finishing up some diving courses.

This was one of my concerns. They did ask for money preferably. I'll talk to my friend casually about BTC and see what he thinks I suppose.
