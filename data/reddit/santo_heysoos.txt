Yea that's  why I asked about gold. I mean Aztecs used chocolate as currency. You mentioned seashells. So it made me wonder about gold...

I think if banks invest in the technology and buy up as many bitcoins as they possibly can, wouldn't that create a problem for the autonomy of the cryptocurrency since only those with the means to buy and exchange bitcoins have the power to set fees just as they do now with money and credit ? 
I'm asking and sorry if I sound like a 5th grader but I'm trying to get a perspective from people that are actually in the game and know everything there is to know about this fascinating technology. 
Like what happened to all those bitcoins Mt. Gox "lost" or where stolen from them? How could they simply disappear? How is investing in bitcoins secure after such a fraudulent scandal? Couldn't banks pull a fast one by creating their own bitcoin exchanges?

Im a newbie here and please I apologize if this has been asked before, but please explain what is the value of bitcoin based on? If central banks fail and a bitcoin is worth $3,000 (US dollars), then what will the value of bitcoin gonna be based on? If it's fully decentralized (which i doubt it will remain like that forever) then how will the value be assed in such event?

Oh I see! So if the bitcoins are secured in a bitcoin address w/ a private key, and you and only you know the code to your key, what is the advantage of keeping your coins in a hardware wallet such as Trezor?  Wouldn't they be just as safe in your online wallet just as in your Trezor wallet?

Thanks for your response man. I guess what I'm trying to get my head around is that in case all banks fail and Fiat money becomes worthless, then bitcoin would simply be valued by bitcoin standards of supply and demand on the Blockchain (and the ability to process those transactions) ? 
And Wouldn't gold become worthless at that point as well since currencies were once based on gold and silver, then switched to dollars? So basically, bitcoins would become the dominant currency by which all other emerging cryptocurrencies would be valued by (just as the worth of a peso is based on the security of the value of the dollar)?

So if all banks fail, then bitcoin would take on its own value based on the demand of the cryptocurrency  itself as I understand.  I guess what I'm trying to grasp here (since I want to invest and I see a lot of pros but I'm trying to understand the cons of this system) is what if the banks just start building their own blockchains? Or simply cripple  bitcoin by hacks and the spread of misinformation? If it's based on the demand of the coin, and no one is buying it, then what is another way bitcoin can gain market value?
Or what about if the banks centralize bitcoins by investing more and more in the technology so it can expand and reach more people? Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of decentralization? Isn't centralization achievable within this paradigm? As I understand from articles I've read, there is a huge possibility of centralization.

Thanks for taking the time to address my questions. I'm starting to get a clearer picture of the pros and cons:)
