--How large is the code and static memory


--and ram in the VM? 


--How big is the stack?


--Does it support concurrency? How many threads?
It doesn't look like it's explicitly stated, but I'd venture to guess its just a single thread of execution.
--How much recursion is allowed? 
However much before the transaction runs out of fees. Each computational step in a contract costs a fee, and when it goes to 0, the contract stops.
--How much computation is allowed? 
The contract is run until it hits an invalid command or STOP command or it runs out of funds. Each computational step in the contract costs a fee
--What is the purpose of the computation? x2
I see the purpose of the computation as being able to manipulate the state of a globally decentralized database, in a trustless way ala bitcoin. You would use this when you want some sort of complex logic to act on this global database in a verifiable way. Think decentralized 'apps'.
--How are the inputs and outputs of computation communicated across blocks?
I don't think they are.. The inputs are sent in transactions and only run for the block in which they got 'verified'. They don't need to be communicated across blocks because a transaction is only run in a single block.
--What benefit is there to have thousands of nodes run these scripts? 
It's the same benefit you have with with bitcoin miners all processing all transactions they come across -- to maintain the decentralized, trustless system!
--Does it support pointer math?  Floating point math? Trig functions?


So not out of the box.


Perhaps a whole host of heavily used functions could become 'optimized' in the same way that they plan on optimizing crypto functions.
--3d graphics? 
--Write me a1,000 line ethereum script with recursion and functions that does something of value to the community as a whole?
too much whine, not enough read.
