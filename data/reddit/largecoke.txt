Off topic: I just wanted to thank you guys for processing my first ever bitcoin purchase so quickly. I was honestly surprised at the speed. Very professional.

Can you explain this to me? I get the "to the moon" thing but what is "to the potato"? Sorry if this is a silly question, but I've been seeing this on too often to ignore it any longer.

Fun fact: Roughly $2 billion worth of gift cards went unused in 2012.
Also, I find that I generally spend more than the giftcard is worth so as to use the whole thing up. So even if I do use it the store gets more money than is locked in from the gift card.

The divisible part is in reference to the lowest possible fraction of a bitcoin you can trade, which is 0.00000001 BTC (8 decimal places).
Edit: Added missing currency.

Would you mind elaborating on why we need to make a new offline wallet once we spend something? What vulnerability does spending from an offline wallet create?

Thank you.

I think explaining *how* he could have avoided it and not just stating that it could have been avoided would have been much better.

This is awesome. Where will they be located?
