As someone living in Switzerland, I agree. 
I’ll believe it the day SBB allows you to pay with the Bitcoin you can buy at the machines.

The Blockonomics wooCommerce plugin is pretty nice, and really easy to install. Maybe check that out?

Blockonomics is launching an ICO, if you accept the new coin there are no fees and so on.

Always enjoy Upstate contributing to the world.

Blockonomics sets up a direct to wallet Merchant service:
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:03:34
That is just false.
@_date: 2018-07-11 07:38:05
They have to raise money somehow, the erc20 token was probably the easiest.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:05:34
The Czech Republic and Slovakia for one.

Blockonomics is also a great alternative: blockonomics.co
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:06:08
Blockonomics is nice, offers permission-less direct to wallet payments. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:13:54
But it’s an already established company, been working since 2015. Has a strong Bitcoin payment system, won’t be switching off that anytime soon.

There's a acouple of options you can do to speed up a stuck transaction, such as a child payment. If you've got the transaction ID I can look up the estimated time for you, and then you can decide whether you'd want to pay a fee or wait.
You're private key is just that, private, so you shouldn't show it to anyone.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:42:31
Looks like it's got an ETA of about 3 days. You could try adding a child fee to the parent to make it go faster.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:14:55
Here's an article that lists the options and shows you how to do them.

If you read the full post, you'd realize it's not just talking about being a bubble. The possibility that this is a bubble is there, but as the concluding remarks say, Bitcoin will be around for a while. No one can, with completely certainty, say what Bitcoin's true value is so it could be a bubble or it may not be. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:51:12
It's scheduled in about 2 days. You can try sending a child payment to up the fees.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:06:22
Should fail after 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:57:31
Yeah, that's why you have to keep those 12 words very safe. You can steal your private key that way.

We've got a Wordpress plugin if that's what you're interested in:

It absolutely is good. WannaCry was a big driver of the recent price increase.

If you need the money, I wouldn’t, at least not the full 100. I know I’m going to get burned for this, but I’d invest half in Bitcoin and half in the stock market (though do it in a few months when the recession hits): you should hold both for a while. In 10 years when you’re starting to enter into the post-college years you’ll be happy with both investments.

It really depends. Bitcoin will probably go up in the long term. When, where, and whether it crashes in the mean time is anyone's guess. The important thing I'd argue is that when you get them hang on to them for a while. Long term investment seems to be key.
I've got some tips on whether to invest in my blog:

You can send it through whatever channel you want, as long as the receiver can access it. And of course this is a tad faster than snail mail ;)
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:26:21
According to this, it'll go through in 3 days. There's also some ways to try to speed it up listed there. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:56:25
That's a prime argument I make. Bitcoin is used for illegal activities just like dollars or cars or anything else. There's no reason for extensive cracking down on Bitcoin.
That doesn't mean though that one should ignore that dark side. It would benefit everyone to have a Bitcoin that is used less by criminals, if only to shut up the critics.

You can try a couple of things listed on that page, such as increasing fees. Otherwise you may have to wait.

55.57880322 BTC. You can see the total amount at the bottom of the link in the tweet.
