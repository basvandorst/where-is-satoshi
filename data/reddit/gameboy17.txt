It's not about honor, it just makes sense for them to do. They would gain no advantage from leaving your files encrypted after you pay and people will hear that they don't follow through and so won't pay. This way people hear that they keep their word and are more likely to pay them.

If she manages to overtake the rest of the network, sure. But the network has a lot of computing power, something like 64 exaFLOPS, so she would need either a ridiculous amount of processing power or an implausible amount of luck to mine blocks faster than the rest of the network combined, which is what she would need to do to make her chain the longest.

Mining all the blocks wouldn't be an attack, though. How would the protocol even be adjusted to prevent that?
For someone to mess with the blockchain like that, they would need both extreme amounts of resources and extreme amounts of stupidity. While they wouldn't necessarily care about the future of Bitcoin, they would need to be willing to expend massive amounts of resources for little personal gain to overtake the blockchain and invalidate transactions. They wouldn't even be able to take other people's coins like that, only double-spend their own. Doing this would be incredibly illogical.

I'll just ignore the insults, apart from noting once again that the fact that bits share a name with the currency used in MLP is a coincidence and they are not otherwise related even though I know you'll just continue to ignore that fact.
It makes sense to have the most frequently used unit be one that doesn't require a prefix. This is true whether or not you understand metric prefixes.

Glitterdust is a second-level spell from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 and Pathfinder, not a pony name as I assume you intended. This wouldn't really make sense as a pony name, as things like glitter/twinkle/shining/etc. tend to be unicorn names while the only pony I know of with dust or similar in their name is a pegasus. Also, while there are plenty of exceptions, pony names tend to be two words.
([Are you impressed by my knowledge of pony names? Well you should be. It's totally awesome.]( /s)
I've tried to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're just an idiot instead of an asshole, but at this point [I've pretty much given up on that]( It's pretty much undeniable at this point that you're [trolling]( Like you said though, [friendship is magic]( and so instead of insulting you, let me just say that I hope you are able find it in yourself to [become a more friendly person]( as you certainly seem to need it.

I'm actually claiming none of those things. I never said I had any trouble with it. Kilo- and milli- were both in the list of prefixes that I excepted from my statement that plenty of people don't know all the prefixes. I never said not having a prefix on the base unit was essential, only slightly more convenient.
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:33:53
Sure, we can do it. But it's slightly more convenient to just have a smaller base unit.

That's why it's unlikely that anyone will ever attempt a 51% attack. It's far more practical to just use the hashing power to mine coins instead of trying to double spend.

While she's building her chain, the rest of the network is building their one as well. The rest of the network has around 256 times the power of the world's top 500 supercomputers combined. It's just not feasible for one person to have access to that much computing power, making a 51% attack near impossible.
