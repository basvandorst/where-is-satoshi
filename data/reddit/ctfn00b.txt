You are coming to the table for a gender discussion before you checked your gender bias.  Then you compound that with your confirmation bias,  by seeking outside examples (quads etc)  that supports your gender bias.  
It seems so obvious to me that you are apparently unconciously biased that your knee jerk reaction to explain any gender inequality is somehow an innate or inherent deficit in women rather than even being open to exploring the potential for external societal influence/deterrence etc.
I am not a women studies major, gender equality activist or any such thing, just a normal guy that sees obvious and flagrant gender bias and sexism running rampant in this thread about (ironically) why women aren't participating in bitcoin.

Are we talking about plea bargains? Plea bargains are not secretive at all, they are fully public knowledge. You must learn to conspiracy better. 
check your definitions: a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful. 
1) a plea bargain isn't a secret plan. Its disclosed publicly 
2) A please bargain isn't unlawful, its done with oversight from prosecution and defense attorneys along with a judge
3) Harmful is kind of subjective, bargains aren't intended to be harmful they are actually intended to offer punishments LESS SEVERE

Nothing to do with bitcoin. This isn't a general rant and rave about dpr and sr sub. This sub is about @_date: 2015-06-20 18:49:09
When this leaves the realm of POC and enters the world of mass exploit, I'll be more concerned. Until then browsing the web is still the more likely vector imo.

do u mean private key ownership
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:37:34
THey've been confirming for weeks now that nobody in greece knows or cares about bitcoin. Thats the main point here. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:00:14
its the MAX block. MAX. MAX != mandatory
@_date: 2015-06-30 01:42:26
thanks for another shitpost with Greece in the title 
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:30:28
Only semantics separates extortion from armed robbery. If you engage in that behavior you forfeit you right to continue living a peaceful existence. I wouldn't even call it murder it would be man slaughter at most, self defense.

Come at me bro. Cool ur jets N00b
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:11:35

Who cares, its a hearsay rumor. stop peddling gossip
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:02:36
doesn't look bitcoin related
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:58:24
where is the sanity around here...its batshit crazy...I counted over 25 greece threads. Wtf!!?!??! People can't be this funking stupid.
@_date: 2015-06-30 01:19:17
do what exactly? make culty posts about Greece all day long day after day in a bitcoin sub?
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:26:28
is this a joke? We have a thousand shit threads per day about greece why wouldn't they get downvoted? THey are full of shit. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:27:51
plea agreements are literally public knowledge the opposite of conspiracy

@_date: 2015-06-26 01:28:05
I'm not certain how someone can own a public key. Anyone and everyone can be in posession of the public key thats the intent.
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:54:50
it's not a conspiracy people take deals all day
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:08:11
don't play down the fact he was trying to kill the people extorting him. If you get murdered while trying to extort someone thats called justice in my book.
@_date: 2015-12-06 19:25:41
Its China, they can make up the rules as they go.  Your contracts have no power here

Needless to say I don't believe you

I can't defend that part of it but at that point they were just egging him on. He probably would have sold his grandmother at that point.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:08:34

good post. so many upvotes. I must be the troll. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:31:32
who cares go post somewhere relevant. we have cnn and nbc and cbs and drudgereport and all the other rescources that post news articles without relevance to bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:39:56
well completely ignoring the fact that you can't distinguish cipher text from garbage data, the enforcement would be dead on arrival as thousands of cloud services spring up flooding the internet with garbled text 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:59:45
That's a big stretch,  you could say that everything is bitcoin related since bitcoin is math and everything is math.  
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:23:33
Put a wager on it? 
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:23:56
you can't ban encryption though so yeah...
@_date: 2015-12-13 04:07:26
1) this isn't bitcoin related
2) US has always held the purse strings
3) US took puerto rico from a rubbish filled third world to basically the 51st state with massive (read: billions) in infrastructure investment.
4) this doesn't have to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-06 02:25:41
Definitely not. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:32:46
fork it and make the changes you want to see and quit bitching.
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:53:22
low if you consider that bitcoin can represent value beyond cash replacement. cash, coin, gold, real estate, securities etc etc etc

Well your perception is off,  if u think about reality 99.99% of people don't use bitcoin.  About half of those 99% are women. 
Those 99.99% of people (men and women)  don't use bitcoin for the same reasons

lol let us know how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:52:45
You are putting the cart before the horse here. No one has supplied any evidence that the premise your statement presumes is at all likely. Greece's financial problems != bitcoin surging. There is absolutely nothing supporting that. Its the equivalent of saying If China ditches their currency for bitcoin there will be a surge and therefore any articles about china's currency are now bitcoin related. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:40:24
lucky  for them they are a commonwealth and can reap all the benefits of our fiat printing press

isn't that what news sites are for? I come here to read about bitcoin I don't give a shit about greece. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:00:02
thats a reach.
@_date: 2015-06-30 01:37:03
somebody should create more shitposts with Greece in the title.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 01:41:09
idea, make more shitposts about Greece 
@_date: 2015-06-28 13:34:46

unfortunately in the legacy banking system you cannot control who or when someone you have previously done business with will out of error or greed submit unauthorized charges. By the time you sort it out, if you can, its too late you're buried in fees.

Government is an abstract concept so inherently it has no characteristics other than those in our shared reality agree too. However, somewhere along the line it is perverted into a the shit show as its manifested itself into today. Somewhere along the line all government we know today in modern times operates on the use of violence, coercion, force and agression. So anything that operates on those principles is easily classified as inherently bad.

In any model where btc even finds success in a tiny niche market the liquidity will improve and the symptoms (fluctuations will go away) This scenario isn't far fetched vs. your strawman. Its not far fetched based on just about every metric out there, btc growth/adoption curve isn't comming to a sudden stop soon.
There are already services that lock in the value of your coins if you are looking for a mitigation for fluctuation right now but thats off topic.

At the G20 Summit in Cannes in 2011, Bill Gates stated that, “If the transaction costs on remittances worldwide were cut from where they are today at around 10% to an average of 5%…it would unlock $15bn a year in poor countries.” [11] A number of low-cost online services such as Azimo have emerged with the objective of lowering the cost of money transfers to developing and emerging economies.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:14:52
There is an answer common folks don't have access to banking or where they do its excessively costly.

What do you think I mean? All governments that I am aware of and I'm by no means a phd in poli sci operate with violence, coercion, force and aggression as their core operating principes.

@_date: 2014-10-16 15:44:18
1 + 2) If people want to voluntarily contribute to the formation of a local/state/national DEFENSE force that does not engage in coercion/aggression then they should be free to do so. Its probably a good idea to have one and be prepared for a psychopath.
3) This hinges on a new assumption from you that non-aggression will actually result in more violence than our current state of aggression/violence/coercion based society. I'm going to need some evidence to support that.

your falling back on "Nirvana fallacy (perfect solution fallacy) – when solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect."
again right here. Just because the solution isn't perfect nor the implementation doesn't mean its not better than the current state. We've been down the road of violent/coercion based regimes. We know how they all end(they all end), in violent upheaval. So we can continue forward on a path where we know will end up being at this rate the certain distruction of the human race or we can start as a society rejecting aggression/coercion as a principle, piece by piece, not over night and erect new systems and new solutions. Not continue with the old death and destruction.

what does the government do that does not fall under this definition:
Coercion /koʊˈɜrʃən/ is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of intimidation or threats or some other form of pressure or force. It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the free will of an individual to induce a desired response, usually having a strict choice or option against a person in such a way a victim cannot escape, for example: a bully demanding lunch money to a student or the student gets beaten. These actions can include, but are not limited to, extortion, blackmail, torture, and threats to induce favors. In law, coercion is codified as a duress crime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in a way contrary to their own interests. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury or psychological harm in order to enhance the credibility of a threat. The threat of further harm may lead to the cooperation or obedience of the person being coerced.

your using a straw man to misrepresent my argument. If a government throws you some lube while it rapes your asshole why would you celebrate that as a victory? that's essentially what your doing your saying "see see the gays are free government isn't moving in the direction of restricting personal freedoms"
I'll take it to an even more abstract level for if you want. The government never had the right to legistlate sexuality. Freedom of sexuality and the persuit of happiness observing the non-aggression principle is an inherent right its basic philosophical principle. The fact that government decided they can legislate being gay as right is fucking mind trick, they have no power legislate a freedom that is inherent. Next they are going to legislate that the sky can be blue and birds can fly. It doesn't work like that. Just because they restricted an inherent freedom through violent oppression then later on decided to permit it doesn't mean they are good guy government now. They never had the authority to begin with.

If you had followed my advice and made some serious efforts to rid the cash economy of the criminality that has infested fiat space, of which drug dealers are some of the worst scum, then you might not have been wringing your hands so much over this announcement.
Seriously when are you going to wake up to the fact that 98% of the world population do not want criminality in their lives in any form. Unfortunately some very weird libertarian pro drug politics seems to have got into cash in the early days of banking. Perhaps we can now make some serious effort to eject these undesirables as well as all the hackers, cash thieves, investment scammers and so on.
An ethical, honest, crime free fiat space might well be something more people would find attractive compared to the unfortunate contamination with scum you have now.

This is getting towards the really paranoid. The technical answers are dependent on many factors and really are going into the realms of digital forensics. Your question really is what digital artifacts will remain when I'm making a cold wallet and can these artifacts individually or in aggregate enable someone to steal my coins! 
The answer to this question is different as each computing environment is different. You need to think of it as a risk spectrum and decide what risk level you are willing to tolerate. If you are looking to achieve zero risk I'd say you are unlikely to meet that objective...ever. 
I know this doesn't answer your question necessarily but rather poses a question to you. It is important to understand where you are on the spectrum in terms of what kind of risk you are able to accept vs. what measures you are willing to go through to reduce that risk.
If you are technically competent enough to create a liveboot virtual machine on a usb stick, I think that would be viable and relatively safe method of creating your wallet. Other considerations though are backup copies of your wallet too. You do not want a single point of failure in any system. Again the extent to which you implement a backup mechanism should be dependent on the total value of the wallet you are protecting.

For me I printed my wallet on a (adequately secured) network connected device to a network printer that I knew to be configured with immediate image over write. I printed two paper copies, one is stored in a fireproof safe the other is stored in an offsite location also in a safe.

inanimate objects cannot have inherent subjective properties such as "cons" .  
But ignoring that ridiculous premise. making a transfer in bitcoin isn't as simple as you suggest because on each end of the transaction you need to exchange to local currency. All large transactions will be easily spotted in the noise of bitcoin transactions and can easily be followed as they are spent and liquidated. THe paper trail and transparency is completely unattractive for any "bad guy" dealing with any serious monetary volum. Cash and cash equivalents (jewelry, metals, art) is still king for laundering and transfer of wealth stealthy

ah yes I definitely see non-native English speakers browsing local Bitcoins(in English) to meet up with strangers(who speak English) and hand over cash. Definitely more convenient.&lt;sarcasm
The idea that they would some how be paid in Bitcoin is even more far fetched. They would literally have to demand it and even then their would be little incentive for the employer because there is a reason they are paying them in cash in the first place convenience and no paper trail. They receive cash for good and pay staff with the cash. Couldn't be easier why change that?

In order to draw YOUR conclusion, the control then would need to be a link in the same spot with no mention of bitcoin. Your making the conclusion that it was the mention of bitcoin and not the link itself. They did not test the link itself without mention of bitcoin so you cannot draw that conclusion. 
I'm not arguing from an entrenched position here but the test didn't support your conclusions. I'm not even going into the causality and correlation here as there are just entirely to many variables to account for which is why A/B testing is favored because it simplifies everything to a single measure -- is this better than that. The answer is yes or no ...not an explanatory why. why is a different test.

You understand A/B testing at all. It doesn't make any other determination other than which option converts better than the other. What your also not seeing is that seemingly innocuous changes (i.e. background color yellow &gt;&gt; blue ) can impact conversions in significant ways as well. Your not going to draw the conclusion that the color yellow is TOXIC!! I would not expect a fringe internet currency to beat out traditional payment methods in an A/B testing.

The USG federal government never existed to legislate morality...they were escaping that kind of oppressive regime in GB. The fact that it eventually enacted morality laws and repealed some of them isn't a demonstration of how good or efficient government is, its quite the opposite.

I'll assume you mean why isn't it working for remittances in third world countries where remittance through WU and the like are most popular. 
The answer is its entirely impractical buy and sell Bitcoin in these places. Things like accessible internet, bank accounts and credit cards are non-existant. Kiosks for purchase and redemption do not exist. On the flipside WU has over 40k physical locations in latin America with 10k in mexico alone! Bitcoin? &lt; 10
So there is your problem in a nutshell. To fix it would require a large network of cash2btc/btc2cash physical locations.

markets will be violent when they are controlled by violent government regime, interfering with coercion to protect privilege at every turn. Cause and effect. violence begets violence.

I wasn't considering those as the same government. A dictatorship and a democracy isn't the same government. My point was more along the lines of when that Dictatorship started, he was probably like good guy dictator save the day support me and your life will be great. By the end he was ruthless rule by fear dictator and the democracy was a welcome reprieve. Fast-forward another hundred years that democracy is out of control with only corporations and foreign interests in control of the votes and literally expanding their control over citizens lives at every turn. Until that democracy crumbles and they restart with something new that sounds great and probably is great until again it becomes a power sucking hell hole.  Get it?

Kidnapping is a primary activity in third world countries like Mexico.  Their are not police following the money there. Your first mistake was assuming police can actually protect you from boogie men.  This example makes no sense because a kidnapper to who has received payment cash or otherwise has no obligation to perform their end of contract.  They are fucking criminals for Christ. sakes.   Painfully stupid to read.. Its almost like you believe kidnapping,  blackmail and extortion never existed.

That's quite a logical leap there.  Do you know the clearance rate of kidnapping n the USA?  It's pretty high actually because most of the time is someone close to the victim and demands are never made.  
Kidnapping for profit is definitely gang/cartel controlled and not the work lone wolves. You can't just open up shop as a serial kidnapper and hope to operate with impunity simply because you use Bitcoin. Nothing about that makes sense even if you ignore the fact that the criminal underworld has its own hierarchy and checks and balances and you will pay the piper.

Dude, do a search on this sub, dozens/hundreds of people btc stolen by people (probably just like you) that got control of their email account compromised. If coinbase are not allowing access its A) for your protection due to suspicious activity B) you are actually doing something shady C) false positive . If B isn't true I'd be very happy the custodian of my btc was taking measures to protect it in the midst of suspicious activity. I mean that is part of the reason why you introduced third party risk right so they would take measures to protect the assets under their control? The fact that you have resisted this as a possibly and gotten your jimmies rustled so hard leads me to believe that B is true. Your story isn't adding up. Provide some proof or reasons we should believe you.
Suppose if option C was a true and you were flagged by mistake. In which case, as said before,  you entrusted them to guard your btc did you not?  If so why would you be upset they want to be sure whom they are releasing it to isn't someone nefarious?

How can anyone know that?

Bitcoin payment network does not have these inherent(i.e. by design)  vulnerabilities. Do you know how Bitcoin works? To defraud the Bitcoin payment network you would need to execute a 51% attack which would require huge resources beyond that of a credit card transaction.(millions of dollars in hardware)

You cannot possibly have the scale of "when people are allow to freely associate and form voluntary organizations with a common purpose of serving humanity" needed to take it to the next level of implementation with consistent interference and coercion in the market place. Any solution would be purely speculative after some point because most people cannot even imagine a day going by where they aren't overtly/covertly being controlled by their government.

This scenario of what if something better comes along is overblown. A feature doesn't make a brand. Bitcoin has the brand recognition at this point that would be tough/impossible to supersede on the premise of a feature. A new/better protocol would likely find its success in marketing itself as Bitcoin 2.0 or whatever and coordinating a hard fork transfer from the old network to the new.
just my opinion of course.

It doesn't need to apply to you. They reserve to the right to do it for any reason. Did you miss that part? Any reasons at all. All that have to do is suspect you are in violation. They don't have to prove it, it doesn't have to be a fact at all, just suspect. If their software flags you as suspect thats all they need. You probably shouldn't be using a computer if you can't wrap your head around that concept.

If you want to use their service you play by their rules why should their be any sympathy because this business doesn't revolve around your wishes and demands? They didn't treat you poorly by the way, they just asked for you to identify with whom they are engaging in business. This is common practice in many industries outside of bitcoin. Surely this isn't the first time you've been asked by a business associate for information about yourself? If you want to operate anonymously more power to you but why the hell you would try to do with coinbase makes no sense to me when its clear from their terms and conditions that your anonymity is not in-scope for their business services.

you will and are getting a bunch of varied answers to this. Its unique to each individuals risk threshold. This is a spectrum...and it is usually determined as a factor of the value of what is being secured and the resources of the person who is attempting to secure it. (resources can be technical know how or dollars to throw at the problem with gadgets and gizmos)
Some questions to ask yourself:
Are you ok with introducing third party risk of any kind? 
Are you ok with physically securing a physical paper wallet? 
Are you ok with the concepts of secure computing? (Do you know how to live boot a vm from usb, can you securely delete etc)
Are you paranoid and assume any network connected device is likely infected with Bitcoin stealing malware?

FWIW bitpay claimed there was notably greater spread in merchants that saw sales. But I don't agree with merchant adoption being a leading indicator of spend. Bitpay allows merchants to accept bitcoin with no or close to no cost or risk. There participation is important in establishing an economy but its rather superficial as a sales indicator. 
A bigger indicator is the total buying power in the bitcoin economy. THe market cap went from 13 billion &gt; 6 billion ?  Thats significant less buying power. To see any kind of gains in that kind of environment would be incredibly surprising. I'm not any kind of economist but all indicators I could muster painted a clear picture that 2014 would not be a "smashing success"

I see. Well the activity on the exchanges is very low right now. If a couple million dollars is enough to create huge swings in price. That's really because there aren't many people using/trading Bitcoin. Velocity will remain constant while adoptions will increase. The supply can't keep pace with adoption due to its limits. At some point, assuming adoption continues on an increasing path, the demand will out pace the supply.

I'm not going to split hairs on why the federal government was formed. Its not nascent to this discussion really. But I do disagree with your assessment that governments aren't good or evil. In the case with modern governments they almost entirely operate from a point of aggression, coercion and violence. You cannot operate on this principle of violence, coercion and aggression and be anything other than inherently evil. You cannot hold this operating principle at your core and expect any other outcome than a consolidation and increase of power to improve the efficiency and expansion of your methods of coercion and violence. Government over reach, restriction or freedoms, morality laws can only exist if your government holds as a core operating principle the acceptance of violence, aggression and coercion. There is no other outcome possible for such a government.

three parts: 
1) you don't understand the non-aggression principle. It doesn't mean you cannot defend yourself or respond to violence or aggression. Quite the opposite. 
2) Bringing in an argument of moral equivalence, "not as bad as..(ISIS)" another fallacy
3) Nirvana fallacy is exactly what you attemped you stated because non-aggression principle doesn't eliminate all violence it is a less worthy solution of a non-voluntary/coercion/violence based society.

not sure what you mean, the blockchain doesn't allow fraud  in the same sense as credit cards. Doesn't apply
Bitcoin - no chargebacks , no sharing of private key when paying, private key only exists where you determine it to exist
credit cards - many chargebacks, must share credit card number (private key) with all merchants, merchants store data in poorly protected databases.

The code changes are easily tracked in github. you can see what the last changes are and what any future changes will be.

Well, I think you are focused very much on the micro level. The change needs to occur at a macro level first. Society must become fed up with it and reject aggression in all its forms including passive aggressive behavior.  Being poor is a result of current regime more than a result of not enough resources. The current regime allows for privilege in markets protected and enforced through violence and coercion which results in the extreme disproportionate accumulation of wealth and resources. This hoarding of ill gotten resources is what creates an extreme poor class of people that cannot care for itself. Starving someone to death by withholding food is no more less aggressive than shooting them in the head. Passive aggression is still aggression. It must start with a fundamental change in perspective from a society willing to reject aggression in all its forms. Poor people would also have an easier time to make a way for themselves in the world if all the interference form government wasn't in their way. Also to consider is defensive forces could themselves be voluntary and not cost a thing. A poor person could contribute of their own time(ten hours a week etc)  and in return receive protection. Once you take responsibility for your own well being aren't interfered with, their will not be a shortage of viable solutions and alternatives.

Its very easy for me to reconcile. Evidence is evaluated by a judge to determine admissibility, the only evidence that may matter is those artifacts which the judge allows during the trial. Then its evaluated by a jury to determine relevance and weight. Additionally there is an entire aspect of the case, the defendants evidence, which we have no visibility. Not to mention the lack of witness testimony. 
But thats also off topic because the article references the evidence relevant to the trial that is already completed. This article doesn't reference any of the evidence to be used in the upcoming murder for hire trial. 
So yeah very easy to reconcile.

A sole proprietorship, also known as the sole trader or simply a proprietorship, is a type of business entity that is owned and run by one natural person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business.

the thing I never understood about this is if I get direct deposit today into my bank account, they know where that money is. If I spend it on my debit card or write a check they know. If I spend cash they don't know. 
vs. 
Bitcoin they know I bought it but once its transferred(assuming you send it to a fresh wallet) they have no idea who controls that wallet or what it was used for. 
Please explain how this isn't an improvement?

That's not possible in the existing government framework. Individual voices are no longer relevant. We are in oligarchy now. 
"Ordinary citizens," they write, "might often be observed to 'win' (that is, to get their preferred policy outcomes) even if they had no independent effect whatsoever on policy making, if elites (with whom they often agree) actually prevail." 
so yeah, there is no working within the framework unless you are economic elite.

Or sky can forfeit its right to produce rain storms.  The king has no power over a birds right to fly or the skys right to produce rain.

Self defense isn't murder.  Extortion by definition is coercion. You have a right to protect yourself from coercion whether or not the threats used in the coercion are real or perceived,  physical or otherwise being an extortionist forfeits your right to live peacefully.  Strong arm extortion is still a mafia tactic. Threatening someone's life by providing information to an enemy is conspiracy. This was morally no different  than pointing a gun at someone and demanding a wallet.

I'd voluntarily pay for roads(and do through tolls and gas tax). Schools are one of the few areas where taxes make sense but I so rarely see the government spending recklessly on schools. In any case collecting the tax money and then spending it are divergent topics as well. We spend a lot of money on public schools that are horrible, produce little value compared to the rest of the world. Our dollars would be better marshaled outside of the governments hands.  I don't need an electricity tax because I already have an electricity bill. Same with clean water, I have a water bill. And if I don't pay taxes men with guns will throw me in a rape cage. Air is free still and its breathability is not equated with paying taxes. There are very few legitimate reasons for a tax and yet there are an unknown and uncountable number of beneficiaries. If you can't explain in detail in an auditable way how you are using every last penny of tax money for my benefit then I have to assume its for your benefit which under your definition would be theft. 
Inflation is a tax we have not vote on. And wages have been stagnant in comparison to inflation for thirty years. People would have money to save if prices weren't rising, taxes weren't rising and wages weren't stagnant. I'll just let you sort through the numbers yourself, after  all I don't want too link a partisan source

I did, probably a poor choice of words. The jist of what I was trying to convey was there are only a few government collection efforts which I agree with the beneficiary. I don't agree with their collection effort is implemented as a tax, I'd prefer a voluntary method of collection.
Taxing encourages the wrong behavior not only because its immoral but it discourages the tax collector from being thrift or efficient. The collector becomes much like a an addict in a sense they are addicted to the income. Whether they need it or not they are getting it year after year. They are allowed to gamble with today's receipts based on tomorrow's collections. A voluntary method of collection would enable a more immediate feedback mechanism and a more meaningful vote. If there is perceived or real misappropriation, across the board boycotts can ensue and the money flow is stopped until the ship is corrected. There is no feedback loop in taxes. Its a total one way street. Sure you can vote for this guy or the other but nothing changes but faces and names because the addict involved is the same, the wasteful and insatiable mechanism of government with a lust for spending and growth.

Unregulated markets doesn't mean it needs to be wild wild west. This market just happens to be immature and unregulated. There will be forming in the near future voluntary organizations which set community standards, code of ethics and guidelines. Ethical companies will see their participation and adherence to these as a competitive advantage as consumers will seek out companies that are making an effort to be honest. Give it time.

Lets be serious here a minute, Police aren't close to the top expenditure of governments and they are the least likely to go away or become reduced quickly.
One thing you will however see as a direct result of not having your paycheck hijacked you will have more free cashflow, and increased cashflow will increase the amount and frequency with which people are contributing voluntarily. Additionally you don't need to operate emergency services for all people. If you don't want to pay in, well then sorry we can't dispatch anyone to your house until next week. Our SLA for non-paying members is on a best effort basis and last minute payment is subject to rush fee of 25%.  Watch how fast people pay in. Its not perfect instant or easy but believe me, most service people appreciate and want to have will be missed immediately once they are gone. 
EDIT: also to add must of law enforcement spends time on non-value add shit anyways. People will really decide what should be enforced when they are paying for rather than every annoyance turning into a felony. Or the government using them as a standing army completed with federal funded military surplus. There would be instant efficiencies in this model.
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:26:44

Yes I'll grant you that there is at least 10 trillion in managed wealth and retirement accounts, however not all of it is liquid and not all if it can be sent to COIN ETF with a click of a button.

@_date: 2015-01-10 17:11:35
1) nothing there explains or proves they don't know hwy they were compromised.  If anything you can make the inverse assumption, they are using their old code so the exploit wasn't software related. Overall point being their unwillingness to divulge details to the trolls of reddit isn't evidence of anything other than they are following standard procedures for an on going investigation. 
2) Hastily MIgrated assertion - again no evidence that this project wasn't already in some stage of planning but more over, it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of IT. Restoring full OS image backups to new hardware is a trivial task that certainly doesn't require days of planning. Further, a mediocre disaster recovery plan would have these exact steps  already planned for and tested for an RPO and/or RTO sufficient for the business. Newsflash: businesses plan for "fast" aka hasty recoveries it doesn't mean it was done haphazardly or without thought.
3) There is just absolutely not evidence of this at all. 
I'm not making any assertions about what they did or didn't or what they should have done therefore I am not armchair quarterbacking anything. Just destroying this stupid fud.

@_date: 2015-01-06 14:01:35
Maybe you used solvent in an unclear way in your title. Implying they are insolvent or bankrupt, aka having no cash or fiat left. There is no evidence of that scenario. There is no evidence they require a bailout from bankruptcy or insolvency. A five million dollar loss is nothing. you have no idea what kind of business insurance they carried either. So like I said you have no evidence they ever left solvency and require assistance returning to it, your only evidence is they took a loss of 5 million dollars which unless they are gox 2.0 they must have easily in reserves.

You don't have to eliminate debt in a non-fractional reserve banking scenario which is what we talked about originally. 
If I deposit some money, 1000$ you can loan out $1000 because the money actually exists. Its when you take a 1000 and turn it into 10000 loan in which there is a scenario where you cannot every repay. I mean I think its obvious that $1000 can never repay fully $10000 without a hidden tax of inflation.

I was unaware he's been convicted. I'm of the opinion you also need a victim to have committed a crime. If you are counting all crimes simply based on laws as written,  I'm certain you've committed some crime somewhere sometime unknowingly or associate with someone else that has. Therefore you are guilty by association, aiding and abetting, harboring, conspiracy to commit, one of these applies and as such you should rot in prison as well.

I'm not sure how you prevent freeloaders completely. Lets face it we encourage freeloaders currently so its not like we would be leaving a great alternative. 
Phasing in a system is a matter of starting small and locally. Start on the borough/town/city/state levels first. Every little bit that is pulled away from the government either via privatization or some other volunteer collection mechanism is a win and a step in the right direction. The Snowball effect will eventually take over. I'm not blind here, I realize there is no overnight implementation plan for a system so deeply entrenched in controlling everything, aggression and coercion.

I can't even fathom how their business could possibly impact me individually. Their business is their own and mine my own. I'd prefer it entirely if you and others likely you just mind your own affairs. There are plenty of moral and ethical objections you can make to many different businesses and lifestyles however they aren't shouldn't be (without a victim) legal complaints. Governments and individuals shouldn't be in the business of trying to legislate subjective morality.

 thats a fine stance and I appreciate and respect it as well. The thing is though, bitcoin doesn't have to mean the same thing to everyone. Its perfectly ok for their to be shades of it. There isn't one that is better than the other. Your principled version is just as valid as someone else who doesn't actually care at all for the privacy and security features of the bitcoin. There is no reason people can't coexist and choose what services they wish to use or not use.

his journal in his own writing is hard to fabricate. His getting caught on his laptop logged into SR is hard to fabricate. Generally if you know anything about law enforcement and digital forensics it would require a massive scale cover up(Dozens of conspiring agents across dozens of departments and organizations) operation to fabricate even a fraction of the evidence.

evidence of a loss isn't evidence they need money or third party cash injection to cover the loss. Its simple as that. You have no evidence they "aren't able to pay all debts" aka you have no evidence they are insolvent. What's not clear about this? If I lose 5 dollars out of my pocket in the morning I'm not magically insolvent. I have other money to buy my lunch in my bank account. Get it? Same thing with bitstamp on a relatively larger scale. In the business world 5 million is nothing, even if I had 5 million dollars to give away freely, you have not proven bitstamp doesn't have their own money to cover their loss.

Its kind annoying to read these Monday morning quarterbacking posts from uninformed people.  They think they are so  clever with their hypothetical what if cloud security breakdowns. They have no clue about the extensive control environment these places operate under with continuous monitor at every layer.  Continuous internal and external control audits.  
Truth is a top tier cloud Datacenter is going to have an order of magnitude better control environment than an exchange maintaining everything on their own. It's very difficult for a small shop with limited resources to be world class in this regard.

theoretically this could be the case but when you add interest into the equation there will never be enough money in existence to pay it all off.

Pretty sure you don't know jack ABOUT ENTERPRISE IT,  infrastructure or security. 
You have no evidence to support any of your three assertions. 
They have no obligation to release details of the breach other than to satisfy idiots on reddit,  it could compromise an on going investigation by tipping their hand.  Network forensics can take a long time to unravel. 
To that end an infrastructure refresh could have little impact on the software platform not requiring extensive tests.  
Theoretically the breach could have been a result of multiple layers of compromise,  including operational security,  physical security and logical security.  It's just annoying to hear from arm chair Monday morning quarterbacks like yourself spout off uninformed assertions and opinions.

For many the idea of not sending 10's of thousands overseas to some pseudo anonymous corporation is not appealing.

I did as well. Its clear you ignore and modify the rules as you see fit and then justify when called out with ad-hominen attacks.

they are likely n00bs. people have been claiming bitcoin is dead for years. There is nothing fundamentally different today in bitcoin, that wasn't there yesterday or a week ago. An ex-developer through a tantrum on his way out the door...thats about it. There are hundreds of super talented people focused on solving all sorts of problems(or creating enhancements) with bitcoin. The market will sort it out.

I see the relevance of my comment in tha tthis ins't a bitcoin or crypto related article and the community rules dictate this sub reddit isn't for general financial news. That includes news that is even one or two logical leaps away from being bitcoin related. I'm sure your one of those that can find a tangential relationship between any headline and bitcoin, right? Therefore all financial news is bitcoins news...amirite?

@_date: 2016-01-22 01:40:27
Translation: 
I'm from an entitled generation. I grew up being told I'm special and therefore naturally all seemingly simple rules and guidelines everyone else follows are merely opitons for me. Where most normal people see rules as logical boundaries, I see opportunities to break and bend them to my will. Take for example the seemingly simple rule:
**News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.**
Most people would interpret that as meaning if the core subject isn't about bitcoin technology it doesn't belong here. Me? Hell no, first thing I do is ignore the second part: **This subreddit is not about general financial news.** The author was obviously confused because I can connect any financial news to bitcoin in only one or two logical leaps. So therefore all financial news is bitcoin news. 
Secondly, I just substitute "gray" area parameters like "usually" with absolutes like "never". So the first sentence becomes:
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are ~~usually~~ ***NEVER*** off-topic.
Look at that? I am special aren't I? In just a few slick moves I've changed this subreddit into something more related to what I want it to be. Because it is all about me and my needs and wants.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:31:14

step 1: A problem arises, real or percieved
step 2: Small folk demand that "somebody" do something
Step 3: Manipulators come forward with "their" solutions that suit "their" agenda and "appear" to save the day
Creating an us vs. them along the way only helps make the acceptance of their solution easier aka modern politics where 51% can trample the rights of the other 49%

well thats debateable. But assume you are correct, growth trends can temporarily plateau and then resume growth. A plateau isn't the end of the line.

The blockchain was getting spammed to create false urgency isn't that clear by now?  There is a scaling roadmap but there is not any reason to believe there will be a grand catastrophe if we don't scale today,  next week or next month.

@_date: 2016-03-01 18:14:49
It may not have anything to do with core or classic though, could be merely for the sake of splitting the community to make bitcoin weaker, could be a hostile alt coin *cough* ethereum *cough* already known to spam users of this board. I'm not even claiming a conspiracy, as I said it could be a single person this isn't that sophisticated. I do know when obvious vote brigading is obvious.

That's not the yardstick by which this community operates,  you are making up new guidelines to justify your utter disregard for community rules.

You know that there were at least 3 different federal investigations resulting in two separate trials. One trial Is  complete the other isnt. You're claiming facts about crimes in a trial that hasn't happened.  Good work. Dailydot is srs business. I use it in all my research. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:45:54
Closing point, your points above are probably true(I didn't research them) however they existed in a time where it was not feasible to collect and hold accountable parties involved. In your example maybe its the building owner that is accountable to pay their share of the fire bill. If they don't get fire coverage then the bank forecloses on the building.

Where at all on SR website did it say it was responsible for the choices of its members? Where did it endorse or encourage users to ingest drugs? Where? Any proof at all that it guaranteed safety and encouraged consumption? There was no such warranty made. This is a joke of an argument. If I take OTC medication tonight and die is big pharma responsible? Hell no! Why? Because it says right there on the label they aren't responsible for bad reactions etc. ARe you legit saying there was at no time no warning that you are using the site at your own risk?
by your estimates how many warnings were ignored by these victims? Had to be dozens. Just in getting the information to reach the website they had to accept many warnings.

unless everyone(or majority) were to do this all at once(switch services) isn't it a false dichotomy? The essence of the service to be replaced is its membership and contributors. If there are no(or severely limited) contributors then you aren't replacing like for like the service by "simply" choosing to go elsewhere. This isn't like shopping for milk at wawa or 7-11 unfortunately.

you don't get it though, if the flea market isn't selling anythin or even if it got a single stall(hell a few stalls), i'm going to goto the better flea market that has 100's of stalls and all types of milk. I suppose at a very semantic level you can argue that they are both flea  markets so they are technically competition but really, who the hell is going to the flea market with 1 milk stall? Until there are a competitive amount of stalls who would even consider going to the the other flea market? And worse yet this secondary flea market can't stay in business, the stalls that do exist there can't afford to miss out on the main flea market. You can scream go elsewhere all you want but there is a defacto primary flea market for a reason, it was there first and has all the stalls and moving elsewhere isn't an option unless everyone does it.

just stick ur head up ur own ass ok?
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:46:17
OK I'll roll with that so is it OK to assume if you cannot know the supply , you also cannot know the demand so saying there is a million per day of new demand may be inaccurate or misleading. or is it possible to quantify the demand with out first quantifying the supply
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:24:19
like all 12 Greeks jumped on board right?
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:21:37

You weren't at trial,  how can you even make that assessment? Did you have access to even a single piece of evidence first hand? You are drawing conclusions based on shit you never saw.  YOU aren't even open to the idea that the evidence was collected, stored and analyzed in a forensically sound Manor.  You didn't even look for yourself,  you just said it wasn't.  Huh? That makes no sense,  even the appeal doesn't challenge the forensic soundness of the evidence. They are saying evidence was improperly suppressed,  meaning defense evidence wasn't allowed.  It just doesn't fit for the government to fuzz up their case with sloppy forensics or evidence handling on every piece of critical evidence.

You are incorrect in your perception here,  you don't want bitcoin in the USA,  you want fiat.  This is a fiat problem not a Bitcoin problem.  You can freely send bitcoin anywhere,  your difficulty is now interfacing with the legacy banking fiat systems.  If you have a USA bank account there are other options besides coin base for exchange anyway. If you are legit setting up a new account on say.... Kraken should take a couple days at most.

A trezor is bitcoin specific product that can provide utility to all bitcoiners.  Jewelry is competing with all other jewelers, and doesn't serve a specific purpose to bitcoiners.

how can I tell if I've done this already?
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:41:53
Well you failed hard,  because coinbase isn't bitcoin.  They hold your bitcoins hostage in this case because you changed your phone number.  If you want to really utilize bitcoin manage your own private keys and wallet.  That way you can freely use any number of exchange companies that will take ur business. Also exchanging bitcoin for fiat isn't using bitcoin,  many of the delays and hassles are on the exchange or bank side of things. Still don't know why someone with 10k in bitcoin is so oblivious to all this. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:19:23
Bitcoin can't help you launder money though so yeah....

ok so long as you realize the residency requirements are bank requirements not bitcoin requirements. I think you were getting frustrated at bitcoin when bitcoin doesn't give a shit about know your customer laws. Banks do. There are parts of thsi story that were definitely sketchy at first. Also couldnt you just get a fake bill sent to a friend for proof of residency. Its not that hard..

Only if your threat model includes the one thing everyone says not to do and thats keeping your private keys on an internet connected device. Its pretty simple actually, if you don't keep your private keys online you never have to patch or worry about how old and vulnerable your software is.

Put a warning on it like they do a bottle of bleach or cigarettes or booze. Regulation and criminalization with Prohibition are certainly not the same. Prohibiting a plant is about as sane as Prohibiting sunlight.(funny thing sunlight kills way more people annually then all of the MJ deaths ever documented in history combined) What would be welcomed is more concern for accurate food labeling and obvious government areas such as failing infrastructure.

I'm probably going to be downvoted for this but it must be said. A business, especailly a first business should be approached with extreme pragmatism. Limiting your market to only bitcoin users is EXTREMELY LIMITING. You are trying to sell a niche product to a an extremly nich group of people. Its like a niche within a niche within a niche. So whats my point? I think you have excluded 99.99% of your target market.
The 5 p's of marketing...product, place, price , promotion and profit. 
The p that applies here is "place" you are placing your item for sale online to an audience of billions of users potentially but you are out of the gate, cutting that potential market down to 100k maybe? This is going to impact your ability to Profit. THere are some business models that can compete catering to extreme niche markets, these are usually low volume, high margin high profit businesses. Expensive equipment, machinery, etc....this is not your product though. 
Please consider taking an alternative approach and allowing all types of payments but offering bitcoin-exclusive discounts. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:06:02
Have you been part of a trial before or on a jury? If so you would know the prosecution doesn't present a list of evidence and say here it is, find him guilty.  No.  They take each piece,  describe how it was obtained,  including relevant witness testimony to validate.  Then they explain what the evidence demonstrates and also the presentation of an expert witness to validate the assement or conclusions you can draw about the evidence.  The defense has the opportunity to challenge the facts of each piece.  Did they defense even contest the forensic accuracy of the evidence?.... No.  Reading a list of evidence isn't seeing the evidence for yourself. 
Let's take it a step further,  have you seen any evidence the government or its agents conspired on a massive scale to manipulate and manifest false evidence?  Like not just a conspiracy theory is their evidence to support that it happened? Beyond Reasonable doubt doesn't mean implausible unsubstantiated massive conspiracy theory. 
The whole fact the corrupt agents were under investigation themselves is evidence there wasn't widespread conspiracy.  If they wanted to frame and extort him they just would have and swept it under the rug right?

Nothing about the story makes any sense, I'm sorry you don't get it.
If you can't use coinbase or kraken or gemini or whatever exchange because you don't have a valid bank account well obviously a wire transfer won't help you either. So either your full of shit (my guess) or just too dense to figure it out. Literally tens of thousands have people don't have any issues with what you are trying to do. 
EDIT: Turns out you did the smart thing and contacted the company you were doing business with and had it resolved....not sure why you didn't do that in the beginning because explains why nothing was making sense to me. Though I still don't know why you couldn't use an alternate exchange if you had to.

well faking "a" piece of digital evidence might be easy but there were hundreds if tnot thousands of digital artifacts that when put together painted a painfully clear picture.

Ughh what evidence do you or the defense have that the evidence presented was obtained illegally.

The rogue agents did not seize his laptop. There was chain of custody kept for the seizure of that laptop and the data contained therein.

No it doesn't. Did you follow the trial or any of the evidence presented at it? His convictions were for operating a continuing criminal enterprise, drug trafficking and money laundering. These activities were occurring before, during and after he was extorted by rogue agents. The evidence collected in the trial was part of completely different investigation from the one the rogue agents were involved in. Being extorted doesn't prove or disprove any innocence for the crimes he was convicted of, its just another circumstance. It will and has likely been considered in the pending(?) murder for hire charges.

I think that only works if your debt is pegged in local currency. Which its usually not, especially a Government's debt is going to be settled in USD most likely.

Except in this case running the website was the equivalent to the charge of running a continuing criminal enterprise. They tied the Bitcoin to his laptop, insinuating he wasn't a casual web admin he was profitting immensely from the criminal enterprise. If they didn't have everything on his own laptop the "it wasn't me" defense may have had some wings but his opsec sucked so he screwed himself. Also the evidence found on his laptop corroborated the story that he was and always has been DPR. The jury agreed on all charges in a matter of hours.

whats the exaggeration? Coercion can take many forms including the implied use of violence for non compliance and the actual use of violence. Just because someone complied before the coercion literally escalated to a gun being pointed in their face doesn't make it any less coercion at gun point. 
If I walk up to someone on the street and say "hey I'm going to take the 45 out of my pocket and spray paint the sidewalk with your brains if you don't hand over your wallet" is there a difference (other than semantics) between that an me actually putting the barrel to his head? Its a spectrum of the intensity of the coercion, but its still coercion.

You never proved that handing over keys to cloud flare was some how worse or insecure.. Still haven't. What specifically are the controls cloud flare has in place for key management and what specifically weak about their key management processes. Key management can be a single point of failure regardless of it being outsourced.  You never established any evidence why one method is better than the other. You never demonstrated how compromising one cloud flare clients keys leads to compromise all their clients keys.  Your research(if you want to call it that)  falls woefully short of anything that could be considered academic. 
So please put up some empirical data,  hell I'll take Gartner research anything else besides wild assumption and conjecture.

you can never find evidence to support anything you are concerned about in regards to dumping. You can bet on speculation and conjecture. Oh what fun that is.

Lets start flooding the front page about the gox collapse while we are at it, I don't think we've beaten that dead horse enough.

@_date: 2015-03-23 16:27:47
this less is more approach always seems the most logical to me. Yeah the exchange knows I bought them originally but do I care about that enough to deal with localbtc....Nope. Especially once the coins leave the exchange I only need say I sent them to someone/something else. They were hacked/stolen/extorted. Whatever reason I want, they have literally no evidence to conclude I control the keys.

Auditing relies on the assembly of facts in order to draw conclusions. Fact is the block chain doesn't store these necessary facts. If I create a wallet fill it with bitcoin and give the private keys over to someone else. This is not recorded in the blockchain. similarly if I buy bitcoin on an exchange and send it to an another wallet there are no facts about who controls that second wallet that can be derived from the blockchain. 
Only thing I know is my wallet was hacked and I don't have access to any bitcoins anymore.

So we agree, my point is,  like op,  most people are obedient slaves who seek to satisfy master first and foremost.  
Ignoring the fact that you aren't a criminal in other areas of the world where bitcoin is considered money not an capital gains taxable asset. The smart play would be to seek out tax shelters outside of USA until USA changes their tune.  Good slaves pay without question.  Rich people know this and they pay lawyers and accountants to allow them to keep their money.  Hell apple keeps hundreds of billions out of reach of the government,  my conclusion is you are also an obedient slave.

I think you have it a bit backwards, if you nuke your drive in their presence they can detain or arrest for obstruction. Nuke it before you get to the airport and have your recovery key somewhere not on your person but at your destination. They can't get from you what you don't know and don't have. In fact you can cite a company or client privacy policy you are adhering to. If you are worried about losing the data if they indefinitely confiscate your device then send what is important ahead of you by mail confirm its arrival before departure. I am not a lawyer but they have a tough case for obstruction if you arrive with an inoperable device and you can't possibly memorize the recovery key there for they cannot coerce a confession or any action because you literally can't do it.

Well a couple of obvious differenes I'm not sure how they play out but obviously people still use and take delivery of physical gold. Secondly there is no way to audit all the gold in existence to determine a baseline for supply. As such I see less "wiggle" room to be shady with bitcoin. Its easily and instantly auditable by anyone allowing an amateur to prove a shady leverage scheme is completely insolvent. Additionally there is no way I can see to collude and control supply.

I disagree. I believe(could be wrong) but banks required lots of federal ...oversight/licensing/etc  Being that MJ is still illegal on federal level they would be putting their entire business at risk. I do not see any bank embracing the industry until MJ is taken off the federal schedule 1.

this applies to any currency/barter/exchange method ever. your logic is fail.

This is a misrepresentation and also an incomplete analysis,  "outsourcing all their security"  is not accurate

Not sure why that's relevant,  if your talking securing bitcoin wallets the assumption should always be your Internet connected device is was or will be compromised. This sends the wrong message that only now all of sudden your mobile is vulnerable.

Thanks for the down votes below but let me explain myself:
I'm sure anyone can spend all day reading and crossposting from every single thing and making some weak link to bitcoin "security" but ...that isn't the intent of this sub. 
The premise that all of a sudden your android device browser is vulnerable, "so beware!", is an inferior security posture to that of "your mobile is always vulnerable so never keep anything on it you don't want to lose permanently or get published in a newspaper"
I'm not saying all security issues are irrelevant to bitcoin I'm saying that posts like this perpetuate the myth you are only at risk when the latest zero day has been publicly disclosed.

Volumetric DDOS doesn't require certs. WAF SERVICE DOES. Now you can complain that you are trusting a 3rd party but you can be assured the compensating controls of a dedicated SOC at a CF OR AKAMAI far exceed those of a start up or even an established conglomerate.

In practice, the BIT will function like a gold ETF. The Bitcoin Investment Trust will hold the actual bitcoins. And each share of the fund will be worth about one-tenth of a bitcoin.

Sounds like the major difference vs. an ETF is the minimum hold time of 12 months? Why not just say that instead of being holierthan thou

OP did you find any technical data in your research? If so you left it out of your post. Where does it say &lt;anywhere&gt; that all those companies hand over there ssl . Also where does it say there are absolutely no compensating controls when they do? This reads like a valid concern but seems like you brought out your jump to conclusions mat too early!
I'm scratching my head here trying to figure out why handing over certs is required for DDOS protection, why would you require deep pack inspection to protect against ddos? Unless you are confusing this with a maybe a WAF service offering???

Ahh so at some point, somewhere in unrelated case(s) there may have been evidence tampering we should dismiss all evidence as unreliable. Seems like a reasonable conclusion. The jury can weigh each piece of evidence individually, and can choose to regard or disregard any potential tampering conspiracies the defense spins. Jury's aren't all stupid though, they understand the process and the science behind evidence.

fortunately our legal system doesn't allow for gaping holes like that. Forensic investigation process would follow tight chain of custody. Establishing a clean and uncontaminated Chain of custody is at the core of each piece of evidence presented in any case. This is especially true for high profile cases, and digital forensics cases. The expert forensicators have to establish the credibility of their processes and tools to ensure beyond a reasonable doubt that their conclusions are completely documented, traceable, auditable and valid. I recommend you get on jury duty or spend some time in an open court. Its a very good learning experience.

The whole DPR fairytale was never substantiated by anything more than what Ulbricht himself stated to his buddy, "oh yeah I'm not DPR anymore" . From a jurors perspective you take into account all evidence and weight each piece individually. That single piece of evidence to support this massive theory is what I would categorize as flimsy and convenient. Meanwhile there was a massive body of evidence providing an extensive timeline that he was DPR and was operating the website at the time he was arrested. So yeah, DPR fairy raises a doubt, it doesn't raise reasonable doubt on a single piece of flimsy and convenient evidence in the shadow of the massive evidence saying otherwise. 
The only charge I probably don't agree with and I have the least evidence about was money laundering charge however he was no doubt running a criminal enterprise and he was no doubt the defacto seller's broker/agent/mandate for every transaction. So yeah conspiracy to traffic narcotics absolutely. I also don't know about the hacking charge but the main charges with the stiffest penalties stick like glue. The sentencing guidelines are what they are and he won't be the first drug kingpin to be lucked up for a long time so he's no martyr here.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:37:09

I don't think you know how extortion works if you think a drug user is an lucrative target. You can point a gun at a rock and demand water all you want but it won't work out for ya. If you are talking about drug dealers robbing other dealers well, that's part of the game and the risk comes with the job. 
And if you are talking about kidnapping that's even further removed from robbery and extortion. I mean you are completely making shit up now. There is no evidence every that someone who but drugs on SR was kidnapped for ransom. That just doesn't happen and would never happen. Unless of course you aren't a drug user but a drug dealer and as mentioned above that risk comes with the job.

I'm not sure how you can't see the direct correlation with how mafia syndicates operate and how SR operated. He replaced the layers of man power, buyers, sellers, runners, enforcers, and managers with software. Thats all it was. Like gangs that have turf and territory where their buyers and sellers are under their protection and ownership. SAME THING JUST ONLINE.

do you have this same feel thousands of times per day as other drug criminals are locked up? 
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:57:35
How can't you see the end result is the same here? 
Maybe it would help to draw out some scenarios? and compare how the two would play out in SR and IRL mafia syndicate. 
1) Seller Registration
SR - sign up and list your products
IRL - 1) ask first then sell, paying a cut for using the territory you are selling in 2) Sell first, get confronted probably robbed and told if you don't stop selling or start kicking up they'll be trouble. They may also stipulate you have to get your supply from their preferred supplier which would ensure seemless transactions in the future.
So in this scenario SR has all the control every step of the way for seller registration it can easily terminate your account via software or disable it. NO such equivalent control exists IRL so there is a man power coercion to exact the same control. 
Outcome is equivalent. you could get into some philosophical debate about coercion and violence but in either case you are paying to sell in a protected territory. The means of protection are merely shifted from physical to software. 
2) Failure to Deliver
SR - This happened with stunning regularity, Sellers would pop up earn a reputation then disappear with a bunch of buyer money. They would create new accounts and repeat the process. There were poor/absent controls in place to prevent this.
IRL - If you were selling in a protected territory there is probably limited recourse for the street level buyer. However this would simply be horrible for business because unlike SR you simple can't change your name and open up shop again. Robbing your customers IRL is a failing strategy. The other scenario of selling to other dealers and trying to rob them also a failing strategy because in protected territory those other dealers may also be protected in which case you would have to answer to the territory manager for any disputes that arise from your shady deals. This is not a good scenario for business. 
In this case there is actually a better control in place IRL than SR. There is little incentive to be rob your customers IRL where there is actual accountability. 
If you feel its helpful for me to walk through additional scenarios I will continue to do so.

well you imply there is no authority but truly the government gets its authority from the people it governs. As seen in a growing number of states major policy changes are happening in regards to MM and gay marriage and a slew of other topics. Fact is the majority of this country still wants drug laws and when that changes so will the laws. Until then you can still do whatever you want but not without consequence.

the point was made originally that adding anything to the page could have caused the same/similar reduction in donations. There was no control in the experiment. The page as it was could possibly not sustain any further changes without hurting its conversion rate. If there was data that showed they individually changed a set of n characteristics on the page(and measured results) and one of those things was adding bitcoin. If, out of the set of n changes, ONLY bitcoin caused a large reduction in conversions then it could be concluded that it was in fact Bitcoin that caused the reduction and NOT any arbitrary change.

that's how this country operates, DPR knew that going into it. If he didn't like the laws he could have ran his enterprise from anywhere else in the world or ya know actually done something productive to change or reform them. Instead all he did was pretend he was the internet tony Montana for a couple years and stupidly (oh so stupidly) get himself caught for it. 
So yeah if you have a moral objection to the laws you can do something about it but crying poor DPR still sounds ridiculous as drug crimes per the fbi statistics is the  cause of arrest in this country to the tune of 1.5 million + per year, what makes DPR so special or above the law?

it differentiates this from a moral perspective (maybe) as morality is subjective its tough to argue but legally there is no difference. I think that was my point.
But even in the SR model there is no absence of violence and coercion from the equation because there was a lot of b2b business on those sites and those dealers are still selling to IRL customers. Further, DPR case evidence shows that there was no absence of extortion and blackmail attempts on DPR and who knows how many dealers were targeted individually.  Further showing that maybe you can relieve some dark elements from the street level user (sell/buy) but in any black market you are going to be a target for extortion and blackmail unless you pay for real life protection.
Your argument are virtual territory doesn't make any sense by the way, I know it doesn't take up space that's why its called virtual and it is precisely why its different from B&amp;M, its by definition not existent in the physical world. And web properties or territories are treated IRL the same as B&amp;M property. There are countless cases and laws on the books to deal with matters in the digital/virtual realm.

you brought up the cost of securing the coins that wasn't the original context and the security of the coins after the transfer doesn't impact the cost of the transfer. Like a wifi connection the cost to transfer bytes is fixed in most cases a monthly charge whether or not you have a password protected access point or not. Luckily with Bitcoin there is a very transparent fixed cost for transactions so there really is no debate to be had here. Good day.

in this country it is. He knew that at he beginning. He isnt the first or the last to be locked up a long ass time for  tryin to be a drug kingpin. In fact he had the opportunity to do what all other drug dealers wish they could...he could have done what he was doing from anywhere in the world.  he chose not to take it. He also had the opportunity to retire phenomenally wealthy before the feds stepped in, he didn't do that either. Can't have any less sympathy.

I think the drug war is stupid. But the drug war wasn't on trial, its not going anywhere espcially since none of you redditors make a single remark when thousands of minorities(not to make it a racial thing but more minorities are in jail from drugs than non) are jailed for drug crimes daily. 
Actually I dropped my support for him from a moral standpoint when I saw he was just like any other  kingpin willing to resort to violence to protect his territory and drug ring from a percieved(or real) threat.

Its a much looser correlation than say actually buying something with your credit/debit card. Which most people do all the time and have no worries about. I don't see there being any mainstream rejection of bitcoinatm on these grounds. As a marketer I'd much rather go after the debit/credit data as well. The connections in the blockchain seem to flimsy,. 
Also to consider is that the lifetime of that coin or coins didn't originate at the ATM. They were mined and spent at least once before that and presumably will be spent many times after that. I just don't see what the value will be of knowing that I bought Bitcoin at some point in time in the past....seems very "so what who cares" to me. More so as it becomes more mainstream.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:54:50
personally I think the drug war is ridiculous. But its currently the law of the land. He knew it going in to it there wasn't and surprises for him or special new legislation created to ensnare him. I don't agree with sympathizing with the guy more than any other kingpin simply because his method of running a drug syndicate was perceived to be innovative and safer. If you want to take it there the traditional mafia provides the same safe atmosphere for black market business. All you need to do is kick up to them and you are under the protection and nobody will mess with your trade. Its the same thing he just replaced mafia org chart and structure with software.

items != transactions. But lets imagine you are correct they had 36.8 individual orders to fill. What makes you think they were processing the payments also in real time? Most were probably credit/debit card which is just an initial approval with multiple days to process. Many were also checking account direct ACH debit which also takes days to process. You are disregarding the actual time involved for payment processing.

I've found that I require a marker board and at least 20 minutes to do it any justice. If that's not available or I don't have that kind of undivided attention(most of the time),  I just give a quick one liner and move on. "Its programmable money, that can be transferred to anyone instantly without the aid of a middle man." If they have more questions about it, I'll ask if they really want to know because its somewhat technical requires some time. I try and dissuade them actually, strangely this piques there curiosity more it seems. 
convincing people who aren't asking for knowledge is futile.

yes but not exactly. Say I went to a fiat atm and withdrew a marked $100 bill. Let say we trace that $100 and it ultimately ends up in the cash register at abc co. Does this mean I shopped or bought something at abc co? Couldn't it have been given to someone else who shopped at abc co? Couldn't it have been given to someone else who gave it to someone else who shopped at abc  co?  See where I'm going with this? With Bitcoin ATM what is provable is that at one time I had the keys to that wallet, it doesn't prove I was the spender.

cheetahs actually have evolved several other mechanisms that make them such prolific runners. Their legs are only part of the equation
Wide nostrils and large lungs combined with a powerful heart and strong arteries provide more oxygen to their muscles. Their huge leg muscles mainly consist of fast twitch fibers, which contract faster than normal muscles. Their small body frame is lightweight and aerodynamic. With long legs, loose hip and shoulder joints, and a flexible spine, cheetahs can cover 7 m (20-25 ft.) in one stride. - See more at:

he said  euphemistically "he did nothing but build a service" like the guy created some open source software for the world to use. Like his only role in this whole thing was that he published some code. Get real he was intimately involved as the broker, courrier, arbiter for all transactions. He replaced the functions of a mafia syndicate with software and profited massively from it. Not only that but he continued to do it despite opportunities to quietly retire rich, bragged about it and apparently gave zero fucks about getting in trouble for it. He was a drug kingpin who is going to jail like all the others before him. 
If this is a we shouldn't have a drug war argument thats something entirely different. Fact is we do and fact is he knew it and chose to ignore it anyway.

Bring up jews and Nazi's to destroy and credibility you had? As well as trump up some irrelevant strawman? DPR lived the majority of his life being a law abiding citizen he made a conscious decision to start and continue to run an illegal drug syndicate online. It wasn't like he was running a legit business then the feds came in and made up all kinds of new rules and laws so they could bust him. Nazi comparison is silly.
