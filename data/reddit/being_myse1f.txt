I think I might have the elegant solution you're looking for.
Let's say I purchase a refrigerator for $1000 or 1 BTC.   You receive it and keep it as BTC for X amount of days (whatever the return period is), and if the I do not return it within that period then you can safely convert your BTC to USD.  In other words, you will have to deal in BTC only until the return period is over.  If I do decide to return it then I can get a full refund for the amount I paid it for, in BTC.
The downside to this is that retailers will have to deal with the volatility while they wait to convert their customer's BTC to USD.  To alleviate this challenge a little bit, the retailer can tell the customers that if they pay in BTC then their return period will be halved or shortened to a certain number of days that the retailer is comfortable with wiating.  
Hopefully the customer will understand the modified return policy when paying with BTC.

Someone once helped me when I started with all this so I'm just sharing the knowledge.  Glad to be of help :)

If Chinese and American exchanges are completely independent then why would their fluctuation affect us?  Technically it shouldn't right?  Is it all just mentality or is there a (financial) link that I'm missing somewhere?

My prediction is with you on this one.  Take a look at the 30 day view (  It's correcting the bubble to it's original trend.

Thanks!  I've been a long time lurker and have seen the days when prices were only a few dollars.  I only wish I knew how to invest back then.  There's quite a learning curve and unfortunately I have fallen for scams, but truly believe there is a future for bitcoins nonetheless.  It's just going through some growing pain.

I shop on Amazon a lot and would definitely use it!  I just heard of Honey from this post and just installed it.  Who doesn't like automatic savings?

It looks pretty simple!  Thanks for the help :)
