I would prefer not to use a sitting duck target like a website for the wallet. But the thing that sucks is the Bitcoin-QT app while it lets me encypt a wallet won't let me run multiple wallets and it won't let me change where the default wallet is located. While mutibit clinet lets you have multiple wallets, change where they are located so i can put them in encrypted truecrypt images and such and using an automator script mount them first and then load the app, but it won't let you encrypt the wallets right in the app. 
One of the reasons I haven't used bit coin is because of the over all lack of native support for Mac platform. I find it funny no one has made a native app at all since there are so many programing professionals i know who use macs. I used linux for a long time but when it comes down to it is like using a mock OS for the work i have to do. It copies the design of other operating systems and while ubuntu is amazing there are just some things that i need that it can never have because of the mentality of the people who are hardcore zealots on it. I'm not about to get windows running either just to use bit coin. 
As for mining and pooling there is a really impressive GUI interface for the pyminer tools so I have been able to use my GPU and CPUS to mine while i sleep. I already have up to 2BTC from just that over the last few days. But the other issue is when it comes to a service like Blockchain, how on earth do they keep running? Do they charge me a fee for their service or something?

bitcoin buying power is limited by places that take for exchange of goods or services and the volatile nature of the fluctuations in price. Also fiat currency won't disappear anytime soon. The ability to run a global internet outside of corptocracy or a stable open democracy is impossible. The level of organization requires stable government and the ability to safely spend money with services like regulated banking, police, fire fighters, yadda yadda.

Old money seldom will allow new money in if they can help it. Oligarchs do not like it when serfs can come in the country club. 
Crypto currency will either become part of fiat currency as in the case with Canada Digital Fiat Currency CAD-COIN they are currently experimenting with or it will be used by people to push out smaller transactions like currently with Bitcoin Core developers with higher and higher fees so it can only be used to transfer between wealthy people who want a digital but semi anonymous wire transfer system even with the block chain system between multiple shell account and less scrupulous fiat money / crypto currency exchange / trade platforms and services.
The fact that a pizza bought for 0.00490 Bitcoin ($20 USD) one day could cost $40 dollars a week or month later is one of my issues with Bitcoin in general. It like using stocks to buy food instead of a currency that has the backing of a government to hopefully stabilized inflation. Government inherently should have some say in the money as a way of course correction to right it to a stable plateau, with a sane moderate government.
The vulture capitalists are the ones you need to watch out for though. The kind who let a country burn down so they can profit from the chaos.

$100,000 is not rich its a nice windfall.
$1,000,000 in liquid currency is well off.
$7,000,000 in liquid currency is the starting point of McMansion level "rich" your children will still need to work and so will you to maintain your "lifestyle"
$100,000,000 in liquid currency is actually the start of multigenerational wealth if you live modestly. 
$1,000,000,000 is cheap table in Monaco world tour wealthy. You will never have to work and if you put those into money markets your children's children's children will not have to work. Anything you do to make more money is pure for the sake of power and control and hording.
