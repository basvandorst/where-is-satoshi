I traded on BTC-E until all of the fuckery happened unfortunately costing me more than I would like. I write all of my bots in c++ and c# depending on what mood I am in. I prefer c/++ and the api because it executes trades much faster than third party tools.

Solar panels, batteries, a data source (phone/hotspot) and an inverter.
Use the solar to run during the day and the batteries in case of a high power load.

It's unfair that renaissance faires have an extra letter than fare or fair.

In an exchange it would be someone else's piggy bank.

Just back up the wallet. It will give you a key/pdf to keep. That is assuming you are using a  single address account. 
If it's in a paper wallet nothing will happen. It just stays there.

Having your own private keys would be like having cash in your pocket.
