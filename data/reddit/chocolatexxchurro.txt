The more comparable asset classes to compare Bitcoin with are gold and government bonds.

I doubt it. People are slowly beginning to lose faith in government currencies, and will continue to lose faith the further down the QE path we inevitably go. 
The fact that governments will attempt to ban crypto will make people double down on it's legitimacy. It's the Streisand Effect. Natural law inevitably wins out over statist law over time.

It's still a state granted monopoly in order to issue currency. I understand it's not technically apart of the government, but this responsibility still lies with the state.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:22:32
I don't disagree. I've been listening to many hedge fund guys (Buffet, Druckenmiller, Gundlach, etc), and they express their negative views on Bitcoin publicly. I bet they don't want it to eat into their net worth, especially if they own a lot of gold. 
I just can't imagine people not questioning government overreach to ban cryptos because of reasons such as "money laundering" or "energy hogs". We live in the age of the Internet and the younger generations in the US don't care much for gold. I guess time will tell though.

We're going to have ZIRP forever from the major central banks within just a few years. That's a major milestone. Now the only other thing they can do to stimulate is print money. I mean, even half of European debt is already in negative territory, so central banks will need to get more creative with their QE.
During the 2020s Bitcoin will become a more obvious fallback to the inevitable demise of fiat. The cracks are already beginning to show.

Bitcoin separates money from the State. Without the power to issue currency, the State can no longer dishonestly steal purchasing power away from it's citizens in order to fund a war the citizens don't approve of. A Bitcoin future is a future for world peace.

The point of Bitcoin is to keep the Bitcoin yourself.
You're thinking of it like a stock. It's not. It's a commodity, like a digital version of gold.
You'd want to keep it yourself because the value is in the gold/Bitcoin, not the dollars it appreciates in.

Over the next decade currencies will fail outside of the US first as people will keep their money in US treasuries since we're guaranteed to pay them back even if it means printing money. 
To be honest I think at that point the US won't even get hyperinflation because people will just switch over to Bitcoin by then.
The US is most buoyant turd in the bowl.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:43:09
You're operating under the assumption that fiat currencies will remain stable for the foreseeable future.
The cracks in their weaknesses are already beginning to show. It will become apparent when central banks undergo even more unconventional monetary policies to combat the next recession.
[For example](
The dollar will be the last one to fail, but the rest of them are going to fail one after another over the next decade.

Sure if you want to convert it back into fiat then you're fine with Robinhood. 
However, I wouldn't trust all of your wealth in fiat in this day and age. Most people who understand Bitcoin and its purpose don't "invest" in it -- they buy it as a hedge against fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:16:24
You're right, governments won't like it, and will probably do anything to stop it.
But this is worth the fight. Without central banks, governments can't create inflation in order to fund wars.
It'll also be extremely hard to fight it if/when currencies end up devaluing.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:01:20
Here's my theory on the recent surge.
Fed governors have been discussing unconventional monetary policy to combat the upcoming recession, such as pegging interest rates further down the yield curve by printing money to buy Treasuries. This is in place of already discussed negative interest rates because it would potentially cause a panic. They're also meeting in Chicago in early June.
Just my two cents on a reason if there's really any reason at all.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:28:54




You're falsely equivocating depositing money in a bank as a non productive mattress stuffer. In a real economy, savings lead to investment by allowing funds to be loaned out for productive endeavors.

There's no guarantee that there's enough real gold to back up the paper gold.

I'm not a gold bug, I'm simply explaining why it's price isn't moving. If more people are buying the real thing, it's price doesn't move. If people buy paper gold like GLD, it does.
If anything my reasoning is pro bitcoin

What makes you say that. All signs point to negative interest rates, which will keep the debt bubble growing. Plus the US will never default, were much more likely to monetize the debt.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:36:30


Banks are financial intermediaries where people can take loans for productive endeavors like an entrepreneur opening a business. This would be more apparent if interest rates would be determined in the free market and the creation of credit wasn't dependent asset prices rising.
It's not sustainable because eventually the invisible hand will slap you back. Supply and demand are fundamental laws of nature, even the supply and demand of money.


Nobody is saying not to invest your money, but in the current financial system doesn't make sense to just throw all of your money in equities and junk bonds in order to seek higher yields. Treasuries and savings account barely even keep up with inflation.

@_date: 2019-05-12 18:56:05


Lmao, no shit. Milton Friedman is one of my favorite humans of all time, and the fact that you're using his quote in the wrong way pisses me off. 
I'm not sure why you're trying to pidgeonhole my argument as "don't invest in stocks" -- obviously everyone should keep most of their portfolio in an index fund at the very least. In fact you're the one ironically thinking there is a free lunch by seeking high yields like junk bonds assuming you're going to get all of your money back. Even the stock market itself has literally quadrupled in value over the past decade. It doesn't make any sense fundamentally -- it's only because the Fed is desperately seeking to prop up asset prices.
All I'm saying is that if banks were real financial intermediaries instead of [credit creating institutions ]( deposits would have a functional role.
It doesn't matter anyways because the banks will inevitably fail again with this practice and thats why you need to hold a commodity like Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-14 17:10:03


I'm betting that many fiat currencies will slowly lose value (moreso than ever before), and people will realize it and hedge themselves to a commodity like Bitcoin. Because of this vendors will accept Bitcoin, like many already have in places in Europe and even Venezuela.
I don't think you're aware of the unconventional monetary policies central banks have taken the part decade, and will further take to counter another recession. Even the United States. If we werent the reserve currency and forced other countries to hold dollars, we'd be more aware. Bitcoin is essentially a hedge against inflation. Some fiat currencies will definitely be worth virtually zero, especially those who have dollar denominated debt.
Using leverage is risky, but probably a good bet if you can make it a long term one. So kudos to you.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:33:24

You should read The Bitcoin Standard and learn about central banks/history of money in general. Or even listen to some speeches by Peter Schiff. He's a gold shill but is good at explaining the modern financial system.
I wish I was more aware years earlier, I would have bought in much sooner.

It's because they ruin the credibility of Bitcoin. They all try and mimic properties of Bitcoin and are ultimately less secure. Plus the network effects of Bitcoin are already more or less set in stone.
The real thing (Bitcoin) will take time to improve it's scalability/off chain networks, but the free market is already weeding out the alts.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:35:55
You're mistakenly assuming there won't be other layers on top of the blockchain. When fiat is on the verge of becoming meaningless, payment services like Visa and MasterCard will adopt bitcoin as a method of payment. 
The payments will eventually be cleared on the blockchain. Of course Bitcoin isn't nearly there yet, it'll take years for it's infrastructure to grow. 
Regardless Bitcoin will be treated like gold similar to how free banking was ran in the 19th century pre-Fed

Genuine question, but what real life value does it have?

I'd probably consider myself a Bitcoin maximalist. But how do people view LTC?
Right now ETH is ~10% (trash imo) and LTC is 2.5%. Since there's only 4x as many litecoin in existence as Bitcoin, would you say its undervalued?
From my understanding LTC is very similar to bitcoin except for name recognition. Am I incorrect?

It's a speculative digital commodity, similar to how when most people didn't know how gold was a useful system of accounting thousands of years ago when people were bartering or using seashells.

@_date: 2019-05-13 20:24:11
Agreed. 
But that won't come until we reach ~90%.
These alt believers don't understand why Bitcoin was made, and gold won't ever be priced accurately since its price is not driven by pure market driven supply and demand.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:41:04
If you want to explain Bitcoin to someone, the proper way to do it is to say that it is a **speculative commodity** because that's what it is.
Explain to them that this is similar to how people were finding out that the value of gold as a superior way to transact as opposed to barter or seashells due to it's scarcity.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:06:56
I actually agree with you. Bitcoin is a digital commodity, so you can't technically invest in a commodity.
But the value in the future is infinity because fiat currencies ultimate value is 0. People will find value in the fact that it can't be manipulated by a central authority.

@_date: 2019-05-15 19:20:29
When you or I buy bitcoin, it ultimately affects the price because of the increase in demand. 
Not the same case if you buy gold bullion, paper gold moves the price.
Banks have been shorting the paper gold/silver price while buying physical gold and silver for years. that's why the price isn't moving.
Bitcoin is a better hedge because people who will inevitably need to buy it all around the world will move the price for those who got in earlier.
