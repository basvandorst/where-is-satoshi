Coinsimple does exactly what you are looking for and is free. They unfortunately were not able to raise funds to develop the service further, but have kept it running. Compatible with receiving payment to static addresses, electrum, bitpay, coinbase or xpub from any BIP32 wallet. I use them for my invoices

I lost nothing. I used Bitfinex to sell bitcoin and my bitcoin was on the exchange for no more than 5 minutes. I deposited, sold, withdrew everything. I don't keep bitcoin on exchanges or custodial wallets. The only exception is a balance I hold on a debit-card backed wallet. The utility of that debit card is limited to an amount I am willing to lose.

The relationship between adoption and latency is actually reversed. The more nodes, the faster lightning gets, the lower the cost gets, the easier it is to find a route. Network effects. Right now 2hat you're seeing is slow lightning because of few nodes.

The import function for an HD Wallet should keep searching until it has found 20 consecutive "empty" addresses. This number is known as the "gap limit". There have been suggestions to increase it to 100, meaning that import will continue until there are 100 consecutive empty addresses. Theoretically this means all 2 billion receive addresses in each account could be used. Practically, it would make recovery very difficult and slow. Most likely recovery would require custom software, but it can be done.

This is not a secure mechanism, nor is it resilient to loss. 
The BIP39 standard already has the security/resillience properly balanced. You should use it and not try to invent your own. 
* Store multiple copies of the seed in physically secure locations
* If you are concerned about physical security of those locations, you should use a passphrase in addition to the seed. You can store the passphrase in different locations (never the same). 
* Or use a Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, to split your seed into separate copies in a 3-of-5 or 2-of-3 scheme. There is a BIP39 adaptation of SSSS.

No one else chains to it, because it is invalid by everyone else's rules. Congratulations, you just created a fork of bitcoin without any economic participants (exchanges, merchants, users), therefore you can't sell any of your coins to pay for the electricity, because they're not on the same chain as the exchanges, users or merchants. Your electricity bill comes due. You go bankrupt and join the pile of other failed coins. Meanwhile, the 49% continue mining the "other" chain, the one with all the users and economy on it, a bit slower, for 2 weeks. Then the difficulty drops 51% on that chain and it continues at 10 minute blocks, without you. No one really remembers you a year later, other than as a cautionary tale: the miner who lost it all trying to mess with consensus.

Andreas M. Antonopoulos here. 
What you're asking about already exists and has been developed in collaboration with many of the biggest companies in bitcoin...
I'm on the steering committee of the Crypto-Currency Security Standard (CCSS), which is currently in draft but is otherwise a very detailed and comprehensive security and audit standard for crypto-currencies.
This standard is likely to be used by audit firms to audit exchanges and wallets that can also use it as a guideline to "best practices".

If you have a child hash, you can re-create its parent only if you also have the "other" child. The blue blocks are the "other" child you need to reconstruct each parent. 
To prove the Hk is in the merkle tree, a node would give you the blue blocks. With Hk and the blue blocks you can reconstruct the path to the root by computing the dashed-blue blocks for yourself. First, you hash HK and HL together to produce H_KL. To move up to the next parent you now need H_KL's sibling which is H_IJ. Combining H_IJ and H_KL gives you the parent H_IJKL. Now you need its sibling (HMNOP) to compute the parent. 
Green - what you have
Blue - the proof given to you
Dotted Blue - what you compute to get to the root.

Make sure you don't accidentally forget the BIP38 passphrase you used. Before you send any money to one of the wallets, test the passphrase (you can do this offline with Canton Beckers CD) to make sure you can decrypt to private key again. 
The BIP38 encrypted wallets are then safe, you do not need to worry about anyone seeing the keys. Instead of sending to professional printers, you might find it easier to go to a Kinkos and have a simple plain paper printout you make at home and get it laminated in plastic. That will keep it secure from damage, water etc. 
The CD doesn't leave anything in RAM. Just power down after using and you're ok. 
Not sure what you mean about "Encrypting the private keys puts out several more keys which I am new too. I dont have to write them down right? Just archive the encryption html from canton becker (the CD) to be safe I can still encrypt it in 5-7 years?"
Can you clarify or re-phrase?

Andreas here. 
This was not me explaining "why charity is so important". This was me making a cynical and tongue-in-cheek observation about how we need to shift the narrative from drugs to charity, because charity is a big part of the bitcoin phenomenon and it is a lot harder for the media to paint their usual smears when talking about it. 
Taking it out of context like this makes me sound like a total douchebag who wants to use charitable giving as a marketing scheme to enrich bitcoiners. If I read this without context, I'd be the first throwing rotten tomatoes at this Andreas. 
Those who know me probably have heard me talk about how important bitcoin is for financial empowerment of the unbanked and underbanked, the developing world, non-governmental aid organizations and charitable organizations. But from this quote I sound like an idiot.

It's a pretty good guide. I would skip one part, where he suggest saving the PDF of the paper wallets on dropbox. Even though they are encrypted with BIP0038, that would defeat the purpose of two-factor security by making the paper wallet available online. 
Also, I would be careful not to select a password that is too hard, you are more likely to forget it. 4-8 words selected randomly (correct battery horse staple) will provide enough entropy for the BIP0038 as long as you protect access to the paper wallets and put a tamper-evident sticker (scratch-off) or a sealed envelope or something to ensure they haven't been "stolen" by someone with a camera.

While I don't necessarily think that this will replace Capitalism or Materialism, I like the term Cultural Capitalism - the link between currency and culture, as currency is used to tokenize the marketplace of ideas. 
I have spoken of currency as a language for expressing value and how I see a future of multiple currencies competing, as expressions of various subcultures. Some will also have broader monetary value, most will only have value for the members of the small group using them.

This wasn't about decimating anyone, it was about presenting facts in a calm way and not getting sucked into the "bitcoin is doomed" narrative. 
A bit of background on how this works, and why it's so hard to do:
I get an email at noon that says "we need someone on screen today, can you make it at 2pm?". 10 minutes to confirm, find the local bloomberg studio, send talking points by email to help the journalist understand the issue. At this point I have no idea who's going to be on. Solo or debate?
T-45 min
Scramble to iron a shirt, get ready, leave 20 minutes later, drive across town to the studio, carrying a shirt on a hanger. 
T-15 minutes
Arrive at studio, get through security, change into shirt. Check myself for 2 seconds to make sure I don't have crap stuck in my teeth or look deranged. They won't take me into studio until just before the show.
T-6 minutes
Go into studio, sit on a chair facing a robotic camera while the tech puts an earpiece in my ear. Below the camera is a screen but it only shows my own image. I'm instructed not to look at the screen, but to look into the lens.  I can't see or hear anyone else.
T-2 minutes. 
I can just about hear the technicial from NY or CA or wherever checking light levels. Dab a tissue on my head because my receding hairline is shiny, while practicing lines in my head as I will only have 5 seconds to respond. 
T-1 minute.
I hear "break for commercials. Mr. Antonopoulos, please pronounce your name for me? We go in 45 seconds". I stare into a camera, I can't see anyone else, there's no monitor. All I hear is commercials on the earpiece. I'm alone in a room, staring at a lens. 
"Mr. Antonopoulos, Casey here, we're going in 15 seconds, are you ready?". 
T-10 seconds
Smile, try not to seem frazzled or angry or confrontational no matter what they say. 
"Bitcoin is blah blah blah, we have Andreas Antonopoulos, Mark Williams and blah blah"
Oh shit, Mark Williams is the Fed shill, **this will be interesting**. They start talking. I have no idea who's there or who's talking. I think I recognize the voice of the two reporters. Then Matt cues me, I start talking. They cut me off, I graciously yield. Can't be shouting over someone. I can't really hear them while I'm talking. Keep smiling.
Mark Williams start spreading FUD. Reporter cuts in with statement about hacker printing bitcoins. I try to answer, but I won't have time to explain mining, so all I can say is that it is based on trust-through-computation. I have 5 seconds to make my point. 
Williams doing FUD. I bring up NASDAQ flash crash. 
I think I got Williams riled up when he was yelling "Misinformation" at me, but I was trying to just smile and be amused without seeming condescending. Unflappable. 
Before I know it it's all over. They cut to commercials. I got 3 chances to speak, without shouting over them. Earpiece goes quiet. I've had no chance to even evaluate what happened. It's been 15 minutes since I walked into the building and 4 minutes since I sat down. 
Now on to twitter to see how it was received. I hope I did well, but can't really tell. Editor send me a note saying "that was a great discussion! Thank you for coming!". All I can think is: That was debate theater with talking heads and no facts, not a great discussion, but what passes for journalism these days. I think I didn't fuck up and appeared calm and cogent. 
Mark Williams was also on the same one-way remote studio setting, it's very hard for him too. I have respect for the effort at least. 
Trust me, it's harder than it appears on screen. Esprit d'Escalier is easy. Actually doing it is hard.

As much as I appreciate the attention and support, this posting seriously undercuts the efforts of many others. Just because I have experience with public speaking does not in any way diminish the efforts of others or their contributions.
I am also quite self-interested, like any human. I get my ego stroked by public appearances and I succumb to the temptation of mistaking attention for bitcoin as attention for me, a struggle I face every day trying not to lose perspective. 
If you try to elevate me like this, I will fall flat on my face. In the end, I am just as flawed as everyone else in this community and the community is about much more than me. I simply reflect and express the incredible intelligence, compassion and dedication of hundreds of others who are kind enough to educate me on a daily basis.

No, blockchain does not store copies of your keys unencrypted and has no access to your funds. Transactions are created client-side in your browser without sending the encryption keys to the server. If you use the chrome or firefox extension, you can also protect against changes in the code as it stores a local copy and uses that instead of downloading javascript, in case you were worried about that.

The result of this error was that several tables were corrupted. Due to the size of these tables, the restore process takes a very long time. We have to pull terabytes from secondary, load them up and the re-index and re-sync to the latest blocks and transactions. This, after ensuring we fixed the problem and it won't happen again. That's why the service is coming back in stages and why it has been slow.

In my defense, there's a much broader context to this, it was part of a one hour discussion, not a 4 minute snippet. What I was saying is that I believe these changes need to be in the core protocol and that the core developers, quite naturally, because of their position and public scrutiny are least able to implement such things. My argument was that I'd like to see many more developers write code to achieve these goals. 
I don't expect the core developers to implement anything that I'm not willing to code myself, which is why I am active in code development around anonymity and remixers, just not using my real name. Opinion is worth nothing in open source, code is the only thing that matters and I'm working in that space too.

Choose how you spend your tips and donations, but don't imagine I'm bitcoin rich or have any investments in this space.

I spoke to Dorian and his lawyer is in fact running this. However, let me be clear: I do not endorse this fund or this lawsuit and I suggest people are very careful before donating. 
In my opinion, the lawyer is trying to raise money through the bitcoin community because of the success of the original fundraiser. However, I very much doubt Dorian will ever see a penny of this money, or succeed in a lawsuit.
That said, this is in fact Dorian's lawyer and Dorian did agree to do this.

In simple terms, multisig is a way to lock an amount so that it needs multiple signatures to unlock and spend in a new transaction. Like a corporate bank account that needs two signatures on a check in order to spend money. 
First, you gather a number of keys that will be used to sign transactions. The public keys are combined in a "redeem" script that defines how many will be needed to sign transactions. For example, you could put 6 public keys in the script, and set it so that at least 3 of the keys are needed to spend. This is a 3-of-6 mutli-sig. 
Once you have the recipe (the "redeem" script) defining the parameters for making withdrawals, that script is converted to a special script address, which is a bitcoin address starting with a "3" instead of a "1" 
Now, any money sent to the script address can only be spent in subsequent transactions if the transactions include signatures from at least 3 of the 6 keys that were in the script used to create the address. Anytime the owners of those keys want to spend, they create a transaction (from 3address to recipient) and then sign it, one after another, with enough keys to make it valid. That transaction can then spend the money.

You create the paper wallets offline, prior to extracting the keys from the wallet. You can add a printer to a running Ubuntu liveCD system. 
Keep a copy of the paper wallet public keys, so that you can use them as the destination address for the transaction you create and sign with your wallet keys. 
Then install a bitcoin client (bitcoind or Armory) in an Ubuntu LiveCD. You can run the bitcoin client in offline mode with a wallet file copied to a USB stick without a copy of the blockchain, so you can use the wallet functions from command line, or GUI. You can then extract the wallet keys, create and sign a transaction and then save that transaction in a file on the USB stick. 
Power down, then push the signed transaction onto the bitcoin network on any other machine (doesn't need to be secure). 
Essentially, you are using the LiveCD as the Offline component of an Armory cold-storage setup, with another copy of Armory "online" to create the transaction, but without access to the keys. 
PS. I can help you step-by-step if you like.

This is in response to a specific question and a bit out of context. The question was "why can't the government just do a 51% attack on bitcoin". 
Keep in mind that I speak more broadly about the consensus mechanism and the fact that governments are not trying to stop bitcoin or likely to use 51% attacks. This was the last question and I answered it a bit more humorously, but it is not a good answer that stands alone out of context. There are a lot of complex forces at play and 51% attacks are the least likely mechanism of attack against a cryptocurrency. More likely is a legal attack against the merchants. However that's not what I was asked... Take it with a grain of salt, at the end of a 40 minute talk.

It's not hard to do, you can use a multisig escrow transaction with the escrow key held by an attorney. The stock certificate would also be sent to the attorney, until the wager is settled. Firms like empoweredlaw.com can probably handle high value escrow deals involving stock. Not sure about the legality of such wagers, that would depend on jurisdiction and scope.

Your browser encrypts the private keys (twice if you have a secondary password) and then sends us a blob of encrypted data, which is stored on our servers. When you log on, we send the blob (based on the wallet identifier) and you have to enter a password to decrypt the blob in your browser. We never see the password and never see the unencrypted blob or the keys within. We don't even have the public keys or addresses unencrypted.

Vetting the administrators of a public software site, before tweeting a link to SOURCE code, which did not contain any malware. Are you serious?
Who does that? Show me one person in the industry who vets the admins of a site before tweeting a link to source code. 
If that was a reasonable expectation of anyone in any industry, twitter would be shutdown. What you're saying is that I should never tweet a link to anything.
You are grasping at straws. I make mistakes, I will be the first to admit them. I have made several. But this was not my mistake and the expectation that I could somehow predict or prevent someone from adding a file after I tweeted a link to a source code package is preposterous.

The blog entry states exactly what Blockchain received as the reason: "Unresolved issue". That's all they said, with no identified issue that was "unresolved", or any opportunity to... resolve it.

I was asked on an interview recently: "How do you make sure your opinion is heard by the core devs". 
I responded: My opinion is WORTHLESS. All that matters is CODE. I write code (at the periphery, not core) for bitcoin and it is worth more than any opinion. 
Please don't confuse advocacy and education with a demand that others write the code that I think is needed. As Gavin says above: patches welcome. If you like my advocacy and opinion, help implement it as code and submit it to the core devs. 
CODE talks. Talk walks.
Thank you Gavin for being gracious in your response. I agree 100%  - patches welcome.

This tweet was simply in response to a rather strange question. Don't read so much into it. It's a bit like DRM, in that you control things (bitcoin) with encryption keys. But it is not a generalizable DRM system for things like media and I certainly don't think that's a good use of the tech. I support open source and make all my work available under open source licenses. I think that DRM for creative content is lame and counter-productive.

Blockchain users,
All Blockchain services have been restored. This includes the blockchain explorer, API functions and of course, the web wallet service.Note that there may be some performance issues as many customers rush in, causing an above average spike of traffic.
You will now be able to access the services exactly as you did before the outage. Just log in using your browser or mobile application and enter your password and second-factor authentication, if enabled. Your wallet has not been affected by the outage and everything should be exactly as you left it.
Thank you for your patience during our service outage. We understand how frustrating it can be to be unable to access funds and we would like to take every precaution necessary to ensure this does not recur. Our team has worked non-stop to ensure services are returned to you in a timely manner.
During the outage, many users gained access to their funds using a wallet backup. We designed the Blockchain service to offer independence to our users, so their funds are not compromised even in the case of a disaster or outage that affects Blockchain. We published instructions explaining exactly how to import your wallet backup into Multibit, allowing you to make transactions from your wallet. If you don’t have a wallet backup, you can make one now by using the Backup option on the Wallet Home page and selecting from Dropbox, Email or Google Drive. Make sure you have a strong primary password and a secondary password so that your wallet backup is not vulnerable in case your PC is compromised. Blockchain’s design is based on the principle of giving users 100% control of their funds. We don’t hold your keys and we don’t hold you hostage. You are your own bank.
Should you have any questions, please contact our helpdesk
We are constantly working to upgrade our services to meet the performance and resilience expectations of our rapidly increasing user base. We take pride in our work and care deeply about our customers, so this outage was humbling and painful for us too. We will do everything we can to regain your trust and make sure this doesn’t happen again. We will spend the next several days analyzing what happened and will provide more detail in a future report.
We thank you for your patience and support
Blockchain Team

Given the nomination of Mellon to the board, nobody should be surprised when the Chamber of Digital Commerce recommends regulations requiring identity to be tied to every bitcoin address and thereafter enabling blacklisting of certain recipients backed by mandatory audits and fines. 
With regulations like that, bitcoin will perfectly mirror the current financial system and all its broken mechanisms for protecting entrenched and corrupt incumbents. The one thing such regulations will not do is protect consumers or prevent crime. All it will do is re-concentrate power in those who already have too much power.
Beware of those who tell you that the only way to get "permission" from the governments and banks is to give up the very essence of bitcoin by adopting terrible ideas like blacklisting and mandatory identity.

There are more way to talk to the core devs than IRC. 
All of this stuff about my book and my relationship with core developers and the heated discussions on github 18 months ago has nothing to do with the security report. It's more about your personal issues with me. I'm not sure why you dislike me, but you're making it transparently obvious that you are trying to make this about me, rather than about the security issue. Your efforts to attack me on three different fronts are quite obvious.

Andreas here,
I un-nominate myself. 
While I appreciate the support, the job is much bigger than any individual and does not need to be centralized. 
We do need some coordination in the industry for moments of crisis so we can help each other understand what is going on, who's working on a fix and how to best communicate. In fact, that is already happening and this week was a great example of that. There were 20-30 people collaborating actively on IRC and by email on this from the first moment we realized there was a bot making this a problem for everyone. People from companies not affected were working with those affected with a huge assist from the core devs. The problem was clarified, the solutions discussed and then the message was coordinated so that we could do press releases that were clear and consistent. Within an hour there was a coordinated response.
But we don't need centralized PR and I certainly don't want to be in that. That doesn't scale. We need people from every part of bitcoin to write articles, to explain, to speak up, to call editors, to write letters to editors and to contact their local journalists. In every city, in every town, every paper, every local radio station, every local TV station. If you are someone who can speak about bitcoin clearly and is not afraid of the spotlight, find your local news media and tell them they have a local resource for interviews. When something happens, write up some "talking points" that explain things for mainstream audience and send them to a few journalists in your local media, give them a helping hand. Before long they will be calling you for explanation and comment, then they will quote you, then they will interview you. A local face is much better than some Greek with a freaky name from a studio in a far away metropolis. 
**You** are the PR department, you just haven't stepped up to the job yet. No one invited me to do this, I just started doing it, you can too.

It has now officially been validated by the audience, so I'm making an audio show "bitcoin saves capitalism" and then you will hear it in a few weeks on my TV interviews.

I created this photo to make a joke and to use that to raise money for charity. I was able to raise about $600 in tips  (people donating to make me stop posting silly pictures of myself) and donated to RAINN (rainn.org) a charity for women who are victims of rape and incest and need shelters from abuse. I have supported that charity for years and I saw an opportunity to use self-ridicule to raise awareness and money for that cause.

This is incorrect in so many ways. Bitcoins are not stored on wallets, wallets store keys.  A coin is not 1GB. That doesn't even make any sense.
The key storage is independent of the value of bitcoin. The hierarchical deterministic wallet structure, used in Trezor and other wallets, can store an enormous number of keys each of which can manage any amount of bitcoin. 
There is no limit to the amount of bitcoin that can be managed by a single Trezor.

That was one of the most genuinely fun and simultaneously excruciatingly difficult interviews I've done so far. 
I start the day with news of Charlie's arrest, then get blindsided non-stop with Brian's web news debunking stream, until they dump a story about Russia banning it, mid-show. At 2hrs 45min, I need to pee like crazy. Problem is, there are 15 min left and we're live. They should have a warning about that, seems a lot of guests have... squirmed.
At the same time, wow! Joe's a genuinely nice and warm person who enjoys talking with others, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.

The bug is apparently related to the display of balances and is a medium criticality bug: To clarify, it does not allow attackers to spend money or compromise balances.
The development team has a fix that is currently going through our testing process, preparing for deployment across our servers. It may require some planned downtime and therefore has to be carefully scheduled.
We have had this bug fix ready for a few days now and we were scheduling it for deployment. Due to the complexity of a large global infrastructure, we can't push changes willy-nilly into the infrastructure without sufficient testing and a deployment plan that ensures we do not introduce other problems when we fix something.
I am aware that we did not communicate well with the author who notified us of this vulnerability, but we had a working fix ready for deployment. We are a small team and we have to work deliberately rather than hastily, to ensure we don't introduce bugs.
It is disappointing that the author released this message to score points, instead of following responsible disclosure practices and coordinating with blockchain.
As a reminder, blockchain.info operates a security bounty program managed through Crowdcurity. Security researchers who submit fully documented security vulnerabilities following the responsible disclosure principles, receive a reward up to 1 BTC per vulnerability. To date, Blockchain has distributed more than a dozen reward bounties to responsible security researchers.

saivann is not a core developer, he is a web maintainer. There was an attempt to pull a 'coup' on the bitcoin.org page to exclude Jon Matonis and Roger Ver from being mentioned as press representatives. The former is now the chairman of the Foundation...
At the time, a group of core developers assumed that their control over the domain allowed them to create policy on who could speak about bitcoin. They pretended that a pull request was the "right" way to make changes and then changed the rules 17 times as I brought more and more pressure by making these shenanigans public on bitcointalk.org and getting the community involved. In the end, this led to some significant changes in the management of the domain and even Sirius stepped in. I am proud of the fact that I took a strong stance against political games that attempted to dilute the voice of prominent bitcoin advocates and backed my actions with broad community support. 
I did not try to get a core developer fired. I do not have bad blood with any core developers. I communicated with all of them privately and we resolved any lingering issues that were caused by passion. You're stirring up shit for no reason.

You can use your backup at any time to access your wallet through multibit. This is not the same as "removing" funds from blockchain, because we never store your funds, only your encrypted wallet. We do not have access to your keys, only the encrypted wallet which we store as a backup. 
We will resume normal services before the max 72 hrs we promised. Your funds are safe, but you can always use an external client like Multibit to check for yourself and then continue to use blockchain.info when we resume services.

@_date: 2014-02-26 04:46:34
Agreed! 
This was a limited scope "spot-check" as you called it, I think that's a fair and accurate assessment. I explicitly detailed both the goals and the process so that it was clear exactly what the scope was. It was intended only to re-assure jittery markets by ensuring they had funds in cold storage and were not operating like complete nincompoops (aka Gox). 
That's no tto say they're not a lot more sophisticated than that, only that I didn't check beyond the scope of a spot-check.

@_date: 2014-02-18 00:00:28
Andreas here,
That's not what I'm saying and it has nothing to do with whether Gox is solvent or not. I am talking about off-blockchain transactions.
In fact, Gox keeps most of their coins off the system in cold storage and only a small percentage in the online "hot" wallet. This means that they probably didn't lose much in the withdrawal fraud, which makes it more likely they are fully solvent. 
I have done recent interviews where I state that I believe Gox *is* solvent:
- I have no reason to believe otherwise, have never seen bad faith from Gox or Karpeles, only bad management. 
- Incompetence explains everything very well, no need to attribute malice of fraud.

I am someone who deals with journalists every day because of bitcoin and I am very familiar with their ability to misquote, to quote out of context and to twist your words around. I believe very little of what I read since I started reading my own words distorted to mean the opposite of what I say. Now I avoid journalists who I cannot trust to represent my words correctly. I research them before I talk to them. 
I hope all this attention will blow over. Already, two days later, most of the media are laughing at Newsweek and fewer people believe them. Gradually, they will leave your brother alone. This community will respect your privacy and we will leave you alone too. I hope you find peace and can return to a normal, quiet life.

The book shipped from O'Reilly's printing press on Dec 10th. Major booksellers received and started shipping to customers on Dec 20th. Amazon US has been shipping to customers for the past week. I've received two pre-ordered copies myself already. 
Not sure why it would take as long as January 15th to 21st, other than they ran out of stock filling previous pre-orders. Keep in mind that O'Reilly made it available for pre-order in April and Amazon made it available for pre-order in August, so there may be a big backlog of orders to ship. I don't know how quickly they filled the first print-run, but they print new batches on-demand on a weekly basis.

I have no information or knowledge on the status of the keys or the identity of SN. I cannot confirm or deny Will's statement. 
I think an even better result would be if SN created transactions that sent all the coins to a provably un-spendable output, thereby demonstrating destruction of the coins. Don't need to prove destroying the keys, just use the keys to provably destroy the coins.

The server sends Javascript code to the browser, which then runs it locally. The browser then generates private keys locally on your machine. The private keys are stored in a JSON bundle, together with the bitcoin addresses, address book and various settings. The bundle is then AES encrypted with your password as the encryption key. For extra security, your password is first "stretched" with PBKDF2 key-streching algorithm (between 2000 and 20,000 rounds, depending on your settings), before it is used as the encryption key. The encrypted bundle is backed up on Blockchain servers. 
Additionally, if you specify a "secondary key" in your settings, then all the private keys are first encrypted with that before being put in the bundle and the entire thing is encrypted with your primary password. 
No private keys are ever stored on the server side, only encrypted wallets.

by generating a vanity address of 1Dorian, I locked in 6 characters, forcing most people to check the *following* 2-3 characters to confirm it. If I had just done a 1XYZPDQ address randomly, then someone could do a vanity of 1XYZPDR and because most people only check the first 2-3 characters, they'd miss the scam. This way, it is much harder to fake.

The point _is_ the public key, because the point is what is used to verify signatures made by the private key. The encoding of this public key is simply that: an encoded public key. The encoded public key is a number made by adding a prefix of either 04 or 02/03 if it is compressed, as 04xy, 02x or 03x, where x and y are the coordinates of the point. That number is then hashed into a bitcoin address. 
For more details, see chapter 4 of my book on github:

UPDATE: 
Service Outage Update &amp; How to Import a Wallet Backup
Dear users,
We apologize for our extended outage period. We are working very hard to ensure our services return 100% as soon as possible. As we mentioned previously, the outage was caused by a bug in some database handling code. Please rest assured that your wallets are safe and this outage does not affect the security of funds or the completion of executed transactions.
Unlike other services that have ownership over private keys, Blockchain is superior because it allows users to access their private keys, thus enabling them to have access to their funds under circumstances such as this. It is very important for us to emphasize how crucial it is that users make regular backups of their wallets. Doing so will allow users to import their funds into a wallet client such as MultiBit and therefore avoid the headache and stress of being unable to access their funds, for whatever reason.
Instructions on how to import a wallet backup via MultiBit:
Click here to download MultiBit. Please click here for instructions on how to import a wallet.aes.json file into MultiBit.
Please note:
After the import, MultiBit then replays the blockchain from the replay date to find the transactions for the new private keys. For blockchain.info wallets the blockchain must be replayed from the first block. This can take up to an hour on a wifi connection (depending on the speed of the computer you connect to). It is best just to leave MultiBit to sync the blockchain on its own.
If you don’t have a wallet backup, please fill out a helpdesk request here.
Thank you for your patience. We will continue to communicate throughout our resolution of this issue.
Blockchain Team

On a one-year basis, bitcoin price has sucked. On a three year basis, bitcoin is the best currency in the history of humanity. 
You pick your time frame based on your bias and what you want to "prove". The only truth is that volatility is very high and bitcoin shouldn't be day-traded as a penny-stock get-rich quick scheme because you will get-poor-quick.

Failure is always an option for me too. 
The episode you quote was recorded a week before it aired, approximately. At that time I was watching Karpeles discuss the Tx-Mal fixes on public channels and I thought they would come back, because I didn't believe the Tx-Mal issue was that big. It wasn't, the problem was bigger and hidden. 
I said "Gox will survive and continue on for new noobies to be Goxed in the future" because I was lamenting the fact that people wouldn't learn the lesson and stay away. That was clear from the context of the rest of the show which you intentionally omitted because it contradicts what you ascribed as the tone to the out-of-context quote. The entire show was bashing Gox. Same as the previous shows, same as the first show we did in April where I warned people to move out of Gox, that was 9 months ago. 
A week after this show, they suspended withdrawals. I immediately went public with another round of very strong criticism. The news articles quoting me said that I was "scathing". 
Yes, I was mistaken in thinking they would fix Tx-Mal and come back because I saw them working on it and knew it wasn't a big technical problem. I had no insider information and no idea they had solvency problems. I always said that I had no indication they were insolvent because I had never seen bad faith, only incompetence. I still have no idea if there has been fraud, but I have plenty of evidence of gross incompetence. 
I stand by my words. If you don't take out one quote out-of-context, in their totality I said things I believed and said them directly and honestly. I was mistaken in some ways, correct in others. I was consistent for months. 
I am not infallible, but I am always honest and direct and I will publicly admit when I am wrong. Here's the statement I released the day the TwoBitsIdiot article blew the whistle, when I found out alongside everyone else:
Yes, failure is an option. I will also make mistakes and say things I later regret. I will do so not out of malice or dishonesty but out of simple human error. I accept the criticism. I'd rather be wrong and admit when that is the case it than pretend I am always right and then prove otherwise, as is inevitable. I believe you will see that is what I say in my "Failure is an option" article too.

Andreas, the Chief Security Officer of blockchain.info here.
There are many alternative services to check transactions on the blockchain, so such a "conspiracy" would be kinda pointless. Furthermore, we have every reason to encourage the investigation of transactions on the ledger, we want bitcoin's transparency and shared ledger to be celebrated, not thwarted.
There is nothing exciting about this outage, no conspiracy, no hackers, no aliens, no giant government conspiracy. Just an unfortunate combination of database errors, giant data sets and a slow painful recovery. 
Our blockchain.info explorer services are up now, so you can go sleuthing on the blockchain. Our other services will be restored in a phased approach over the next hours and days. More info here:

Agreed. It's not that I didn't "get it". At first I supported a block-size increase. I still do, but at a much lower priority than fixing other issues. I learned more, understood some of the tradeoffs better and gradually changed my opinion based on my understanding of new facts. 
I now support Segwit first with a block size increase later, perhaps combined with a few other useful HF changes (eg. reorging the block header, adding nonce, redesigning the merkle commitment architecture). 
That's the difference between science and faith. In science, opinions change when new facts become known. I learned, I changed my mind. I may change it again. You should make your own... ;-)

There are many errors in this posting, which fundamentally misrepresent how LN works:


 
Not true. You can make an LN payment to your other channel endpoint, and leave the first channel with a zero balance on your end. You don't have to close it.


It is not possible for miners to identity the channels/addresses of a hub


Not true. LN uses a new address for every channel and for every endpoint. It is not possible to associate channels, users and endpoints by their addresses.


Not true. Not only are all the assumptions leading up to this wrong, but furthermore, it is not possible to determine if a payment in LN is meant for the next hop or several hops later. The route information is encrypted and from each node's perspective always appears to be 20 hops further away, a static length. Even the HUB doesn't know if it is paying the "users" connected to it with channels, or if they are routing payments on the other end to other channels. 
I understand you have concerns about LN, but overall your concerns are mostly based on faulty assumptions and a limited understanding of the technology. 
Here's some information that might help:

You can tell if a receiving address is NOT segwit: it starts with a "1"
You can tell if a receiving address MAYBE segwit: it starts with a "3". 
But not all "3" addresses are segwit, that's just the code for P2SH. For now segwit addresses are "wrapped" in P2SH and therefore start with a "3". 
In the future, a new address standard for segwit addresses may be adopted (it's in the proposal stage), in which case the address would start with "bc1" (bech32 addresses for segwit).
We should be seeing an increase in P2SH address adoption, as a result of segwit. Track that at p2sh.info
Hope this helps.

Beware of appeal to authority. 
It doesn't matter if I support something. It matters if the reasons I offer to support something are valid or not. These types of articles are not helpful. They are appeal to authority, without a serious analysis of the arguments. 
Examine segwit on its own technical merits, for each of the things it claims to solve: Tx malleability, quadratic hashing, input value signing, scaling, strengthening P2SH security etc. Then examine segwit's proposed adoption mechanism, a soft-fork upgrade, separately from segwit itself. Finally, look at Lightning, Tubmlebit and other tech segwit enables (or makes simple) on their own merits. Draw your own conclusions and ffs don't simply follow an endorsement without evaluating the facts yourself.

You don't know the checksum, but you don't need a checksum.
You Base58 decode the digits you have and brute force the missing bits of the key. The last few Base58 digits dont matter as they're not part of the key, they are the checksum.  
For each attempt you create a public key and bitcoin address and compare to the address you have (he said he has the address).

When miners join a pool they are mining a block header that includes the coinbase (payout) transaction to the pool address. They can't change the payout address and "keep" the reward when they find a block. If they use a payout address that is their own, then they are solo mining and get no shares. Either in the pool or out of the pool. Can't be half in the pool and then leave when you "win".

Most likely it is caused by the difference between compressed and uncompressed public keys. 
If your private key (WIF export) starts with K or L, it corresponds to a compressed public key, which produces one address. If the private key starts with 5, then it corresponds to an uncompressed public key, which produces a different address. It may be that blockchain is using an uncompressed-public-key internally, but exports the private key as a compressed-public-key compatible key. 
Open bitaddress.org and "Save Page" to a local HTML file. Disconnect from the Internet. Open the HTML file from your local drive. If you take your private key (WIF export) and you paste it in the "Wallet Details" tab, you will see if it is compressed or uncompressed and both versions of the private WIF export format (K/L or 5). You will also see the corresponding bitcoin addresses in both compressed and uncompressed. If you tried the key that starts with K or L, try instead importing the key that start with 5, which will be shown on the "Wallet Details" page. Or, vice-versa. 
If one of the two versions of the bitcoin addresses (compressed/uncompressed) doesn't match your expected address, then your probably exported the wrong key.

Safe compared to what?
Security is always relative. There's no absolute security. 
Realistically this means: Are hardware wallets safe _compared to a custom solution I build myself_. The answer is, unequivocal - **Far far safer** than anything you build yourself, unless you are a highly trained security expert.
Buy a trezor or ledger. Make a backup on paper, laminate it (water damage), put the backup in a safe (fire proof). This is the safest way to store your bitcoin (for 99.9% of bitcoin users)

The restoration function doesn't reveal the seed, as the Trezor asks for words in a random order. If you have less than 24 words it also introduces bogus words into the order. Even if the mnemonic words are keylogged, without the correct order, a brute force attack would need to try 24! (

The last 4 bytes of the Base58Check encoded WIF are a checksum. So that means that you don't need to find 6 characters, but a bit less. 
For details on Base58Check encoding and how it works see: 
If you know the bitcoin address, this will be a LOT easier.
You are looking at 38 billion possible keys. Given that you will need to generate each key, then generate an address, then look up to see if it has any balance (or compare to the known address), this is a computationally intensive task, best handled by someone with experience in algorithms and bitcoin.
One option is walletrecoveryservices.com. Alternatively, you could use a script, but it has to be highly optimized to handle 38 billion keys in any reasonable time.

Do NOT spread your money over 3 hardware wallets. That is not good advice or good security. It increases the risk of loss without really increasing the security against theft.
Hardware wallets are already properly balanced between risk of theft (security) and risk of loss (availability). If you split into three, you unbalance that. 
Plenty of people storing 6-7 figures ($) in a single hardware wallet. 
Write the seed down on paper, 3 copies, using a pen or pencil. Laminate them to protect from water. Store in a sealed tamper-evident bag to ensure no one can "peek" without you knowing. Store securely in a vault, safe or locked drawer. 
For extra security, add a passphrase 4-6 simple english words, that you can memorize and tell a loved one so they can recover in case you die or are incapacitated. Do not write this one down, but do tell at least one other person who doesn't have access to the seed.

It's very kind of you to propose this. In fact, I've been upgrading my audio equipment over the past year.

I'm surprised no one has commented on the participation of miners in such a market. 
Miners have the underlying asset. They need to hedge the risk of volatility against their electricity costs which are fiat-denominated. Therefore, they would be the obvious customers for short positions that hedge the risk of bitcoin's price declines. Their exposure is not unlimited because it is not a naked short. They can simply sell bitcoin to cover it if the price rises rapidly. If bitcoin drops rapidly they defray some of their losses through the short contract.

For significant bitcoin amounts, it is best to setup a complete plan, including an estate planner (attorney) and a digital executor (technical specialist). My company (thirdkey.solutions) offers solutions for bitcoin estate planning where we collaborate with an estate planning attorney to create multisignature schemes that survive the loss of one or more keys and allow for recovery. At the same time, these schemes do not have the weakness of having a copy of the key lying around in a will or with a lawyer who might lose or accidentally leak the key.

No they cannot
LN uses an onion routing protocol that ensures that a node cannot know what the route is and what their position in the route is. 
For example, if Alice is paying Eric on LN, via a route:
Alice &gt; Bob &gt; Carol &gt; David &gt; Eric
Then Carol sees only Bob and David and has no idea whether others are involved. Carol does not know payment is from Alice or that it is to Eric. It looks indistinguishable from a payment directly between Bob and David. Carol may not even know that Bob and David are running additional channels. 
KYC/AML becomes *much* harder on LN. It is not possible for an intermediary to allow payments between two of its channels without also allowing it to be routed over for payments by third parties connected on either end. 
Censorship and privacy properties of LN are even better than bitcoin's. Much much better.

Store 24 words on paper, in 1-2 locations, separate from your HW wallet. If you are worried about someone accessing those words, you should use the "optional passphrase" feature of BIP39 (the mnemonic standard) to add a *short* and *easy to remember* passphrase on top of your 24 words. Make sure someone in your family also knows the passphrase in case something happens to you.

For several years now the organizers, in my opinion, have actively created a "cryptobro" environment that is toxic, exploitative, sleazy and crass.
Last year, after being criticized in the NYT article, they had the gall to play lip service to a conduct policy that I created in 2013 (and demand for any event I attend), even though in my opinion they consistently behave in direct violation of those policies.

Picking a good passphrase to protect your encryption keys is hard and you'd have to back that passphrase on paper, as well as back up the encryption keys, so you're back to paper backups. You've just shifted the backup problem one step up the stack and added complexity unnecessarily. 
The real problem however is that a keylogger can capture your passphrase or your seed when you put them on the computer to encrypt. 
You should never type the seed on a computer.

Not double price. The OpenBazaar price is $12.00, just the same as Amazon paperback. Paperback distribution is still lagging for EU and UK, but will soon be available there too. 
The ebook (Kindle) is $6.99 because the costs of producing bits are lower than paper.
I can't however offer the digital version on OB if I offer it on Kindle Unlimited. The publisher decided to make it available on Kindle and not OB. Here's why: This book is intended for a MAINSTREAM AUDIENCE and therefore putting it on Kindle (no DRM), Kindle Unlimited (free for subscribers), Kindle Lenders Library (free to lend to friends and borrow for Prime) and Kindle Matchbook (free if you bought the print copy) put it in the hands of many many more people from a mainstream audience than offering it on OB would.

So, a hot wallet that is insecure and needs to be topped up regularly or is a huge risk for users. Or a custodial wallet that someone else controls the keys. 
Basically, break crypto to make it more like fiat so that we can use crypto instead of fiat. 
Makes zero sense to me. Makes zero sense to my supporters on Patreon. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:34:58
I'd like to see a bit more honesty in this comparison. 
Patreon charges 5%, not 10%. That means that BitPatron is 20% cheaper, not 60%. On Patreon, the credit card processor charges an additional 4-5%. But that's not Patreon, that's the credit cards - BitPatron is "claiming" the credit card processing fees as part of the "discount" it offers, where that is simply crypto, not BitPatron. I can already save that amount by accepting crypto, without BitPatron.  
Also, as I see across this industry, most people in crypto misunderstand some of what Patreon offers. If you put your content behind a paywall, then using a crypto paywall (BitPatron) instead of a fiat paywall is probably a good idea. However, for creators who do \*not\* put content behind a paywall, Patreon is not about quid-pro-quo - it's about monthly recurring support. All of my content is available for free for everyone. Patreon allows me to get monthly recurring support from people who believe in my work and want to support it. They don't really get anything in return, just a week earlier access to the unedited \*rough\* video before it's finished and published to everyone. 
You can't do recurring subscription with crypto - people won't go back to their wallet every month to make another payment. Crypto is a push-payment model. For recurring monthly donations, fiat is (for now) the only viable option. I will gladly use fiat to support my work in undermining fiat and promoting crypto. My audience is newbies, many of whom don't have crypto and want to support my work with fiat. Monthly recurring revenue is essential to supporting creative commons work, at scale, in multiple languages. 
I hope one day we will see good models in crypto that can offer what Patreon offers today. But, today, we don't have good alternatives - pretending otherwise is counter productive.

If you have your bitcoin in a segwit address, you can send to:
* A segwit address (starts with 3)
* Any legacy address that is not segwit (starts with 1)
* A script address (also starts with 3)
* Any combination of the above, even, in a single Tx 
Also, you will get a fee discount under all these scenarios. If you have coins in Segwit, you get a discount when sending, regardless of whether the recipient is Segwit or not. If they are also Segwit, then *they* get a discount when they next send from that address.

Yes, all of that is correct. The recipient's wallet defines the address that they can receive (and recognize when inspecting the blockchain). Segwit is backwards compatible with non-segwit wallets. It is entirely optional to use segwit and you are not restricted in any way regardless of whether any one else does or does not use it.

You don't need to do anything to your paper wallet. It will continue to work fine as is. Segwit does not break compatibility with any legacy systems or force you to take any action to upgrade.
A "segwit wallet" is a bit of a misnomer. Wallets can upgrade to become segwit aware and be able to receive on segwit addresses and create segwit transactions, but they don't have to do any of that. Because they gain a discount on fees however, many of the wallet developers are actively working to upgrade their wallets with segwit.

I believe there are equivalents to BIP38 in other currencies.
 However, if you want to store several different crypto-currencies, it is better to use BIP39 mnemonics, as they support multi-currency wallets where a single seed can hold BTC, ETH, LTC ,ZEC etc
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:30:18
The major objections to segwit are not direct opposition to segwit itself, but opposition to the way segwit was introduced or the choice of segwit over competing proposals. 
There is one argument made against segwit, which is that coins stored in a segwit address are "less secure" because if the segwit rules were to be rolled back or ignored by a majorty of miners, then the coins would be spendable by anyone. I strongly disagree with this analysis. It takes two assumptions that I find troublesome. 
1) That miners can ignore certain consensus rules, unilateraly, without the support of the economic majority, the non-mining validating nodes, the wallet nodes, the merchant nodes, the exchanges etc. I don't bellieve they can do that, even with 100% of the hashing power in collusion. 
2) That ignoring the segwit rules is any different than ignoring any of the other consensus rules. Segwit rules are part of consensus, just as much as "ECDSA signatures must be valid", or "P2SH requires a valid redeem script, not just a hash pre-image". The segwit rules are no weaker than any other rule. Under the same logic of ignoring the segwit rules, miners could also ignore the ECDSA validation rules. That means that a 51% majority of hash rate could accept a transaction spending Satoshi's coinbase from block  with the signature "Deez Nuts". Sure, they could. No one else would accept that Tx or the block containing it as valid. Same applies to "rolling back" segwit rules.
PS. I don't just disagree with this theory on a rhetorical basis. I have bitcoin stored in segwit addresses. I moved bitcoin to segwit addresses a week after the activation, as soon as I could do so with a compatible wallet and not by rolling my own address. I feel confident that my bitcoin in a segwit address is exactly as secure as my bitcoin not in a segwit address (yet).
I hope this helps answer you question

I think that in most cases, the mark up in destination countries is much higher. 
If you look at the world's busiest remmitance corridors, the markup in the destination (developing country) is often 10-20% for those who are selling bitcoin (eg. Mexico, India, Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh). By contrast, the markup (or exchange fees) in the countries that serve as the source of remmitances are the lowest in the world (US, UK, AU, FR, DE)
By taking advantage of the difference in liquidity the cost of doing a bitcoin transfer can actually end up being negative, with the recipient gaining more on sale than the sender spent on purchase.

Money has three primary functions:
- Store of Value
- Medium of Exchange
- Unit of Account
Volatility must be low to achieve the second and third. Bitcoin serves the first very well. It serves the second purpose a tiny bit, but still too volatile and on-chain fees are too high for small amounts. Bitcoin fails today at the third function "unit of account". Even people like myself who use bitcoin daily and earn income in bitcoin will price our services in USD.
However, one day bitcoin's volatility may be low enough to make it suitable for UoA. 
tl;dr Money doesn't have to do all three functions to be good money and bitcoin won't be a unit of account for a while yet.

DO NOT FOLLOW THIS ADVICE:
"If you think that you don't have good locations to hide your seed you can divide your 24 words seed at 3 and make 3 sets of 8 words each (set A, set B, set C). Write on 3 papers: paper 1 = set A + set B. | paper 2 = set B + set C. | paper 3 = set C + set A. Hide each paper in different locations. If you have at least 2 of 3 you have all your seed."
If you cut your seed into 3 pieces, each piece is 1/3 of the security, right?
So if an attacker finds one or two of the pieces, how hard is it to break the third?
You started with 2^256 security. You broke it into 3 parts, of 2^85 security.
Whereas 2^256 is computationally infeasible, breaking 2^85 is computationally feasible. 2^85 is not 3 times easier to crack than 2^256. It is 10^51 times easier to crack. There's not even an easy name for a number like that. You just blew up the security model.
Use a cryptographically secure mechanism, such as Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. If you don't have the technical skills to do that, use a BIP39 passphrase of 6-8 words from a much bigger dictionary and store that on paper in a second location. 
Do NOT try to DIY cryptography. You will fail.

I disagree. Running your own node affords you privacy you cannot get with SPV. It also gives you a role in validation and propagation of transactions. If you're running an SPV node not only do you not get privacy, but you also *need* a full node to server you transactions. That full node gets to choose consensus rules for you. I'd rather serve transactions to your SPV node with my full node. When there is a controversy over consensus rules, you will follow what I say. Fine by me.

Devcore is a good project, especially since it had a very low cost for students to attend. I wholeheartedly support such education projects and frequently speak at such events.

A private key Wallet-Import-Format (WIF) that starts with an "L" represents a "compressed private key", which is meant to indicate that the corresponding public key is using a compressed representation. This format is not very common in paper wallets, most apps expect an old style uncompressed WIF that starts with a "5". This is likely why you're having difficulty importing it. 
You will need to use a different application to "sweep" the private key, one that can handle compressed WIF. Trying to import the corresponding uncompressed WIF (starts with "5") won't work, as it will attempt to recover all funds associated with the uncompressed public key/address (none), instead of the funds associated with the compressed public key. 
Most modern desktop wallets should be able to handle this. Have you tried sweeping it into a Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin Qt) Electrum or Multibit wallet? From there, you can forward the funds to wherever you want. 
Good luck. Send me PM if you need more help and don't worry, the wallet/funds are most likely fine and can be recovered.

The Foundation is and was irrelevant in all ways except one:
Funding the core developers so they can work full time. 
What's the plan to help fund the core developers when the Foundation goes belly up? Even better, what's the plan to start funding core developers *before* the Foundation goes belly up?
Mike Hearn has build a fantastic crowdfunding tool: Lighthouse. We can use Lighthouse to crowdfund core development but we have to address several lingering problems. As much as we may hate the Foundation, they "solved" these problems for some values of "solved". 
* Who gets the money and how is it apportioned between developers? Giving it to a single developer directly might be an option, but that would be too much power. Giving it to a group of developers re-creates the Foundation board. 
* Who controls the money? Multi-sig? Who are the signers? Again, if there is a "board" making decisions, haven't we just re-created the Foundation all over again?
* How do we keep a steady stream of donations beyond the first fundraising event? It's easy to raise money for the first month. What happens after the buzz dies down? A membership model was a good solution.
Despite the many obvious problems with the Foundation, they did (for a time) solve the problem of raising money for core development and apportioning it between a couple of developers. 
Bashing the Foundation is easy and well deserved, but ultimately they are self-destructing. We need to be thinking about what happens next. 
It would be great for people in this thread to suggest solutions to this problem.

Written on paper, with a pen or pencil. Two  or more copies. Laminated and stored in fireproof safes or bank safe deposit box, or other secure storage.

Yes, Copay uses a hierarchical deterministic wallet, with a mnemonic phrase as a seed. This means it will generate a 12-24 word phrase which if you backup can be used to restore your wallet. This applies to single signature or multi-signature use (in multisig each participating wallet has a different mnemonic phrase).

You're doing the right thing, thinking this through carefully. Fortunately, the space has evolved enormously in the last year with the use of HD Wallets and mnemonics (that's the 24 words that give you a whole tree of bitcoin accounts).
Good luck and don't be afraid to ask for help and experiment. Put a little in different wallets and try them out. Move money between them. Use a few and see which are easier to use and more intuitive. Make a backup, put only a tiny amount in ($2), then wipe the wallet and try to restore from the backup and see if it works. Learn how to restore from backup before you really _need_ to restore. 
For large amounts, consider paper wallets or a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger wallet.

Some questions were raised about the financial implications of this. Let me clarify:
The book is available under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA). This means that each translated version, just like the English version, will be available for free for anyone to use for any purpose. Translators can publish the book for profit without giving me a single cent. Independent publishers can do the same. I am not making royalties from any of the translations. For the English books I make a small royalty from every book sold, but the book is also free to download and legally available for free from many sources, including on github and as PDF, EPUB, MOBI torrents.
If you think that I am making a lot of money on the book, you don't know much about publishing. Amazon makes money on the book. If it continues to sell well, I might make minimum wage on the hours I worked on it, in a few years.
Translators who work on this can add credit to themselves in the book. Since it is open source and free-culture licensed, they could even add an entire chapter about themselves and then print and sell it for profit. No one needs to ask my permission or pay me or O'Reilly anything to do this. 
The book can also be used for mashups, for building educational materials or any kind of derivative content. You could make a Star Trek themed musical based on it if you like. Again, I don't get paid for anything. All that is required is attribution (a single sentence with my name) and an equally open license for anything derived from it.

I don't believe bitcoin will *displace* banking overnight. In fact, I don't think bitcoin will *ever* displace banking. Banks will adapt by reducing their power, control and profit margins. They will adapt just like AT&amp;T did to the Internet, becoming the world's largest ISP and running their entire telephone network on top of IP. 
Banks will be *disrupted* overnight, meaning that they will suddenly face significant and deep disruption. It will take several years, but then it will reach a tipping point at which time they will have to race to adapt. Most will adapt. Some will not and will not be able to compete. Entire layers will be disrupted radically and have to adapt or perish. But most banks will adapt and will continue. 
In order to survive however, banks will need to change themselves. Gone are the days of fat margins and fat profits. Gone are the days of 9% remittance fees. Gone are the days of "3 to 5 business days". Just like AT&amp;T can no longer charge $2/min for long distance to Europe, banks won't be able to compete unless they curtail their profits and power. 
I have spoke on this subject in more detail at other times and stated that banks will adapt and be smart about adopting technology, as they have always done in the past.

A seed (stored as a mnemonic phrase and used as an HD wallet) is much superior to a paper wallet:
* It is easier to transcribe
* It is easier to read even if a bit smudged. A single smudged character will not stop you from reading the word and recovering the seed. In a private key, a single smudged charcter is big trouble. 
* A HD wallet can store multiple currencies (bitcoin, ETH, LTC, Zcash, etc)
* An HD wallet does not reuse addresses, therefore gives better privacy and security
* A seed can be recovered without revealing the seed to a keylogger (by mixing the order of the words), a private key can be compromised on recovery
* An HD wallet handles change addresses, a "swept" private key does not and can lead to loss of funds if improperly managed
* The security for a private key and a mnemonic seed (24 words) is exactly the same (256 bits)
For all these reasons, use a seed, preferrably a BIP-39 + BIP-32 + BIP-43 + BIP-44 compliant one to achieve the highest interoperability with the most wallets.

I think the first reason is good (identifying official company accounts), the second can be handled in a decentralized way by RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and the community. I tag all the core devs and smart/interesting bitcoiners with RES. Impersonators are quickly reported and publicly ridiculed. Don't see why it is necessary to do it in a "systemic" way. 
Can we have flair for the year we first discovered bitcoin? I'd love to see [2010]'ers self-identify so I can see what they have to say.
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:01:12
Yes, I'm sure. 
The commitment transaction Mallory holds is structured so that it pays Bob his balance immediately and delays Mallory's balance by N blocks. If that commitment transaction had been revoked by Mallory, then Bob can issue a "punishment" transaction to also collect _Mallory's balance_. So Bob has then been paid his balance (when Mallory published the commitment transaction) and has also collected Mallory's balance with the punishment transaction. 
Mallory gets nothing, Bob gets it ALL.

If you think this drawing is funny, silly or just plain weird please donate to rainn.org. 
The original it is based on was a parody used to fundraise for RAINN (Rape Abuse Incest National Network), a national charity dedicated to protecting and sheltering the victims of sexual violence. I have frequently raised funds for this charity, most recently with a charity run that raised $1400. 
Many of the people you see taking "sexy" photos for bitcoin are themselves victims of past sexual abuse or may currently be in abusive relationship with someone who is exploiting them. I use self-parody to "exploit" only myself, in order to highlight this issue and raise money for this very important charity. 
RAINN does not currently accept bitcoin (though I am working with the charity's leadership to help them do that), so you will need to use Paypal or a credit card:
Thank you

Have a look at a more detailed technical explanation in my book "Mastering Bitcoin":
@_date: 2016-05-09 21:54:43
I disagree. Most people I know who use "blockchain" use it as a word that means "bitcoin and things like it, but more than just currency". As in "the underlying technology". However, they don't understand the difference between an open blockchain (eg. bitcoin) and what I would call a permissioned ledger. I am using the term open blockchain so as to force the question: Is this "blockchain" I'm being presented with an open blockchain or not? I will do a video talk on how to tell if a blockchain is open and has the features of immutability, security and permission-less innovation or... not. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:03:26
Sure, as long as you acknowledge the capabilities that each technology offers. 
* Blockchain offers tamper-evident auditability.
* Proof-of-Work offers immutability. 
* The combination offers both. 
Most "blockchain" offerings claim to be tamper-proof or immutable and are not.

@_date: 2016-05-26 16:44:28
Except that "tamper-proof" is an artifact of Proof-of-Work. Without Proof-of-Work, the chain is "tamper-evident" but not "tamper-proof", meaning that immutability is not guaranteed. 
So, their definition is incomplete. They need to explain how they achieve "tamper-proof" immutability without PoW. Round-robin signing aka Byzantine Paxos aka Signing-not-Mining aka Proof-of-Authority do not achieve that. 
In practical terms, "tamper-proof" means that even if the consensus mechanism is completely compromised, the record cannot be tampered with. In bitcoin, if mining is 100% owned by a single actor, they cannot simply re-write blocks without offering PoW. Practically speaking, that limits the ability of even 100% of the hashing power from rewriting more than a few tens of blocks, an afternoon's worth of ledger. Re-writing a month of blocks (144 * 30) would require such an enormous amount of Proof-of-Work that it would take... a month. That's the important quality of PoW that is not easily replicated with other consensus algorithms. 
So tell me again? How do you do "tamper proof" without PoW?

The part you're missing is the game theory behind commitment revocation Bob and Mallory have an open channel:
- When Malory broadcasts a prior commitment that has been revoked, the best she can achieve is to receive the balance that she had at that prior time
- That balance will only be paid after a delay of N blocks. The default is 5 blocks in LND, as far as I know. 
- If Bob is able to transmit a recovery transaction during that delay, he not only gets back his balance - he get the ENTIRE channel balance. 
The punishment for Mallory is much higher than the gain. Which means that Mallory would have to succeed much more often than fail to break even.

It's not a big deal. I'm not blocking out of spite, but for an entirely practical reason: if they will make "stories" without asking me to comment on a single tweet, they're misusing twitter. Twitter is an ephemeral medium, it's not blogging. I can't express nuanced opinion on twitter, in 140 chars. Taking it out of context is abusing the context. So, if I block the writers who do that, they don't see my tweets and can't do it as easily. That's the practical reason I blocked them.

The most secure device you own is a smartphone. Since the amount is not big enough to get a hardware wallet (as I saw in an earlier answer), then you should use a mobile wallet. The wallet you choose should be one where you control the keys.
Easy to use, secure and used by many people without too many problems include:
Android: Mycelium, Copay, Airbitz, Jaxx
iOS: Copay, Breadwallet, Airbitz, Jaxx
All except Airbitz will ask you to write down a recovery phrase. Do not make a screenshot. Instead, use pen and paper and store 1 or 2 copies of those in a couple of secure places (a locked drawer at home, inside a book in your bookcase, a locked drawer in your office, a safe). 
If you start using bitcoin a lot or store more than a few hundred $, then you should look into a hardware wallet, such as the Trezor or Ledger wallets.

This video is not new. Before ASICBOOST, before it was clear (to me at least) that Bitmain controlled a significant % of chip manufacturing. 
While I still believe that the mining pools and mining farms in China are not an issue, I am concerned about the power concentrated in one manufacturer and I'm definitely concerned about the impact covert ASICBOOST has on development roadmaps and centralization.

It's not a sudden change. The value of fees and the value of reward "swap" in importance over a very long timeframe. By the time the reward is substantially lower, the number of transactions should be two orders of magnitude more. 
Right now, the reward to fees ratio is 250:1. By the time it reaches the "bits" level, you can expect the ratio to be 1:1000 in favor of fees. Somewhere in between is a crossover point when the two are equally important (ratio of 1:1). None of this happens suddenly. The dynamic difficulty algorithm can account for the changes in market value and hash rate. 
tl;dr: Don't worry. By the time reward is low, there are enough transactions to support the network even if each transaction has a low fee. In any case, the difficulty will adjust to make the mining process profitable at whatever hash rate is necessary.

*SIGH* 
That's an out-of-context partial quote that completely misrepresents what I said.
I said that such exchanges *do* exist: eg. localbitcoins, abra, mycelium trader. 
What I said next was that they can only exist at small scale with cash-based transactions, because of the limitations of fiat payment systems which cannot guarantee payment without charge-back. So a large-scale, digital payment, non-cash decentralized fiat-bitcoin exchange cannot exist because of fiat limitations.

I work for myself. I also try to keep my expenses low, so no whores or cars (or house, I'm a nomad).
I get paid by 5-6 commercial conferences a year and that covers my travel costs and allows me to travel and speak at lots of meetups and community events for free.
I make a bit of money from books too, but not much. Recently I started a Patreon page, which is a fantastic way for me to cover my costs without having to chase commercial conferences. This frees up a lot of my time to do community focused educational work. 
If you'd like to support my work, you can become a patron and get early access to my videos and know you are helping me do more. I'm hoping to get lots of small donations, rather than a few big ones. A monthly contribution is much better income security for me than a one-off donation.

Way too complicated. The use of an optional passphrase is sufficient to protect the seed. Keep it on paper. Make more copies on paper.

It serves to demonstrate broader uses. I will of course compare to bitcoin's smart contracts (esp. LN and payment channels). My discussion of ethereum will be cautious and with appropriate disclaimers as it is even more of an experiment and far less mature than bitcoin. But I will talk about it.

You didn't address the issue of immutability. Proof-of-Work is computationally bound immutability that cannot be faked. So far, no one has a better answer that offer true immutability - meaning tamper-proof, not just tamper-evident. PoW is not just anti-spam. It is also immutability.

I was extremely critical of both the soft-fork and the hard-fork and said that it would damage ETH, but that it was one of several bad choices with no good choices available. 
It serves to highlight the enormous value of bitcoin's immutability (thermodynamically guaranteed). But that doesn't mean that there isn't a big use case for dapps with lower immutability guarantees. It simply means that ETH is now now what was initially sold to the public, it is something different. 
I have a nuanced position on Ethereum, consistent for more than 2 years and I continue to be interested in the use cases for smart contracts and dapps that use a Turing complete VM. 
I did not invest in the DAO other than $40 to give me the ability to vote and use the contract. I do not "invest" in crypto-currencies, I use them daily and see the value in their utility not as investments. I hold a dozen cryptos in varying amounts, most small, so that I can use the tech "hands-on". 
I always urge people to look at these things as tech, not investment and I actively discourage people from speculating in volatile assets like these unless they are experienced and appreciate the risks.

Need to clarify the question, before answering it. 
Q: Can UTXO stored behind "old" addresses be spent with a segregated witness? 
A: No, you first have to create a segregated witness output (P2WPKH or P2WSH or wrapped in P2SH). Then you can spend that output with a witness that is not in the Tx (segregated). 
Transactions can be mixed, spending both segregated witness and scriptSig witness (traditional) inputs. They can also create a mix of segwit and non-segwit outputs. 
But before you can use the capability of Segwit, to gain from lower fees etc, you must create Segwit outputs. Old outputs can only be spent with a signature inside the scriptSig.
Another way to look at this question is "Are my old outputs still spendable after Segwit, or do I have to do something special". The answer to that is "your old outputs are still spendable exactly as before, nothing special needs to be done. You just don't get to take advantage of the extra space. However because others will take advantage of the extra block space, that will free up space for your transactions so you should still see lower fees even for old UTXO.

It's a huge boon for privacy and fungibility, massively increases the scalability of Bitcoin (or any other blockchain that supports LN), and can be made near invisible to the end user as part of their wallet. 
There are some downsides to LN, of course, as with any technology. To use LN you have to store some bitcoin in a multisig whose keys are online (a hot wallet). That means you have to be careful with security. But compared to the alternative, which is off-chain SQL-based payments from hot wallets at exchanges (what we have now), it is vastly superior. 
I expect we will first see LN used between large entities, to pipeline transactions trustlessly (eg between exchanges and merchant aggregators, or hosted wallet providers). Eventually, I expect many of the host exchange wallets will become LN wallets, increasing the security of exchanges. Finally, I would like to see LN nodes run by co-ops of users interested in earning small fees and increasing privacy for everyone. 
tl;dr I am not ambiguous on LN - I am very bullish about LN technology and its offshoots

1. Every network node validates every transaction before forwarding it. The miners also validate mostly, though some do so called "validationless" mining.
2. The scriptpubkey of the recipient is encoded by the recipient's address. The sender puts that in the output. Each type of address encodes a different type of scriptpubkey (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, etc)

This is a typical US-centric  view of the world, from which is very hard to "extract" oneself. 
The other 6.5 billion live in a very different world, one where their currencies (the other 190 or so) are volatile, manipulated and over inflating. A world in which the vast majority have no banking services at all. A world in which even those that have banking are tied up under strict currency controls and more corruption. 
The argument is "Bitcoin will not grow in the FIRST WORLD consumer space". Sure, it might have less utility at the moment, relatively speaking. Certainly compared to the only world reserve currency. Less so for many Europeans. But the other 6.5 billion? Unbanked, disconnected from the world economy, yet full of productive potential? Bitcoin is very much a consumer play for the other 6.5 billion. Not all, not for a long time, but the bitcoin technology will allow entire continents to leapfrog "banking" the way they leapfrogged "landline telephony". 
They will crane their necks and wonder at our first-world blindness as they pass the wreck that is "modern banking" and go directly to global crypto-currencies-over-cellphone.

I disagree. Trojans, keyloggers and camloggers are common on consumer machines. That means neither the files, nor the typed passwords are secure. Witness the many heists of bitcoin that are reported here, result of keyloggers and trojans.  
Paper wallets can indeed be created for free, including *on the site I link*. All our code is open source. What we offer is complete instructions and easy to use pre-perforated paper for better results. 
Before accusing others of "preying", perhaps you should check the link and the work that has gone into the project and the related openpaperwallet project which has so far produced 25 open source CC-BY-SA designs, open source code to simplify paper wallets, open source instructions, a free bootable CD/USB image for offline printing etc. 
No worries though, plenty of bitcoiners know who I am and what I contribute to the community.

I can explain - this is due to a lack reading comprehension on your end. I used sarcasm to criticize the status quo as being too narrow to represent the community. I am against *only* having white men from the USA as representatives. 
I am explicitly trying to recruit people from around the world. The people who built the bitcoin.org site left only 6 spaces for press contacts and then picked a group that only represents a tiny minority in the US. I said sarcastically "we're well covered", knowing that this is not a representative sample of.. well anything really. 
I built the bitcoinpresscenter.org, an alternative site, precisely because I objected to the way the bitcoin community was portrayed as consisting only of white males who speak English. 
I then set out to recruit people from all around the world. I have spend the last 6 days reaching out in 20 languages, using help from volunteers and Google Translate, to make a site that represents the complete "rainbow" of humans, rather than the narrow slice that others had picked.
Next time, try reading the whole message and understanding it before flying off the handle. I'm trying to make sure it is *NOT* just the white English-speaking male representing bitcoin, so it seems like we want the same thing. 
Now, can you help me recruit people from around the world, preferably non-English speakers? It would be great to have more women represented, more nationalities, more diversity of bitcoin use and more ages. 
If you read my message, look at my site and pay attention to my actions you will see that I'm trying to fix the problem you are accusing me of, not promoting it.

There are plenty of ways to find him. He handled the bills leaving fingerprints. He was recorded on multiple cameras. He drove into the mall via the parking garage, showing his vehicle. 
However, I have absolutely no intention of going to any "authorities", as I've had first hand experience of *no good deed goes unpunished* and the cops and feds have burnt any trust I had at least a decade ago. Treating your own citizens as either enemy or collateral damage creates blowback.

I would like to recommend the [SafePaperWallet.com]( product. 
It has a ***backup stub***, a unique feature which addresses the risk of loss of the paper wallet. This second copy of the keys should be stored at a different location, to prevent loss of keys from fire, flood, theft or... termites. The best approach is to store the primary wallet in a fireproof safe at home, while keeping the backup stubs in a bank safety deposit box. 
The SafePaperWallet also comes with scratch-off security stickers that adhere to the paper and prevent tampering. As a side-effect, the stickers make the paper wallets much more resistant to water damage. We tested this by applying different liquids (plain water, acidic liquid, colored liquid) to wallets printed on laser and inkjet and covered or uncovered with stickers. (128 different combinations)
We found that inkjet inks are the most susceptible to water damage. Unprotected inkjet QRs are obliterated by moisture, as the ink bleeds into surrounding cells destroying the pattern. Laser inks are less susceptible to this. Acidic liquids are worse than plain water. In all the tests however, security stickers prevented the liquid from damaging the QR code, *even* when the water damage was from behind. The sticker binds to the ink on the front of the paper and holds it in place, even under extreme soaking with water, acidic liquid or colored liquid. 
SafePaperWallet is a product that is designed to survive for a very long time in storage. Every aspect of the product, from the acid-free archival quality paper, to the stickers and backup stubs, make sure you can still retrieve your bitcoins many years in the future. By also making it very easy to use large numbers of paper wallets, you can also spread your bitcoin across several wallets, further reducing the risk of catastrophic loss. 
All the software is open source and you can use it for free on the [safepaperwallet.com]( site. The detailed instructions will help you apply it, whether you buy the kit or not.

The keys are blank. You get the instructions and software. You generate keys on your computer and print them on top of the design using the software. The software itself is open source and has been inspected by many experts, since it is based on the widely used bitaddress.org.
Once you make the keys and print them, you cover them with stickers and reboot the computer and printer. The keys now only exist on paper and have never been on an online computer.

Not my previous practice, but certainly part of my normal practice now. This is why I made a PSA.
@_date: 2013-06-02 18:11:10
We will be adding an option to the software to print the base58 (human readable) private key on the backup stub, instead of the public key QR. 
That will allow you to have 3 copies of the private key, for extra redundancy and security, and you will be able to put a square sticker on it to protect it from prying eyes and dirt/water.
See the [layout variations](
I expect the software addition for that feature by mid-June at the latest...

Bitcoins stored on a PC are somewhat vulnerable to trojans with key-loggers, screen-loggers and print-loggers. Trojans can capture private keys if displayed, or capture encryption passwords when typed. Most of these are probably owned by private hackers, not the NSA, but they do steal bitcoin from people quite regularly. They also can inject API keys and create transfer transactions on online wallets, on exchanges and wallet providers, if you do not have sufficient security (two-factor, API two-factor etc).
I always keep the majority of my bitcoin on a paper wallet. You can find detailed instructions and free software on SafePaperWallet.com (Disclaimer: I own this), or use the software on bitaddress.org.

"There are good cops, there are asshole cops". No, there are asshole cops and there are the bad cops who protect them. Good cops are those testifying against both of the above.

Hard to do, sure. Impossible no. 
Whether you accept it as the "voice of the community" (there, a bit more mild?) depends on the size. 
If it existed and there were 200,000 members and you had a resolution voted and approved by more than 100,000 members, that carries weight whether you think so or not. In the real world, lots of voices matter. 
If you add funds from donations and fees to make that voice heard in media, then it would have de-facto voice.

Actually, the bitcoin recipient was not affected and received real bitcoin from an automatic escrow system, possible because of bitcoin's programmability. 
By contrast, I was unable to easily verify authenticity, or worse I thought I had and had not really. The fiat user was the only one affected and the fiat use was the only one that failed (when I tried to buy a drink).

Andreas M. Antonopoulos here - The interview follows some of the topics I presented for the bitcoin 2013 conference, specifically the topic of Bitcoin Neutrality. 
In my conference presentation I relate bitcoin neutrality to adoption by "the other 6.5 billion" and talk about bitcoin from the perspective of the global *unbanked*, the 6.5 billion who lack banking services, stable currencies and access to the world economy.
I am very interested in any feedback and comments from the community about this interview. It is about 2/3 of what was discussed, but I think it captured my positions pretty well - I have more TV and radio interviews scheduled, so feedback will help me improve!

In (most of) my videos, I speak of 6.5 billion having limited or no access to the global financial system - 
This includes the core "unbanked", who represent 18% of the population in the US, higher everywhere else. It also includes the "under-banked" who have limited access to banking, limited access to credit and almost no access to international wire services. It includes their families, not just the working-adult population. 
The World Bank says 3bn, but are only counting the completely cash-based unbanked adult workers and not even their families, I think. 
Many of the under-banked and un-banked have rudimentary Internet access or 2nd generation phones with extended-length SMS and MMS, possibly as many as a billion. They are the first/main audience for bitcoin and crypto-currencies in my view. 
Mea culpa where I have said "unbanked" and 6.5bn in the same sentence. I am more careful about that detail now, than I was in the past. 
The main thing is that this is less important to the billion or so residents of US and Western Europe (the current bitcoin population, mostly) and far more important to everyone else. 
"It's all about the other 6.5 billion"
Thanks for the correction and debate

Didn't say it makes them a bad guy. I said it makes them a bad cop. That's because they put the job above the law, their safety above the law and their safety above that of the civilians they are supposed protect. That's bad policing, but very understandable, from each individual's perspective. In the end though it doesn't matter to me. I have no idea whether I will be interacting with a "good" cop or not, so I take the precautionary principle. 
I put my safety first too, responding rationally to the incentives of a broken justice system. Can't blame me for that.

@_date: 2013-06-01 02:14:22
Just to clarify - 
We ***do not do key generation*** - the key is generated in Javascript, on your browser with randomness from your mouse movement, all while offline.
There are detailed instructions for the whole process, every step ensuring that your keys are generated on your PC, offline and directly go to a printer over USB. Then they disappear as you power-off. They never touch the net, are not part of the software, never saved, only printed.
If followed properly, this process ensures that the keys only exist on paper, under the security sticker. 
The kit comes with some test pages for alignment. We're also making some tweaks to the software to offer a +/- offset for each axis, so you can make adjustments. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 22:20:01
Code signing itself is only useful if you can verify the source code, and compare the hash to a secure copy of that hash.
Most sites publish the software code and the hash on the site. An attacker can modify both without detection and you will validate *their* hash.
We're doing something different, which you can see on the [software validation page]( We link the code back to github, publish the SHA1, but also ***digitally embed the SHA1 into the blockchain, using a digital notary service***. No one else, that I know of, does that. It ensures that the hash you are validating cannot be corrupted in the page. The hash can be recovered from the blockchain and is timestamped independently by the miners. 
I would love some feedback on this new feature...

The security process (explained in the incuded instructions), involves creating a safe copy of the code on portable media, validating the hash, booting in a clean OS (LiveCD, never online laptop, or OS Vendor CDs) then print directly (USB) to a local printer. Then wipe everything before going online again. 
Security is in the process and completing each step correctly. If done to the instructions it ensures that no keys are ever online, will thwart software keyloggers, trojans, hardware keyloggers, screen-grabbers, and of course all online threats.

No need for name calling, you don't know me. 
Plenty of media sensationalism is more than enough to get a smear going, already happening for bitcoin without Satoshi. Nothing paranoid about it, already rare to find an article that doesn't mention drugs or "terrerists". If Satoshi was known, they'd be asking him/her/them sensationalist bullshit questions and to predict the future of bitcoin or speak on behalf of bitcoin. 
That's before even anyone notices anything about bitcoin.
I think bitcoin is currently smaller (objectively) than several niche fetish movements, smaller than most minor religious sects, smaller than many city-states, smaller than many island populations. It's insignificant. But it will get bigger, and annoy and threaten some established powers, just like the Internet. Do you have to go ruin it for everyone by outing Satoshi just to satisfy some trashy tabloid curiosity? Let him/her/them be.

Hi there, Andreas, the owner of SafePaperWallet here.
You should ABSOLUTELY NOT trust key generators blindly. 
You can review the source code to verify it is operating correctly - anyone can, it is open.
Our code is derived from bitaddress.org. You can very easily do a "diff" and see what changes we have made. 
It is absolutely possible to weaken the key generation algorithm to narrow the key space in such a way as to make them vulnerable. 
It is also possible to capture keys while they are generated, which is why you should always generate offline. 
The SafePaperWallet site uses open source which can be inspected. 
I would like some suggestions as to how to increase trust in the code itself. Here are some of my thoughts:
- Get it independently vetted by security experts in the community. WHo would you trust to do this?
- Code signing - We do not offer a hash on the site, because we have seen from experience that almost no one validates this and even if some do, it is not effective security. Instead we monitor the source code remotely for changes, to detect a potential intrusion and modification.
- We are releasing a new version of the software within 2 weeks that will allow you to simply type in keys of your own, generated somewhere else. You can type these in while offline and have them printed on our wallets
- We are also looking at partnerships with hardware wallet printers with verifiable firmware, for easier offline printing.
Obviously our business depends a lot on trust. What can we do to increase the trust of the community?
@_date: 2013-10-01 22:58:57

If Satoshi is ever revealed he/she/they will immediately be smeared as a terrorist, criminal, pedophile or weirdo. That's how power is applied in propaganda terms.
