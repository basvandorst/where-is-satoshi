honestly I am very surprised and worried that someone who owns a few dozen BTC is asking questions like this.
Every possible address on the internet has a potential qr code.  So every wallet has one too.
And I'm not sure what you mean by "one time voucher" but if you create a wallet, it is forever usable as long as you have the private key.

Be sure to bring a device where you can either view the blockchain or log into you wallet account (coinbase, blockchain.info... etc)
You pay the amount agreed upon, they deliver the bitcoin.
You verify the coins have arrived (I only wait for 1 confirmation, but it's up to you)

I am having major issues with them right now.  I have a few hundred dollars in litecoin in my account.
About 2 weeks ago they randomly locked my account, then didn't respond to 4 subsequent support requests.
Then a few days ago they changed the status of my account to "suspended" and still will not respond to my support tickets.
If you must deal with them, buy your coins and immediately pull them out to a paper wallet or some other wallet.

when you put your coins on gox, the transactions within mtgox systems were off the blockchain.

1 thing we can be sure of.... on paper, Satoshi Nakamoto is the worlds richest man or group.
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:20:00
sweet, i was looking for someone who knew what the price was going to do so i can position myself properly.
THANK YOU!
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:22:47
do you accept bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:46:05
10 4... i actually agree with you after further review
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:22:27
I predict bitcoin will have a price in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:27:14
again... how does this hurt the person who is asking about paying with paypal?
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:00:32
um, wat... they've proven themselves pretty well over the years imo
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:46:12
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:16:00
again... how does this hurt them?
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:51:52

You could say that about anything.  I'm a vegetarian so a tenderloin steak is worthless, yet to others it's $15/lb.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:46:44
k bub.
my point was satoshi didn't care about some guy trying to cash in on pretending.
but satoshi DID care about someone being harassed for no reason.
so it does hold up.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:35:30
satoshi is on record saying you should never get rid of private keys... still wouldn't guarantee he/they didn't lose them
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:49:08
crash? LOL
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:20:14

how would a reversal hurt them if they are the one paying with it?
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:52:12
have you read anything satoshi has written?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:49:08
crash? LOL
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:29:13
but they get the $37,000 AND the gold medal
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:53:16
my point was that a gold medal is monetarily worth more than 1 bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:34:55
this is good for the bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:29:52
lol... what did you think i meant by immediately?  after 3 seconds?
2 days is pretty fast, and they had to tread carefully to make sure they got it right.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:58:38
good luck austria
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:22:36
yea... my thoughts exactly 
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:59:45
this is the internet... copyright doesn't exist
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:58:03
prank? more like wasting people's time.
go do something productive you fucking tool
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:12:08
always with the "bitcoin is used for crime" argument... fiat is doing just fine with the vast majority of the worlds criminal transactions being done with cash.
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:54:29
this is your answer OP
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:54:32
this guy
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:41:20


why do so many of those addresses share this very specific transaction time?  that must be wrong
Also... why is that list total BS.. this is the first address - 
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:02:21
classic tactic of removing context in order to confuse people
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:18:23
bitcoin dick is huge
@_date: 2015-04-27 12:26:45
misleading title

US athletes get paid $37,000 if they win a gold medal
@_date: 2015-04-13 08:13:55

@_date: 2015-04-13 16:06:42
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:52:35
lol wtf?
@_date: 2015-04-13 08:47:10
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:32:50
circle.com does exactly this
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:50:00
Satoshi spanked newsweek becuase he saw a vulnerable innocent man being harassed and wanted to help.
craig wright is a douche, Satoshi probably didn't want to give him the time of day since the community proved wright is a fool almost immediately. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 09:31:27
lol how long have you been on the internet? you don't know what geocities is?
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:54:11
THANK GOD... i was beginning to think i was hodling for nothing
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:46:55
the conversation that happens after with the next guy proves these people have no FUCKING clue how bitcoin works
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:59:08

@_date: 2017-06-30 02:06:23
nah, i'm good
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:41:53
because why would anyone assume the video you are linking to is 2 miles down the webpage and not the one at the top?
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:35:33
lol...  getting mad at people because they don't scroll
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:40:24
what a shitty video... this conversation sounds like something from 2012
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:02:48
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:00:38
I believe that it is a bubble to some degree... and just like the .com bubble, it will come back roaring.
The internet did not go away.  And neither will bitcoin.
