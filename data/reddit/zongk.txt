The stock market is partying like it’s 1999, and for exactly the opposite reason. Last week the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite hit a synchronized high for the first time since the eve of the millennium. America’s most valuable company is a tech stock (Apple today, Microsoft back then). The tech sector is back above a fifth of S&amp;P 500 market capitalization, and just as then bears worry that the market is overvalued, although not by anywhere near as much.
In 1999, wild optimism was elevating the market as investors piled into anything with “.com” after its name—leading to a rash of stock-price-boosting name changes. Investors punished dividend payers for not having enough ways to spend money on transformative tech. The number of clicks beat cash flow as an investment tool.
The contrary is true this year. Wild pessimism about the global economy has led investors to chase dividend payments, demand buybacks and punish companies that invest. Cash is king.
And yet, the market rises. “Nobody seems to be particularly optimistic about much of anything and yet the stock market in the U.S. seems to do nothing but go up,” said Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at Boston fund manager GMO.
The theoretical justification for higher prices now, as it was then, comes from the dividend discount model. This states that the value of a stock is the total of all future dividends, discounted back into today’s money. The bubble mentality of the dot-com era made earnings forecasts all but redundant, but the hope was for big profits one day, which eventually translate into dividends to justify the price.
Something radically different is under way at the moment. Pessimism has depressed bond yields, reducing the discount rate and so making even fairly stagnant future profits look more attractive in today’s money. Higher prices are justified, without needing much in the way of earnings growth.
Prof. Robert Shiller of Yale, joint winner of the economics Nobel in 2013, calls this the “new normal bubble.” “Paradoxically when people are most pessimistic about their own future, stock prices are at their highest,” he said. Worried households save more, pressuring the economy and leading to lower interest rates—so boosting shares.
Finance theory hasn’t exactly covered itself in glory over the past couple of decades, and this analysis comes with a snag. Just as expectations of future profits from the first wave of dot-coms proved horribly wrong, so expectations that central banks will keep rates low pretty much forever might also prove mistaken.
If Pets.com’s IPO and failure in 2000 epitomizes internet excess, investors in the future might look back in wonder at the willingness of today’s investors to justify lending money to highly indebted governments.
“Negative rates to me make no sense,” said Leon Cooperman, chairman and chief executive of New York hedge fund Omega Advisors. Euphoria in the stock market in 1999 has been replaced by euphoria in fixed income in 2016.
This lament isn’t exactly new, with frequent worries voiced about bond yields as they dropped in the weak recovery of the past seven years—only to drop even further.
Yet, stocks are hot. S&amp;P 500 earnings have been falling for 18 months, but Wall Street analysts are becoming optimistic again. Forecast operating profits 12 months ahead have been rising since February, and aren’t far from their 2014 peak. The now-maturing tech sector has done particularly well, with the so-called FANGs which led the market last year before plunging— Facebook , Amazon.com , Netflix and Google, now Alphabet—rebounding fast in the past month on the back of broadly better-than-expected earnings.
This reflects the basic market belief that the world economy is weak enough to keep central banks pumping out free money, but not so weak that company profits will dive. As Mr. Inker said, “That’s a very small sweet spot.”
Still, central banks provide a more reliable prop for shares than the madness under way in the markets in 1999. David Rosenberg, chief economist of Gluskin Sheff, who was deeply bearish during the dot-com boom, thinks there is no parallel in the bond markets today. “I don’t look at bonds as a bubble, I look at it as a controlled market,” he said.
Much depends on whether he’s right. If central banks both can and do keep yields low, U.S. equities look OK in comparison.
One big difference between the excess of 1999 and today is for those who think that he’s wrong, and low yields are unsustainable. In 1999 it was easy to find alternatives to wildly overvalued tech, media and telecom stocks. With dividend-paying stocks out of fashion, their yields were well above the wider market; more than 180 members of the S&amp;P 500 paid a dividend yield at least twice that of the index. Now, that figure is just 26, as dividends are in demand.
It amounts to further evidence that It is harder to find anywhere to hide today, as the great central-bank monetary experiment makes everything expensive.

In this case confirmation is a specific term reserved for when a miner has included your transaction in a block and broadcast that block to the network. 
In english using confirm as a synonym for verify would generally work well, just not in this specific case.

I agree. People try to force segwit with social pressure now but this is the kind of thing that we should have expected. It was argued that nodes being allowed to not upgrade was an essential feature.
SW activation had very little support until the SW2x agreement. This is another reason to expect SW adoption to never take off.

The cost of a competitive fee depends on the size of your transaction. The size of your transaction is determined by how many inputs and outputs it has. You will only have one output since you are sending all your bitcoin out.
Inputs are going to be describing where each "chunk" of bitcoin you are sending from is. If you received two payments of 0.005 BTC each that make up your wallet balance of 0.01 BTC then you will have 2 inputs and 1 output for a size of about 226 bytes. This means your tx will take up 226 bytes in the bitcoin block which it is confirmed in. There is a max to that block size depending on a number of factors but for simplicity it is roughly 1MB on the Core chain.
If you have received 10 payments of 0.001 each that make up your 0.01 BTC you will have 10 inputs and 1 output. This transaction will be considerably more expensive due to it taking up more of the limited space in a Core block.
Look at your tx on blockchain.info and you can see what fee you paid in satoshis per byte. By comparing this number to other transactions in the mempool you will see where your transaction ranks in the pile of unconfirmed transactions. As I write this a competitive fee to get included in the next block is currently 930 s/B.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:08:26
Sure it has. You should learn your history better.

I mean send the ETH to the market account and then trade it for whatever you want there. Just don’t use BTC for the transfer. Use a cheaper coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:57:14
So you overpaid, or perhaps you had many inputs.
Transactions can be different sizes and therefore will cost different amounts. About $40 is the cost for a BTC tx of around 226s/B, but it costs less than $0.01 to send a BCH tx of the same size.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:02:59
Your tx is 13055 bytes.
Right now to get in the next block you need to pay 470 satoshis per byte.
470 * 13055 = 6135850 satoshis = 0.06135850 BTC total in fees
That is $963 at this time. 
It may never be worth it to spend this bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:47:17
No you have 58 EUR you said. Fees are well more than the difference. Say goodbye to your BTC until fees drop (if they ever do).
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:21:18

You don't want to send $10 in bitcoin to anywhere right now. For the typical smallest transaction size to be confirmed in the next block it will cost you around $40 today. So $50 total to send $10. This is pretty much the best case scenario although there is a very slight chance that if you are only using one input and one output it might be a little cheaper.
If you have lots of inputs, say you accepted small amounts of bitcoin to your wallet over time, it may be much much more expensive to make that $10 transaction, which is likely what your wallet is telling you.
You can send with a smaller fee, but you risk getting your transaction stuck in the mempool for a long time, or perhaps until it times out after two weeks and the bitcoin is returned to your original wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:59:01
268.817 sat/B
Not competitive at this time to be included in a block. You may get included if fees drop back down, or in another 9 days your transaction will be dropped from the network and you can try resending it if you wish to do so (and can afford to of course).
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:09
That sub is pretty damn friendly, I will give you that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:59:30
Bitcoin is most certainly not a “store of value”. It is a wildly speculative investment with questionable fundamentals due to the current fees. It is no longer peer to peer cash, which is what brought us to where we are now. 
I think people buying it now are only looking for quick gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:15:00
Sell it, buy ETH, send that. Still more expensive than BCH but probably your best option.

The link you provided showed how many bytes the tx was.
I found the current fee required to get in the next block at  Scroll to the bottom and you will see it in bold.
How I actually calculated things is right there in my first post.
You can try and send the transaction another time if the fees are lower, but the value you are trying to send is only 1/6th of the cost of the fee. Even if fees go down to 1/6th what they are now you would use up all the value just paying the fee. If they go down to 1/12 what they are now you could salvage ~$75.
Yes it is time to accept that this money is now "gone". More accurately, it may now be time to accept that bitcoin is no longer money.

Not trusting. Not seeking permission. Privacy. Security. Freedom.
Centralized services can be free, but most in this world aren't. Even the ones that seem free really aren't. You still pay your share.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:19:54
Always having enough space is how we have been doing things so far.
Do you propose no increase?
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:28:54
It will centralize with a 1MB limit too, but for worse reasons and in worse ways.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:48:44
Well I think you are wrong. Not because someone else said it, but because I thought about it myself and it makes sense.
Having a limit to the block size limits the number of participants. No time for that. We are just getting started.
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:16:45
If a change is not made then Bitcoin will begin to behave different then we are used to.

You step up. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:43:00
It isn't really about the devs or the miners. It is about which chain people accepting bitcoin decide to use.

Cool! I like hearing that.

1. If bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, yes.
2. 2016 or later.
3. You will be fine. Your bitcoins will remain safe and useable on both chains. It is the bitcoin you acquire after the fork that you will think about. Which chain will you consider valid?
4. This was brought up because right now there is a 1MB max size for each block. Only so many transactions fit in that and we have more new people making bitcoin transactions every day. If growth continues we run out of space and spending bitcoin becomes financially competitive. It may cost hundreds of dollars in fees to send bitcoin. By increasing the max block size the blocks can continue to grow as needed, as they always have.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:12:28
It is the people who accept bitcoin who decide.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:45:45
There will be no incentive to running a full node if you can't afford to use it.
So the rich get to use bitcoin, and the rest of us have to trust them to relay our transactions through their centralized clearinghouses?
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:10:14
Who is going to run a full node when only the rich can afford to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:54:34
What if I want to use bitcoin for all the benefits it offers over centralized services?
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:35:38
If the core coin continued to exist and have value, yes. 
It is most likely that if there is a HF the core chain becomes worthless immediately since BU would only fork with a majority of support. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:24:54
Version 10? Not entirely sure on that one but hopefully someone with more knowledge will chime in.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:22:10
You think the price will collapse because a majority of the community has decided to make more space for additional users?
Allowing the block size to grow as it has since 2009 is not "changing too much".
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:05:57
If the coins they are receiving have been used in a segwit transaction then they must trust that they are valid. They will accept the transaction without verifying the actual witness data.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:10:51
Did you know you are responding to the owner of a bitcoin ATM network? Fact is BU does have real world traction and it is snowballing now. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:03:50
The current core leadership rode the coat tails of those that came before them. Back was the first person Satoshi contacted yet didn't see the light till 2014. Maxwell said he had proven bitcoin couldn't work before he got involved. Core has dropped the ball and therefore will be rejected and replaced unless they start to provide what the community wants to run. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:46:36

You just need a wallet.
I recommend [Electrum]( for your computer or [Mycelium]( for your phone.

I agree
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:00:00
It would be removed compared to how non-segwit blocks are constructed. The node will no longer be validating the actual history of the coins it is accepting.

@_date: 2017-02-09 09:08:03
They appear to be valid, but the node can not tell whether they actually are or not.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:17:10
The definition of backwards compatibility is that new software accepts data/code produced by or for old software. When Windows 10 runs apps written for Windows XP, that’s backwards compatibility. Both fork types require backwards compatibility, because otherwise new nodes would be unable to verify the block chain from scratch.
The correct term is actually forwards compatibility: this is when old software continues to accept data/code produced by new software. When you save a document in Word 2013 and it can still be opened by Word 2011, that’s forwards compatibility.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:18:12
ETH operates differently than BTC. It retargets difficulty every block.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:12:56
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:21:33
123 years until the block subsidy ends. A "fee market" is a waste of money at this time.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:53:36
Because the value of bitcoin spiked and wallets were all still using default settings. This was quickly corrected which brought the fees back down as software was updated.
It was very different from what is happening today.
Edit: 
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:27:39
It depends on how much lower. If bitcoin prices out a high enough number of use cases, and another crypto adopts those lower fee use cases, then the network effect of the other crypto can rapidly eclipse bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:15:03
No, the code has been added already. It won't be activated until 95% of the hashpower is voting for it.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:19:05
It is called supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:57:08
"Spamming" low-fee transactions will do nothing. It isn't an attack. You must send transactions with competitive fees to matter. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:07:38
SW isn't different because it is backwards compatible. BU is also backwards compatible. 
SW is forwards compatible. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:37:05
Why do you assume it will only cost 0.0002 BTC to send bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:08:59
They don't validate the witness data. You become a SPV node.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:16:18
Blocks are full. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:14:06
The block reward won't end for another 123 years.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:38:56
They added SW code for which there is no concensus
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:15:31
We should worry about bitcoin remaining useful and desired. Miners get to set their minimum fee and can compete with each other for the available fees.
A Bitcoin with bigger blocks allows for more use cases, more users, and more fees. You can't simply limit the use of something and expect people to pay more then it is really worth to use it. There are other cryptos out there that are willing to scale on-chain if Bitcoin won't and that is where users will end up.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:29:34
Even if they aren't valid they will appear to be valid. The actual witness data is not checked. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:17:13
There is not.
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:20:37
This is FUD. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:36:18
Because it is only your opinion that SW is the only safe/realistic blocksize increase option on the table. The market disagrees with you and is now taking a different course.
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:37:35
They can continue to use the old rules but they are unable to understand the information passed to them. It strips them of their ~~vote~~ ability to validate.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:02:32
They would continue to operate normally. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:34:55
The actual witness data has been removed from the block. You do not validate it anymore. You aren't doing the important thing that a full node is supposed to do to be a full node.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:19:31
Fees were fixed back then. It had nothing to do with supply and demand. There was plenty of block space available.
Edit: You may also want to read the following link so that you can better understand what actually happened. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:44:32
I have edited my above comment to be more clear. While nodes do vote by announcing their preferences to their peers, they do not lose that ability in a soft-fork. You are right to point that out.
It is the ability to validate which they lose. If you don't agree with the new rules you don't get to use the key feature of bitcoin anymore. You are blindly trusting.
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:24:56
You won't know the size before hand. At this time you are relying on the wallet to pick a competitive fee, but really this isn't easy for it to do. Everyone wants their fee to be competitive but there are more people wanting to send transactions then there is space, so some will get left out.
Anyone stating that bitcoin has low fees is most definitely misleading you these days. It used to be very low cost and reliable, but not anymore.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:30:58
It will be catastrophic. The majority will do everything possible to destroy the minority chain.
@_date: 2016-01-11 08:21:00
I would give that a try
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:43:23
BU doesn't won't fork without a clear majority. You have nothing to worry about. Core can either get back in touch with what the community wants or they can become irrelevant. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 05:48:13
I share your view. Very well said. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:32:05
No that is not correct. There is no automatic activation. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:21:27
BU isn't going to activate unless it has an overwhelming majority.
Edit: Also, ETH is up.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:54:44
Allow for open discussion. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:55:28
You posted this 4 hours ago but it just appeared now. Any idea why?
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:06:55
I don't see why you couldn't use them on both chains.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:15:30
No it can't. It is not validating that actually history of the coins it is accepting. It becomes a SPV wallet. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:54:59
ETH behaves differently than BTC though. It retargets difficulty every block. Not a fair comparison. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:44:24
I'm sure you could, but have you even considered the children?
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:01:46
They have a reason to mine empty blocks. It earns them more in the long run if they broadcast empty blocks under certain circumstances. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:03:39
With more and more use cases for bitcoin, and more and more users, the number of nodes would increase.
Miners are already incentivized to not create too large of blocks due to the risk of orphaning their own blocks. There is also the max_block_size which can prevent them from making too large of transactions.
Without an actual physical limit I can't quite close my mind off enough to say that something will never be possible. Perhaps I have already seen too many leaps in technology in my short time on earth to be so close-minded.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:17:13
He offered reason. You have brought nothing in response. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:45:44
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:53:37
If you aren't holding the private keys you aren't holding bitcoin. 
Without the keys you may be invested in it but you are missing out on most if not all the advantages.
I don't want a bank settlement system. They can use it for that too if they want, but I want a p2p electronic cash.

The ones behind Segwit are the same ones who think this blockspace market is a great idea.
Follow them at your own peril.
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:20:40
Core supports artificial scarcity of block space. They have done anything possible to resist hard forking to a larger block size. Fewer and fewer are running their code as pressure builds.
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:42:37
No one is "blocking" segwit. Even if all the nodes running BU began signaling for SW right now there still wouldn't be enough support for activation. The fact is that the bitcoin network has rejected SW and the current development team.
The core team is responsible for the sorry state that the network is currently in.

Bitcoin as digital-gold largely managed through custodial accounts does not have the same value as a functioning digital-cash. It may not have any value at all.
I agree that we may never get past 1MB, but I have hope that the miners will still do what is in their best interest. It is possible they do act, but too late to save bitcoin.
What use will bitcoin have when another coin has a larger market cap and a higher TPS? Right now bitcoin has network effect, but that is being eroded daily due to the poor performance of the network.
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:16:19
Breadwallet is one of the best out there and it isn't all that accurate unfortunately. It isn't even their fault at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:02:30
We want blocks to be able to continue to grow, as they had from 2009 until 2015-16.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:50:50
It isn't untested. It is normal for blocks not to press up against the max block size limit. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:57:59
You don't believe bitcoin can handle 2-4MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:49:38
Did you decide that for everyone else?
Not sure if I would describe bitcoin as conservative.
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:07:58
The scale on bitcoinfees.21.co is in sat/B though.
Is my math off? 2000 sat/kB = 2 sat/B
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:44:16
These guys make estimates: 
From what I see right now they are saying your tx (50 sat/B) will take ~35-infinity minutes. Infinity as in it will never be confirmed.
Fear not! This is only a huge inconvenience. Your bitcoin will not be lost. After 4 days or so the bitcoin network will forget about your transaction and you will be able to submit it again. Make sure you use a higher miner fee then everyone else the next time. The key here is to make sure some other guy is left out and not you. Electrum shows its fees in BTC/kB so make sure you get the conversion right if you are getting an estimate in satoshis/byte.
Electrum may just return the balance to your wallet. You may need to do something special. Not sure. You should probably ask another question about that when/if the time comes.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:55:28
The first ones mostly were. Example: litecoin.
Some of the more recent ones work much differently, and have many additional features.

What is the limit that prevents us from scaling to an appropriate level for on-chain micro-txs some day in the distant future?
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:26:21


There is also the possibility that BU miners use some of their hash power to mine empty blocks on the core-minority-chain as to orphan any blocks the minority miners do manage to find. The minority fork might not be able to mine any blocks...
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:29:14
80sat/B isn't competitive now. It may never be confirmed.
You can't cancel but your transaction will be dropped from the mempool in 3-4 days if not confirmed by then. Not sure exactly how Electrum handles dropped transactions so you will need to research that.
You can try to submit your transaction [here]( If you can get it submitted they will include your transaction in the next block they find.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:20:48
Hard to say what the chances are but it is looking more likely every day. 
It will happen some time after a supermajority of the hash power has agreed to make the change + a buffer period to give nodes ample time to upgrade. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:24:17
Do you not understand why they are motivated to do this?
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:54:23
No it just means they would need to upgrade their node to something modern like a $10 raspberry pi.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:16:09
I will not accept core's path any longer. I heard the arguments they provided in furtherance of a "fee-market" not so long ago, and now that we are here I will not accept segwit framed as a solution to the very problem they created.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:59:03
It amazes me that this kind of garbage is allowed on the front page while legitimate posts are removed.
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:20:25
That isn't a technical limit.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:40:56
Consider for a moment that the miners do have Bitcoin's best interests at heart.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:43:31
Can't say with any certainty. I think the speed at which it will occur will depend on how congested the network becomes and what effect that continues to have on the utility/value of BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:47:03
The minority coin will be destroyed very quickly. 
I agree that it is tough to have a neutral discussion on this topic under the current circumstances. Having an environment where both sides of the debate can be openly evaluated would certainly help bring the community towards consensus. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:55:58
Waaay more then 100 people understand bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:37:35
Isn't 2000 sat/kB really low? 2 sat/B is not competitive at all. I don't think anyone would even relay them.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:57:41
Very much so. It gives me hope.

Do you really think that BU is a 2MB fork?
It isn't...
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:46:38
They all ateady are. BU doesn't change transaction format. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:53:11
 No definitely still a limit 
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:06:57
Those same devs are the ones that argued for a blockspace market. I think they added a small limited increase so they could use it as a reason to accept SW as a solution to the very problem they themselves created.

It doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:05:28
The increase in max block size will not change anything overnight. This is just the max size each block can be, not what it will be. We have 1MB available now and almost never use all of it. Growth of the block size will probably continue as it has.
Yes, tor users can run full nodes.
No, luke-jr will not be able to solo mine with his 56k modem many years from now when we actually have blocks closer to 20MB in size.

No one knows yet. I don't think a month is likely. Could certainly happen sometime during 2017.
I think fees will continue to increase exponentially. If this is really the case then I believe we will see a fork this summer.

@_date: 2017-03-09 00:29:06
Classic was gaining steam.... then the infamous HK meeting where a handful of Core devs, Blockstream employees, and miners had a closed door meeting. The end agreement was that miners would only run Core's code, and Core would provide a 2MB hardfork in addition to SW.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:47:48
121sat/B just doesn't cut it anymore. 
21.co is recommending 220sat/B as the fastest/cheapest fee at the moment.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:25:21
It is still the leader but that lead is slowly eroding. 
It is no great technical feat to have blocks greater than 1MB. Core devs are in support of limiting the block size in furtherance of the "fee-market", not due to some real technical limit. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:52:24
If they can't afford to upgrade their hardware they aren't going to be able to afford to make bitcoin transactions.
Also that was two years ago. Many of them probably have upgraded already.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:47:18
You are assuming they do. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:42:22

@_date: 2017-03-03 17:27:49
They say you never sent the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:24:12
With no miners they won't have any blocks, so yes they will need at least 1 miner I suppose.
Without enough hash power they might not even make it to a difficulty adjustment. Blocks so sparse no one can transact and fees would be through the roof. The hash power on the other chain has very good incentive to try to hurt the shorter chain in any way possible. It is in their best interest to destroy it if possible.
UASF is a small group of users turning their back on the miners, yet not hardforking away from them. So dumb.
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:50:19
Not necessarily. They could simply allow their blocks to grow larger until they had the network effect.
It is bitcoin's game to lose.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:02:27
Yes the author clearly missed that info.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:43:13

@_date: 2017-03-24 04:17:46

We are quite far from only "corporations" being able to run nodes. Why couldn't a neighborhood, small community, or village run their own node? Why is 1MB such a magic number to you? What about 0.1MB or 2MB? Who decides what is too much?
If you want layer-2 to compete then bring it. You don't get to hobble layer-1 in an attempt to make layer-2 more competitive.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:16:49
You will not lose your money. The network will simply forget about your transaction and the original wallet will be able to send it again. 
You need to look into the specifics for whatever wallet you are using for how your wallet behaves and how to deal with this situation.

That is what BU is doing
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:38:33
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:50:00
They are literally limiting on-chain scaling and attempting to make a change that facilitates their layer-2 "solution".
Without an arbitrary and internal limit on-chain transactions are more valuable and lower cost than layer-2.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:40:56
With BU finding a majority of support there may not be anyone willing to accept corecoin. It is too early to say at this point.
Additionally, with a minority of hash power it may not even be possible for you to move your corecoin to an exchange or buyer.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:18:44
They aren't what got us from genesis to here. They aren't what people use today and they won't replace sending bitcoin on the actual bitcoin blockchain.
If you have a viable layer-2 network to launch then bring it and convince people to use it. The market will not wait for you.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:24:24
Even worse:
There is also the possibility that BU miners use some of their hash power to mine empty blocks on the core-minority-chain as to orphan any blocks the minority miners do manage to find.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:51:33
Segwit is nowhere close to the required 95% support for activation. Doesn't look like it is going to happen.

I am sure you were very thorough.
It isn't the cost, it is the value.
If it isn't worth it for you to run a node then you shouldn't run one. That is what SPV clients are for.

Not the same devs as 7 years ago.
I never said it was a secret or that they were trying to intentionally hurt Bitcoin. I believe they think they know what is best.
Why? So they can limit on-chain transaction volume while facilitating their layer-2 solution.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:13:28
There are fees to open and close the payment channel because those are bitcoin transactions. You will need a channel with each party you directly transact with. While your btc is locked in the channel you can send it back and forth with the other participant for free, but just to them.
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:48:48
This is no longer about big vs small blocks. Both camps now want bigger blocks. The only question is how to go about getting them. Bitcoin has begun the rejection of Core.

Of course it would be best to do it years in advance. That is why this has been an issue for years. Now that we are here the discussion has reached a feverish pitch as the new "fee-market" takes effect. 
The fact that the Core has remained stagnant thus far is not justification for remaining slow to react now. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:51:29
They learned when they realized others would accept it as payment. Before that moment it had much less value to them.

If all the miners are mining bigger blocks, and you don't want to have bigger blocks, then just switch off your node. Same outcome but will save you electricity. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:08:05

4 blocks now
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:40:52
Nodes will still be able to reject blocks they have decided are too large. An adaptive block size does not mean miners are the only ones in control.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:54:34
I don't think breadwallet takes a fee for importing a priv key, and I don't think they will make you wait for 4 confirmations. You will have to pay a mining fee because you are sending the btc to a fresh address.
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:27:02
It is in the self interest of users, bitcoin businesses, and miners to increase the block size. It is the vast majority.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:15:33

What happens if we all pay $0.05 more?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:55:08
If they had put that work into mining bitcoin chances are they would have solved just as many bitcoin blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:19:13
Nope. That isn't an issue in general anyways, but particularly not when trading on LBC since they are escrowing the transaction.
The price to sell a bitcoin is not below market because the demand for bitcoin is high right now. You can imagine that at some point people are buying for -5% and selling for +5%. Then the supply of bitcoin is constricted. The price shifts to 0% buy and +10% sell. Both distributors and end-customers are willing to pay more for BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:41:53
They decided to put SW out there. Why don't they do the same with a block size increase and see what the community decides on?
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:26:02
They are both confirmed now.
There are more bitcoin users then ever fighting for limited block space. Fees are going up and wallets aren't doing a good job of keeping up. It isn't really their fault because there is no good way to predict what fees may be in the future.
Bitcoin didn't used to be like this because we always had excess room available in blocks. In the past year or so we have run up against the max blocksize limit which has altered Bitcoin's behavior to what you are now experiencing.
From now on you can use a service like bitcoinfees.21.co to estimate the required fee, then find out how large your transaction will be, then use those two variables to determine what fee would have gotten you into the last block that was mined. You can then use this info to try to guess how much you need to pay for your transaction to be included in the next block in a timely manner. There is no guarantee it will get included though as it may not end up being competitive relative to other transactions. It is just a guess. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:16:27

@_date: 2017-01-05 00:10:20
I know breadwallet is one of the few wallets that allows you to spend unconfirmed funds so I don't see why they would make you wait for 4 confirmations. I have never heard of this from anyone or seen it myself in practice. You probably were actually waiting on Bitstamp.
There is a mining fee involved because you are sending funds on the blockchain. That is how you sweep a private key. If you want to just import the private key to save $0.20, and have less security, then yeah, use some other app. The fee doesn't go to breadwallet. It goes to the miner who mined the block and included your transaction in it.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:36:29
That chart can't go much higher due to the max block size.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:41:38
That isn't a good reason to choke Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:26:07
They already have it, the infrastructure is already built out, it is fast to send, it is practically free to send. Bitcoin was amazing money until we hit the 1MB limit. I see no reason why its success would not continue once the limit has been removed. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:49:09
Then why won't un-upgraded nodes understand the new behavior?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:26:09
BCC easily clearing the mempool with 8mb blocks and having nearly free transactions are also huge advantages. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:43:33

One interesting though I had was that it could be where the Hong Kong agreement was signed back in 2016...?
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:18:08
Paying more isn't a solution to the larger issue. Paying more doesn't create more space. It only pushes someone else's transaction out. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:36:38
More people using bitcoin will make it more decentralized and more censorship resistant. 
You are complaining about something that isn't a problem. Never has been. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:13:58
You pick individuals to attack as if they are the only ones in protest. The reality is it is a large group of users, businesses, and miners who feel the bitcoin blocksize should continue to grow. Heck, almost everyone thinks that to some extent. It is only the Core devs who wish to impose a new "fee market" system on Bitcoin. That is the radical change whose rejection is being played out right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:40:18
It is greater than BTCs at the moment (and was when you asked the question). 
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:21:57
I am happy to have layer-2 solutions. Bring them on.
Having said that, I am interested in bitcoin, not layer-2. I want the unique properties that only bitcoin has offered. Those are the special things that have changed my life and the way I see the world. I am concerned with the health of bitcoin and I want it to permeate society at all levels. 
One thing is for sure, I will not accept core's path any longer. I heard the arguments they provided in furtherance of a "fee-market" not so long ago, and now that we are here I will not accept segwit framed as a solution to the very problem they created.
@_date: 2017-01-20 05:56:16
You played yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:44:52
Increased fees make bitcoin less useful and less valuable. There is no need to incentivize miners with a fee market right now. We have ~123 years until that is necessary.
I run a full node. So what? If the value of processing a Satoshi Dice transaction is worth it to a miner then it gets included in the block chain.
The Core has not moved us down a path which allows for Bitcoin to scale. Stopping all transaction growth is stagnation to me. This is by design (as we have been discussing) and a large portion of bitcoin users, businesses, and miners find that to be unacceptable.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:57:25

It isn't simple though. You can not guess with certainty what the fee needs to be to get into the next block. You can be aware of what fee requirements have been in the past, but that doesn't help you predict the future. Check the fees then what?

@_date: 2017-01-21 01:27:12
It is likely they have had individuals use another person's ID, and a picture of said person holding their ID. This should prevent that.
It is a man-in-the-middle attack. Scammer finds victim who wants to buy bitcoin. Scammer requests from them all the same info a person needs to register at Kraken, then uses this to register a fresh account. Scammer has victim transfer funds to this new exchange account, trades them for bitcoin, and withdraws this bitcoin.
This registration process prevents that. You are already giving up your info, so no harm in writing out the message to go with the picture.

It isn't as simple as "just pay the fee." The fee is variable. No one knows what it needs to be to get into the next block.
If what you said was true then we could all simply pay $0.25, or even $1 and get included promptly, but that isn't the case. If we were all paying $1+ in fees per tx we would be in the exact same situation we are in now.

It is trivial for both nodes and miners.
The word you used, contentious, simply means 'controversial'. There is a difference of opinion in the community, that is all.
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:50:49
The 1MB blockchain, the one that all bitcoin nodes can fully validate, will have no additional space. Some may move some of their transaction data off the 1MB chain reducing the cost for others, or perhaps even creating room for more participants, but the max number of bitcoin txs remains the same. 
This debate goes well beyond that. Leaders amongst the core dev group have clearly expressed their intentions to create a fee market by refusing to increase the 1MB limit. Adoptng SW doesn't solve that problem. It just makes it worse. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:10:22
I'm with you. Well said. 
Also, you don't need to run a full node to use bitcoin. Its most important advantages are available to anyone with even very basic hardware. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:02:08
The majority of pools are not signaling for segwit presumably because they don't want it, or perhaps they would rather see a blocksize increase first.
A blocksize increase will allow more people to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-24 02:58:18
You aren't thinking of the user. To ask the average user of a currency to do this for each transaction is very burdensome.
If you do educate every user will it even matter....?
What is end game? So say we are all paying attention and sending bigger fees. The fact is that when at max capacity some users will always be having their transactions displaced by others. Matters not how it is done. Making it a competition may make you feel like it is fair but it is not.
The bitching will be all we hear until there is only silence.
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:09:27
4MB would give us four times the capacity. Most people don't and won't ever run full nodes so it does not matter what their data cap is. There is nothing technically difficult or even expensive about 4MB blocks. If running a node is important to someone then it will certainly be feasible.
Determining if something is spam is subjective and up to the miner. Nodes can also decide what to relay. If a miner includes a transaction then it is obviously not spam.
The attack is not the filling of blocks, but rather the artificial limitation of the max block size.

Or make a cash deposit to someone's bank account on Localbitcoins.

Why does it require a supermajority? It only matters that the increased income from pushing up fees is greater then what you spend on fees yourself.

IMO removing, or at least substantially increasing, the max block size is the most likely path towards an increase in network capacity. Once this has been done I believe the community will be more accepting of additional tools such as Lightning.
You encapsulated the core of the blocksize debate into one of your quiz questions, then excluded one of the most obvious and popular solutions from the answers!
However you meant it I hope you realize how it comes across to participants on both sides of the debate. Excluding one side of the debate from the conversation makes it painful obvious (to intelligent observers) that your position is too weak to be challenged.

@_date: 2016-12-03 19:15:16
You are attempting to redefine what a block is. SW moves data outside the block. If you want to fit more then 1MB of data in a bitcoin block you are going to have to hard fork. No way around it. 
Very few are buying the doublespeak. Certainly not bitcoin miners.

Miners most certainly configure their config file and would change it as needed if they were missing out on transactions that were worth it for them to include in their blocks.
Besides, fees have been well above the default minimum for a long time.
In the past before Core the default was dropped in new releases as the value of bitcoin rose. Fees at that time never got to be more than a few cents for standard txs though. Miners used to even mine 0-fee txs if they had a high enough priority.

We do know because the guy was never charged with a crime. The police don't need to charge a person to take their money anymore, they just take it. This happens all over the country, every day. That is a fact. 
[Here]( is just one example of what the police are doing these days.
Do you not believe that people in the US are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law? If they are innocent then how to you justify stealing their money or property?
To maintain control over your money. To maintain your privacy. To have the most liquid form of money available to you when you wish to spend it. To make payment to someone who can't process debit cards. To use money without having a bank account. To save fees.
Cash is not a crime.

Look at your customer's experience. Not too easy or immediate. When using Circle there can be delays, limits, holds, identification, verification, etc. The major issue is that bitcoin can not be charged back while credit cards can. This creates friction in the buying process and it has always been like this. You state in your post that the issue is with Circle but more broadly the issue is with digital USD.
Circle may work for some, and I would mention them as an option, but give some other options too. Mention bitcoin ATMs with a link to coinatmradar.com, mention localbitcoins.com, mention bitcoin exchanges like bitstamp and bitfinex. Mention earning bitcoin as a possible route to obtaining it.

It isn't a slowdown of work, and it isn't a matter of timing. It is a fundamental change in the direction of bitcoin. It has nothing to do with patience. Satoshi left the project with a group of devs who have since been completely removed from the project by Core. It has been Core's deliberate intention to make block space scarce and expensive.
Core is the problem here.
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:08:50
Why do you say there were advantages, and what would make them unfair?
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:27:59
They prevented the number of transactions per second from increasing with demand.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:36:52
I disagree. I believe Core is incompetent for letting the blocksize stagnate at 1MB.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:08:53
No Segwit didn't allow for more information to go into those blocks. It made the blocks larger, but in an unnecessarily complex and messy way.
Core devs want high fees and scarcity of block space. They are the problem.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:50:36
Obviously you can. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:04:15
It isn’t the entire development community. It is only Core.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:19:32
So you have a specific number of txs in your mempool at a given point in time? Then you can count them.
Stating there is no way to count the number of unconfirmed txs is incorrect. You can say that depending on settings nodes may calculate different size mempools.... is that what you meant to say?
Acting as if the size of the mempool, and the resulting competition for limited block space, increasing fees, and inconsistent confirmation times are not relevant due to not all mempools being equal is foolish (or perhaps insincere?) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:02:34

Putting the miners on POS terminals doesn't mean anything special in itself. It is the fact that not just one person is updating the ledger that makes crypto unique. If one company determines what software the terminals run they might as well update the ledger on a single computer.
I don't see how it would be worth it to mine on a bitcoin ATM. You still have to pay for the hardware and electricity. There is no advantage to mining with a BATM.

Perhaps inevitable once the technical limits of Bitcoin have been reached. It should be up to the miners to decide whether the cost of including a transaction is worthy of the miner's fee attached to it.
It most certainly isn't good to have an artificial limit placed on the number of Bitcoin users.

Yes I run 3 full nodes. 1 is a production node processing 100+ txs per day in service to paying customers. The other 2 are for testing and backup.
**A server that can handle 100MB blocks would still be cheaper than the increased mining fees I pay right now.** I would most certainly run a full node if blocks were 100x larger, although it is quite a leap to think we will be needing 100MB blocks anytime soon.
On the other hand no matter how "decentralized" Bitcoin may be I am not going to run a full node if my customers and I can no longer transact on the Bitcoin network due to the cost and inconsistent performance of the network. Many of us are hard at work adding other cryptos to our platforms right now. I now also run 3 non-Bitcoin full nodes and if that is where all the business ends up going I will turn off my Bitcoin full nodes after the transition has been made.

Here is a paper discussing the incentives of a miner controlled blocksize. Very thought provoking. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:53:23
Miners should be selfish. That is how Bitcoin works and in no way does it mean they will or want to destroy Bitcoin. They ARE Bitcoin. They have more skin in the game than any other user. 
Miners aren't stalling anything. Choosing which software to run on their own hardware is their choice. They are protecting themselves and therefore protecting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:44:02
If people want to use crypto and there isn't enough room for them in bitcoin they will begin to use something else. This transformation has already begun. 
I doubt it will be "too late" until another crypto has become the most used and takes over the network effect bitcoin has always maintained. 
At some point in this transition miners are likely to recognize their error and make changes to increase capacity. Hard to say when. I believe it is most likely they choose to scale on chain first and reject the developers who argue that a constant backlog of transactions is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:58:20

@_date: 2017-05-21 18:14:17
Miners interests are perfectly aligned with the success of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is their product and they get paid in bitcoin for the service they provide.
Asicboost is FUD. There has been no proof that it has ever been used in production and Bitmain has agreed to update their open-source software to prevent its future use.
Transaction malleability is not a pressing issue. There are better ways to fix it than with segwit.

@_date: 2017-05-14 20:40:53
[Blocks weren't full until recently]( Nothing was wrong then. You are wrong now. Miners have always decided if the value of including a transaction was worth the cost/risk of including it in a block, as they should.
Perhaps you should concern yourself more with helping to build Bitcoin into something there is massive demand for vs campaigning for an artificial limit to the supply of block space available.

That is a false dilemma and adds nothing to the conversation.
Jihan should be maximizing his personal profit. Miners maximizing their own profits is what keeps Bitcoin secure.
More hash power is signaling for on-chain scaling than for segwit. I don't see how you can conclude that Jihan is "blocking" segwit. Less than a third of miners support segwit. It has been rejected because it is an undesirable change. No fancy mental-gymnastics are required to understand that.

In the case of a one-time peer-to-peer transfer a lightning tx will cost ~2x as much as a traditional bitcoin tx. There is one miner fee to open the channel and one to close it.
LN doesn't help with today's growing use cases. It is interesting tech but not a solution to scaling bitcoin. It is a distraction.

@_date: 2017-05-20 21:36:15
Yep. One of those sick jokes that is only funny because of how screwed up things are.
I completely disagree that Bitcoin isn't ready for more purchases. The only issues I see right now are because miners are no longer able to increase the block size as they have been for the previous 7 years.
If you don't want to store every transaction forever then run a pruned node. Limiting Bitcoin's growth isn't the solution.

I have seen nothing to make me believe Bitmain won't do what they say they will do, and what is in the best interest of the network. They have my respect. 
Off-chain scaling is secondary to me vs on-chain scaling. Until we have that fixed I don't want or care about off-chain. On-chain is Bitcoin. That is what I am invested in. 
I support hard forks for network upgrades. I don't think it will be as contentious as you might imagine.

@_date: 2017-07-30 18:43:50
No. With SW the miners will be able to update the ledger without verifying signatures. In fact the signature doesn't even need to exist for them to move the coin. 
It is explained well here:
"Imagine that you have 100 BTC in a segwit address and a few days later you notice that they've been transferred to an address that you do NOT control. You try to find the signature that authorized the transfer to prove the theft (you're sure your private keys were secure so you think the signature must be bogus) but conveniently nobody seems to have it saved.
Can you prove that your funds were stolen?"

@_date: 2017-05-15 15:44:07
If the value of bitcoin more than doubles every 4 years then the block reward continues to grow. Miners are certainly not hurting for money. They are earning more than ever (asside from a very short period during the late 2013 run up). 
Bitcoin's best defense is a good offense. The more people who are aware of its unique qualities and who become users of it the more difficult it becomes to shut down. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:27:44
Having that many people using bitcoin sounds like a really good problem to have.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:06:04
The number of non-mining nodes supporting UASF really is meaningless. The cost of running a node is so low that it doesn't carry weight. It can all be one person or a small group behind those nodes. I will agree that other measures such as companies/individuals publicly voicing support for or against segwit carry some weight, as do other forms of support. Anonymous twitter and reddit accounts, like non-mining nodes, are as meaningless. 
If the three largest miners signal something it would matter. Miners have to put their money where their mouth is. If three people (or one person with 3 online identities) with 0.2 BTC between them fire up some UASF nodes it really doesn't matter. 
Proof of Node is too easy to game. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work for a reason: it is a way to find concrete consensus.

With a SW transaction there is no requirement for miners to download the signatures, or to verify them. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:00:58
Meaningless data. If you are relying on the number of nodes supporting a proposal as some kind of important number you fail to understand Bitcoin and how it works. There is a reason we use PoW. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:06:09
There is two-way replay protection now so no one will be able to steal SW txs for use on the BCC chain. Not an issue. 
What I believe you are referring to is the attack where miners are incentivized to no longer verify tx signatures. This will make SW txs vulnerable and it has nothing to do with BCC. 
"Imagine that you have 100 BTC in a segwit address and a few days later you notice that they've been transferred to an address that you do NOT control.

Or do you want to argue that it isn't contentious?
A small number of Core devs get to decide what is merged. That isn't some utopian system of governance. It is a cancer that is in the process of being removed.

No. BCC has strong two-way replay protection built in.

Long term I can see BCC being more popular, but no that is not what I am talking about.

Not legally. It has nothing to do with the law of man. Only the laws of math.

I have bought 3 mattresses from T&amp;N with bitcoin so far and am super disappointed to hear they no longer accept bitcoin.
I just called and let them know my feelings. Was told the change was made because of a website redesign.
Hopefully we don't have to go to the extreme of posting youtube videos of us shooting our wonderful mattresses. ;)

No you aren't. You paid less for the ETH tx, and it actually got confirmed. 
You seem to be missing some of the basics.

Longer term BCC will likely have a greater value due to it being able to grow into a larger network of users. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:06:15
Good luck with that.

You aren't keeping up. When you fork away from bitcoin you don't get guaranteed that any hash power will go with you.

Miners accept the txs with the greatest fees. They fill up all the space available to them with txs. They would include more txs if they had the space available to use. 
If miners didn't take only the hightest fee paying txs everything would be a mess.

It started when people were not allowed to voice their opinions here.
Segwit is the new addition to bitcoin. The other side is trying to keep the original behavior.

ETH adjusts the difficulty every block. Entirely different situation.

^ The real question.

Like you use your account to list ads for them?

Here a lawyer can explain it to you:

Hold your own and you will have as many BCC coins as you have bitcoins. You will own both. 
Leave your coins on Coinbase and you will only have bitcoins. No BCC coins.

It does denominate in btc. Settings &gt; currency &gt; swipe the topmost field left. The one that shows what $1 is equal to. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:45:22
IIRC it just makes one for you.

ETH did not lose more value. ETH is up 10% today vs USD, while BTC is down 10%.
ETH is up to 85%+ of BTC's market cap.

It is the dollar that got stronger.
