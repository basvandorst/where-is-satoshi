No problemo! I tweeted you back right after you sent the tweet as well, hope you saw it!

I've actually been thinking about how to make a leather cold wallet for Bitcoin. So far the only thing I can think of is laser engraving, but maybe if others with more knowledge on the subject had some ideas I could make it happen! I'm admittedly not very knowledgable about cold storage right now.

Ahh, Classic bifolds aren't made to order, they're a stock item. Most of the "made to order" items are all items that have different sizes- with the Black Friday sale, I just sold out of Cognac bifolds. I'll be restocking later this week, just check back on Thursday and you'll get a freshly made wallet :)

thank you!

true! though even when we don't need physical wallets anymore, we'll still need to hold our pants up :)

Yes, I make them! I hand sew everything

Hey there!
Unfortunately I don't offer non-branded product besides the belts, it's kind of a pride of workmanship thing in leatherwork (called a maker's mark, like an artist signing a painting). However everything is guaranteed for life and made in the US. I ship worldwide on a daily basis!
