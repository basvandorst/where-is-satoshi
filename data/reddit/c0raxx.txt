I have mixed feelings about cex. If you want to use a credit card and then send to your wallet. Sure no problem. I transfered money to them via a SEPA transaction. It literally took a week before it was credited to my account. I would stay away from trying to withdraw from cex as well.  I would recommend that you make a bank transfer to gdax for instance. Usually takes less than a day if you live in the EU. Buying with a credit card is ofc instant but the fees are pretty steep compared to a bank transfer.

To answer your question: use coinbase. buy in gdax. sending BTC between coinbase and gdax is instant. its the same company. My recommendation: Buy hardware wallet, buy BTC on gdax. send to wallet. And then hodl

IIRC you cant adjust the fee when sending BTC from cex. Sending to your wallet is much faster and depends on the miner fee cex applies and traffic on the network. For me it usually took around an hour.

Never had problems with sending BTC to wallet on cex. But their customer support is terrible. Thats what ive got using them;)
