On satoshiround.com you can find al documentation about "Provably Fair". Thank you.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:43:24
Users have asked for it. And we did what the users wanted.
We're not here to change the world, it's just a provably fair Bitcoin lottery.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:17:03
We do not dare to judge this

"You don't need to respond to every comment here with passive aggression." Sure, in the same way you do not need to attack every single word.
"offer the best service possible" Sorry, this is a misunderstanding, I meant that we do our best to offer our best service.
We are talking about nothing, I do not think it is useful to users, so I stop here ;)

No, there will no longer be a return to bch, at most it will be added ALSO a version in bch, but we want to remain faithful to btc. We do not preclude the road to LN in the future.

Thanks to your feedback (even if not polite) that term has been deleted, it was part beta version TOS.
With the previous beta version in BCH we never encountered technical problems of any kind, so we can say that the system is stable even with BTC network.
Not all the world wants to cheat you, there are also honest services like Satoshiround.

No kidding. This is a totally provably fair lottery active for more than 6 months and which has rewarded many users. Now we are back to the main chain, in Bitcoin. Does something seem strange to you?
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:20:00
Do not insult please, it's just a service communication.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:59:58
We are very sorry if you don't become one of our players, but as written several times on the website, in case of technical problems just contact us. To date we have NEVER had any problems of any kind. Best regards, sorry for misunderstanding.

Sorry but link works like a charm: 
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:30:46
Yes because we have already explained our motivations several times
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:36:29
Right or wrong it was our choice
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:54:56
Thank you for your support. Just trying to offer a fair and fun game. We take all your advice into consideration
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:17:56
Not true. I repeat, users have been asking for this. Many players use both btc and bch for various games, but evidently preferred this lottery in the btc version.
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:34:52
Just your opinion, not the truth. As such I accept it but I do not agree with it.
In life we must choose whether to believe in people's good faith or think that everything around us is a lie.
We have explained our motivations and will continue to offer the best service possible, everything else is not worth discussing here.

Do you live in Iceland? Games of this type are not accessible from there. If not you can go to: satoshiround.com
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:13:28
I do not understand what you mean
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:58:47
If this should happen (but maybe even earlier) a parallel lottery in BCH will also be added.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:35:16
1. Yes
2. We are evaluating it, LN will be the future 
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:57:24
Just corrected, thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:19:03
The war between btc and bch has nothing to do with this post. Satoshiround is a provably fair lottery and is now based on the Bitcoin network. Everything else does not concern us and we can only express our modest opinion.

The QR address has been added. Have fun and good luck!
