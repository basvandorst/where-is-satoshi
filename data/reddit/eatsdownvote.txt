Can someone TLDR this for me? Had a few beers...

Seems to me that being able to buy this with your 401K would drive the price UP ahead of bitcoin if the transactions did not post right away. It seems that you think GBTC is about to drop, can you explain please?

Reddit should do something like that, the karma just got real!

So it's clear that this is a scam, but do you think they just take your coins straight away, or return them if you make a small "investment" and then take the coins when you try a larger "investment?"
I'm curious, I will send them 0.1 BTC and let you guys know how it goes.
**Update** I received an email with a transaction number after filling out the form for a 1 star plan.
**Update 2** I received another email confirming they received my deposit of 0.1BTC. The email states the withdrawal date will be 12-24-2015.

I'm based in the USA. I'm not concerned about the .1BTC I sent, I knew it was a scam from the beginning. I just want to help report or get this site removed, I'm surprised at some of the other juvenile comments on this thread and the downvotes. I will check out the trading standards site, thanks tea-drinker.

I will try it out, this will be fun!

For comparison, the number of transactions per day was around 6k before the last halvening and now we are seeing an average of 150k.  I like to include this data because it shows that the adoption rate and demand are both increasing greatly, this is driving the price and should continue to do so. I'm investing as much as I can afford to. 
I feel like the stock market manipulation has to end at some point. If it doesn't that's even better for BTC since inflation.

I've been thinking about this since I got my shift card. On the one hand, you can now spend your bitcoin anywhere credit cards are accepted, and as you pointed out you can get cash from an ATM. However, these transactions still run over the credit card network and clearinghouse.
So, that means if someone gets your credit card number, they have access to your Bitcoins. I actually emailed Shift about this and they said that in the event of fraud, I would be covered by VISA. 
But, I feel like this might prevent people from making the leap to doing the entire transaction through the old infrastructure. 
My hope is that the Shift card is a step towards an entire economy without the credit card being used at all. For example, vendors are still paying a credit card transaction fee when I pay with the shift card, so it's not a 100% win.
Overall I feel like the Shift card is a step in the right direction.

The last time the reward halved the price went up 10 fold in the following year. Bitcoin was $12 each then, near $400 now.

Well for me the idea is to purchase BTC when I can, later I can spend them in USD when they are worth more. Maybe not the best use case, but holding BTC will help the community.

I didn't know that.

I'll be sure to do a write-up after the fact as a warning to the community. I hope we will have the reverse effect.

It will be interesting to see what happens here after the halvening, thanks for the link.

Mike Hearn is not personally in this video, it's just about him and Bitcoin in general; still a good video though.

Apparently that link is broken, sharing from Google news is hard.

In the informative article they say Bitcoin is at $300, posted today. It looks like an old article they never updated the price. Lots of misinformation about BTC out there.

Look at the geographical breakdown.
Most the searches are [coming from Ghana]( and Slovenia. It's good to see interest in the developing world, that's huge.

Omg what a weirdo

Why are you throwing the cards on the floor? Maybe just move them to the back of the stack so you don't have to clean up later?
