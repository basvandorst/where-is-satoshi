It doesn't really matter what the white paper says, nor what any individual wants bitcoin to be. It's a consensus algorithm, it'll be whatever the miner majority wants it to be, no matter how much anyone attempts to impose and rationalize the constraints they'd prefer to put it under.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:39:33
It's not ENTIRELY irrelevant: 
You're right none the less, anything can be exploited. Which is why you don't put things you care about on the internet. Like, idunno, private keys.

Tim Minchin captures it: "Science changes its views based on what's observed. Faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved."
The point being, any improvement that fixes a real world problem in an agreeable way, should be adopted by consensus, because the white paper does not and can not know about the real problems bitcoin will face.

That is also my initial reaction. This doesn't seem to indicate that cold storage in general is a problem at all.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:23:34
That is indeed interesting. However, that insurance won't matter much unless bitfinex was paying for the additional coverage, as 250k$ is a pretty small chunk.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:26:07
I'm pretty sure the insurance company won't consider bitfinex' customers BitGo's paying customers. Also, IMO the "had to keep them not commingled in a cold storage wallet" thing is misunderstood and nonesensical. It's a reference to their margin/lending/future system, and has nothing to do with cold storage of funds (which can easily be kept nicely seperate anyway).
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:49:07
I don't understand why one would take all these measures to have a days delay in using the money, when a cold storage provides better security and can be moved much faster?
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:44:47
..what? Can you back that up? My experience is that new and promising OSS projects get more maintainers than clones of existing proprietary things.

IP security is not really a significant security improvement. If your API keys are compromised, there's a good chance that's because the attacker gained access to your server, hence can tunnel an API call from there.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:51:00
All insufficient senses of security can be bad if nothing else, for the fact that they create an illusion of safety.
More layers of "not bad but not exactly good"-security is not what is needed, better security models at the core is. In this case, cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:41:25
Yes exactly! You write solidity code in counterparty! I'm pretty sure it qualifies 100% for the smart contract platform secured by bitcoin tag.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:43:55
How is it the first smart contract platform secured by bitcoin? That's exactly what  is.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:46:52
I have a feeling you didn't read it more than once. 
"did not actually deliver bitcoins **purchased on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis** to the traders who purchased them".
Nothing in this paragraph has anything to do with normal funds.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:44:08
But DDoS... :/
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:08:27
Well, he's not stating that is not possible, he's stating he used a non-standard nonce, and asking how are you gonna deduce that nonce. (in an obscure, heated "show me that source code then" kinda way).
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:23:07
That's indeed a difference. But no part of either being a smart contract platform, or being secured by bitcoin. Secured != pegged to.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:33:49
Yeah no. That was not about cold wallets for account funds. It was about margin trading / futures / lending, where they were forced to somehow pay out the loans.
the phrase people keep trying to use to make it seem like they were forced out of cold wallets is:
"During the Relevant Period, Bitfinex did not actually deliver bitcoins purchased
on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis to the traders who purchased them within the
meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(aa) of the Act. Instead, Bitfinex held the purchased
bitcoins in bitcoin deposit wallets that it owned and controlled."
Read that a few times. Tell me how that relates to wallet funds.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:12:59
Oh, I never used Bitfinex, so I didn't know you had to sign an agreement with BitGo and pay them money. Which I assume is the case, otherwise what you're saying doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:31:44
Possible, I just don't buy that they were forced by regulators not to use coldstorage. I'm sure they were happy to rid themselves of that hassle with BitGo's 100% secure hotwallet system.

Or in the reddit crypto subreddit crowd, to be honest.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:14:24
Yep, cryptoreddit hypetrain vibes are very embrasive when it comes to what constitutes a clear buy signal.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:11:01
By that logic doge coin will get the last laugh...
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:11:07
which is exactly not the same
@_date: 2019-11-11 07:51:17
P=NP is not really covering the plethora of scenarios that could murder bitcoin as we know it. A bug in the software, 51%, a superior alternative that actualy gains traction...
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:22:13
Well.. no. Banks cannot "store their own wealth as they please", and the way that banks invest is significant on a societal level, no matter how you like them.
@_date: 2019-11-17 09:03:10
No, what counts is the truth.
@_date: 2019-11-02 21:05:12
Of course, they wouldn't, really. Perhaps up a few surefire real estate cases, but not to people who need it
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:32:45
No. They already pay if they have lots, the news is paying when you have less.
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:05:17
Huh. I saw it as a sarcastic comment on this community.
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:51:12
It's cool to give credit. 
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:50:10
This. If you wanna fight centralization with bitcoin, please. But don't use tax evading / money laundering / financially illiterate stores to shoot down the existing infrastructure.
@_date: 2019-02-10 10:19:24
So bitcoin is a wasteful prestige project to prove to someone how suprerior we are?
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:59:53
Which 99.9% of financial institutions can't actually do.
@_date: 2019-01-20 10:01:40
Though the current best bet for scaling will take away censorship resistance..
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:19:25
Yeah, I'm trying to challenge the status quo where we don't question anything and assume that bitcoin will solve all the problems we refuse to understand, so we don't have to be political.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:17:04
Anyone who understands inflation cringes at these memes. But this is an echo chamber that can't really be bothered
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:55:04
That's exactly why lightning lol

He's pointing out that there's a difference between distributed storage, and crypto-paid bandwidth. This is most likely the last.
If this had anything to do with what siacoin does, bitcoin couldn't be used for it. They're not that interchangeable. Also it wouldn't make sense for file sharing, as it's way costly to host any serious amount of data in a decentralized fasion.
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:05:11
Oh, no no, I mean  :) It's like 30 bucks a month. Bootcamps are surely also effective, but not at all a requirement!
@_date: 2016-07-29 19:20:39
Ragequit would be to stop using bitcoin because the price drops. Dropping one of many exchanges because you don't care for their way of doing things is just good sense.

Doing code is paramount. Can't read your way into it. Codeschool is worth the money if you go for a language that they teach (afaik not a lot of python going on there), do their example apps, follow along, and then put it into practise on your own thing. Keep close to IRC or some other place where you can ask questions. Learn to love stack overflow. 
About the languages:
Javascript is two sided, on one side it's a very productive language for implementing things that you can see and "feel" - taking advantage of the plethora of frameworks and libraries for making interactive websites is a nice experience with a lot of immediate feedback, which can be a driver.
The downside is that javascript (while having recently improved) is a kinda inconsistent and obnoxious language. It follows some old-school paradigms, and debugging it is an art in and on itself. Expect gotchas.
Python is a language that has been especially embraced by the scientific community (and others) and draws a lot of it's power from some extremely solid mathematical and scientific libraries. It dominates when the subject skews towards statistics, machine learning, genetic algorithms, neural networks etc. 
While python was made to be easy to read and learn, it appeals more to the non-programmer in a few of it's language constructs and decisions.
Ruby (my prefered language so take anything with a grain of salt) is just a language made to be nice to code in. The focus was entirely on developer happiness, consistency, and code that tells it's story well. Because of rails, it's become a very dominant backend web language. This reason for that is because of it's powerful and easy-to-use (and to abuse) metaprogramming capabilities. Ruby does most things well, but doesn't have a killer feature like python or javascript does. However, it has a brilliant community, it doesn't require that you learn a new framework every 2 weeks *cough javascript*, and lends itself as nicely as python to writing isolated programs for everyday use.

Keep in mind that c++ is an old and painful language to learn and Work with, and in The context of bitcoins it is not a requirement unless you want to work on the actual reference implementation. Consider working with some more abstract interfaces in a nicer language while you're still getting familiar with coding. Personally I'd always recommending learning Ruby, as I feel it best accomplishes being a language that makes coding pleasant. And it has not been a barrier, I work now professionally on a bitcoin payment provider in Ruby. It's lucrative and feels great :)
@_date: 2016-07-19 08:12:13
Did anyone get imprisoned for having bitcoin already?
