Even then, yeah it did. It affected us non kimchi premiums as well. Because it didn't include them in the avg anymore. Resulting in it looking like dip. Enough to scare people. Then you add in the misunderstood 'ban' by the blue house and exchanges being raided and people start selling out of fear of having funds seized or something else. Korea mattered. It SHOULDN'T, but it did.
