Hope that's a throwaway account man. There's a lot of great people in this sub, but don't forget the internet is an unforgiving and ruthless space. Don't want to attract the attention of the wrong people.

Nearing $18Bn!!!

This has been concerning me a bit. See what I did there ;).

Lands on it's feet though ;)

It happened with coinbase earlier, and I don't think it was an issue just too much activity at once.

I lost my shit, that was fucking hilarious. Thank you so much for sharing. Is that really the origin of the term "hodl"??

If people could get working internet and electricity like pointed out it would potentially function as the only currency available (?), other than you know like people using force/power to get what they want/need.

I invested very little in BTC compared to those on this sub, but as a 22 year old unemployed college grad. with student loan payments just starting I'm really torn on what to do at this point. I "invested" around October 1st at a price of $640/BTC. I've seen my initial investment grow more than 30% and now we're looking at a price that's essentially a 3yr. high. 
Losing it all wouldn't kill me, but I can probably only afford to hold onto my coin for another few months before rent/utilities/loans start to crush my savings. You think I should liquidate? The only thing holding me back is the potential of Trump taking office in January and the price continuing to soar. I know this isn't the place for questions really, I'm just not sure what the odds are of the price hitting say 1500 within the next 2 months or continuing to grow enough in the short term to justify holding on.

Even though it's down the relative dips are really not significant. I mean it's dropped but it's not plummeting. It still seems like significant overall long term growth is happening.

When there's a will there's a way.

Thanks.

This could be completely off base, but wouldn't the most obvious culprit for a large hack of a BTC exchange be a powerful government like the US? The IRS has clearly expressed interest in examining accounts, and you just know that intelligence agencies are dying to quell the cryptocurrency idea for obvious implications to the role of fiat currency. Then of course there is the whole money laundering/black market aspect which I'm sure has brough btc onto their radar many many times... Just saying.

Thanks! On a side note, I guess DDoSing is a LOT easier than I thought haha. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 08:14:19
Yeah I just went with Thread.sleep()

I guess only 24% of us do. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:44:58
Honestly, I don't have enough for that to be worth it. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:57:04
No, I'm stubborn and I like eclipse haha!
edit: Alright, so I downloaded IDEA. I stand corrected this shit is awesome!
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:44:44
True, which is why I invested so little. I already watched the original BTC surges and kicked myself for using my btc and not holding onto some so I decided I needed to give it a shot. I'm definitely happy with my experience so far, and I think it's an amazing piece of technology, but you're right it will be there in 5 years when I'm (hopefully) more stable economically.  
edit: Thanks for the advice! At this point because I'm likely going to dump most of what I have relatively soon. I want to at least maximize what I can get out of it. Just not sure if this surge is going to stop overnight... either way it's been a fun ride.

I barely understand what money is any more. It's a fiat currency, the fed controls interests rates, vague connections to OPEC/oil prices/petro dollar.

Your gif was funny while also being a somewhat insightful (whilst not overly critical) critique of a subreddit I enjoy. Being dumb and gross while being smart or successful is what makes the internet so much fun.

Username checks out. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 04:38:11
Thanks I will! It would be cool to track the order book and try and do some math. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:34:12
I actually just figured out webcrawling/scraping today so it's my first program that does anything like this, didn't realize the while true would do that (makes sense though, oops!). I didn't really format the code for easier reading yet, usually I'm better with commenting and making code readable. Thanks for the input!
edit: Lol yeah looking now this code is totally unreadable lol. Still a lot of fun though. I'm really enjoying the webscraping, makes coding a lot more interesting than what I normally do!

You're probably right about that bitcoin bump.
