Roman is a crook who stole my bitcoin. Easy for him to repay cash he probably used to buy more bitcoin with. Just more fraud to make some feel good PR so he can set everybody up again. He's scum as far as I'm can tell from the evidence in my case. I'll never do business with anything he's associated with EVER.

I bought $200 worth of BTC when they were almost $10 each. It is my opinion that he stole them and then claimed somebody hacked his system and got them. He has shown not a spec of proof otherwise. From the evidence, he is indistinguishable from a common thief. There is .5+ BTC left on my account there. He refuses to send them to my wallet. His system just says "Internal Sever Error" every time I try to transfer them to my wallet. Unless he returns not only every penny of cash but each and every BTC people lost in Bitfloor, I hope this follows this creep every place he goes for the rest of his life so that even his grand kids and such confront him with it every time they see him. Maybe those people recommending Bitlfloor to you were his sock-puppets.

I had about $200 worth of bitcoin there when they supposedly got robbed. I haven't got squat back. Not even a thank you.

I cringe when I see the words "based off of." They usually mean, for best results, stop reading now and spend the time twiddling your thumbs. But, I decided to type this little ditty and be on my way.

It's probably some kind of scam or incompetence. I watched the video, did the captcha and got the message that they couldn't pay me because my browser settings were wrong or some extension interfered. I tried two other browsers and now the message is that they don't have any videos available. 
Fuck them.
