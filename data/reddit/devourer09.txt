Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.
I think they could, but only if they had something like a warrant. Ideally, no government entities should be able to access your private information without a warrant. That's why [comment]( is relevant, because in order for government agencies to know whether you possess illegal data they need a warrant.
**HOWEVER**, now we all know that the NSA is collecting all the data they can get their hands on. So most likely, they already know what data is in a citizen's possession **WITHOUT** a warrant. Whether they act on this information or not, the public can not be certain.

I'm glad he adds an alternative perspective to things, but I'm highly skeptical of the things he says.

First time I'm hearing about someone not liking Anderson Cooper. Him, Sanjay Gupta, and Don Lemon are the only things I like about CNN. The rest of it can rot and die.

If you would read the white paper on bit coin written by Satoshi nakamoto, you would see that he explains that the incentives to commit fraud using the network should be so expensive to the attacker that it would be in his (economic) interest to not commit fraud (as mining returns would be greater).
In this case that is invalidated, but that is still the intention of the protocol as it was originally written.
Sheesh, do I have to fucking spell it out for you you snarky so-in-so.
