Kraken is the worst. High ass fees, slow engine with low liquidity and terrible slippage. Fuck em.

I'm more of the opinion that making BTC forbidden for chinese will destroy some of its value proposition. i like it as an instrument for capital flight.

This is where you can pay me back for wasting my time with this trash.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:38:02
You pay to receive cash for cash transactions like drugs
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:09:00
It's tough. How are you able to do this safely? I can imagine people might feel it necessary to assault you on your way to the exchange even if you're not carrying any fiat to give them.
Stay safe out there.
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:30:10
Better not sell if this shit dips another $200 like it's about to.
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:48:25
They're selling a gimmick for $100 lmao.
Also you pretty much have to live in abject poverty to spend under the withdrawal limit on this shit.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:02:43
Nah up and downbarts
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:32:31

Wanna explain what KYC means?
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:06:17
Yeah thanks, never used an atm so i didn't know what they were really like.
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:11:53
I bet since he designed it to be a system of digital cash then yea, it was imagined that it would be used for all name of cash transactions like drug trade.
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:32:30
Lol then everyone started to sell thinking it couldn't hold and got rekt shorting up to 20k

But I thought bitcoin was real. Should I be dumping BTC?
@_date: 2018-07-15 08:36:21
Dude educate yourself a little bit on what money even is and how it works. 
Money is not the green notes in your pocketbook..
You can already pay for rent with bitcoin through various services. 
you better not pussy out now if you're holding.
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:03:54
So in other words Hodl!

Finalhash is all good and dandy but I prefer Moroccan blood hash

@_date: 2013-08-06 13:55:37

How would i go about restoring it without losing my current wallet's funds?

@_date: 2013-08-06 07:04:39
When you say "unearth your old wallet" do you mean the .dat file?
