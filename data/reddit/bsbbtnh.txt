Except it is all done on a public ledger that everyone has access to, and will be around for the life of the currency.

This is why one of the forks will end up doing much better.

Isn't there going to be a fork on the 28th? I wonder how that'll affect bitcoin.

Isn't there about to be a wave of forks? Free bitcoin in some ways, in other ways, BTC itself could get overtaken.

Got tipped 500 bits for a silly [pumpkin joke]( *3 years ago*, worth $0.17 then. I actually just withdrew it from changetip (0.0003 transaction fee), but damn, that still over $3 today! 
If only I'd stuck to pumpkin humour, I could be a btcbillionaire today.

What if one of the upcoming forks overtakes BTC? BTC is *useless* now. It has proven it is, and it isn't willing to change. It takes too long to transfer, it is useless for small amounts now, and the fees (which was the whole drawing point of BTC) are hurting it. It has never been anonymous.
Now we have some forks that are (or will be) competing on these areas. Once the masses start using them, BTC loses its value. Could be the most spectacular crash in modern history. 
Dec 28th man. End of the ^^BTC world.

Which bitcoin has done many times.

Because networking is the best thing you can do in college. If you pass with the lowest grades, you still have the same piece of paper as the person who spent 4 years locked in their dorm studying. If you're in a frat, you have friends, lots of them. You get to know people, trust people, socialize. You do volunteer work, you're involved in events and clubs. 
By the time you graduate, you'll have friends/connections with people who have now been employed for 3 years in good paying jobs. You piggyback off some of them, and you'll have a job the day you leave college. Your job will likely pay more than any you would have seen advertised. And you didn't have to knock on a thousand doors alongside a thousand new grads.
Hell, if you get involved in the alumni, you'll meet people who can *create* jobs for you. At the least, *they* will have their own network that is much, much more advanced than your own.
Likewise, many fraternities have members that are now in the top echelons of government, industry, commerce, everywhere and anywhere. And your being a member allows you varying degrees of access to those very people.
