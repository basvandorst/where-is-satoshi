Jihan has 20%, and he's beholden to the economic incentives that secure the network. 
he can fork off to Bcash if he wants, we'd be better rid of him. of course bitcoin's centralized mining isn't ideal, but it's nowhere near a 51% attack. ASICs actually align long-term incentives. switching costs are prohibitively high. miners only recoup their investments if they support the currency.

1. That article on coindesk is virtue-signaling trash. Women are the only ones that have a need for privacy? Seriously? 
2.  Anonymity will never be added to bitcoin. There are far, far too many vested interests which love the transparency of the blockchain. A de-anonymized bitcoin is a wet dream of the NSA / IRS/ Facebook /  google. They will never let bitcoin go private. 
Yes, I'm a monero shill, whatever. I'm a big believer in bitcoin but the powers that be won't permit native privacy.

And monero has a scaling problem too. However expensive / heavy transactions are the price for privacy. There's tradeoffs. Monero doesn't claim to be bitcoin, or satoshi's original vision. It's an entirely different protocol. 
Monero will have to change if it wants to grow, and that's fine. We're going to do it with consensus rather than hostile hard forks.

no it's not. it's a high fee due to the spam attacks on the network and the slower blocks due to the bcash attack on the network. 
luckily bcash is on a stupid rollercoaster of difficulty where it's now way more difficult to mine. 
for 99.9% of bitcoin's existence, fees have been much lower. segwit will help. lightning network and more collaborative development by the most qualified (core) will fix this.

democracy is not a truth machine. 
an informative and functioning forum needs moderation. every moderator on reddit knows this. I am 100% fine with banning of conspiracists/maligners/propagandists/sybil attackers. Bitcoin is a tad sanitized but that's ok. There is an objectively better way to scale than to arbitrarily increase blocksize and the technically adept among us know it; the impatient and the ignorant don't. It's fine if we keep them out.

This is badly needed. 
Few understand that decentralization extends not only to miners and nodes, but also those in charge of the network. 
Bitcoin is one of the few actually decentralized networks out there. Even though people hate on Core. 
Necessary but not sufficient conditions for decentralization: 
1. Political decentralization  (governance)
2. Miner decentralization   
3. Node decentralization   
Bcash has none of these. Bitcoin has all of these. You make your mind up.

This is incredibly amateurish, and it ignores a ton of valid criticisms. It's advocacy disguised as academia. This "academic" is anonymous because they're an undergrad somewhere who just learned about NPV
For instance, bitcoin's fungibility is not "very high". And banknotes' fungibility is not "low." Banknotes are probably more fungible than bitcoin right now. There's a reason black market activity occurs with physical cash. 
Other claims that are just factually untrue 


Wishful thinking. Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's pseudonymous 


I think bit just means bit 


... no. USD is the global reserve currency. It's used in places where local money sucks. 


Maybe in 5 years? 


You also have to estimate the velocity of money. I guess the writer hasn't gotten to MV = PQ yet in his Econ 101 class. 


Money isn't scarce by design. In fact, money is generally inflationary. Scarcity isn't intrinsic to money. 
And who can forget this clanger


I'm all for decent academia in the space but this piece is just poor. There's a reason people put their names on things. It's so they can be made accountable.

it already is. whenever there is a primarily male-occupied space that generates wealth, value, or social goods in some way, it's only a matter of time until the media demands that it is opened to women, redistributed, and those social goods are appropriated from the (mostly) men who developed them. regardless of how it came to be occupied by men (natural curiosity, risk-seeking tendencies, technological awareness, etc).

I agree. But it's expensive to take a vulnerable system and make it ironclad. Easier to start with one that is amenable to things like formal verification. There are very good criticisms of solidity out there. Ultimately, the most efficient system that disburses smart contracts as cheaply and securely as possible will probably win. Will it be ethereum? I doubt it.

you literally can't trade it anywhere. if it's not liquid, it's not real. repeat after me. something you can't sell has no value. you can't participate in the market. 
when the markets actually open, and 18.5m BCH appear out of nowhere, true price discovery will occur. and guess what? It'll settle at a reasonable valuation. probably no more than $150.

@_date: 2017-08-23 13:04:50
They are either misinformed or malicious. 
Every one taking a sincere stance on the issue owes it to themselves and the community to leave the echo chamber and educate themselves. For instance, I sincerely considered big blocks for a few months. Read everything about the scaling debate. Then understood why they were wrong. That's the inevitable outcome of someone who dares to understand the implications of the tech and understands bitcoin's essential goals. 
I have no sympathy for those who choose easy, convenient solutions to hard problems, because they can't be bothered to educate themselves or reconsider their existing beliefs. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:37:59
I guess [this]( is a pretty good description of the term.
Put simply (I'm kind of an idiot so I might be totally off-base here) I think it means "a system's ability to remember things."
I'm imagining Siri versus a smarter chatbot. I ask her "What's the weather like today?" (Warm, sunny) and "what about tomorrow?" (I don't know what you mean). That's a system that can't remember one string to the next. A rich and stateful system is one which says "cold, rainy" in response to the 2nd query, having understood the context. 
Again, I might be totally off-base. It's basically a neologism coined by Vitalik, so it can mean anything he wants it to mean. He is an expert in obfuscation through complexity, which allows him to con so many otherwise intelligent people. I wouldn't take anything he says too seriously.

my guess is that the BCC/BTC exchange rate over the week following Aug 1 will be less than .1, probably closer to 0.05. I see mixed feelings in about BCC, many are adopting a wait and see approach and many are conflicted about this versus saving their energies for the hard fork battle in November. to me this is somewhat of a nothing burger, albeit one with an incredibly successful PR campaign. How many bitcoin-enabled airdrops generated this much press and anxiety? Stellar? not even in the same galaxy. 
as for the intermediate case – hard to tell. perhaps something closer to a 5% loss of the original network (assuming some other partial desertion–i.e. joint users). using the sensitivity table, if 5% of the network split, that would yield an original network worth 90.25% of its initial value, with the joint value being only marginally higher. these numbers aren't absolute, of course, it's just a useful model.

Just flatly denying that I said anything of substance in the entire article because you disagree with a paragraph isn't particularly charitable. 
This is a case study meant to illustrate a point, not the core argument. That is made in the metcalfe table earlier in the article. 


Key word, seems to confirm. Objectively, value was destroyed as a result of the split in the two month period following the split. Ethereum plus Ethereum Classic equaled less than Ethereum, prior to the split. Eventually, value was unlocked as Ethereum Classic went in a different direction, sticking with PoW, different monetary policy, getting its own devs, etc. So value was quite clearly unlocked. There were two factions within the ethereum world and they went their own separate ways. The split facilitated that. Will bitcoincash have the same effect on bitcoin? I doubt that it will be as dramatic. Bitcoin cash seems to have less support than ETC did relative to ETH. 
I didn't want to elaborate too much on the ETH/ETC split. The article was already long enough. 


Not sure what the commenter is saying here. You can measure networks by the number of unique users and potential connections they have to each other. Since new users have a synergistic effect, network effects exist. That's really it. It's quite simple. 
Network effects are real; I don't need to argue for that here. Others have done so persuasively. I was talking about a specific variant, with regards to nodes in a communications network. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:55:35
for the record, I believe you. just want to say I'm sorry it happened to you. since the exchange was seized by the feds, you might have a chance at getting that money back, but it will probably take an incredibly long time. 
10k is a lot of money, but you can still work your way back from that. many bitcoiners have lost a ton over the years in exchange hacks or whatever, but the security of being your own bank keeps us coming back. 


bitcoin itself is safe, but exchanges are not. especially those in foreign jurisdictions. the coins are only safe if you own the private keys and no one else does.

Thank you for the comment, this is useful work. I was operating under the assumption that there wouldn't be much overlap. From the ETH/ETC precedent there really isn't much. I don't know why a small blocker would want to use BCC - I certainly won't be touching it. But I guess it's useful to model overlap!

This article covers that. It goes into detail on the potential for the split to be a 'value unlock', as the ETH/ETC split proved to be. In the 2-3 months following the ETH split though, the combined value of the two chains was less than that of ethereum pre-split. This article takes the position that the network split is damaging, and the value unlock is not guaranteed.
