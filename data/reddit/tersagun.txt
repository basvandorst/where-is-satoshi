What does that mean now? A possible haircut scenario is that only  BTC balances will be involved even if a users BTC is still in the BFX wallets? What kind of logic is this? It's like it's BTC's fault so that every BTC holder is responsible.
Either 'everyone' gets a haircut or everyone will be evaluated individually.

Sweet dreams! 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:38:25
What is the logic behind this? 
Why is a BTC holder (not hacked) responsible while a ETH holder (not hacked) isn't? 
All customers are Bitfinex's customers, why treating them differently? Is it because BitGO is involved for BTC wallets?

You don't understand how this works. 
Core can do nothing, no one can do anything as it's  by design. Bitcoin is a decentralized platform,  "core"  does not have any power to do such things. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:57:17
BTU attacking "core" does not make much sense under any condition. The "facts" are:
-Miners are mining for profit.
-Miners always would like a change that would deliver more profit to miners in short/mid/long term.
-BU believes current blocksize limit is hindering BTC value because it makes bitcoin a slow and expensive system.
In the case of a hardfork, if there would be 2 alternative chains and if BU attacks the minority chain with their hashrate, what would the outcome be?
Bitcoin core chain would be fucked, the value would sink to hell. Most people, ordinary people, would flee from Bitcoin and most of them WILL NOT return to either chain. Who would trust the BU chain in that scenario? An evil organization who is attacking the rivals by just brute force. In the end, people would just leave both Bitcoin chains for altcoins and that evil BU organization will calculate NASA projects with their billion dollar Bitmain devices.
Do you think they would really attack the core chain under any cirumstances? It would just kill their WHOLE business.

Yes it's possible.  And do you think that's a danger and an unwanted scenario? 
If yes,  then you should immediately quit bitcoin because that danger will NOT vanish.  It won't vanish if core changes the PoW mechanism,  it won't vanish if we apply any blocksize feature. 
You are way too late to realize that for someone with immense budget,  it's possible to kill Bitcoin.

Any proof that satoshi is alive or he has 10% of total bitcoin?

Selling is 1 transaction; when you sell its done in one transfer and then you are out.  If you have bitcoin,  you keep creating transactions. Furthermore,  many exchanges have shared wallets. So if you sell,  there is practically nothing going on on the blockchain.

Well not really.  I first met Bitcoin because a guy asked me to send it over PayPal.  I did check it out and it was a better way to send money because PayPal was charging too much. 
It all falls to what bitcoin is gonna be.  Either the currency of the Internet or digital gold. Altcoins are will become the currency of Internet if it goes like this. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:09:05
So we are at the point to compare bitcoin to PayPal? Bitcoin should be superior to paypal on most of the vital points.  If it does not have an advantage on cost,  why would the average Joe use bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:52:37
That's the first time I hear that argument.  Most of the BU guys believe the opposite 
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:35:38
Care to elaborate? I'm curious as well.

Sabotaging SegWit makes sense as it means shrinking transaction fee income for the miners. At least that's what I understand by SegWit, I'm not really in a position to understand the technical analysis behind it.
All I mean is, BU cannot be that evil and the community should stop splitting into 2 camps, both assuming the other side to be evil. BU wants a strong a valuable Bitcoin and the blocksize limit is hindering it which is a fact. SegWit might be a solution, variable blocksize limit could be a solution but something must be done in a sane mind without accusing the otherside. 
I just don't like how the community behaves. No side is the enemy.

Cheap and fast money transfer was major selling point for Bitcoins mass adaption though.  Most people use it for practical reason and not for their political stand. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:27:04
I don't expect anyone to behave or act ethically; I assume every party to be selfish and that's what makes decentralization fun as it keeps everything in balance.
If the BU community really wants to go black and sabotage the whole ecosystem, that would be a very expensive suicide and it would hurt them most. That's why I "trust" their intention of keeping Bitcoin valuable. 
Oh, and as a side not. Not claiming Core to be bad guys but just some brainstorming:
Core "sabotaging" Bitcoin is much more likely then "Bitmain". 
Core=some developers. They could just sell their Bitcoin and then take their hats and leave; they wouldn't lose much. They can still continue their life with developing something else.
Bitmain/Chinese psycho guys = Hardware producers&amp;owners. If Bitcoin is fucked up, their all business is fucked up as they won't be able to sell their products and their current rigs would be worth nothing. 
Who do you think would fear more from a weak bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:56:41
Why should I pay 1$ for a 20$ transfer? That is PayPal level.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:40:38
We all should stop using wrong words. There is nothing "dishonest" by wanting BU. 
You guys give too much value/centralization to the "core". Isn't Bitcoin an open-source project? Who is "core" to decide anything? If majority (majority as in hash-power) wants a chance, they have that right.
Bitcoin and PoW in general is a flawed system if you ask me but that's Bitcoin. There is no other way to create a fair poll.  If Bitcoin were a PoS system then people would blame the whales, claiming a few people/exchanges having full control on the system. 
I'm sorry but either you have to embrace the fact that hashpower=vote or you should quit Bitcoin.
I'm not defending BU or I'm not in a position to judge if their claim makes sense or not but it just makes me sick to ignore all the hashpower and just call them Chinese muppets.

how come there is such a giant gap between CNY and USD markets? CNY was always leading but the difference wasn't bigger than 20-30USD
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:37:14
But why must arbitrage be the reason for an equal price?
I mean, China drives the price for years, that is known. I would assume that if China price increases by 20%, Western markets will follow shortly. Why wouldn't an USD/Euro trader buy until the price catches CNY level? 
...or maybe Chinese volume is mostly fake and doesn't necessarily determine the price.

Does anyone even use Tether? I've signed up for Beta access to fund Bitfinex but not sure if I'll ever get invited and how it performs.
