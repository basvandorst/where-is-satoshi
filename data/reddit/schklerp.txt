Really? How do we "know" that? Do you have any evidence at all to support that allegation?
It seems to me if that were true, the high profile hidden service take downs would be reflected by a huge drop in traffic on the Tor network, right? Why do no such drops appear on the charts of Tor traffic?
You've been duped by the oldest propaganda trick in the book:

Right, because those headlines stir up peoples emotions and drive clicks/views. Media thrives on the shocking and sensational.
Do you have any evidence to support that Tor is primarily used to commit crimes, other than your impression based on mainstream media coverage?

I think you're profoundly misinformed. Yes, any easily accessible, commonly known directory of hidden sites is going to be aimed at vice.
Guess what? Dissidents and journalists with their lives on the line don't tend to go posting their links on easily discoverable websites.
Traffic volumes on the Tor network are publicly viewable. Notice the lack of decline in volume during the high profile take downs of illegal websites.
Better yet, watch some of the lecture's by Jacob Applebaum, one of the lead developers of the Tor project.
Its tragic that people are abusing Tor as a tool to harm other people, but lets not loose sight of the fact that privacy technologies like this are increasingly vital to journalism and democracy.
Getting rid of Tor won't stop violence or drug use. But it might very well destroy whats left of the free press.
