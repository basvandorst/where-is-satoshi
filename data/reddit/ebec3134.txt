This is fantastic but even after approval it will still be an uphill fight to get the VA to adopt it and the VA/DOD are the largest treaters of PTSD.  However, if this can "cure" or at least moderate it it could save the VA many millions in disabilty compensation.  PTSD brings along a number of other problems like substance abuse (drugs/ alchohol) which in turn aggravates the PTSD.  The drugs in use have other side effect than than they listed like killing any kind of initiative. They mentally numb you, great when Bitcoin is dropping like a rock.��
This condition (it is not an illness, it is a normal responce to a extream traumatic event) has never had the open minded research it needs.  The community can make a difference.

And for the record, Greg Maxwell doesn’t have a Twitter or Facebook account.

This is all very interesting, one group singing praises, the other condemns.  How many of you really know Greg.  How many of you were there when a bitcoin was 50 cents yet he was the future and worked towards? How many of you have been helped by Greg? He says.things as he sees them if  that doesn't fit your world view then that is your problem.  Greg was a key player in Blockstream even being created.  He was there when he was most needed. Now, his work is done and it is time to move on to other challenges. As a company grows it becomes a life of It’s own and not what it was in the beginning. Enjoyable challenges become worrisome problems.  Happiness is doing what you really love to do.
You can rest assured that what ever it is, it will be good for Bitcoin in the run.

I fully expect it to hit 10,000 by Wed, it will bounce around 10k for a while then take off again blowing past the 10k mark.

Let's just say I have someone that has been an integral part of Bitcoin and I follow his passion.  Also, I feel you should not put anymore into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose.  As a small business owner that has to compete  against very large companies I have never felt that o could do it.  Even though it may be late in the game I may get into it soon, just to hold it.

You are not alone, I have been following it since it was pocket change and just set up an account yesterday.  My slowness was not a lack of long term faith but rather just not wanting to add something to my already busy life.  Have I lost millions that I could have made, maybe, did I save myself from a loss, maybe.  No matter how good this looks there are external forces (and some internal) that still make this a crap shoot.

Very good article.  I am not a crypto holder but I have been following Bitcoin from it's earliest days, when a Bitcoin couldn't pay for a cup of coffee.  This has to be looked at in the long term. Standard's must be held up against the quick profit. It will be a long time before Bitcoin will be really mainstream (try teaching your grandmother how to buy using Bitcoin).  In the intrem the games need to stop, the personal attacks need to stop, and everyone needs to look to the future.

That is true but it is the price to be paid for lack of regulation.  Some of the thing that are alleged to be happening if done with stocks would bring down the Rath of Hell from the SEC.  The funny thing is this was the topic of discussions after thanksgiving dinner.  My  95 year old mother seem to grab it better than 3 younger brothers.  One of them got it partly by asking if he could invest in Bitcoin via his IRA. This is the type of thinking that will lead to mainstream adoption. Bitcoin is not good as currency yet but is good to hold wealth and get a return on.  High risk but potential for high return.  Putting 10% of a retirement account into Bitcoin is not a bad idea.  Have you priced CD lately?
