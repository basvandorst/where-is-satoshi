I'm not so sure you'd like what they'd have to say :p

Nice with some competition, that might force the local fees down (like safello and btcx with their ridiculous ~10% fees)

Bitcoin uses a system called gitian that creates deterministic builds (anyone compiling the same revision of the source code will get the same application binary). 
Each release is built by a number of people who then verify that the result is correct and sign off on it with their pgp key. [See here](
If you'd like to verify builds you can check out how to build here; 
Edit: guess I misread the question

Keep the changetip circle-jerk away from SO, please.

Ok, this seemed nice til I realized they require my phone number before I can do anything. Why don't they use something like Google's 2FA?

Well, he can start by looting his donation accounts on altcoins, e.g: 
That should net him some extra cash :)

Litecoin is very similar to Bitcoin. It uses sha256 for transactions hashes, block hashes, public key hashes etc because scrypt is just too slow for those things. The only things they did different are;
* 2.5min block time target instead of 10
* different base58 prefixes
* lower starting difficulty (I guess because the pow is more compute intensive than sha256)
* a new function for proof of work calculation (scrypt), but it still uses sha256 for the block hash (e.g. previous block hash in header), the pow validation is basically just using the scrypt algorithm instead of sha256
* 84 instead of 21 million coins
Everything else is the same as Bitcoin. Now that ASICs have been produced for scrypt, its only benefit is a faster block time (which admittedly is quite nice, bitcoin confirmations are sometimes annoyingly slow). But there are disadvantages to using scrypt instead of sha256; e.g. it uses more power (perhaps not as bad on asics), slower on mobile and drains more battery, validation is slower etc. But since it is only used for block proof of work, I guess the difference is negligible.
The advantage with this approach for Litecoin is that any software for Bitcoin can basically be copy-pasted, and after changing a few variables it will work with their coin.

It sure is! I doubt this party is over. I'll probably buy into the next dump if there is one :P

Haha, I'm not *that* much of a bagger

Works fine in Sweden too.

Maybe he's referring to this;

Cool to see Bitcoin mentioned in swedish mainstream media. But must say it's a bit disappointing that the main focus of the article seems to be kncminer. They are a rotten bunch of assholes. But I guess it makes sense, since they're by far the most successful swedish bitcoin company and all the controversy likely gives the newspaper more traffic. :/
But they should at least have mentioned Safello, they seem do be doing well. I wonder if she left the exchanges out on purpose. ;o /tinfoil
