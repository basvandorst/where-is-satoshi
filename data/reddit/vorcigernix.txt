Well, in reality, you will probably have to install this kind of virus to Linux yourself, under root priveleges.

Is it the same thing I have in Revolut for quite some time or I am missing something?

I'll just reiterate what others said: antivirus is not solution. Use secure system, iPhone seems to be best thing for average user, Chromebooks are also known for security. Buying one of those is still a fraction of price you just paid.

I still think it is more than money. It is a tool to change our society.

No, that's not the reason. Most of ticketing systems and discussion forums predates github. Creating issue in github is equally difficult to the systems you mention. 
All of that makes me wonder why would anyone write a comment like this, you are clarly capable of using reddit, so there is literally no chance you even tried to simply follow what suggested.

Well. I fought my fight for democracy 20 years ago. But having army of mercenaries in my side would make me feel I already lost.
@_date: 2019-09-02 05:58:23
Yeah, fighting Chinese army. Brilliant idea.

When Apple is watching anything, you know they will introduce a new invention which will basically copycat existing thing, but open it to the general public.

Nah, OP is right, we need some hype, overhyped prices and some correction - I want to buy my bitcoins at 4k as I was used to.
