It could just as easily be someone advocating other solutions than a blocksize increase that is spamming the network as any solution that involves higher txs will increase profits to certain parties.
The point being whether its increased block size, offchain solutions or something else we need a system that can handle all this. We can complain until we've pulled out all our hair about such large numbers of txs but the system allows it therefore it will always be an issue whether we like it or not. Its part of the freedom offered by bitcoin and we have to deal with it somehow, and preferably in a way that isn't going to destroy the system.

The blockchain has found several novel uses (for example for voting mechanisms) and the only common denominator is the fee they pay, if they pay more their tx goes through before others. Or do you wish to unilaterally dictate which types of tx are considered valid and which ones are considered exploits?

Which is exactly the problem with deflation.

Satoshi isn't god despite how much we like bitcoin, he is just a man and he can do bad as well as good with it, no one deserves that kind of wealth.

More like they can, therefore they will. Complaining about it is not the solution, we need something that will make bitcoin impervious to spam attacks or anything else people can dream of using the blockchain for. As long as their txs will go through with fees, regardless of their motives they will keep doing such things from time to time.

Except you can't rely on only responsible parties using the blockchain, people go on about bitcoin being about freedom but then they don't like the freedom people use it for. The thing is if we want bitcoin to be successful it needs to be able to survive such things and a lot of people think its people advocating block size increases spamming the network but it can equally be people advocating offchain solutions doing the spam or for all we know there might be a legit purpose to it even if the party is not responsible as you say.

Yes because miners clearly don't want 7000$ in fees.


Clearly the blockchain shouldn't be a useful technology for wider applications /s

If DDoS'ers pay the website for every request they send I am pretty sure the websites would be overjoyed.

Simple, send bitcoins directly to pools that signal uniquely for segwit in order to give miners a higher % and more miners will put their hardware in those pools.

Wait, are you saying bitcoin is NOT a cult?!?!!?!

I knew altcoins were in a bubble when the loaning rates on poloniex for btc were 2% per day. Bitcoin is in a bubble but one that is not yet matured imo. There are way more red flags to see before it has come full swing.

Its exactly the same thing when talking about the US: "this was what the founding fathers wanted"

Well you complained about inflation and I gave you the specific maths about how much it costs you, under 5$ a month.
I'm a big bitcoin fan but spreading misinformation about the currency system is not going to help it, and bitcoin is certainly worth more than just the inflation factor which as I calculated for you is a net cost to you of 5$ a month. Actually I think you undervalue bitcoins true purpose.

I get the idea of real wages stagnating (though I'm not from the US so its not quite relevant to me) but the value of the US dollar comparisons is quite unfair because you don't account for interest rates. If you had put a dollar in a interest bearing bond, in the past 50 years you would have gotten far more than the inflation rate. Even a bank for most of the time paid an interest rate that was above inflation, the last few years is a bit of a historically unique situation though and it remains to be seen how it ends up playing out.

Plus the fact that such transactions are normally reversible. Cash cards (paysafecard), prepaid debit cards, gift certificates were the option of choice but all the above had a massive cost to the ransomware hacker to liquidate whereas bitcoin doesn't.

You have a point about government overspending but when you suggest recessions are evaporating the value of the dollar you are wrong, recessions cause deflation because people stop spending. In other words these recessions are increasing the value of the dollar, who they hit is those that have substantial debt.
The term cash is king applies to both every day spending and investments during recessions.

But when you are advocating to save in bitcoin in order to avoid the loss of US dollar value it is an unfair comparison because no one in their right mind would hold US dollars for years or decades without getting interest on it. This is the point you completely miss, you don't compare one type of savings to something that is only held for a quick transaction, you compare one type of savings to another. You are doing an apple to oranges comparison.
edit: to give you exact figures the total currency in circulation in the US is 850$ billion which is about 2650$ per person in the US, so with an average inflation rate of 2% per year the seigniorage tax is only about 55 dollars per year per citizen. If you are arguing bitcoin as a currency reduces this tax I will agree, it would save the population 55 dollars per year on average. All other forms of money other than currency in circulation will bear an interest and so the seignorage tax is much less or negative.
