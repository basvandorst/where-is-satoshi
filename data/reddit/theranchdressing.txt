I had no plans to do anything with it. It was an asset. I got most of my coins when they werent even worth 50-30usd a piece.

Can confirm had almost 3 grand stolen from me for selling "virtual goods". I hosted Mw2 modded lobbies for donations and sold jtag'd Xbox's. Donations where sent as gifts 98% of the time. And jtags where sold via goods and services. I was able to get back about 2k after about a year. But it wasnt fun. And now anytime i use pp the fees just keep going up up and up.

Why not accept litecoins too? ... Ill probably get down voted for that, but i have so many at this point(from mining), and ive only heard horror stories about trading them for BTC or USD... So, id buy a few mugs if you did, just looking to get rid of them at this point...

Not with that kinda attitude. We here at BTCPROHELP know the value of .001 BTC and we make it worth it! 
We are* also traded on the market. So.

I had all my wallet login info stored in .txt file. User::Passwd which was encrypted. I lost the cipher, which i stored offline. And i used to strong of encryption to break it with hashcat, JTR, etc. Ive tried.
I didnt lose it in the conventional sense.  I also never thought there would be a use for it again. 
And its not like i can just go recover it lol

Thank you for the info. Any idea of what type of lawyer to contact?

What about those who had all their BTC in Mt Gox? .... Id own a house, a nice car and have some saved for retirement.... If i didn't lose all my coins to Mt Gox. I had 150 btc in my wallet, roughly. It was my rainy day fund, and was purely holding on to them just for fun(never thinking they'd end up being worth what they are now). I figured id cash them out and maybe get 500 to a couple grand. I mined most of them, bought/given some, and won a few in contests. I eventually combined them all in my Mt Gox, i had them scattered accross different wallets, so i thought massing them in one online wallet, was securest option. &lt;.&lt;  So after that happened, i just gave up on bitcoin.
I know they have some legal action against them now, but i know people who had far more BTC in Mt Gox then me. So i doubt any legal actions that re going on right now, would include me? ... Also, does anyone know anything about this?
