What does your version of the future look like that financial advice is no longer needed?
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:23:57
Wow.  You're not going to be okay with just being poor for the rest of your life god forbid that were to happen.  You said before you're going to take profits at some point (15k) but you're back to all or nothing.

I haven't been asked directly from a client what my opinion is, but when I am, I will share the same thoughts that I have in my original post.  And if they want to buy, I will walk them through the best practices to minimize transaction costs and to secure their Bitcoin safely.  But it will be my fiduciary duty to not allow them to invest more than they can afford to lose.

That is pretty vague.  Will investing and lending exist in your better future?  I don't care what the medium of exchange is, capitalism will continue to exist.

Do you have an automated process to trim your neckbeard as well?  If not you should look into it.  It would give you a few extra minutes in the day for the porn thing.
What did the funds do?  What did you do?
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:15:32
Yes for a quite a few reasons.  
1.  In managing client portfolios, i do not invest in individual securities.  I use mutual funds, hedge funds, and some ETFs to build broadly diversified portfolios.  The fund managers are deciding on the individual securities to buy in their respective spaces.  There are a very few venture capital funds investing in Bitcoin but no mutual funds or ETFs yet.  The hedge funds that we work with and that I talk to are not interested at this point.  
2.  Custody.  We do not custody assets.  We use a 3rd party that specializes in it.  The direct ownership is one of the most appealing aspects of Bitcoin in my opinion, but its a problem in my industry.  For serious money to come into Bitcoin or other crypto currencies, this is the biggest road block.  But people are working every day to figure out a solution to that problem.  And when they do, that will lead to capital flows in the many billions into the new asset class.  And that is my thesis for personally investing now.  While I don't think it will replace all money in the world and all of that stuff.  I do believe it will remain as an investable asset class that will be common place in some form in investment portfolios.

No, you have that backwards.  5% of my money as Bitcoin is pure speculation with a price based on emotion rather than fundamental factors.  
But as I said in another response, if a client asked me my opinion, I would share it.  Our clients are wealthy families who tend to be in the distribution phase of the game (i.e. older) with more conservative risk profiles based on their timelines.   Or, they're institutions such as charitable or professional organizations that also are drawing funds annually for their operations.  It would be massively inappropriate to include an asset that swings in price +/- 20% in a week no matter what the potential is.  But for someone like me who is relatively young and has a long investment timeline, I'm willing to take the gamble fully accepting the fact that this investment can go to zero.  And don't full yourself that you are an investor or trader and smarter than everyone else.  When you fool yourself into believing that, that is when you're in real trouble.  Go back and read about the dot-com boom and bust and listen to what people were saying then.

A 10% annual return doubles your money every 7 years.  And going back to 1929, The S&amp;P has declined in value by roughly 50% or more four times.  That is the Great Depression (1929-1932) with an 86% decline, 1973-1974 a 48% decline, the dot-com bubble bursting from 2000-2002 a 49% decline, and the Financial Crisis from 2007-2009 with a 56% decline.  And despite all of that, if you were invested in the S&amp;P since 1929, you would have earned an annualized rate of 9.5%.  That means if you invested $100 in 1929, you would now have $352,590.  Patience is the key and not buying something that is hot and not panicking when something is getting crushed.

That is exactly what you are doing - betting.  You're betting almost your entire net worth and putting some completely arbitrary price on when you'll be willing to sell some to diversify.  Why $15k?  What if it gets to $14.5k and bounces around for a year and never actually touches $15?  are you going to hang tough?  And what if you get wiped out?  The paid of losing hurts way worse then the pleasure from the same amount of gain.  
Just takes some profits.  You're a millionaire.  You've already won the lottery on a bet.  I'm not telling you to sell everything, just start taking some profits and invest in other things.

So you've had this username for 2 days and your two burning issues are Bitcoin making the economy obsolete and your porn feed not working correctly.  Makes perfect sense.

Yes and that is a good question to ask someone who you are going to trust with managing you money.  My group manages our company's 401(k) so our employees are invested in these funds as well.  And we expect the fund managers to have a significant percentage of their net worth invested in their funds.  So client's money, my money, our 100 employees, and the fund managers' money all invested together in a common interest.  If that's not for you and you want to DIY it on the internet, that's great.

You definitely didn't work in the investment business.  If you did, it was in IT or something resetting passwords.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:52:18
Take some profits and diversify.

I see you deleted your question about your porn feed.  Hope you got that figured out.  It'll be a lonely night without it.

I don't think you should sell to buy fiat.  I think you should sell and invest your money in other things.  If you think they entire world is going to melt down and the current version on the economy is going to completely evaporate, then at least buy some actual physical gold, or bullets, or whatever else may have value in that post apocalyptic scenario.

So you're picturing a scenario that the entire global financial system and the entire global economy will look like Zimbabwe?

No.  I work for an independent firm that has no products ourselves.  Clients pay us directly rather then us earning a commission from selling the company's products.  Our only interest is to choose what we truly believe are the best investments.

Are you saying inflation adjusted?  Sure, then a $1,400 initial investment would have grown to $352,590.  Still sounds like worthwhile investment to me.

I would love to know what your profession is.  You worked at a hedge fund right?  What kind and doing what.  
And who gets their porn delivered to them via an automatic feed?  Are you too lazy to search for it?  Or do you consume so much that you had to figure out a more efficient way to get it?  Or maybe both?

If I were you, I wouldn't wait until any particular price to take out a big chunk like that.  I would sell x amount of Bitcoin every month over the next six months.  That way, you get a smoother average price rather then catching a bad price.  If you sold a bunch now and the price shot up over the next six months, you'd be pissed and regret selling.  On the flip side, if you sell today and the price went to shit, you'd be thrilled.  By systematically selling over six months you take the emotion out of it and keep it objective.
And what you should diversify into depends on what you're planning on using this money for?  Do you expect to use some in the next 1-5 years?  If so you're going to want to keep a portion in a safer investments like bonds that won't have the same volatility as stocks.  If you don't plan on touching this money for a really long time, then you can be more aggressive and own mostly equities.  Are you planning on taking an income to supplement your current lifestyle but want to make the money last for the rest of your life?  Then I would need to know a lot more about your situation to determine the right allocation.  
And I don't advocate trying to figure out which individual companies, or even sectors, will perform the best.  It's really hard to do that even for mutual fund portfolio managers.  It's best to either leave it to them or buy ETFs that represent broad indexes for equity exposure.  Hope this helps!

We lost more clients in 1999 then any other single year in our 40 year history.  Clients, word for word said exactly what you just did.  Why do I need to pay for advice when I can just buy a bunch of tech stocks and the value goes up hundreds of percent.  Why do I need to own anything else?  
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:56:25
You are the person that regulators are trying to protect from hurting themselves.
Like with any great disruptor, many people will get rich.  Many already have at least on paper (or on a screen maybe) with Bitcoin.  But countless others will make dumb investments like buying it and hoping it goes up 5% in a few days so they can pay their bills.  And more people will just mess up on the tech part of it and lose their Bitcoin somehow.  And many more people still will get outright ripped off.
And how do we know Bitcoin specifically will be the technology that wins out.  People love the Amazon comparison, but how do we know Bitcoin isn't one of the other 1000's of tech companies in the 90's that had a great idea but couldn't make the business side work.  What if it's ETH or some other cryptocurrency?  Or what if its still USD but instead of paper bills and checking accounts, its blockstream.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:29:46
Even if Bitcoin becomes the dominant global currency, don't you think companies, or individuals at least, will continue participating in the global economy and demand Bitcoin rather than whatever currency they are taking now?  Commerce will continue.  And whether we're dealing in USD, JPY, Bitcoin, or Wampum, investing and lending will still be a part life.
