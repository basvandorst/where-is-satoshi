Everyone else is asking, "Who is Shooter Jennings?"
Well I'm here to ask, what game?

If I already had a portfolio I wouldn't need to invest in bitcoin either.
But I caught the ass end of of the social stratum, and I'm happy to just hodl for now. 
But thanks.

Check out BitShares and DPOS.

bitcoin is native to the whole world.

That's a valid point. I'll add to it and address the use of other clients. What are you finding confusing about it?

I just looked at the ad again and see the dollar sign now. I'm going to concede this one, it's a poorly thought out parody.

Hah. I feel like I had a hand in explaining this to lots of people here

Bitcoin is more centralized than bitShares because the mining pool operators have the same power as bitshares delegates. the difference is we vote on delegates, we have more delegates than bitcoin has mining pools, and the number of delegates will go up as the network grows, not down because of some computer power arms race.

I'm having the same issue. I'm using a prepaid paycard to buy off circle. I've done 5 transactions since being invited to the beta test, but this last one (also placed friday) was pending all weekend. Today it was cancelled. I went to place another order and it said to contact support (which I had already done, and been given the same form letter as you about fraud prevention).
It would be a shame to have to go back to mailing money orders to coinmkt :(

No need to drag coinbase into it. just add "worth of value," after the dollar references. It's not mandatory to trade the BTC back into fiat after it arrives at its destination.

I'm in your position exactly! Noob inspired by cryptocurrency to learn code.
After putting alot of thought into it and reading a bunch of different arguments from people, I was stuck deciding between c and python.
I suspect Python would teach you what you need to know, and it would be better for a complete beginner.
But I noticed in your comments it said you have a little bit of experience (same as me), and to contribute to cryptocurrency you'll need c anyway. So I chose c for myself.
I went with learn c the hard way by zed Shaw. It's available free online, and it's written in a way that doesn't put me to sleep. I'm enjoying it so far.

There is no currency exchange going on in the Bitcoin transaction. Both parties use Bitcoin.

I love this because they would view it as stealing...
Stealing THEIR profit from inflation.

there were bbs systems before compuserve.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:42:21
Thanks for the clarification. People often use c and c++ seemingly interchangeably so I was thinking maybe the syntax is the same with some differences being something else.
So basically, python or c, it really doesn't matter?

by using collateralized shorts that can get margin called to back the bitUSD.
it's a brilliant little system. I'd explain more but I probably don't understand it as well as some people. learn more at wiki.bitshares.org and bitsharestalk.org

When there's more infrastructure companies will make it easier for Joe blow to secure his money in a way that just works.
The fact that we aren't too that point yet means you're still in early enough to make money off this.
Unfortunately that means taking a little extra time to learn to secure your money.

i honestly forgot how the thread evolved into the conversation we were having. but I admit that it's a fraudulent advertisement. think I may have just jumped in for sake of debate.

I'm curious because I was evangelizing to somebody, who mentioned it to her accounting professor, and I guess the accounting professor became interested and starting asking her a bunch of questions that she was unqualified to answer.
Are you in Ohio by any chance?

It says send satoshis anywhere for only one of your American issued pennies.
The part about the pennies is misleading, I'll grant that.

I have half a bitcoin and I spend an inordinate amount of my day thinking about that, lol
