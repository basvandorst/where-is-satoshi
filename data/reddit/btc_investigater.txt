Unfortunately for a lot of you hashtalk people, coinbase transactions and balances (not ZenCloud) are now lost. The deposits that have been sent to Coinbase have been received and some have been staked or transferred and the rest will follow. You will not see these funds in your account again and neither will you be able to withdraw or transfer any balances.
We have been following and investigating this saga for one of our investor clients since Monday 16th and have so far not received ANY response from Coinbase / GAWCEO / MrCEO / Josh / John / Mark or any other aliases. Our emails now get bounced as non deliverable, we have been blocked on twitter and the landline telephone for Coinbase has now been disconnected. Our forensic techs have spent 60+ hours examining blockchains and transactions and while deposits certainly ARE reaching coinbase, they are not and will not reach the customer accounts. We are also aware of 2 other specialist forensics companies performing similar investigations into coinbase and while I cant give information on their behalf, I can say that there will be at least 2 reports released over the coming week into what us and they have found. None of it is positive for investors and traders.
At this point, it would be very very risky to transfer / deposit funds of any type to coinbase, the chances of you seeing such funds again are negligible. Clearly hashtalk has many avid and passionate advocates for coinbase who delusional refuse to recognise the detrimental signals over the last few weeks and / or are yet more aliases or MrCEO. To these people (where they are real), I'm sorry for your loss of funds but hopefully you invest smarter in the future. The next few weeks will be entertaining for those of you who saw this coming. I will post back when our report (or any of the 2 others we are aware of) is released.
