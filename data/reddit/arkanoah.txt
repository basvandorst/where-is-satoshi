thats nice :)) can you send me 1 please? :))) 0 left :)
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:27:23
all those "keep btc with us" still gets ripped of time to time.
keeping it on ordinary PC on windows without bulletproof security is nearly the same risk. :(
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:21:18
Still not any virus was found or vulnerability.
