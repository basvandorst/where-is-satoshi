My only other conclusion is that they're in over their heads and are trying to make good on claims against them. In my dealings with them, they always struck me as being on the up and up.

Bitcoin's bubble stage was the summer of 2011. This is actual growth based on usage and adoption. Bitcoin will, of course, go through ups and downs like any stock, ETF, mutual fund, etc. 
A million dollar sell is now just 0.25% of Bitcoin's market cap. It take a lot more to move Bitcoin than it used to.
I'm not ignoring you. I just disagree. : )
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:20:47
I use it and hold it. When I get new bitcoins, I spend 5-10% back and hold the rest.
Bitcoin is more than just a currency. For example, it's also a [cryptosigning and verification device]( 
Bitcoin has many uses besides just a currency. That's what gives it value, not hype.

JP Morgan appears to be Buffett's replacement in the manipulation of the silver market. Silver is an excellent bet at the moment because larger interests want a low paper price so they can snag up the physical product now. When there's no more juice left in the paper, the majority of physical will be in the hands of JPM and their betters. This will result in a spike in gold and silver  about the time the Fed runs out of QE voodoo.
Bitcoin is the equalizer for the rest of us in this impending mess.

What's fascinating about Bitcoin at this stage is that human greed is part of its mechanism, as with any currency. People are buying because Bitcoin is rising. Those that sell to make a profit are selling to those that want to buy in. As it now takes more sells to trigger a massive drop, that will ensure that more bargain hunters will snap up what they see as cheap coins when the drops do occur.
Also, of the people that buy Bitcoin, very few cash out completely when they do cash out. As more people are holding more coins, it will decrease supply and support price levels.
Bitcoin: finally, a constructive use for human greed.

I'm not that smart but even I saw the potential for Bitcoin two years ago. I'm baffled about people much smarter than I am still missing out on where it's going.

People are spending. I'm a Bitcoin scrooge and I paid for my VPN today and bought a domain name the other day, both with xbt. If scrooges like me are spending, even a little bit, that means the less stingy are probably spending also.
Bitcoin already has proven transaction value. This is the test to see if it also has worth as a store of value.

Paper Wallet:
1.) Create a new bitcoin address via  (do this offline)
2.) Copy and print out your public and private key from this new address. &lt; - IMPORTANT!
3.) Send your coins to this address. 
4.) Put the printed copy somewhere safe. Print out a couple/few copies to be even safer.
5.) Don't think about your bitcoins again until they hit $100.

The IRS has no jurisdiction over Bitcoin. Just convert some coins into dollars and send an anonymous postal money order to the IRS or the US Treasury. 
Citizens are the government and not the IRS, so speaking as an American citizen, you owe me nothing. I'd suggest not sending those people in DC a dime until they can get their shit together and learn how to manage money correctly.
