We don't know what the population will be in 2140 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:58:37
I would think it's just hydro.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:38:24
And there are many more that wish we had more money to put in. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:20:27
I'm sure there are some, but it's not hard to find a good one. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:50:13
Is there a link to the wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:17:25
What time does it get good?
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:05:17
No more than 10 months.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:59:28
That should have been standard practice for the last few years. Friends don't let friends get goxed, goxblocked.

Person of interest is turning out to be one of the best tv shows ever. I am amazed at where it is going. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:29:16
I would say that because of his location, basically next to a hydro dam, he is 100% hydro. That is why his cost is so low.

And when corrupt Chinese officials read this, they will start to make it come true. 
I am wondering what techniques could be used to try and trap corrupt officials by the central government?
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:38:52
And next year?
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:58:26
He is laughing. And it's also using FUD to try and scare anyone that is curious away from believing that Bitcoin has a future. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:39:38
On sale!
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:51:13
Assume that its $500 - $1000
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:02:45
It's not hard to get permission from a reporter to record the interview. He is usually letting you know they is recording it as well.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:56:42
Since when is buying Bitcoin at $650 insider trading? Please.
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:04:07
That's what I thought. Then my BTC can buy more :)
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:38:14
Hold fast!
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:11:06
I can't imagine living in NYC. I am sorry. Where I live you have 10 different CU that are all awesome and will let you deposit and withdraw from each other.

Keep Calm, and Buy Bitcoin

mBTC = millibitcoin = 1 thousandth of a bitcoin = 0.001BTC
uBTC = microbitcoin = 1 millionth of a bitcoin = 0.000001BTC

Post the link when you can. iOS options are scarce. 
Any chance for a dogecoin web wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:56:21
But he is a just man.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:45:47
It's a smart move to buy at $800, $700, $600, $500, $400 and $300
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:47:29
A more recent book of his, Reamde  is also great. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:36:51
I got some at 800, 550, and 700. Holding through 2017

Dave Ramsey calls that the Stupid Tax, the price we pay for a mistake. And if you learn from that mistake, we can make it back and much more. 
You have the right attitude friend. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:28:27
I really want to get these but I am going to wait for BTC to hit $1200 so I can buy it at half price. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 08:48:06
Hipster on a street corner, boiling water on a propane stove, hand grinding coffee and doing single cup pourover coffee.... For Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:22:49
I've been thinking about ways dogecoin can gain traction among students. There is a need for wallets on iOS. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:36:40
I think it feels like the tide going way out right before the tsunami hits. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:42:05
That will be quite a few solar panels. Would love to see the finished project. Have you done the calculations of how many solar panels you would need? My understanding is that you need an RV hookup to power at a reasonable rate. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:24:22
Came here to say this. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:37:25
I sure wish I had read that 9 months ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:03:14
Yes but how does it work? I'm still confused.
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:49:11
I listened to it. Kind of disappointed but he was being very realistic. I'm a true believer in the potential of Bitcoin. Time will tell. The market will decide. I'd much rather bet for Bitcoin. Where our world is headed, Bitcoin could make the landing much softer.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:30:17
I think this is a big reason why Apple is not allowing any Bitcoin apps. They are not sure that the iPhone security could take being attacked by the bad guys. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:21:30
Last week I realized that a teenager could mow lawns for cash, buy Bitcoin. Hold it, skip college and keep saving as much as possible and retire at 22.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:36:11
True, but it could be stolen if not also guarded with intellect. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:07:54
Buy high and buy low is also a good strategy.
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:09:57
Or $15, or $20 or if you are a Winlkevosse it's going to be $932
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:31:30
Moonshine would be a great application. In fact, if you were to combine with an automatic still it could make, test for purity, and dispense.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:41:39
This all sounds interesting. I look forward to following the developments of the Forest. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:46:06
At least Angelo is taking BTC on Latest in Paleo on the 5by5. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:07:32
Roll two dice every time and use that number. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:47:20
When the time comes he could easily fund ideas of others with a simple giving them what they need to complete a project. No need for it to tax deductable. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:08:30
In 18 years he can afford a trust with it.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:40:13
On coinbase you can sell 50 BTC a day. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:07:00
We are doing this for our kids too but they are too young to understand it and we are forcing them to go long. Tiny amounts (0.02) each, as a hedge against not having any. Merry Christmas, hope Santa sends Bitcoin to the moon for ya in the next 5 years. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:12:10
Jason, check out  
I'm really excited about what you guys are doing. I'd love to chat about permaculture with you anytime.

I think a town like that needs Lemonade Stand Day, where all the kids set up lemonades stands all over the city.
