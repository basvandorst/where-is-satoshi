Bitcoin can not go dead with the rising machine 
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:09:22
Crazy 
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:04:42
Does it charge in cash or token, or both?
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:15:30
Yea, the model definition makes me confused 
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:13:43
If no reward for miners, why do they secure the network? I don’t think bitcoin will be same value in an insecure network
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:30:05
Also want to know that, how do they deal with the fee and tax
@_date: 2019-01-25 03:57:05

Want to know more about the details in Chicago, how hard, which part?
From I have been know that also not easy for crypto capitals in other cities in US.
@_date: 2019-01-08 04:32:29
Well, it was weak at the beginning 
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:59:31
“Sell bitcoin “ sounds really like buying gold, lol
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:43:51
yes, there is always a fee there, but the differences are less and less mining reward, which means less incentive for miners. So the next step may turn to a higher transaction fee, may push people to switch to a cheaper transaction platform. I guess.
@_date: 2019-01-06 06:47:50
Do they pay tax? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:35:24
Web3 doesn’t care 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:20:02
Well, I think it’s the basic part

A tool to approach freedom,  but maybe not the way you expect.. difficult to say about how people deal with all the society jobs at the last moment
