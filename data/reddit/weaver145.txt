You mean the calculation?  Total retirement assets USA via google gives estimate of 25 trillion. Take 1 % and compare that to total bitcoin market cap which is # of bitcoin in existence by current avg price across all exchanges.  Then adjust down by removing the genesis block coins since they are not really in “circulation”

For now a self directed account can hold GBTC as a fund that holds bitcoin but there is a hefty premium.  
I think fund managers especially hedge funds will look to have some exposure to goose returns.

Seems to me that Kleiman was potentially the person who initially held the original private key associated with Satoshi.  He had the background in computer forensics and probably orchestrated the anonymity aspect of the Satoshi persona.  I think it was a collaboration of both but with Kleiman putting in the long hours behind the PC.  Now that he is dead, the Wright character feels he is entitled to his share of the credit.   Satoshi is not Wright or Kleiman.  But he is both.

MK is not a Moron.  He is a brilliant crook.

This Satoshi has shown to have but a small fraction of the command of the English language that the real Satoshi displayed. There is no way that they are one and the same.  The journalist should have compared the two very consistently disparate writing styles and concluded that this Satoshi could not have authored the bitcoin white paper or the over 500 postings that have been generated over the years by the real Satoshi.

Is it possible MTGox has been ordered by some agency to block withdrawals of accounts suspected of having been funded through Suspect transactions?  Even in the last week there are numerous reports of nearly instantaneous bitcoin withdrawals happening  of random amounts.  Their lack of transparency while their business essentially crumbles sure would be explained if they were carrying out some govt imposed screening of accounts prior to allowing the exit of funds.

Have you tried to get xif data info from the image file?  It could give you GPS coordinates but also identify the device used and then you may be able to cross reference that with other pictures posted online that could help Dox the individual responsible for this crime.

Yes I have.  But their argument can be overcome eventually.  They say the complexity is not something the average joe can get their head around easily. I have to agree  I say what is needed is a layer of abstraction.  Wallets that don't display long alphanumeric strings and instead use user labels.  Also not displaying btc balances but instead in the local currency.  The bitcoin concept is only of interest to geeks.  Everyone else is just interested in an instant payment system that doesn't result in a new random value of their buying power every day.  Bitcoin is a few years away from achieving mass acceptance - if ever.

Now that we know Mk is a serial crook,   there is no need to debate whether any new development may somehow benefit anyone but him.

A little more detail is provided here.     If the facts are as presented then one could argue that charges were justified.  Kind of ruins it for those who are trying to make an honest buck while helping people get bitcoin.  According to recent FinCen guidance buying and selling bitcoin for ones's own investment did not constitute being an MSB.  That was a huge step in the right direction. But now this puts everything in flux.  The public is being taught that bitcoin is only attractive to criminals.  It's been a tough year thus far for bitcoin believers

I can understand TX-Mal causing the loss of some coins.  Anything dealing with technical incompetence I might also be inclined to look past.  What I can't ever forgive, however, is this idea that he can somehow mislead the community into thinking that soon it might be business as normal again and then this document surfaces out of nowhere suggesting the vast majority of ALL coins are actually not in their chilly wallets.  
The conduct of this individual in the wake of posssible/likely massive wealth destruction or fraud is beyond pale.
Is he alone?  He really needs competent support to 1) secure his safety 2) investigate the loss and 3) communicate directly with customers as to what exactly is transpiring. I posit that  For every ten or so speculative accounts in mtgox there was at least 1 that belonged to a humble bitcoin believer whose loss of funds will have a significantly negative effect on their lifestyle or mental health or both.  Every minute that passes without that direct honest communication from Mark causes me to have even less sympathy for him. Soon enough I will be fresh out of f to give regarding what happens to him next.

This Nakamoto likely has heard of bitcoin, may own or has owned some bitcoin and even got involved with mining bitcoin.  But he IS most certainly NOT the same Nakamoto that wrote the white paper nor the numerous posts over several years about the crypto currency.   In my opinion he is not understanding why he is being questioned and has not fully analyzed the repercussions of being identified as an underground multi-millionaire while the rest of his family seems strapped for cash.  Someone at Newsweek needs to be held accountable for what is most certainly an Epic Fail!

Sounds like a reasonably clever scam.  Except why would someone make a cash deposit to an account without getting actual goods.  Perhaps scammer and victim are one and the same or related in some way.

Interesting.  The IRS has determined that bitcoin is property and not currency.  Therefore the mt gox balance on any given day had to be over $10,000.00 in usd regardless of the bitcoin amount held simultaneously to trigger an FBAR disclosure.

I may be in the minority but I feel the bf has done a pretty reasonable, I dare say even splendid job of initially defending themselves and establishing dialog that aims to keep the US regulations at bay.  They more than anyone see the dangers of treating bitcoin like any other currency. Once a single nation adapts bitcoin as its official currency (and that day is perhaps closer each day) then State rules about foreign currency will kick in.  Anyone who thinks a 1 billion and growing market should resist all regulation is probably spending too much time on SR.

If each share represents 0.2 bitcoin that is a fifth and I am using $100 a btc to make the math easy.  That's $20 worth of btc per share x 1million shares is $20 million.

There is a delay, but there is also a delay currently with international wire transfers.  Sometimes days!  Not implying colonists would mine the chain. Just transact using it.  A local "MarsCoin" could also be employed if more real time confirmations became needed at the local level.  The fear however that a local colonist would double spend coins by taking advantage  of the time lag somehow would seem quite remote and perhaps only a problem many many generations hence.

Well crafted.  The additional coverage for the general case could be really helpful as other States employ similar language in their statutes.  It would be helpful if the foundation were to craft a similarly worded document that would cover the sale of bitcoins throughout the US and make the case as to why such sellers would not be required to register as money transmitters.

At a million shares, the fund controls $20 million dollars worth of bitcoin which is 2x roughly the amount of bitcoins the Wincklevii are said to own presently (11million). Remains to be seen if the fund has already amassed the requisite inventory. Should put a floor under the bitcoin price.  I think folks initially thought the twins were selling off their btc stake hence the drop in btc price today.
