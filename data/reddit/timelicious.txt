With the 10$ i mean a bitcoin crash.
Would u buy bitcoin at 10.000$ if you know it’s crashing to 10$ a year from now.
Now would u buy bitcoin at 10.000$ if it’s going to go up till like 100.000-400.000$
Now are u speculative? 
I get what u mean by gathering more fiat, but atm fiat currency is what we buy groceries for in this world and thats why it will be dominant for now.
I don’t think bitcoin will ever take that spot but I do think bitcoin is the new gold, a new store of value.
I like to think that governments will create their own crypto backed fiat currency, and they will do it the right way because if they don’t the power of bitcoin will threaten them. Bitcoin is forcing the governments and banks to make this world more fair on it’s financial part.

This could maybe work through some use of blockchain technology.

Might be a fee?

Would u stay in bitcoins if you knew it is going to be worth 10$ each? I think we’re all speculating on bitcoin, but that comes with the fact that we also think it’s a great technology that is taking over the world. Buying bitcoin back after you just paid with it will only make it more valuable in the long run. And is a thing i regret i didnt do after paying my ledger nano s when bitcoin price was around 7k.

I don’t think they can practically ban the use of bitcoin.
And by the way what is more, $1000 or $1000 USD?
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:05:56
I meant your combined use of $ and USD haha
$ is enough as it means USD ...

I think BitMex is what you’re looking for. I’ve never used it but it looks like something i’d use if i were you ��

That $8k worth of stock a day is probably the amount of bolivars in stocks in usd value.. I understood that everyone in venezuela either holds bitcoin or usd, not bolivars...

Or bitonic.nl - i’d recommend it for bitcoin as the fee is a little less.

I’d advise u to watch this video by Ray Dalio explaining economy, its debt cycles and why the system ‘works’. [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio (31:00)](

Lol, he wants to compete with BitMEX with silly usdt future contracts?!
BitMEX has a great product and i don’t think anyone really wants to use this shit instead of BitMEX.

Could do that, good one, but i am not.. not yet haha!

This might already be the devaluation of the dollar.

Submitted! 
One thing i would like to add is, in the section where i get questions like; 'Would you buy this or that with Bitcoin'.
Right now i certainly would not purchase things like groceries, just because it's unnecessary. If the Bitcoin price would ever become stable, then i would start using it for groceries and other stuff. Right now it 's just too big of a gamble imho. These groceries you would've bought could become very expensive over time!
Buying a car with Bitcoin would be less of a problem for me just because of the intrinsic value it might hold.

How the fuck did my comment change to 1.000 from 60.000?

60.000? ��

Wish I wouldn’t check the price for a few days.
I think i’ve been checking the price and this subreddit at least every 2 hours last month.

Gdax is a exchange, just like bittrex, kraken etc.
Gdax is from the same company as Coinbase, you can only exchange pairs of FIAT currency, BTC, ETH and Litecoin as far as i know. ;) 
People use GDAX to buy BTC for their money cause u pay less fees than on Coinbase.

Hi guys, just wanted to make a graph of the amount of nodes in use compared to the price of a bitcoin in dollars.
The reason i squared the amount of nodes is because of [this]( post.
*Source of the data used in the graph:*
[Coin Dance; Bitcoin Nodes Summary](
What's interesting to me is the sudden rise of 'nodes in use' around february this year, the bitcoin price seems to really correlate with it over a few months of delay.
Now the question is; will the very recent spike in node use u can see on the graph affect the bitcoin price again, at a later stage?
If u have any ideas for a graph that you'd like to see, let me know!
*(BTW: Google sheets is horrible pls bear with me!)*
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:09:16
aaaaaah where is the x-axis on your graph!
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:45:47
Yep, should be cheaper. Never done it myself, but that's what i've read a lot.

What the fuck did i just watch.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:12:17
I tried it, and what it does is.. it makes the graph look flatter.
The bitcoin price graph is already exponential itself, so showing that on a logarithmic scale will only make it look flatter.
Cause i took the square of amount of nodes, that graph looks exponential aswell, so it makes it only look less clear.
[U can fool around with the graph urself here!](

ah i get it so 1 satoshi is 0,00000001 BTC or 0,01μBTC !
I did not know the definition of the term yet, thankyou!
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:06:41
Haven’t tried yet, but will try when i get back to a computer. 
I dont think it will show any interesting difference tho.

Ok so.. this is gonna be a noob question probably but it´s the only (probably not the only) thing i really don´t know yet. 
Where the fuck do i find my private key? Is it even there? Do i need to know what my private key is? It's not the code I encrypted my wallet with right? Where do i find it? How to protect it? 
I'm using a Bitcoin Core wallet.

So? Read his comment again.. ��
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:55:10
I think there's just a lot of indecision going on. It would be really natural for the trend to have it go down a bit and let it hit a higher bottom in the uptrend. This will in the long run only have a positive effect.
Just like a person walks up a staircase, u have to go step by step...  the price goes up in highs and lows, it has to gain momentum/more buyers and it does that by being on a lower price.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:51:19
Looks like the recent one is more substantiated though.
