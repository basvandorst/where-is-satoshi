A similar idea is presented in this video in regards to energy distribution in the future:

It's not that bad business. Complying with these rules is less than trivial and makes it harder for smaller businesses to compete with bigger ones. I assume you're not a developer, but people who have actual businesses have been discussing this at length and their opinions are very divided, examples:    
I think you guys in the EU are too complacent with how your lawmakers are doing things. It's very unfair to punish companies globally with insane penalties (4% of global revenue or 20 million euros) to get them to adopt your particular views of how data should be handled. This is similar to what Trump is doing with tariffs, and if you don't agree with that then agreeing with this is inconsistent.
On top of that, they're not really stopping just at the GDPR either:  I don't think you guys have a functioning democratic system and these laws are a result of that

I just hope you understand that the next time you complain about monopolies, regulations like this one actively help incumbents and prevent smaller businesses from competing with them. I really do hope you understand that this is one of the prices you have to pay for agreeing with a regulation like GDPR.
