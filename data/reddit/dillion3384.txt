I agree, but I think they'll start by harassing merchants that accept it.

I think you're probably right. I was thinking they might have tried to short sell after the price jumped and they're waiting for the price to fall before replacing our coins. But your assessment seems more likely.

Coinbase is your best bet to get started. Or find someone local. You can Google "buy local bitcoins" but coinbase is the easiest.

Tried to send some coins to mtgox 50+ hours ago, still pending.

Well I agree that  governments will not give up control of currencies without a fight, but I don't think they will attack bitcoin directly. For example I don't think they would attack bitcoin by trying to manipulate its price--doing something like buying a million btc, drive up the price, then sell a bunch driving down the price, making the currency more volatile. So, I agree with part of what you say so I used the word but. But, I guess you'd consider an attack on merchants an attack on btc. I just took a more literal interpretation of your post, my bad.

I'd sell you some but all of mine are frozen with coinbase. I think they sold all our coins,lol. What do you mean mtgox isn't trading? If I ever get my btc from coinbase that's were im likely going

So the US government says bitcoin is legal money, pretty cool.
