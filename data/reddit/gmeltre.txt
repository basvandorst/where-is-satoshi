all bitcoin transactions, including ones sending coins to a cold storage address, are publicly viewable on the blockchain. but the private key to the cold storage address is kept in a server that has never been and never will be online.  that's cold storage

I am also close to the company - what they have in insurance reserves is much larger than 15 mm - much.
In addition, insurance companies use actuarial analysis to determine the likelihood of loss then determine the reserves they need to meet the lijelt losses. So don't issue a "PSA" that is 1) factually incorrect and 2) ignorant of basic insurance practices.

exactly -- you can increase the security on the Wallet if you want.  BUT i think the concept here is to keep the Wallet very accessible -- if you want foolproof security, send your coins to cold storage (the Vault)

Um no.  Captive insurance companies are used by most of the companies you interact with day to day (eg, ever read the NY Times? They have one.)
don't regurgitate FUD until you've done some basic research on your own.

"only 27 million"?  wow, what a disappointment.  that is more than double the current number of bitcoin users.  Xapo is spending their VC money seeding a deal that can actually stoke the fire of bitcoin usage with a compelling use case -- and you are effing complaining.
Yes - get a damn life.

Xapo was up front: 
It's called a captive insurance company -- 90% of the fortune 1000 have them.
