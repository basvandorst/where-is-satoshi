You don't get it, do you? Most of the people aren't digital natives, that has nothing to do with intelligence. And even for digital natives like us its far more complicated than to open a bank account, where you just have to go to the bank and they do everything for you.

I never doubted that, I know a lot myself, BUT its not the majority. And for the non technology affine people, there's just no reason why they should get Bitcoin by now, except risky speculation

No its not. I cant imagine my grandma, or even my mother to register on an exchange, verify yourself (takes more like days/weeks than 5 minutes), set up a wallet and transfer your Bitcoins to it.

I dont really understand what the problem with tether is. I mean every crypto currency is backed by nothing and is created out of nowhere. Can someone explain that please?

I'm not into that case, just wondering why anybody would refuse so much cash, if he could have it legaly?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:48:49
Let me explain further:
1: What I wanted to say is people who use Bitcoin to really pay things is a small minority of total transactions. I dont have absolute numbers on that I admit, but considering Steam/Microsoft stopping BTC payments there arent really so many places where you actually could buy things with Bitcoin.
2: You are totally right on that. LN will make micropayments convenient where they arent today. I meant the transactions for opening and closing a channel, which have to be on-chain.
3: Thats right too, but what effect has a doubling in transaction capacity if Bitcoin wants to be globally adopted with a multiple of current users and even more transactions.
This shouldnt be FUD, I just wanted to point out, that LN and Segwit alone wont be nearly enough to solve the scalability problem.

Well I had almost 9k cushion and then it tanked and tanked. Hope this doesnt happen again so soon though.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:42:59
Well correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I see it:
Nobody uses Bitcoin today for paying everyday things. So basically all transactions are deposits from or to exchanges or larger sums from one wallet to another. These wont get replaced by LN, that's not what it's for.  So LN will even create more on-chain transactions. Segwit improves the scalability, but only so little it doesn't matter on the large scale.

Scaling is as important as it was before. If adoption increases the same problems will of course start again. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:55:57
You really think someone outside of crypto would care about the market cap?
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:36:29
Let me get this straight, LN is an important step, but even with LN there will always be on-chain transactions which will reach a limit in phases of heavier use, as we all have seen.
And I never said scaling cant be done otherwise, I just said that LN might not be the one and only ultimate solution.

Why is almost every altcoin tanking? Normally they are more or less correlated with BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:13:45
Well you could easily add the prediction that bitcoin will reach 1 Million, just saying

Problem is, the more privacy a (digital) currency offers, the harder will governments fight it.

Way to expensive. If you arent a total noob, check out electrum.
