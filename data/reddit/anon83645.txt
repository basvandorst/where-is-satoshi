This is a key point in my mind, humans generally are lazy, not proactive, and wait until the last possible moment to change their behaviour, often in panic mode.

The main benefit of a credit card though is an unsecured high interest loan! That can't be made obsolete by technology, someone has to take the risk of default and reward of high interest.

I get your point, but to add some realism, modern humans have only been around for 200k years. So in half that time, we're probably talking about tribes and such. Native Americans have been said to not have the notion of possession. They felt they belonged to the earth but the earth did not belong to them. So while bartering with items may have existed then, let's not forget the whole concept is relatively new, along with ourselves.  😉

But that's his point. He thinks it's helpful to be able to control the money supply in times of financial hardship. And it surely *might* be problematic to have it set to bitcoins formula. 
Look at how the inflexibility of the euro destroyed the economies of Greece, Portugal, etc. Different situation but similar premise, rigidity can be problematic.

They pay Gavin a salary. That alone is enough reason to let them be until bitcoin is a bit more stable.

anecdotal story - i was talking to an Argentinian recently about their history, how inflation destroyed the place. and i mentioned bitcoin, explaining its deflationary properties. it went in this chap's ear and out the other. the penny absolutely did not drop with him. and he is a professional mathematician.
think they have a long way to go.

The man has a family, he needs a steady income. Let's not rock the boat until your proposed alternatives have proven themselves. We need Gavin and others to be thinking about bitcoin, not where their next pay check will come from.

Good post. I would agree entirely but for 1 issue. Bitcoin isn't fast enough to act as a point of sale system for the world. Maybe credit cards can exist like change tip, off chain transaction systems funded by bitcoin.

Great counter example. I should add that there is something missing from your equations, the time holding the proceeds. Money past and future are linked by time in which it could be spent on countless other things. As we know right now, the real value is earned while holding during the tough times. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:12:57

@_date: 2015-01-25 20:07:05
I don't think it was advertised but you used to be able to select the currency, gbp or eur when you deposited funds. Now you cannot change the currency from eur. Problem with depositing gbp now is that it won't match the eur amount you said was incoming, so I guess we just need to bite the bullet and send eur. At least we can still buy bitcoin...

Ethereum isn't even out yet so nobody really knows how to mine it. But it will be out soon and the protocol has been designed with home computer mining in mind. It's bound to be more complex than clicking a button but I'm sure you can figure it out.

Buddhists believe in birth and death, life is eternal. That is not to say you individually are reborn with your past memories, but the collective whole, the one life, suffers no loss. As your body decays other organisms are born and your life energy transfers. Or if you're burnt to minerals, this world too has energy in the form of atomic bonds. All is connected, rearranged but not lost.
