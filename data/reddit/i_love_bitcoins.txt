Crap, everyone knows how I feel about Bitcoin.

Now is later, so thank you!
I'll never complain about free BTC!

Not regretting, just wish I were an earlier invester, and had further funds to invest. 
Quite difficult now that I'm out of a job and freshly out of the military, but I'm very excited to see what little I do have rise like this.
You can tell from the username, I'm quite enamored with the idea of bitcoins.

This is definitely one of the more awesome things I've seen on reddit. It's great to contribute to the community and the is a brilliant idea.

I served in the US Military for 5 years, spending 2.5 of those years in the middle east and have been told that I'm a "Patriot, Veteran, Hero" etc. I respect and admire the passion and commitment to his promises and to the true freedoms of America (and the world as a whole) that Ladar Levison exhibits, and he is more of a hero than I could ever be.

Of course they're nervous, Bitcoins are the future.

I was deployed to Bahrain for 2 years, 5 months and 18 days. I only saw one vendor who knew of Bitcoin while I was there, but it was still interesting to see that all the way around the world, news of this relatively new (couple years ago) crypto-currency was spreading around the world, even to a small middle eastern country in the Persian Gulf.

Not as much as I do!

How do you do that tip thing? I don't have much to hand out yet, but I'd love to be able to.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:37:06
Mine too!

Still continuing to invest. I don't have much money considering I'm no longer in the military and I'm going to school, but I have an odd passion for Bitcoin (if you couldn't tell from the username) and see it as a promising investment long-term.

BitcoinQt is a software wallet installed on your computer so as not to utilize a 3rd party (online wallets for example) to handle your BTC. It's been suggested to protect that wallet carefully. 
Personally, I have it installed on a USB device and password protected.
