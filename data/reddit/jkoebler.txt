I'm not Sarah (I'm a coworker at Motherboard) but I can confirm that she was in our Slack chatroom essentially the entire night uncovering thing after thing after thing. She did a ton of research on this (obviously some of guided by and pointed out by yours!)

I was attempting to reply to both of you. But yeah! Anyways, thanks for reading

Yeah, I can confirm that (I wrote the article / tried it) ... I didn't make any accounts.

I wrote this article, and she mentioned Bitcoin too but I didn't want to just throw everything out there. I don't have the quotes with me at the moment (am on a different computer), but she acknowledged that there are "legitimate  uses" for Bitcoin but that overall it's a pain in the ass for them. She said the FBI and Justice Department "understand" Bitcoin, so it's slightly less of a concern. When I get home, I will post the full quotes.

Here's what she said about Bitcoin:
"i think bitcoin is still viewed by criminals as a way to mask transactions. There's no central place where bitcoin is located, so that helps. It’s perfectly legal and may have a place in commerce as the markets evolve. It can be used to conceal illegal activity and it’s more difficult for us to trace transactions being done in bitcoin. We need to update our anti money laundering laws" to deal with bitcoin-related crime
"we have a lot of people who know a lot about bitcoin - they understand the market, they understand the whole bitcoin and virtual currency space. we may be playing a little bit of catchup, but we’re certainly getting it. Law Enforcement tends to lag a little behind criminals"
"I don’t know that we’re focusing on bitcoin infrastructure [as a place to look for criminal activity]. We're more focused on the criminal activity itself whether they choose to use bitcoin or not"

I don't know that their methodology is sound—they're going with internet savvy people who filled out an online form, so I think maybe it's an overestimate.

Agree, 65% was actually a lower percentage than I expected
