Off-topic, but you should look into  They give you premium access to a bunch of these file hosting services (including uploaded.net) for 7 EUR/mo, plus access to a really decent Usenet server.
I've been using them for about a month now, and have been nothing but pleased.
Don't want for this to sound like an ad, I'm not affiliated with them at all, just wanted to spread the word, as they're not widely known. Oh, and they take Bitcoin too. :)

Yeah, you download off their servers. Not sure about the technical side and how they accomplish it, or if it goes against the services' ToS. All I know is that the UX is dead simple and the speeds are always great. Dealing with each individual service is a nightmare, and paying for premium on all is just not worth it.
And not sure about the traffic. I heard about the site in @_date: 2016-06-04 08:02:52
Is there a way of using TREZOR just as an encryption device? I don't need the Dropbox integration, nor the Chrome extension.
I'm currently in the process of migrating from LastPass / KeePass to [pass]( and don't want to trust a custom 3rd party solution.
If I could use TREZOR for encryption instead of PGP, and somehow make it work with pass, that would be the best of both worlds.
