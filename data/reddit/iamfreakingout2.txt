2. I had only 2 wallets

I am so stupid i didn't make backup for my other bitcoins i only done it when i had 3 BTC. 
All happened so fast ( no one should talk to himself 'i will do it other time' there is no other time, the time is NOW ).
I used other computer and i recovered my 3 BTC.
I scan my other computer there is no .wallet file actually there is nothing here ("AppData\Roaming\MultiBit") i used recovery program in that folder it found  "multibit.wallet" file i got instant happiness, but when i imported in MultiBit there was nothing... 
I guess i lost 40 BTC it's so sad i am so depressed now i don't really know where and what to write, so i am writing here. 
I loved using bitcoins a LOT, now i guess i will never ever use in large sums again. 
I am so stupid person i promised a lot of things to me kids i wanna die now seriously.
If someone thinks that he can recover my btc i want to send my laptop to his address and share all BTC in half. Please anyone?
Thanks for all your reply-s you are very good people.
