Well. Looks like crypto dad jokes are a thing now. I love dad jokes so have an upvote.

This is actually what originally got me into Bitcoin a few years ago. Done with all that now but boy am I regretting spending 2 Bitcoin on a little bit of LSD. Everyone's a genius in hindsight though.

My girlfriend already hates dad jokes and when I talk about Bitcoin. Thank YOU for the ammunition.

If I knew how to gild you I would.

Thank you for giving this guy an explanation. I was curious myself as to why but didn't want to be accused of being a BCH shill. I just wanted information.

Fellow SC resident reporting in. It's a lot more common here than you think. Also since you're a hockey fan GO STINGRAYS!

Up until recently I was in the mindset of how many dollars this is going to make me. But the more into it I got I'd start setting goals for myself to get to. I'm currently at .2 which is my most recent goal. .5 is on the way. It's easy to just gain money from Bitcoin but I'm finding myself more worried about my total Bitcoin than my total money.

At what point Is it really considered as having taken off?

I have a few friends telling me I'm wasting my money and that growth like this isn't sustainable without a massive drop in price. What exactly makes Bitcoin sustainable in spite of the nay sayers? I may check into that book. Appreciate the referall to it.

Bought in at $3000 thinking "well hopefully I don't lose this money"
