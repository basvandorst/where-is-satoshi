It’s a lightning wallet, and not a lot of places currently accept lighting payments, so it’s probably not a replacement for a regular bitcoin wallet. But I don’t really know really know, as I don’t have android. Maybe you can make regular transactions with it as well.
I’d definitely ditch blockchain though.

Also, no segwit support.

I hear ya. Just a light-hearted joke ��‍♂️

Abra is faster for sure though. My last deposit only took about 24 hours.

Finally! One for iOS! Syncing up now :D

You can set custom fees in Edge as well. Just fyi

Definitely Cash App. You can withdraw instantly.

If you mean Bitcoin, and you’re in the US, then yes.

What wallet are you currently using?

Honestly, I kinda wish I had gone with the Trezor, but I really like the small, sleek, unsuspecting form of the Ledger Nano S. It doesn’t look like it holds anything important, and it’s practically unnoticeable in your pocket or around your neck. Being able to input the pin or recovery seed on the device itself was another contributing factor. This issue has been resolved with the Trezor Model T, but it’s more expensive and looks a bit bulkier.

No idea why he commented

Are you the same guy who did blockhash.win?
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:37:57
Good idea. I should do that.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:40:46
Interesting, thanks
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:28:27
Doesn’t look like it. Different logos

This is awesome! I had no idea they enabled receiving. Just won and withdrew 4,000 sats from lightning spin :)

Hey, very nice! Just curious, what software/tools you used to create this?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:54:46
I’ve been using this from time to time. Immediate withdrawal, vs. 10 days on Coinbase, is pretty sweet.

I just downloaded blue wallet a couple days ago after they posted here. Nice UI, lightning enabled (send only), and open source.
It’s kind of new obviously, so maybe doesn’t fit your “trusted” criteria, idk, but seems like it could be a good fit if you’re only keeping small amounts.
Feels great to make payments over lightning with it :)

How are you keeping up with all these comments? Thanks!
