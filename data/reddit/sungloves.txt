1. Disk space is incredibly important for Bitcoin because the entire blockchain is stored on each user's machine.
2. Moore's law is still very much in effect.

They are charged with money laundering because they knew the buyers intended to use the BTC for illegal purposes and agreed to sell to them anyway.

He's a really good actor, then. Because in the video statements and interview clips shown so far, he clearly has no idea what Bitcoin even is, really. He even stumbled on his words briefly and called it Bitcorn.

Nice try.

The police did not say Bitcoin was clearly the topic of conversation, they said the quotes were accurate. The quotes do not contain the context of the general topic of the conversation.

Right now it's just some dorkus in Congress yelling out stupid things. Very likely it will not go anywhere. I suspect he isn't very well liked by his fellow Democrats given that he was the only Democrat to vote against letting gay people serve in the military (among other reasons).

I was previously about 85% sure he wasn't and am now 99% sure.

He speaks what I would classify as good English, but not perfect. As noted by others, he makes some mistakes characteristic of people who speak English as a second language. Some people are overselling him speaking poor English, however.

Anyone can create a key with any address and then sign another key with it, and they can set any date they want by changing the clock on their computer (the signing occurs locally, not on the key server).

I had to wait almost a week a while back after not updating for a year or so.

Good. They explicitly identified they were intending to use the BTC for illegal purposes and he went ahead with the sale.

Even Dorian Nakamoto confirmed that he said that, but he said he said it in response to a question about his career. As many have speculated, it seems like she asked the question about Bitcoin but either didn't phrase it well or he just misunderstood and thought the question was about something else.

If one wouldn't make such a mistake, why would they make the mistake of telling the reporter they used to be involved with Bitcoin and then later say they never said that and try to cover up the fact they (allegedly) admitted it?

Anyone can create a PGP key for any particular email address, and a signature can be backdated. Note that it's shown as having been signed on April Fools Day. Also note the other signers: John Titor (time traveling hoaxer), Dade Murphy (Zero Cool/Crash Override from *Hackers*), etc.
