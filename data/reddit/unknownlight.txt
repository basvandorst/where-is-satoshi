Bitcoin addresses need to be simplified. No one wants to even *see* such complicated nonsense next to their money, let alone have to copy-paste a random string of numbers and letters whenever they want to pay online.
Bitcoin addresses should be like IP addresses. Still the fundamental backbone of the system, but hidden from normal users.
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:02:30


Small enough transactions (like the 1 satoshi transactions those addresses were sending) will never go through. However, it's not really possible to buy anything with transactions that small, so it doesn't matter. 
This problem will start rearing its ugly head once someone attempts a microtransaction scheme, but that's for the future to worry about.

Can I advertise that Vancouver's Robocoin ATM (the *original*, world's-first one) has no identification at all? The machine has a hand print scanner installed (I guess in case it needs to be used in the future), but it's disabled. You just go up to it, scan your address, funnel some cash into it, and it sends you bitcoins. If you want to, you can also sell your bitcoins at the machine. It displays an address, you send some bitcoins to it, and it gives you cash.
It's awesome. I happily pay the 5% convenience fee.

The company may be transparent and provide that information somewhere on their site, but the ATM itself just presents an exchange rate. Take it or leave it.
Source: I live a twenty minute walk away from this thing. A lot of the existing online information about the ATM is outdated. For example, the palm scanner was turned off after a week, and the UI has been substantially updated since the original videos were made. It's a pretty awesome little machine, if I do say so myself.

Blockchain.info keeps an encrypted version of your private keys on their servers that then get decrypted within your browser. They never get direct access to any of your bitcoins. Sure, they could try to brute-force everyone's passwords, but that would take generations.
No, it's not nearly as safe as, say, a paper wallet, but it much better than most web wallets.

The reason why information on the Waves ATM says that they have KYC implemented is because it *was* implemented when the ATM was introduced back in October. They turned it off after a couple weeks, and haven't turned it back on since (bear in mind I haven't been back there for about a month, so the situation *may* have changed, but I doubt it).

1. Using mBTC doesn't solve the problem, because the price only has to go a little above $1000/BTC before you have to start rounding off the cents. Yes, I know that rounding 0.495 to 0.50 isn't really a big deal, but rounding off your internal balances is bad practice in general. Plus, it could *in theory* lead to problems like someone trying to spend 0.50 mBTC even though they only have 0.495, causing the transaction to fail.
2. The ISO standard thing is a good reason, and you say so yourself. It's a good reason *on its own* to make this change, regardless of anything else.
3. Correcting people's misinterpretations is *not* manipulation, it's something that *ought to be done*. You haven't explained why letting a wrong assumption flourish while it could easily be resolved is a good thing.

People don't seem to be answering your question, probably because they're so used to the workings of Mt. Gox that they don't realize why you're confused.
You don't control the private keys of bitcoins deposited to Mt. Gox. You send them your coins, and Mt. Gox credits your account saying that you have "[x] BTC". When you withdraw, all you're doing is asking them to send you your bitcoins back. This is always how Mt. Gox has worked. Right now, they're refusing to send people's bitcoins back to them.
I honestly don't know if other exchanges work the same way, but I'm pretty sure they do. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Nope, Nexi. "Nexii" is garbled nonsense (well, "Nexi" is too, but to a slightly lesser degree). 
The plural of octopus is octopi, not octopii. There needs to be an "i" in the original word for the plural to have double "i"s (like radius. The plural is radii).
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:04:37
The one problem I have with this theory is that I vaguely recall that Gox bought a failing bitcoin business, bailing out all its customers who would've otherwise lost everything. I'm sure that happened more recently than 2011. That action wouldn't make sense if they were already in debt a million bitcoins.
I completely forget was this company was or any of the details, though. Uh, does someone else remember what I'm talking about?
**Edit:** Okay, the company was Bitomat.pl. On July 26, 2011, they accidentally lost 17,000 bitcoins due to their server being wiped. Mt.Gox bailed them out.
Meh, it's a bit odd that they'd bail out a site a month after they lost a million bitcoins, but I suppose that 17,000 is a drop in the bucket compared what they just lost.

Bitcoin pretty has a built-in time limit. If it's not a huge success by around 2040, then the network will kind of fall apart because there'll be no more incentives to mine.
No one really considers the "time limit" to be a big deal, and for good reason: If Bitcoin isn't a big success by 2040, then it probably never had a chance to begin with. We'll know long before that if it's a success or not.

While they currently aren't, bitcoins can be made to be essentially infinitely divisible. It doesn't matter if 99.9% of bitcoins are destroyed, because the remaining 0.01% can handle an economy just fine.

Currency codes are created by taking the "country code" and adding an extra letter to it. 
The United States' country code is "US". Their currency is the Dollar. Their currency code is "USD".
Canada's country code is "CA". Their currency is also the Dollar. Their currency code is "CAD".
Great Britain's country code is "GB". Their currency is the Pound. Their currency code is "GBP".
The European Union's "country" code is "EU". Their currency is the Euro. Their currency code is "EUR" (because making the last letter an "R" makes it very close to the name of the currency).
Bhutan's country code is "BT". Their currency is the Ngultrum. Their currency code is "BTN".
See the problem for Bitcoin's "BTC"? It's not a "Bhutan coin", after all. The solution is "XBT". "X" refers to international assets, such as gold ("XAU") and silver ("XAG").

"Bitcoin is basically a set of rules, enforced by programs on the internet. The rules can be read by anyone, but it's impossible for anyone to change them. These pre-written rules dictate how bitcoins are transfered, when and how bitcoins are minted, etc. The whole system regulates itself, and no one is allowed to interfere. The creator of Bitcoin was the person who initially wrote the rules. We don't know who this person was, but it doesn't matter because they're not capable of changing the rules any more than anyone else is."

keeps on saying that the palm scanner is optional, and keeps on being down voted. He is telling the truth. Vancouver's Robocoin ATM (the first one in the world, if you guys recall) has absolutely no security enabled whatsoever. No palm scan, no picture, no name, no ID, no email. You just walk up to it, hit "Buy", scan your address, put money in, and take your receipt. It's great, and completely anonymous.
That's why I, personally, dislike this news so much. What's currently an easy, anonymous way for me to buy/sell bitcoins will soon turn into a bank branch that's nothing at all like what I want.

A "wallet" is just a collection of addresses. Just add all of those addresses into your main wallet by importing the private keys. It's not a transaction, so you don't pay transaction fees.
Say you had 10 address, each with $0.10 in them. Combine them into one wallet, and you'll be able to make a $1.00 transaction. The transaction fee will apply to the $1.

It defeats the entire point of bitcoin to have central powers that can control money that doesn't belong to them, so no, this will never happen.
Think of bitcoin like you would physical cash. If someone steals your wallet from you, you have to physically hunt them down and take that money back. Cash doesn't have a built-in feature that allows you take back money that's out of your hands. It's the same with bitcoin.

Incorrect. The block chain verifies who *controls* which coins. If you steal someone's private keys, then the block chain will give you full control over that person's coins.

The Bitcoin Protocol backs bitcoins. Unfortunately, we use the same word, "Bitcoin", to describe two different things. The protocol is a highly sophisticated, uncentralized system that allows the speedy transfer of information while also verifying its authenticity without the need of a third-party. 
While bitcoins (note the lowercase "b") are the main thing that are currently transfered using the Bitcoin Protocol, they are by no means all that you can transfer. For example, if you send a contract through the system, then this contract will be both publicly accessible and there will be *no way to ever edit the contract*. You would have undeniable proof that this contract said *exactly* what it did, and was signed *exactly* at this time, without any debate, and without the need of a trusted third-party to back you up.
This (revolutionary) technology was created so that bitcoins couldn't be counterfeited, which is why the protocol is called Bitcoin, but it's much more versatile than that. The system works using unbiased math and processing power, and so is much more trustworthy than anything that's come before it.
Or, in other words, bitcoins are backed by Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:06:17
Bitcoin *is* a bubble—or, rather, is overvalued—right now, that's essentially fact. The market cap of bitcoin is far higher than the actual bitcoin economy is currently capable of sustaining. Thus, unless something big happens, I figure the price will eventually fall to match the bitcoin economy.
*Yet*, the bitcoin economy is constantly growing, so I believe we're on an upward trend in the long term, regardless of the individual peaks and valleys. And if not, uh, oh well.

Sorry, when I said "rarely used metric measurements" I was referring to micro and below.
Using the "bit" naming convention, 0.01 of a bit is a satoshi, so we never have to bother with "millibits". If we ever get the point that we have to start splitting up satoshis, then, well, we'd have to do some renaming regardless of the system we use.

Google+ has actually been extremely successful. What are you talking about?

18, male, in college, live in Vancouver. Had no interest in bitcoin until nine days ago, which is when the bitcoin ATM opened here. Now I and both my parents own one bitcoin each.

I asked a question on Bitcoin Beginners and was eventually advised to ask someone more knowledgeable about blockchain.info, so I'm going to link it here. [This was my question.](

Here, I'll tell you what a bit is: 1 million bits = 1 bitcoin.
Don't tell that you'd be able to "intuitively" know what a mBTC was. Unless you were told what that "m" stands for, you wouldn't be able to know for sure that it was referring to the metric "mille" (you could *guess*, but you couldn't know). It's even worse with uBTC, which you wouldn't be able to guess referred to "micro" even if you were an expert in rarely-used metric measurements, due to no one using the µ symbol. And even after that most people don't know how many zeros are in a "micro", even from metric-using countries.
You *have* to get an explanation anyway, no matter what system you use, so why can't the explanation be 1 million bits in a bitcoin?

I am legitimately having trouble understanding why some people don't like this idea. It seems utterly *perfect* to me, and extremely intuitive. I really hope this becomes standard in the future.

I'm kinda hoping it crashes. I got into all this extremely late and want to own more than just a single bitcoin.

It's the ultimate all-or-nothing. I'm glad to be here, watching it happen.

What sketchy stuff have you heard?

Ah, [this]( article explains it. Never mind.

It very much depends on where you're coming from. For example, I never really knew much about bitcoin until just a little over a month ago, when the Bitcoin ATM was installed downtown (I live in Vancouver). When I first went to that ATM, the price was ~$200, and I bought a little bit for the novelty of it. A few days later, after a bunch of research into bitcoin and the price shooting up by another hundred, I went back and bought significantly more. A few days later, with the price skyrocketing, I bought some *more*, now kicking myself that I didn't buy very much on that first day.
But the thing is...the way I see it, long-term, if bitcoins are going to be a success, it's going to be worth a hell of a lot more than it does right now. And if bitcoins fail, then they'll be worth nothing. There's not much in between. Which means that I kind of *want* to return to that price I saw on the first day, so that I can actually buy a meaningful amount and properly play this lottery.
...This crash has been a massive disappointment for me so far. I'm really hoping it continues to sink, and doesn't just bouce back like it's done every other time.

See, you're showing your tech bias here. Would you believe that a significant majority of people have no idea what the difference between KB, MB, GB, and TB are? And even after that, only a small percentage of the people who know and understand the difference could tell you, say, how many standard photos you could fit in a GB.


100K bits, or perhaps 100 "K bits". The idea is to use terminology people already know and can intuitively grasp.

I try to. I really do. It's just hard to find bitcoin merchants that sell stuff I want to buy.

Thank you!
