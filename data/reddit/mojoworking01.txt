Then here's my question. How difficult would it be to crack a simple easy to remember portion of a password, appended to a known high entropy 40 character portion of a bip39 passphrase. Essentially creating a 3 Factor Authentication.
Why? Let say you want to leave some BTC to a loved one. But only after you're gone. So you give them a copy of your recovery mnemonic. You then give a copy of your high entropy password to a trusted family or friend. Plus copies placed in your safety deposit box.
You tell your loved one that no one should ask them for their copy of your mnemonic recovery. And that a copy of your high entropy password is stored in your lock box. Plus a trusted friend is also holding a copy for you.
Then you add the secret sauce. You write a simple password that you and they can easily remember on a piece of paper. Then burn it. You tell them that they're never to write that password down or share with anyone. You tell them that they will need all three factors to recover your Bitcoin.
Unfortunately somehow someone gets a copy of your mnemonic and you're 40 character high entropy password. But only you and your loved one knows about the simple password appended to the 40 character high entropy portion of your password.
So with the mnemonic and the 40 character high-entropy password in hand, how hard will it be for a malicious attacker to crack the hashing, key stretching, salting, gnashing of teeth, Etc. By cracking the appended memorable simple password.
Does the complexity of the mnemonic plus the high entropy portion of the 40 character password significantly increase the complexity and difficulty of cracking or brut forcing the appended simple portion of the password alone. Thereby preventing the theft of their Bitcoins.
If so by how much does it increase the entropy of the simple password. Is cracking just a matter of time. Or unfeasible like the 40 character high entropy password.
