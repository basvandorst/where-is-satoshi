i am going to be straight up and just say i did minimal research and am now paying the price for being an idiot.

i already paid someone the bitcoins anyway so it's cool. but next time i will just get it sent to an address in the electrum wallet, thanks!

i am using very small amounts. i'm not worried about security as i don't intend to be using bitcoin very often, just wanted to buy some discounted modafinil but i have found myself in a whole molehill of computer stuff i don't understand. thanks for all the advice though!

ok i just installed electrum, put the key i received the bitcoins in and it says i have the coins. it's all good!

1 more question... is it possible to get the coins out of a watching only wallet?
Now i know i have the bitcoins, how can i send them? they havent' arrived at bitcoin core yet because it won't connect to anything to get the block chain downloaded, and even if i did download the block chain torrent, i couldn't sync it so it would download the rest. so basically i'd have to do some weird computer shit with nodes or something i don't undertand at all. any way i can get the bitcoins out of the watch only electrum wallet?
I literally have no idea what is going on. At all. Now i know how most people feel at the gym (meathead here)

i imported the private keys, but it says the wallet is watch only and i can't spend money with it. so i need access to the bitcoin core wallet to move it around, as that is a normal wallet. 
the problem i'm having now is that it says 'no block source available', 7 years 16 weeks behind, and it has 0 connections to the bitcoin network. this means it can't download the blockchain and work. 
any idea on how to get bitcoin core connected to the bitcoin network? I've been googling a lot, to no avail.

ok so i gave up using bitcoin core because it wont connect to anything. it won't even start downloading the block chain or sync up tp anything, it's got 0 connections. i don't undertand it so i downloaded electrum, and while i can see the bitcoins on it through a watching only wallet, i can't send them because, i'm assuming, i got the bitcoins sent to an adress made with bitcoin core. 
any idea how i can get the bitcoins out of the watching only elctrum wallet into a wallet i can spend them in?

I imported them into the electrum wallet and it worked. thanks so much!!!!

Thank you very much. I will try this now. Thanks.

it should have. i got sucked in and fucked it up. i am fully aware of how bad i am with technology so i'm not sure why i even tried. i can't even properly format my own fucking phone so it works how i want it to.

I was just buying some modafinil, i figured out how to get the private key as someone said, got it on electrum and then sent it to the seller. it's done now, all is good in the hood, but i'll be sure to do a lot more reading before i use bitcoins again.
