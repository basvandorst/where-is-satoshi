if more people start to short btc, how can they create the missing bitcoins to pay people who shorted bitcoins? Shouldn't they have for sure some reserves in dollars?
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:12:50
Because coinbase defeats the purpose of Bitcoin. It's centralized like crazy.

Best quote ever: “As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either, not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose, and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel. If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.”

They don't have to pay taxes on those bitcoins until they actually sell them!!!!!

This is just a clown show. If I want to "LOCK" my bitcoins to USD I simply sell them on an exchange for USD. When I want to "UNLOCK" them I just buy bitcoins back.
That's exactly how they do it. They keep your fiat money (or whatever other asset) on an exchange. Good luck with that! Suuuuper risky!
Also, I bet the quote for this "locking" service will be worse than "locking" your coins yourself on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-20 08:53:29
it was 500$ last week, not a big deal. It will be $4000 by end of this year. This is just normal volatility and miners selling BTCs to pay electricity. The whole ecosystem is growing. You have to look at it long term.

So you are saying that the whole supply of bitcoins will have the value of a package of 21 tolls of toilet paper? I don't think so. I think the value of a bitcoin will rise higher than what it is today as people realize that it can't be inflated like you can with paper currencies. It will be good to buy to protect your savings.

Thank you. I also think that is the direction to go. I'm investigating a bit about the TouchID feature because it could be truly amazing. Think about being able to store bitcoins in your finger.. and if you lose your phone you'd just get a new one a re-spawn your wallet with your finger. Very secure at the same time. Of course you would be able to export a generating seed in case you lose your finger :)

Can it scale to say 10'000 users?
If you periodically scan the everybody's posts every 5 minutes you'd need 33 requests per second to the Facebook app..

Switzerland always had its currency tied to gold. Until 2000. It was actually the last country to abandon this. Is it a coincidence that Swiss people are so rich compared to other countries? No. Now, since 2008, there has been an injection into the system of 8 times the amount of francs in circulation before. When people will wake up and realize that the swiss franc is nothing but a bad copy of the euro (since it's now pegged to it), inflation will kick in and people's savings will get diluted by 8 times (or something like that). All of this just because some muppets in a suit decided to start printing swiss francs.

Ok. Was https on? The only way for an attacker to attack you is to be a tor exit node and spoof the https certificate. In this case, however, tor will notify you with a page saying that the https certificate isn't valid and you'll have to manually accept it. Did this happen? If not, either tor isn't doing its job correctly or you were not robbed through tor.

Warning against fiat use:
**Bankers**. Fiat currencies are targets for highly sophisticated bankers, who have been able to trick people into scams.
**Fewer protections**. If you trust someone else to hold your fiat something *will* go wrong.
**Cost**. Printing of the US fiat money costs the government more than 20 billions a year.
**Scams**. Fraudsters are taking advantage of the hype surrounding fiat currencies to cheat people.

It's a stupid question. It's like saying: if bitcoin didn't have the properties it has, would you still use it? Of course not. Would people still invest in gold if it was as easily inflatable as paper currency? No.

If they have a pool of Bitcoins on the exchange already they will loose even more if the price of a Bitcoin goes down. Imagine they ask for 100$ in Bitcoins. If the price of a bitcoin goes up until they can sell it, they will earn extra money. If it goes down, they will loose money after they sell it. If, in addition to the bitcoins the payer sends them, they also have a pool of bitcoins on the exchange, they will loose even more (since the price went down). Doesn't having a pool of Bitcoins on the exchange expose them even more to risks?

THIS IS A MISBELIEF. The proposal demands that gold that was bought can't be sold **by the small elite of people at the top of the pyramid**. If, in the future because of a crisis or emergency the population would need to sell a bit of gold, they can still do so by exercising direct democracy. The initiative is there only to prevent those few muppets at the top to speculate and debase people's savings.

No actually we were just having fun... don't think you can make a living with day trading, unless you're simply lucky. And if you're not you simply loose your money.

haha, i'm planning to move to the silicon valley in the future. Funny how relative things look.

Interesting. After the verification I didn't receive any email asking me if unwanted to increase the withdrawal limit. I think there are 2 levels of verification. Then one where you just send some scanned documents and the one where you send government-signed documents. Which verification level are you talking about? I only did the first one. Anyway, I added a bank account 2 days after the big bitcoin crash and it's still being validated. I emailed them yesterday and still no answer...

Actually we don't do trading at all... leave that to the monkeys :) We simply hold our coins long long term and spend them on cool stuff from time to time.

It's a Samsung 1000W home theater kit with bluray and 3D (which I never use) hooked up to an Apple TV. Can't remember the exact name though.

You're not the first person to ask me that!

I don't see any organization for civil claims in the linked forum. Anybody did something about it? Who says we have to do that?

Used it to get emergency cash in an airport:

I met Giulio (1 of the 2 co founders) when he came to Switzerland for a project. All I can say is that he's a really good guy and really really passionate about his work. Congrats Giulio!

Actually i just checked and my bank account got approved! Yay! I sent an email to aml asking for withdrawal raise to 10k$.

The code I think is open source, but how can we trust that the actual code loaded on the chips is not backdoored with some sort or weak cryptography (e.g. weak random generator)? Or that there's a hardware backdoor somehow? We can't right? We basically have to trust those guys. Just playing devil's advocate.
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:30:27
Yes, it still works fine with "Uncompressed"

Doesn't directly answer your question. But you may find this interesting to lower to time needed to accept a payment and detect double spendings:

I am in Poland right now and my girlfriend is polish. Can I help?
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:08:26
Nice one. Too bad they have no way to prove their coin came up heads N times in a row.
@_date: 2013-07-24 11:21:37
How did you initiate the withdrawal process? I can't seem to find any buttons to do that :S
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:11:54
That's actually great to hear. What was then that exploit about weak number generators about?
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:04:35
I reviewed the code. Seems ok. But still he could make a silent update and screw people over. This is quite risky. Even with 2fa..
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:07:17
But how would you explain them bitcoin difficulty? A Galton Box allows me to do that.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:13:13
My girlfriend who's waiting for me in Poland just told me she doesn't have words and that I'm the craziest boyfriend ever :)
I guess she's starting to realize how bitcoin isn't just an imaginary fairy tale that I tell her sometimes about.

My girlfriend just high-fived you (except for the "don't show women your bitcoins.")
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:00:32
I didn't know about bitcoinpulse. When did it get released? Pretty awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:21:25
Can't remember. Don't even remember where I got it.

Hi, my passport doesn't fit in my wallet. I think this is true for almost every passport in Europe.

Had a 3.5 hours layover in Warsaw before the connecting flight to Wroclaw. But you're right, I wouldn't have starved.

I got this email from their lawyers 2-3 weeks ago: "The problem is not anymore where the funds are held. The Polish authorities are not holding all of the funds anymore. A part was released – but for another part they prolonged the seizure. The problem is, that we cannot start the refunding, because in doing so we are risking to pay funds to account-owners, which are under suspicion of illegal activities. That’s why we’d need access to the files – which is denied because there are ongoing investigations against those third parties and the Polish authorities are of the opinion, that giving access to the files would endanger these ongoing investigations. As stated in the latest update we're currently working on a solution for this, but it will take some 2 or 3 more weeks to prepare everything."

Thank you all!
Update: I asked several people at the Zurich airport if they knew bitcoin. Most of them looked at me in a weird way and had difficulties repeating the name "bitcoin".
Until I found a person who knew it very well.
I exchanged some of my coins for 300 Swiss francs seamlessly. We agreed to use bitstamp rate.
I'm gonna board the plane more relaxed now :)
I will still try to change some bitcoins in Warsaw.

Maybe I'll avoid the analogy then.
