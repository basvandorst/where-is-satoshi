Be aware of this. Just take a look at the sourcecode at github. On the Homepage they are telling "no premine" but they added some, so they just want to to make short money with premined coins and then maybe let the project fall to the ground.
And the MiningAlgo will change to x11.

Well, if you are storing you crypto on some Exchanges, it could be possible. The chances of loosing your cryptos is more likly to be stolen by a hacker or a institute that is a so called hacker.
When you store it on your own machine, the chances of a financial damage are less then a lotterywin

You could use Blockfolio, where you can insert your Buys and Sells. Just take a look on Blockfolio :)

Even if you got some, the Blockchain is dezentralized, therefore you don't even own some, you could not grab it. It is all located on the Blockchain. It is everwhere and nowhere. At any time you just see a "snapshot" therefore it is kind of timebased outdated piece of Data. The only things you own are the private-key files. If you use some software like Coinbase, you own nothing. You only have an access to an account, because the private-key files are stored at the provider of a Node. The Blockchain itself owns the Cryptocurrenies because you cant take it out of. 
So no you dont carry any currencies. 
That would be my answer at this case.

We shouldn't move to a cashless society controlled by the banks! If we do, the mankind will truly become powerless. We wouldn't have any control of our hard work deserved money. So if the bank or gov. has to 100% control of your money, the bank has 100% control of you. You would lose the chance of your own freedom.
