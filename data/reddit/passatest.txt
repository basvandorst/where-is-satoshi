Lmao I️ just bought another 200 and watched BTC drop to -45 but now I’m back up I️ just had 3 heart attacks
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:57
This has to be a joke
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:55:29
No I️ wish, $200 worth lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:24:13
Thanks, I didn’t realize I had the payment method set to my bank account lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:13:36
Should I still take my coins out of coinbase around that time? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:57:12
Only got nervous bc I️ realized I️ could’ve capitalized when it went negative lol not a huge deal

I googled it and the first place i found was bitaddress.org , is that safe to use? theres no cost involved so im not sure if its the right thing
Edit : also how would you sell you bitcoin that you keep on a paper wallet?

So currently I have bread wallet and Coinbase on my phone, before this fork happens I plan on moving everything from my coinbase account into my breadwallet, would that be considered holding my own key or is there more to it?

So it’s ok to stick with it? I only plan on buying $20-$50 a week for now and I just want to let it sit and watch it grow

So whenever this fork happens, should i send all the bitcoin i have in coinbase over to my wallet that i have on my laptop?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:16:42
I just downloaded it on my laptop, do they have an iphone app too? Thanks for all the answers btw
Edit: I started up Bitcoin Core and it didnt have me make an account, are the bitcoins just going to be linked to the laptop theyre on?

What would you recommend to do? I’m still pretty new to this. Also is there a specific date for when the HF will happen ?
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:54:16
I don’t have the money for one of those right now so once I actually get a decent amount of coin saved up I’ll move it to a flash drive until I can buy a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:53:11
Ok, so what would you say is a good backup to have?
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:37:33
Ok i see what youre saying, but the laptop i have now might not last too much longer so i'd feel safer putting my coins in a wallet on my phone, do you know which one would be the safest on ios? i know i asked this already im just really new to this

I recently made an account with Coinbase and I’m new to this whole thing so I’m not sure what all of this means, but should I find a new way to buy and sell or will I be ok with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:23:13
Ok thanks, I have an account with BitPay too, if something goes bad with Coinbase would that be a safe place to put them?
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:59:01
Np, thanks for answering everything else though 
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:51:11
By then I’ll probably only have around $200 in it because I’m buying a certain amount every week, I’ll most likely just put it on a paper wallet since I don’t have the money for a hardware wallet right now
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:49:50
Would it be safe to put them on a paper wallet for the HF?
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:58:59
Is it still considered early if i start buying now?
