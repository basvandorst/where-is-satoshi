For real, and everyones situation is different. $1,000 can be a big deal.

You call racism on something not racist, then call me an Uncle Tom which I'm sure you say about certain black people. So, yeah. You're your typical SJW snowflake who's actually racist himself. People who call people *uncle toms* are racist, sorry.
cnn and is that way

I'm Asian and I find Asian stereotypes hilarious because they are true lol.

Do you call black people Uncle Tom's? Because that's about as racist as you could get. Uncle Tom implies that they are literally less than slaves because they are subservient to their masters. 
Just another clever way for people to literally be racist and get away with it, go back to CNN.

Whether or not that was one entity doesn't matter. It's all about the current market sentiment.. That candle is a clear indicator for many that the bear market is reversing which brings in new money. People have claimed manipulation for every single run that has ever happened with Bitcoin and my argument that it doesn't matter if it is or not because the rest of the market views it as bullish.

It's volatile because people use it as an investment rather than a currency.

My assumption was that if the people who had literally hundreds of millions to billions of USD during the height of the market and didn't sell would mean that the really true whales are long and expect the price to be worth much more than $20,000/btc

short positions got liquidated for insane amounts, this is very bullish

around 10 of the 100 seem to be the major exchanges.

Bitcoin has deflation though, no? Coins will be lost over time, lowering the total amount. Deflation causes people to horde currency

Ah, I see why people are confused. What I meant by "not going anywhere" was that it's not a ponzi or a fad like FUD would suggest. I suppose I should of said "undervalued and not a scam"

You don't think it's alarming that almost 70% of bitcoins are held by only about 8k wallets? Why do you think bitcoin is so volatile? The whales dump when the price is inflated then just buy again when the market crashes, rinse and repeat. It's text book pump and dump lol

Could you imagine if the USD's value fluctuated as much as BTC?

We have a pretty good understanding of how the economy works, actually. Thousands of years of history and understanding says otherwise.

remember when the government forced banks to give sub-prime mortgages to people without jobs, bad credit, etc which lead to the one of the most devastating recessions we've had in the last 100 years?
All because the banks were "discriminating" against minorities who were getting denied for mortgages at a higher rate than "whites" but the real reason was that they were being denied is they had no proof of income and/or bad credit?

Lol anyone I've ever heard use the term "financial freedom" were all part of pyramid schemes.
