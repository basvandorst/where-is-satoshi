Welcome! Thanks for the feedback. 
**Only you can see your wallet address.** The only other person that might see it, is the person who hires you. Until then, no one else will see it.
With regards to the bid and proposal, for the most part, most people do not mind that is public. Other sites like Freelancer.com, has the same practice.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:28:09
Thanks for the feedback Elvis, I'll see what I can come up with. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:40:07
Fixed! Sorry! Your account was created, but was not correctly redirected. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:56:12
Right now it is a P2P, talking to the freelancer outside of the service, gains you nothing. At some point I will charge a small fee, if you accept the a bid. Refunded if the job is not completed. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:45:11
Thanks so much mewald! Here was my the original introduction:

Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:45:51
No plans to do so.

You've got it.

Some of you know my past work:

Unfortunately none of them have been successful, so I'm trying my hands on this.
Let me know what you think. Thanks.

Its a fantastic point, I've reached out to payment processing vendors, and they are VERY picky. I'll continue to stab away at them, and see if I make any headway. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:41:51
Thank you, I will be mindful of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:47:32
You're absolutely right to be skeptical. History should always be taken into account, when accessing the present.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:41:16
No I do not mean ETC, I am referring to EPC (Experiencecoin).
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:24:17
If you look right below the chart, you will see the Candle Chart option.
As with workingForBitcoins.com, my philosophy will be to develop a trustworthy reputation that is based on fairness and just practices. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:33:43
Sure, in what section?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:35:53
I'll look into this. Great feedback!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:27:22
It will be developed using a combination of technologies. It will not be open sourced. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:34:01
Those are just placeholders, at the beginning I will be only implementing a few coins:
* BTC
* LTC
* ETH
* EPC
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:31
Thanks for the feedback, I'll look into this and see what I can do. It will likely be in the pipelines sometime soon after v1.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:22:45
Hmmm, this is something I have not thought of, great feedback, I'll have to do some research as to what this would entail. The biggest thing is being able to do that and be responsive. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:36:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:02:17
Nor will I. What weight will a statement like that have?  In the absence of an assurance, do you feel you are any more at risk, than in the presence of one?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:21:30
Yes, its for real.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:19:11
Having Mobile App application is definitely on the roadmap. The site will utilize a combination of sockets and API calls, the same mechanism that will be used by used by our mobile apps.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:45:11
The optimistic side of me gives it a 2%!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:21:20
It will start off as only Crypto. If it shows any traction, I will implement Fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:31:02
It's not that I don't want to develop fiat features right off the back, the problem is it will only be me and one other person. Plus I'm funding this project with what little money I have. As a result, I will need to utilize the resource as efficiently as possible to get it out the door. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:41:41
You use services at your own discretion, if you feel that a service provider does not meet your standards and or requirements, clearly you're not going to utilize them. Which is a very wise choice, as I stated somewhere else, as with any service, your decision on whether or not to trust them, should steam from your own inquiry. Only then will you be able to appropriately make a reasonably sound decision.
I very much care about the interface, a project life cycle has different phases and practices. The practice I chose to apply, makes the interface an important starting stage of that cycle.
With regards to your other questions; Until I have a minimal viable product out and running in closed beta, are unnecessary to address. You don't count your eggs before they hatch, and the same applies here, until I have a MVP, who knows that potential road bumps, and potential roadblocks I will hit, that might derail the project.
Your concerns are completely just and rightfully expressed, and as the project makes progress, I will do my best to answer and address not only your questions and concerns, but any others that might come up as well.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:55:23
Can you please provide additional information on the fail cases?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:39:24
I want to provide some info about my experience, a question a few people asked.
* I have experience working on financial related projects. I was the chief architect and lead developer for a system that handle large sums of transactions on a daily basis.
* I have experience developing software that are PCI compliant
* I've held leadership roles managing large teams and large budgets
* I been developing since the mid 90s
* The sites I've posted are my own personal projects, not related to projects I've work for, when employed 
In addition to that, here are some notes I want to make:
* There is absolute NO online system, service, website in the world that is completely secure. The very nature that allows us all to connect, is the very thing that exposes all systems to security risks. The only difference is the difficulty with which someone can eventually break through
* The system we are going to architect around the wallets, will put into place a couple of security protocol, that will make it very unlikely a potential threat can be present.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:45:51
I'll be sure to add this. Thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:32:50
As with ANY service, you need to do your research on whomever is offering a service to you, and determine whether you think there is a likelihood of this happening or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:28:21
For this exchange, I am not until I am confident with a MVP. It would be silly and irresponsible for me to seek any investment from anyone during this very early development phase.
However, once the product is up and running, and I feel confident with it, I would look into

Because of the greed at Freelancers.com I created WorkingForBitcoins.com
Because of the bad experience I've had with some exchanges, I'm in the process of creating my own.
I have a very unfavorable opinion of Coinmarketcap.com, due to their continued refusal to include EPC, despite it having a bigger market than some of the coins on there, and having been around since 2013. I understand trying to maintain a list that meets some standards for the sake of quality, but in this situation, I disagree with their assessment. Having such a important role in the market, this comes across as an authoritarian operation, dictating who belongs in the market and who does not. Through this, they've inspired me to create an alternative site in late 2018, early 2019.

@_date: 2018-08-10 06:27:04
Sorry about that, can you give me a break down of what steps you took and any errors you received?
When you say don't work, what exactly do you mean by this? It is not accepting your input, the input does not accept any value?
* Are you using NoScript by any chance or any other addon?
* What version of Chrome are you using?
* Are you on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android?

Neither is a drop down, it is expecting text input for both. The skills page will require you to select one of the options available, not ones you make up yourself. the Duration is simply a value from 3 to 30
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:39:26
I don't quite understand how this works.
I have a wallet right, and it has an address.
When someone send me a bitcoin, they send it to that address.
How do I now send that bitcoin to someone else, without showing them what address sent it to me initially?
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:23:43
Man, reading up on bitcoin's protocol, has lead me to 14 open tabs, each leading to more intense reading... and im only 1/3 of the way down the page...! 
I think I need to just get myself out of this rabbit hole, and just play it dirty and run regex on the html content from the the /address/ page on blockchain.info hehehe! Would that really be wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:08:34
Hey friend, I'm stuck on a issue. It appears the sum of the inputs are not equal to the value of the output value variable, even when there in a single output.
For example, summing up the inputs = 2, but the value of output is 1.9959. My code is not rounding up the variable, as I double checked the accuracy setting of my environment. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:50:27
Just to be clear, I'm not trying to program anything for bitcoin, I'm simply building something that utilizes bitcoin as one of three options to complete a transaction.
With that said, I think this is great advise, I'm reading over the wiki page now, and hopefully when I'm done, I'd be able to better understand this json data. Thank you for directing me, sometimes the most obvious things are the most difficult to realize! lol  
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:45:30
Thanks for the help, I fixed the bug you discovered! It was nice chatting with you, hope to see you on there again.

I know its not very active, its a new site and it will take time to gain some traction. At the very least it is an option you're free to exercise, and I hope you do.  
@_date: 2019-06-10 20:02:18
That's exactly the reason,  there is not enough traffic,  if I removed expired jobs,  it would appear more dead than it is.

@_date: 2017-04-03 17:11:23
Thank you for a insightful response. My follow up question is, given that all companies engage in activities that best serve its interests and profit, there would be, without a doubt, a conflict of interest at some point or another. 
What would happen at a crossroad, where one path would be in the interest of Blockstream, while the other would best serve the overall objective of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-28 12:08:15
If you think promoting that site on here, is going to gain me any traction, I can assure you, it does not.
I am simply sharing my shift to Stripe, which I am proud of, as duly noted in my title. :)
@_date: 2017-04-16 20:52:11
I got you covered bro. Watch bitcoin/btc on April 21st. If my brain doesn't fry by then, I'll be releasing my site for testing phase. Then after two weeks, once I've ironed out most of the bugs discovered, hopefully go beta.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:05:49
Thank for pointing this out.  Once I get home tonight,  I'll fix it. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 19:11:15
Wow! Great info, I was not aware of this. Thank you so much for bringing it to my attestation, although its not relevant for this site, other sites that I owe, it will be. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 19:10:18
Thank you
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:46:54
Wow, such a simple yet Fantastic point! I had the same idea of trying to minimizing the risk, by first pre-generating the addresses, then locking down the wallet, until I needed more. However, your suggestion is far better, I can simply generate them offline and transfer them over when I need more. The passphrase, though a sold approach, granted its a long secure one, still is not as safe as a completely disconnected wallet. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:36:52
Well,  maybe it can be a setting option you can turn on. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:12:09
Its my duty brother. I'd want someone else to do the same for me, if they discovered a scam running.
Information is power.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:29:56
I'm a bit puzzled by the down votes. I am not well informed about the every day workings of bitcoin, and figured it was a reasonable  question to ask. For example there might event/announcement/development in the past week/month or so.
Moving forward, I'll refrain from asking questions on here.
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:43:02
Is there any advice/tips you can share with me on starting up, and operating the business? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:25:48
Why are people trying to push bits so hard? ELI5? 
@_date: 2016-05-26 01:23:00
The idea is not to start off as a profitable business,  rather start imprinting Bitcoins into the fabric of businesses.
The business is going to operate at a loss for the first couple of years,  however,  this isn't about turn key profiting,  far from it.  It's about bringing Bitcoin closer to locals and making it readily accessible. 
The people that would be supporting this project,  are investing in the promotion of Bitcoins, and bringing it to a market that otherwise would be ignorant of its existence. 
There are many ways to go about this,  this is one option,  that with the right backing could become a reality.  It doesn't mean it's the only option or the best.  Far from it,  it  is merely an opportunity to expand it into market that has the potential to have a positive impact. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 06:23:34
It's not about leaking the identity, it's about potentially proving the current claim false. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 02:02:21
I just want to add that for every one good reason there is to go ahead with this project, there are probably 100 good reasons not to, but that is the nature of venturing into something like this.
It is likely that this idea will go no further than this post, given the sheer challenges I will faces. For example, gaining peoples confidence will be extremely difficult, and why should people trust me, how am I any more trustworthy than all those people that came before me, etc.. etc..
If this does nothing else, but inspire an idea or encourage someone else to go ahead with their idea, than its worth putting it out there, and seeing where it goes and what can come of it.
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:47:20
Honestly,  there is no real answer to that,  for the most part I plan to simply help people learn about bitcoins,  and help them buy them.  They will hold on to their own Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:23:57




Thanks for the feedback. I'll keep that in mind
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:45:29
Thanks for the heads up.  Can you provide me with some reading material that will help me get up par with laws governing these types of businesses? 
Also, my plan is to start out very simply, and see hour things work out. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:48:34
This is a great idea, I can give local businesses the altitude ability to integrate btc in to their businesses.

Nice catch,  the search result is using the wrong templates. I'll fix it when I get a chance.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:59:58
You don't pay anything until you get the final product. Just like any new site, it takes time to build karma/rating. You will start out with no rating and the freelancers will start off with no rating.
There will aways be people who will try to scam and or screw you up and down the street, you just have to build a platform you can rely on and that will reduce these odds. That is one of the object of the site.
@_date: 2016-07-30 00:02:55
I may not agree with but if they strong arm him out, I'm done with reddit. If people don't believe, trust, or like his handling of his subreddit, go somewhere else. 
Very disturbing notion.

Can you please link the account you're seeing this in.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:51:55
Post the job and I'll see who I can find. This is a really hard task, and its likely the most likely approach people will take is to try to brute force it. But you never know, post and we can see what happens.

Yikes! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:14:00
Guys, I want to make this site the best in can be, in terms of functionality, usability, reliability, and trustworthiness.
I will do this by working hard, listening to the community, and providing them with something they can count on.
My principles drive me to work towards creating something that is not only successful, and useful, but also, a business that will support its user base.
I started this project because I was absolutely fed up with all these other sites. Freelancer.com, upwork, and the rest of them. They are greedy organizations, designed to exploit the market that they feel they can control. I'm here to put a stop to that.
Take Freelancer.com for example:
If you have budget of $1000, they charge you $30, and then they charge the freelancer $100. I got sick of this, and decided I could do much better.
I honestly believe that a company can because successful by treating its users fairly, and I'm here to prove it. I have a extremely uphill battle before me, and the likelyhood of me failing is very high, but I want to try.
Please help support my efforts, and in return, I'll give you the best service I can possibly provide that is within my capacity.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:15:00

Its an ajax driven site. 
What about it annoyed you?
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:10:20
I understand your point. However, let's say I make these actions without the need for js, you'd still be faced with the issue that all the core functionality of the site are js driven, so then you'd be faced with the same issue.
Craigslist is a great site, but they utilize js as well, though not as much as I do.
