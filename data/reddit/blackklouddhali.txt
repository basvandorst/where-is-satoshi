Dec 2017 Bitcoin value is new territory:
1. Financial institution money entered and existed the market in an unprecedented manner in Q4. Hedge funds pulled their profits out before year end to post gains and collect their year end bonuses. 
2. Japan and Korea announced a hefty tax on crypto currency gains in 2018, people were forced to cash in on profit before year end. 
3. Corporate financial markets saw how easily manipulated crypto currency is. They will be back and Bitcoin won't be the only crypto on their radar. This isn't just a get rich scheme for the everyman, it's about to get even more interesting. Watch the markets swing and swing big. 
4. Ripple (XRP) is setting itself up for success in that they are working with financial institutions using blockchain technology for more efficient tr and action speeds and reducing cost in segments using astronomical transaction volumes. XRP Is undervalued, but that doesn't mean a large pullback isn't coming. 
5. Fiat won't die in this decade (in the U.S.), there are too many powerful entities who control too much to allow blockchain and crypto currencies to prevail. They will get on board and begin to manipulate and cash in...unless government entities legislate it to death.  
6. 2018 is uncharted territory, we will see regulation and unprecedented growth. 
7. Not sure why I numbered these, I did no research and just rambled while sipping on half unsweet iced tea and half lemonade. Some call that an Arnold Palmer, but those are usually made with sweet tea, I'm trying to be refreshed, not a sugar high.

Both precious metals and digital assets are manipulated. The next stock market correction will be huge for many reasons, the major one being due to the current market is vastly hyperinflated. If real estate crashes too, that's a smart long term investment in undervalued areas.
