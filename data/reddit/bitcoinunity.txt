As long as we all collectively keep putting buy orders, the price will not keep dropping. It's basic supply and demand. That's what I'm advocating. I don't see what is so complicated about it. It shouldn't take much money to stop this attack that the chinese are currently doing to us.

Ok look I personally have invested about $8600 of my money, thats pretty much my entire life savings. I still have another $850 in my checking account that I would spend if it wasn't for the fact that my rent ($550) is due on May 1st. The rest I need for groceries and bus fare until I get paid again. So I think you can see bitcoin is a major commitment to me and something I'm passionate about. 
I was going to ask what a throwaway but after googling for reddit and throwaway i see that you're saying that this is a temporary account. I just started using reddit recently, a friend of mine showed it to me. previously I was learning and researching bitcoin through bitcointalk forums.

Thanks, i really would like to see more people like you posting here telling us how much you just bought. I'll be monitoring this thread. Hopefully it makes a difference and turns the price around. Me personally, just spent the last $220 I had in my savings account. I would do more but rent is due soon and i need the money in my checking account for living expenses. but as soon as my next paycheck comes I will be buying more.

If everyone who reads this thread just goes and spends 20% of their fiat savings in savings and checking accounts then we will be out of this mess. That's the whole point of this thread, to get more people on board with the idea that we really need to support bitcoin during a time of difficulty by increasing our purchasing since there are active political problems in china that are increasing sell side pressure.

I made a thread in this sub about the chinese selling pressure that's making our holdings worth less. Hopefully people here join in on the effort and scrape up whatever fiat they can to cause the buy pressure to exceed the sell pressure and cause a quick reversal in the current price movement.

I don't think this is fair. I bought coins myself too. I said already (in one of my other comments) that i've pretty much spent the last fiat I can afford to spend on bitcoin. Although its a tough time for me financially, I'm still doing my part. I'm not advocating for only other people to do this, I'm putting my money where my mouth is and participating as well. I think if everybody had a similar attitude we would quickly go back up to the 600 to 700 dollar territory in the next month or so and we'll be surpassing the all-time highs by the end of the summer.

I understand where you're coming from, but I think with a concerted effort we can all put enough money on the buy side to combat the panic selling that the chinese are doing. I'm doing my part to keep the buy side pressure up and I'm hoping that my brothers and sisters in can pledge to do the same. We shouldn't have to suffer because of their political problems.
