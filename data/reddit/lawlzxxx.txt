twice in the last week  
reminds  me of mt. gox   
even before their alleged "hack" which most of us firmly believe was theft... mt. gox used to regularly crash the market... wiping billions out of the cap because they we're too incompetent   to get their infrastructure to a standard where they could handle the load.   
then their only response was to post on facebook how impressive and successful they were.  
now all these years later coinbase does the same... twice in 1 week.  
Last week they blew 70 ish billion out of the market cap in seconds

In the words of the classic song.
"BCH's be crazy".
like when bch's say stuff like.
"its not pump and dump its just getting fair price".
These BCH's think all aspects of life should be like special school sports day where everyone gets a 1st place participation medal.
if anyone went into a shop to buy a watch and some sleazy  creep offered them a rolex or a fake rolex and said the fake rolex is more expensive.
What would they do?
Cheap counterfeits made by less skilled workers should never be considered to be entitled to compete with the designer labels... then get but hurt when they arent

I've edited it and added the word bitcoin a couple more times
I don't see how a post regarding bitcoin being under threat from a group of parasitic self serving ass hats is not relevant to a bitcoin community.. even if it was primarily the scum getting mentioned

hahahahah.... I love how he's reacting like someone just dropped the "N bomb"... maybe they should just "own it" and start calling it themselves but when anyone else says "bcash" they say... "hey thats our word"
