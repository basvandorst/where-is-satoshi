I'll be selling the same tshirts with just the Bitcoin logo soon, I will post the link once it is uploaded :)
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:03:06
Unfortunately not, but I think with this design it's really clear and bold
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:37:07
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:31:58
I made it a high-quality vector image so the quality is better than most other logos...
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:57:33
 for cheaper as well.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:11:53
I believe it is Tamara Bunke, the Woman Che Guevara Loved, but I am not 100% certain because it is a design from the public domain that I uploaded.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:34:49
Awesome, thanks so much it means a lot! :)
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:59:50

"and the crash could take us below 1,000."
**edit:** Just learned about what's going on here: 
My mind is changed completely, he could actually be right. How scary.

Here is the video:

Also, if you look into EOS (cryptocurrency) there are some interesting videos by Brendan Blumer where he talks about the solutions that decentralized systems create. Governments and banks are centralized systems, all centralized systems are inherently prone to corruption.

Cheers dude, at least somebody got something from it lol.

Sure, the only reason society is progressing is because of the freemarket. Governments that steal from society have hindered this progress severly and have created poverty, debt, and slavery. Bitcoin is a beautiful example of the freemarket, it was created by people within the society, not government. Without taxation, the money would go back into the pockets of society, individuals would no longer be suffering as much, increased wealth would create unfathomable amounts of opportunities for growth in all businesses, no taxes = more monies for businesses to reinvest and hire people = more jobs = more growth = more opportunity = more spending = more innovation, etc. Taxes were initially a voluntary act, and they made them mandatory only in times of war (Research why taxes exist). Eventually countries (such as the USA, surprise surprise) got into so much war and the wealthy individuals (central bankers) were making hansom profits and they realised that they could just keep entering wars and the people would continuously be forced to pay more taxes. They made it "law", the central bankers are in control of the money supply, which means they own the government. The federal reserve owns the government, the government forces people to pay tax, therefore the banks own you. UNLESS, you stop paying taxes (enter Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies). I'm sure you're the kind of person to say something like "Well hang on a minute here, what about public schools? Public hospitals? Police? These things are important!". Of course they are, but with the amount of money that the government taxes, if it was given back to the society, these hospitals and schools would be popping up through freemarket competition and the need for such businesses (people can create their own companies and businesses without the heavy taxes: e.g. private schools, hospitals, etc), and these things would be much cheaper. As for police, not only would the crime rate reduce significantly because of the reduced poverty (governments create poverty through increased taxation, inflation, etc) but local communities could contribute to a kind of community police force or private security. Just remember, societies got along just fine before taxation ever existed, and there are countries in the world that don't have tax. I know it's hard to believe because it's been drilled so much into your head, especially in America, but there is an interesting short book you can read that explains everything much better than I can. If you'd like to read it, it's called the Market for Liberty. Did I answer your question???

We should assume that governments are already tracking everyones transactions on exchanges already, nothing new here. Just the Aus government trying to threaten, intimidate, and steal more from its citizens as usual.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:09:34
Taxes are not necessary to run our society, where did you get this idea from? Societies have existed perfectly fine without governments that forcefully tax their citizens. We don't need it, total enslavement mentality.

Then it shall be forced from the bottom up.

You keep your money in cash for either exchanging value, or saving. The second is a form of investment, hoping for a larger amount of savings in the near future, this is a form of investing that is subtle and often overlooked. Fiat currencies (cash) go down in value over long periods of time as can be seen from this [easy-to-read chart.](
