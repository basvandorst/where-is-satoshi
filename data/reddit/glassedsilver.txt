I might get down-voted to oblivion in this sub for saying this, but I'd rather invest in that than Bitcoin as a long-term investment.
In the end, only invest into things you have an understanding for. Don't just trust third-parties who don't care about your long-term success, but more their short-term commission.

The metaphor is a bit weakened by the fact that the percentage of people using or even realistically being able to use Paypal is absolutely stomping the percentage of peopleable to speak on something that is basically limited to a small group being able to use the thing at any given point in time due to low capacity (seats in the studio and viewer attention) in a linear, single broadcast.

Nothing will ever change substantially until someone abuses these tools to great devastating effect on Average Joe, someone malicious outside of these agencies.
The scale has to be VERY big as well and people will, although I wish it wasn't so, have to suffer greatly.
Until then, not a thing will change, most folks will nod at the headline and think that they have nothing to hide. Same old song.
No pain, no change. Apparently all sorts of international govts sitting in your home with eyes and ears wide open isn't pain enough.

x86-64 is an extension to the x86 platform.
So yes, practically any modern desktop or laptop you buy today does in fact have an x86 CPU.
You follow very well and you know it. :P
@_date: 2018-10-17 06:34:14
ewwww fiat!
I'll see myself out...
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:06:18
Of course it does:
"Recent Intel x86 processors implement a secret, powerful control mechanism that runs on a separate chip that no one is allowed to audit or examine. [...]"
**Recent** processors. So let's see when they ditched 32bit-only:
* Atom processors you'll quickly see that you won't really find recent x86-32 computers anymore.
Whilst you could argue that older Atom processors are still being included in some more modern devices they are arguably not "recent Intel x86-processors", but at least 4 years old (Atom Cedarview D2550 with Intel 64 disabled) or at least 8 years old (Atom Diamondville Singlecore which never came with Intel 64 extension).
* Intel Core: Beginning with Core 2 they were all 64bit.
* Pentium: After Pentium 4-based CPUs there were no 32bit-only processors in their lineup and even in Pentium 4 you saw first Intel 64 CPUs being offered. All Pentium D processors were 64bit, too.
* Pentium Mobile: Their Yonah-based mobile Pentiums (lineup 2007) was their last 32bit-only offering.
* Celeron: Desktop: no more 32bit-only offerings starting with 2006 lineup.
* Celeron: Mobile: 2007 made the entire Celeron M lineup Intel 64 compatible.
* Xeon was one of their first processor lineups, if not the first to introduce Intel 64, no need checking on that.
Anything I missed?
I guess at least what's obtainable as consumer we got all of Intel's processor offerings covered now. :)

The power and impact of the internet had been severely hindered if any development and participation had to have been signed off centrally.
It's pure irony if you talk about giving everyone a tool to obtain power over their wealth and yet, at the same time complain when the establishment wants to be part of it as well...
What do you expect them to do in their position? Stay fiat-only? Not see the advantages unlike Average Joe who is supposed to adopt, strengthen and establish the system, because that is in the end of the day - like it or not - how the value of crypto - just like any tender - is determined. By how many people trust the tender to hold its value.
If anything, if establishment didn't jump on it I'd be severely worried someone out there might be cooking up something to plot against it. I just don't want crypto to have enemies, just like anything I want to rely on to hold my value so I can participate in the economy as freely and with as little to worry about as possible.
"But you can hardly hack everyone and overtake crypto!" you might say. Well yes, the block chain is one of the most powerful tools ever created to create a trusted data storage device, however what can be tampered is people's trust in crypto. Again, in the end the value of ANY tender, no matter its underlying philosophy is people's trust and acceptance.
Hell, even the same monetary value in form of a tag can still be vastly different.
A $1000 credit line on a Mastercard will be worth more than the same on an Amex card, simply because more people accept MC than Amex. (bit of a technically incorrect example, because Amex isn't really a CC, but a charge card, but you get my drift)

I will generate a SET of paper wallets with some way of backing them up safely I still have to ponder about a bit.
And to be frank, I'm baffled myself, but then again, I'm glad I eventually pulled the trigger.
I think investment in general is something you only really get to think about once daily spending etc is covered and you have some surplus of liquidity.

A hardware wallet isn't safe from fire either and yes, I'd use backups, the only problem is that any good password is a password I likely wouldn't remember, but I'll get around to coming up with a good strategy.
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:30:21
Well, looking at how more and more companies are getting into it.
Looking at how established financial institutions whose business relies on being as involved with your capital as possible are warning users left and right about how BTC "has no future". (if it doesn't why are you sending warning signals when its adoption in the market is as weak as it is compared to fiat? I smell someone feeling their interests at danger...)
I'm also looking at the potential gain versus the risk of losing a gamble, which is what all investments are if we're being honest.
Even though I'm just a student I have some money that I can invest into something. Fiat isn't exactly something that holds value very well, BTC has been steadily rising and whilst nobody in this world can promise me BTC is infalliable, nobody can say the same about the Euro. Just looking at my recent trip to the US made me realize how much of a joke fiat can be. 8 years ago my trip to the US has let me spend a lot more in NY than nowadays... I'm talking currency exchange rate here... Nothing ever is stable and setting aside 5% of my income for something that I feel may incredibly change my life vs. the risk of losing 5% of my income seems like a gamble I'm willing to take.
EVERY long-term investment is based on hope and reasonable trust, there are no guarantees with anything, just like there was never a guarantee that the money I kept in EUR would suffice to pay for my stay in NYC... I ended up spending a good chunk more over there than had I traveled twice the same year I went the first time around if you get what I mean...
The world changes  all the time, if you let that get in the way of making investments what's left is only redeeming your income into good right away and not owning ANY kind of money at all.
Which reason do I have to trust EUR more than BTC? Fiat is issues by a bank which's interest it is to keep its member states' debt in check, the more money there is for a currency that dictates a critical amount of nation's debt, the better for the states.
Guess why banks in Germany are getting costlier and costlier, more and more fees get added, etc...
Also, always remember shit like this can happen anytime:

Thanks and I'm excited already to finally be on board and get to cherish the price curve! :D
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:17:53
Oh my BTC stay where they are, don't worry. Alts day/week trading is something I'd only consider with someone knowledable to guide me after reading a lot myself. I'm not someone to jump into it just because there's 100 YT videos (with convenient ref links in the description... *cough*) that suggest to do trading for the quick buck.
Also, if I ever did get into it I'd only start small and increase purely based on my income allowing for more "play money".
I wouldn't ever risk money I cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:38:01
Well, looking at BTC's general trend there have been plenty all-time highs. Also I'm doin small deposits over time. If I get the sense the curve trends against my interest over time I can still pull out and whilst I would lose money I think it's worth the chance that I'm potentially doing a life-changing investment.
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:33:19
That is a very real problem indeed. Something to be followed closely.
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:16:42

Has is for the third person singular.
Have/has refers to the instances in that sentence, which is third person plural, hence you need to use "have".
Another way of asking the same thing basically and using has would be:
"Has there been any instance ..."
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:01:39
Well, I just want to invest into something that I already trust a lot. For long-term investment that is.
I'm not against short-term daily/monthly trades though. I would probably convert any gains back into BTC though.
Either way, reading up on that is definitely something that's on my to-do list, but I would probably stay away from diving into this before knowing someone who knows trading better than I do.
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:09:52

@_date: 2017-04-30 18:02:44
Hmhm... I've been browsing the site  every now and then when tabbing around in Chrome the past few days.
I'm even looking at getting their tamper-resistant stickers, anyone with any experience using their stickers and how accurate and thorough their advice is?
Using dumb printers and a dedicated offline OS seems like pretty good advice to begin with, but I'd probably rather use my own live CD that I verified myself.
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:54:30

What if we need to scale back energy consumption in this world drastically one day? Being able to interfere for the good cause that benefits everyone is indeed noble justice!
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:22:20
Yeah, I know to be cautious in trading, that's why I'm holding off right now and if I do enter it'll likely not be without someone else who knows a thing or two about it.
And indeed, all I'm investing right now is less than 5% of my income.
Not against raising that, but I'll probably stick to that for a while. I have some trips coming up and still need to build up a fiat reserve for a rainy day you know. It's nice having a well-paid job as student, so I'm clearing everything else first before I think about going bigger into BTC. Did want to make the initial jump finally though, so I went in to break the nasty habit of "oh well, some day I'll dig into it, I'm sure!".
Just like the good old Nike slogan: "Just do it!"
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:14:08
I'll send my coins into cold storage using a paper wallet.
Basically I'm super okay with less convenience, so a paper wallet in a safe at home is good enough for me.
Hardware can fail, so to backup a hardware wallet I'd end up having a paper wallet or some sort of print-out with restoring options either way... :)
I will use breadwallet to withdraw from exchange sites and send it into cold storage and maybe to keep some spare change accessible on my iPhone, just in case I get around to spending it on the go, doubt that'll happen anytime soon though, because I don't really live in a place where BTC are a thing for "offline" transactions.

@_date: 2017-04-30 15:08:25
Why would you favor daily deposits? I just did my first monthly one, but I'm pretty sure my May deposit is going to depend a lot less on the specific date, but on the conversion rate. I'll bite when the curve is dipping, then again it can always go up, too.
Either way, the more transaction you do, the more fees you end up paying I guess. Also finding low volume transactions on marketplaces can be iffy, an automated exchange where you buy from the site and they themselves merely accumulate coins sent to them is probably something you should look at.
The place I got my coins from was a breeze and they have a referral program too, but I'm not going to post my link publicly, just something to consider maybe in case you're well-connected or a content creator I guess.
Something else you should definitely do is sending your coins into cold storage, something like a paper wallet or a hardware wallet.
Basically, the more you want to invest and the less accessible your money needs to be, the better off you are with the "inconvenient" storage.
If you want to see numbers change (like the good old "glance at your bank account balance") just write down your BTC balance and convert that through a Google search or something every once in a while and see how your coins perform. :)

In related news, I learnt that in the US coins like these can't be sold with a balance, so you have to provide your own balance.
If we could get something similar, where the tamper-resistant sticker doesn't come applied and you just supply your own private key, that'd be amazing. Submit the public key in advance to be printed in all relevant spots.
Oh well...
I love the concept, I really do and I might get one for laughs, if the balance stays on there it's more of a bonus I guess...
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:12:18
that or a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:45:41
Well, we should extend that even more if we make hints full-blown tutorials.
Like audit the code or trust the source of the code that will generate those keys.
Or how you have to trust your printer.
And how to store paper wallets and what you can do to it getting into the wrong hands and how much the slip is worth in the wrong hands (private key encryption).
Or tamper-proof sealing to disincentivize low-level threats and have rudimentary peace of mind as long as the seal is intact.
We could go even deeper, in the end I purposely kept it short to inspire people to google and find sources they already trust.
Well that and because I don't want to repeat all the details just because I felt a reddit thread was missing one important obvious answer. (:

Bitcoin is about bringing the convenience and privacy of cash to the internet and having an alternate fiat.
If you order illegal goods through the internet, chances are the possibility of transfering money via cash are just as viable, at the very least for items where the dedication is one-off and the pay-off is huge.
It's literally just a convenience tool for gun trafficking.
CONVENIENCE, not enabler.

It's more than money to me, I quite like the concept and I can see past its function of "just another form of money".
That being said, it still DOES have this function and easy in and out is something that is of concern for me personally if we're talking about wide-spread adoption.
Basically, when I said "if you want Bitcoin to take off" I didn't mean it being impactful, which it obviously already is, but it being of very wide-spread general use, which apparently is something many bitcoiners seem to be dreaming about - and I don't mean that in a derogatory way.
I'm specifically talking about that part of success.


Fair points.


Maybe, but maybe not Bitcoin as a whole, but merely popular parts of its economy, like coin exchange sites that suddenly look like crooks, because they happen to be subject to unfavorable jurisdiction. *cough* Coinbase *cough*
Then again, it just highlights that each and every user themselves has the power to subject themselves to these parts or not.
You could theoretically use bitcoin openly and securely. You can say no to Coinbase yourself, or well... use it, but then you know what you're getting into. (provided you're educated)
So in a way, everyone can corrupt their usage themselves. Or choose to use Bitcoin in a more pure (value-oriented) manner.
I think being able to make these decisions yourself is much better than something that is practically locked down to security which could condition you not to apply common sense yourself.
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:43:15
If it was harder to get out of I wouldn't consider using it unless legally forced upon me or in very niche situations.
Why? Because I don't like my money locked into 100 boxes I can't dynamically resize as I wish, because sometimes company X wants the bill payed by Y and if my funds are in a "container" or fiat that isn't quickly converted to what company X accepts all that I will be left with is the impression that Bitcoin and my idea of investing money into it was a bad idea, because it screwed me over.
Tell me, why do you think Paypal is so successful? Because, although it's a crook of a company for many reasons, they actually let me easily transfer money.
Ease is what wins the general public.
I know it may not be beneficial to the core values of Bitcoin and that might be a fair point to argue.
Then again, I do believe the openness of Bitcoin specifically assumes that I personally know what's best to dom so practically I should be able to, if I want to, use convenient and state-sanctioned ways of handling my funds.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:30:57


read that part 10 times and come back.
Nobody says it can't be used for that. We all know it. Just like cash man.
It's just another way of doing this. But if you consider that there's a mass murderer who's willing to take his life and he's okay buying the gun shortly before his action the tracking of electronic classic cash isn't going to do shit.
So practically speaking, the effect is nilch.

It obviously is commonly used to refer to weapons that are reserved to be legally used by military.
You may not like the term, but you got what I was trying to say I'm sure, so there's that.

Regulated, not banned.
You can get a permit in Germany for pretty much any non-military-grade weapon for civil purposes.
You're going to get checked, your ownership is dependent on you sticking to the rules and storing your weaponry and ammunition properly and you're not going to get to carry it any way you like.
Military-grade weapons are banned though, much like you can't just own a tank that's still fully functional. (you could however own a tank which's weapons have been altered useless)

Breaking news: people actually happen to be upset about politics, but then don't vote change.
People ARE KNOWINGLY VOTING CORRUPT ASSHATS INTO POWER.
That's the problem.
Nothing happens if you're one of many in a scheme that scams and it's almost a running joke to the point of public neglection.

Of course guns are enablers. Enablers of quantity.
Yes, you can stab a couple of people maybe. But then?
Case in point: If someone wants to kill people, there will ALWAYS be a way, so what are you pledging for now?
Maybe we should just acknowledge that in this case for example, gun regulation and transfer of funds weren't the problem.
He could have paid with cash and the gun he obtained was illegal (meaning, no law failed in actuality here, maybe controls by law enforcement, but we all know you can't catch all illegal goods and eventually he would have gotten his desired gun most of the time)
No, in this case apparently society failed, we produced one more person that turned crazy to the point of taking hostile revenge.
Those are systematic and granted, political and social problems.
Chances of fixing that? I don't know. I doubt there's that much political will, because it's costly to fix the issues at root.
It's much easier to slap out good old law and order ideology - namely trying to fight the "killer games" and whatnot. (Thomas de Mezière already mentioned that in a recent interview again. Boy, a blast from the past. I hoped we had overcome this long debunked argument)
It's cheaper, too.
Social change is costlier than some lipstick regulation to make it seem like you're doing a lot.
And since these shootings are fairly rare in Germany, one could even argue they may be as low as they will ever get no matter how great a society works out as a whole.
I doubt you can really reach a point where this never happens, much like it's practically impossible to have a working democratic society with actual full employment.

Everyone who's part of the crypto circle, Average Joe still only knows about Bitcoin, maybe has heard of some older altcoins in some rerun of a 2015 TV documentary.
If you are like me you see a lot of future crypto users on the streets and very few who statistically are part of the gang right now.

It's early in the morning after a long night shift, I'm surprised I didn't screw up my comment more.
Thanks for pointing it out, fixed it. :)

Well, if you'd have read my reply in full you'd see I'm specifically talking about gun trafficking.
Anyhow, this is just going to be a back and forth of explaining previous replies from here on out. I've said what I wanted to say.
PS: Yes, it makes certain illegal activities easier, so does cash in the real world and I oppose getting rid of either bitcoin or cash, because I don't want my every damn transaction to be trackable.
You don't need to do illegal shit to feel uncomfortable about that, especially us Germans take privacy quite seriously.

By using fiat you're constantly exposed to inflation.
By using banks at all you will eventually ALWAYS pay fees, they don't operate on air and love and try their best to have fees apply to as much as they can get away with.
So either way, you pay for using fiat.

Dude, I got you. It's a poor term and your question obviously is rhetorical at this point. We all understand and I very much agree that pretty much whatever you're looking to regulate is military-grade.
Maybe military-exclusive is a term that makes you happier?

Those things are great for people already convinced of Bitcoin.
If you want Bitcoin to take off, you need those state-sanctioned ways of easily transferring funds in and out of Bitcoin.
As long as cash is more flexible than Bitcoin, which it is, don't lie to yourself, it will always be a consideration for the general public.

Pondering if I should invest in Karma or BTC now...

Ethereum's main focus is decentralized applications and smart contracts, the currency is a welcome, lucrative and (so far) working currency.
Also I'm not sure why Ethereum's infancy problems are rated so highly in contrast to Bitcoin.
Either way, diversification is key. And don't invest too much, if you're like me it's "play money".
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:54:17
Not sure what the fuck I wrote there.
But aye, German.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:15:31
Which makes it a good coin for diversification and to replace some of the fiat you lug around with inflation.
