They are holding everyone BCC and now allowing to withdraw.They should have told that before opening BCC deposit and trading.

I withdrawn from main balance.Never traded anything.just deposited BCC and then changed my mind and withdrawn it.Been waiting since then.even asked support to cancel the withdrawal since it's taking too long and they denied and told to wait.

I read it they never sent the any tx to me. My BCC deposit has 11 confirms.They accept 2 confirms for deposit and withdraw and i am not alone.Check their twitter/fb. People are waiting for their BCC withdraw from 21 hours so yeah it feels like an Exit SCAM
