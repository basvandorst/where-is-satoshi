Live stats.  Also anecdotally I don't know a single person who doesn't use Facebook.  I can't stand Facebook but that's reality.

Because they know it's going to dip on China news anyway so they pull out and rebuy.

Wow, what a cringey read.  Including by OP.

Majin Vegeta's M looks more like Monero though.

Oh yeah, owning 6 homes is totally living like you're poor.

You play runescape.  Your argument is invalid.

Considering most sites only allow a few security question attempts before locking you out and sending you an email, it's not that easy to brute force.

I think it's likely OCD.

hahahaa.  We live in interesting times.

I think it's related to the hot water example you gave more than anything.  I responded to you but I live frugally.  I drive a $1500 moped, don't eat out, have a cheap cell plan, I moved from Chicago to the suburbs to cut down on my rent and I don't wear expensive clothes.  I have a nice computer and computer chair because all of my work is done at my desk.   If I found myself stressing about something like hot water usage though... I would probably check myself in to a mental institution.

Eh honestly though I don't agree with him I'd say the concept of slavery is pretty subjective.

Fashion?  That looks like a work shirt.  Doubt it will change much in only a few years.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:50:26
Exactly.  Not to mention it's pretty likely Chinese people are still carrying plenty of BTC.

Laughing at everyone who said "5k will be the psychological barrier" a few weeks ago.

The thing is you're picking and choosing.  It's so irrelevant and batshit crazy to be conservative with something as cheap as hot water.  You know another really sweet way to save money?  Not having 5 kids.
