Exactly!  A painting doesn’t have intrinsic value either.
(That's the point.)

What can I do with a bitcoin, without at some point exchanging it for something else... This is the crux of intrinsic value in this context.
Bitcoin has neither intrinsic nor fiat value.... it is entirely dependent upon individual acceptance of it because it's guaranteed by nothing and is not itself a consumable thing.
If tomorrow everyone stops using bitcoin, you are completely screwed.  If tomorrow every merchant refuses cash, the dollar (or Yen or Yuan or Ruble or whatever other government backed currency) will not suddenly evaporate in value because it is the underlying currency in which ALL of those transactions are denominated.

The examples you cite all have an intrinsic value.   You can consume heroin or alcohol in and of themselves. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

That *means* it has no intrinsic value.  You can already use FEDWIRE (in the US) or SWIFT (international currency transfers^(1)) across more banking systems than bitcoin.  But Bitcoin itself cannot in itself be consumed. No government backs it, so at some point those goods and services exist in economies with currencies.  Bitcoin has neither intrinsic value nor fiat value...
My point is: Because I can't consume it directly, and because no government guarantees its value, it is extremely susceptible to volatility and therefore unreliable as a medium of exchange.
Additionally physical capital that you are purchasing or selling with virtual capital still has to be moved physically.  Bitcoin doesn't make this easier.  Once you ship those goods, are paying the shipper in Bitcoin? Not if it's Fedex you're not.  Is the shipment insured in Bitcoin? No.  Are the customs fees paid in Bitcoin ? No. Are the tariffs paid in Bitcoin? No.
So the only thing bitcoin is reasonably good for is under the table transactions, which means that any time a dark web operation gets raided, Bitcoin exchanges will shut down, Bitcoin will plummet, and suddenly you're wishing you'd held on to the tangible goods you sold for bitcoin.
1. I have accounts in the U.S., Canada, and U.K., and move money between them regularly.  I could not as easily, securely and safely move Bitcoin....  I'd be at the mercy of unregulated individuals or entities with zero accountability to me.

A solution that passes on the costs of the inadequacies to the user of the system in the form of fees proves its uselessness as a medium of exchange.  Currency is already backed by the "full faith and credit" clause of Article IV, Section 1 of the Constitution.  Bitcoin is a great gamble, but it's not useful as a currency unless a government backs it.
Also, I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "fiat".  To declare something "by fiat" means something has a value because the government says it does.  The "fiat" in "fiat currency" is the full faith and credit of the United States that Federal Reserve Notes are recognized as legal tender.
**Put another way:** The only reason bitcoin has any value at all is because it is exchanged for other fiat currencies.  In other words, its value is entirely dependent on existing fiat currencies.  If tomorrow the governments of the world agreed mutually that Bitcoin cannot be exchanged for any currency, or traded on any kind of exchange by investors whose net worths are denominated in some kind of fiat currency, every major investor would back out immediately and the value of bitcoin would plummet to nothing.
Bitcoin cannot replace these currencies itself  without the "fiat" part—the government minting, regulating, and backing it.
