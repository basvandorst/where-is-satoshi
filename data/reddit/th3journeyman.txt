It looks like they've just crawled a bunch of businesses using wallets that don't generate new addresses for each transaction. I'd imagine it's far more advanced than that, but there are a lot of unidentified addresses.

Isn't that essentially what Ulbicht did? Create a content agnostic market? The feds took him down without so much as a cease and desist letter.

Um.... that's just wrong.
Of course people administer, control and issue the currencies. The mine administrators and developers control what goes into the source code, and miners most certainly generate the currency. Denying this is like denying the Fed prints dollars.

I'm not sure what you're saying, by citing the document's definition of transmission, which isn't mentioned in the parts I've cited.
As an aside, though, the exemption that allows consumers and businesses to conduct business solely for the purchase/sale of goods or services would have to be interpreted strictly for it to contain any teeth. Technically, stocks/bonds/securities are all a good, in a sense. So, by the nature of that exemption, we can see that it's actually a fairly narrow exemption that forces businesses that accept bitcoin to use it solely as a currency network and move their money back into dollars immediately afterwards.
I'm not saying a court would necessarily see it this way, but it is a very reasonable interpretation of that section of the law, imo.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:31:35
Sort of. 
"merchants and consumers that utilize Virtual Currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services."
That's a very very exempt phrase, and it means that, according to the law, if I use bitcoin also for savings or something, then I'm in violation of not having a license.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:39:50
"License required. No Person shall, without a license obtained from the superintendent as provided in 
this Part, engage in any Virtual Currency Business Activity."
So....none of us can (legally) transact in bitcoin in the state of New York or with a New York resident without a license. Funny how this is a common sense regulation for bitcoin, but dollars get off easy.
Written like a true dictator.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:26:08
I'd agree with this, with the addition that, considering the ruling the IRS just made about bitcoin being treated as property, there is the potential for substantial regulatory burden that comes with BTC.
For example, just that one IRS decision means that, for FY2013, you have to do a capital gains calculation every time you purchased something with BTC. That's a massive amount of paperwork for a company to undergo.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:41:58
Alright, well you should have cited 200.2.n for a definition of Virtual Currency Business Activity for that, and I'll cede the point that, as a consumer, I'm not directly affected by this.
However, 200.2.n.5 means miners and developers have to get a license, and 200.2.n.4 means services like Bitpay have to get a license to do business in NY or with a resident. So, in one fell swoop, the grassroots nature of bitcoin mining is completely gone.
Edit: In the state of NY, obviously, and 200.2.n.5 is what kills the grassroots/open source nature of bitcoin.

Well, keeping your data secure in a distributed storage system is fairly simple. As long as they don't have the key you used to encrypt it, it'll be impractical for them to crack the encryption in a single case, and impossible to do it on all your data, assuming you use unique keys.
For computation, though, they have to be able to actually read the data, and keeping that data secure while the program is working on it will probably end up being impossible, in a technical sense.
Aside from that, if it's a complicated computation you want to do, and it's on large datasets, figuring out how to make sure that the distributed parts of the algorithm have access to the data will also probably be an issue. Figuring out how to breakdown the algorithm to be distributed is also pretty complicated.
File storage is pretty straightforward. You put part A on these three servers, part B on these five, etc. Computation is massively more complicated.

Yeah, that's my basic understanding of what he was saying. It's interesting, though, because this is the justification Bernanke/Yello/Draghi/etc have been giving in order to justify their money printing. Maybe they know something we don't about the health of the economy.

He does an alright job, actually, and I think his opinion probably carries the most weight in today conversation on inflation and deflation.

So, I guess, at its default usage at least, the blockchain would be more anonymous than this because it doesn't include business addresses in the metadata.

My main point in posting this is to provide more data to the notion that gold may not be the bulwark that the world retreats to when the dollar economy collapses under the weight of America's debt.
This leads into the next point, which is that Bitcoin may be the replacement.
I just figured this might add some more to people's arsenal of arguments when discussing Bitcoin's place in the future.

Do you disagree?

I think he was using fiat loosely there. He precedes that statement by discussing companies that issue currency backed by stamps. That's not a fiat currency either. Thus, what he is saying is that these currencies are fiat in that people are declaring they will accept them as currency.

Roger Ver himself declared that he's not opposed to SegWit in the recent Core v Unlimited discussion. He just views it as PART of the long term scaling solution, while Bitcoin has very serious scaling problems going on right now that can only be solved by increasing the blocksize.

There's a product called Storj that is still in beta, but is using blockchain tech to decentralize storage. I've talked with one of the founders, and he says he'd love to do computation as well. However, that's much more complicated and at least a few years away before he would consider trying to solve that problem.
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:59:30
I just want to jump in and say this title is hyperbole. The patch will still be put into the public repo, after critical nodes have upgraded, and those nodes can request to see the diffs to the code directly.
Best practice? Obviously not. Ideally, the bug would have been caught in review. Closed source? Not exactly.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:08:11
Johnny states in the talk that SegWit would provide an immediate 30% boost to throughput right now. Roger immediately responds with "That's not nearly enough". Considering that the network started consistently choking on transactions in Nov and we've seen a ~20% growth in volume since then, I think Ver means 30% isn't enough of a boost to make a long term difference. It would provide very short term relief.
In the middle term, if everybody uses SegWit and we get that 70% boost, that would probably last 8 months, if recent growth trends continue.
SW took six months from the first commit to release, and is way less complicated than LN. SW is not enough to prevent throughput issues from cropping up again well before LN can make a difference.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:17:16
I only skimmed the article, but I don't understand why you would characterize what he's saying as "lies". His position, even in this article, is that we need to figure out on-chain scaling before we move on to off chain scaling so that Bitcoin can survive to the point where LN becomes necessary or mature enough to make an impact.
Everywhere I've looked, Ver has consistently stated that he has no problem with adding SegWit or LN. He simply wants to make sure that we don't kill Bitcoin in the interim (can add SW later) or unnecessarily censor transactions (transaction increases need to be automated so the system can scale with demand).

Asking to understand how AsicBoost is a hack is dishonest? Like I said, this is why is as popular as it is.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:11:07
It's an honest question and an honest point. Maxwell's post simply assumes that AsicBoost is a hack, without explaining HOW it is a hack, which is the topic of this post.
Responses like yours are the reason that is as popular as it is. Belittling curious people is not how you win friends and influence people.

I don't think this would end up being a shouting match. The Ver vs Tone discussions were really interesting to me and clarified a lot of the arguments on both sides of the issue, and those did not end up being shouting matches.
This entire division exists partly because of how little Core and BU thought leaders talk to each other in a public forum like those discussions. You and him simply explaining your POV to each other would do a lot to help bridge the gap.
Obviously, I'm a nobody in this discussion, but I don't think you should discount the usefulness of such a debate/discussion. We need consensus, and simply calling each other names and trying to destroy credibility (vs actually discussing ideas) will not get us there.

I personally know the guys at BitPay. They are pivoting their business to s3t up services for large banks that want to use blockchain tech. It's all hush hush, as that's literally every detail I can get out of them.
Also, they're on a significant hiring spree right now.
So, I'd say they're doing okay.

You're innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. That money is yours until it's shown that it's illegal.
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:16:41


Excepting very specific circumstances, money is not evidence. Bank statements are evidence. The blockchain is evidence. In fact, with Bitcoin, there is no need in any capacity to seize the coins for evidence.


You're comparing apples and oranges and pineapples. The apple is your example. In that case, the police would seize the vehicle as evidence, because it actually is evidence. Also, ownership can be easily attributed by running the VIN.
The orange is when a citizen has allegedly robbed somebody of money, at which point some sort of escrow should be considered, to ensure the money is still there for either party. However, an exception should be made for the defense of the accused, as the right to due process is sacred for a truly free society.
Finally, there's Ross's case, where no property was ever stolen by him. At this point, until the trial is over, 100% of that money is his, to use as he sees fit. Measures to confiscate property prior to a guilty verdict can only be viewed as an attempt to hamstring the defense of the accused.
I'd appreciate a lack of strawmen, going forward.
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:22:06


Really, that's been proven in court? Or are you one of those people who view due process as a formality on the road to the divinely ordained punishment of those who do evil?


@_date: 2015-10-06 17:07:50
What if it just looks like I was caught red handed, and that was actually my money? Should the police seize the funds that would otherwise have been used to procure a good lawyer for my defense and allow me to walk free? This is a FAR more relevant question than yours, given the bullying nature of prosecution.
The outcome of a trial can never truly be known before it has been reached, and it is of vital importance that we treat individuals as innocent until proven guilty.
Secondly, let's say that I was actually guilty. I would know this fact. As a result, I would have to be crazy to actually give away even only a significant part of the money, unless I had an escape plan or felt by doing so I could purchase a legal defense that would probably result in being cleared of all charges.
Third, in the specific case of Ross Ulbricht, he was not guilty of theft. He was guilty of making voluntary transactions that a certain collection of thugs and busybodies didn't like. Thus, allowing him to retain his money, especially for legal expenses, is not anywhere close to the moral quandary you proposed. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 19:31:07
Apparently, I haven't been paying attention. Could you explain this?
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:38:28


Because somebody's property or body has been damaged, taken, or threatened. 


And he should be compensated.


You seem to be forgetting the operative term here, which is due process. Detaining a suspect so they don't run off is one thing. Seizing all assets without so much as a grand jury, as was done in the case of The Silk Road, is quite another. Detaining a suspect requires they be publicly charged AND shown to be a flight risk/danger to society, in order to deny bail. I can't find an article stating what legal ordinance gave them the right to seize Ross's funds.

Also, no they didn't. They were in the initial indictment and dropped after the judge denied Ulbricht bail and the initial media storm died down.
5 of 6 of them have been completely removed, and the last one was deliberately left out of the trial and has not been pursued.
