Yup, I got in young too. I have been programming since I was in 4th grade and invested in Bitcoin in 2013. I sadly can't mine because expensive electricity makes  it  impractical. But I've found other ways to make money.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:58:44
I understand. Anything I can't explain is magic. Now I have about 1000 ICOs I don't understand to invest in.

Not even the original UASF people wanted to raise the block limit by THIS much. This is not helping decentralize bitcoin, it's tearing the network apart. Your coin will soon be unminable by anyone except major companies so good luck with your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:54:23
Yes after analysis I've realized that if you look at who is behind Bitcoin Cash on the PR side of things its mainly Bitcoin Unlimited people, whose project failed.So all I can think is that this is a chance for them to revive their dead project and get large groups back on their side under a different name. Someone should make a youtube video about this.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:38:12
I disagree I think that new chains are a display of free will of the Bitcoin community and how anyone can have an opinion and as long as some people share that, you can disagree and make that idea happen. Besides this is the wild wild west, most laws don't matter here on the blockchain, you can launder money as long as you call it tumbling, you can hide your identity, and pretty much nobody cares.

It takes about 5 minutes to set up a cc. Basically they send 2 small confirmation chrages to your card and you enter the amounts they you can only spend 200 dollars a day at first unless you completely multiple verfication steps, then the limit is raised to 10,000 a day.

Yup. And my point is that a few of us Bitcoin investors have a lot of money, we can totally get a rocket in space. Oh yes I forgot to include the cost to paint a giant sign on the side of the rocket that says fuck Bitcoin Cash. So who wants to donate? :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:41:37
Alright I did the research, I full sized rocket is about 500 million dollars. So all we need to do is raise that, plus a flag of course to put on the moon, and of course a paper wallet to tape to that flag. Sounds feasible.

Ya know I've always wondered what's keeping me from just sending a buisness a fee that I know wont get confirmed and them essentially just getting my money back in like a week after the transaction is dropped from the network. Then I remembered I want them to KEEP accepting Bitcoin.

Mmmmmm. Yaaaaaaa he meant the OTHER Bitcoin sorry. Your going to have to pay a 40 dollar transaction fee to me so that I can connect you to them.

What about this
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:33:07
Ah I see, thanks for taking the time to write a thorough explanation. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:58:38
I just want to send $140 to Exodus, but the fee is 10 dollars. Bitcoin shouldn't be used yet mainstream and I'm tired of people saying it should, Altcoins are testnets to test ideas, Bitcoin will be the finished product. We need another 4 or 5 years of real innovations before Bitcoin is truly useful yet.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:50:27
Alright well at that point there are a few factors to consider so I'm going to break it down to help you out. Just think of these questions: How long are you holding your cryptocurrencies? How portable do you want it to be? How many currencies are you holding? Do you care about simplicity? If you are holding for a long time and want your coins secure for 5-10 years consider the Trezor. If you want to use your coins more often and experiment with different coins although the Trezor supports multiple currencies the ledger is better. Now the UI is kind of preference but honestly I prefer the Ledger UI. Also consider if you plan on carrying this around, which one do you like the look of better, their both about the same size so don't worry about that but some people may worry about looks. So in short if you want a safe I think the trezor is really good at that, very secure. But if you want to experiment a bit and you want a more versatile wallet, the ledger is your top pick. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:42:14
Thank you! Any educated person who has any knowledge of computer software and even the slightest idea how Segwit works is. The only people I've seen who are anti Segwit are either spitting out uneducated insults that make no sense about Segwit, or they have no concept of how mining works and they think they are helping miners by making it harder for them to mine their coin. Good to see we aren't alone. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:33:50
Ya that's what I though of, but it seems like there are people who want to go all the way with lighting network and become dependent on it, I just hope they release some real code soon so we can shut up the BCashers.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:34:47
Hmm layers of Bitcoin, kind of like... Segwit. Join the right side of the fight my friend, the future is layered.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:45:17
That sounds like a bug to me, sounds like devs need to be worried about that in case something happens in a breakthrough in decryption technology. We need to do a better job future proofing.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:47:46
I'm not worried about script kiddies more than governments and banks.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:49:19
People never understand this. There is an actual supply of new Bitcoin and that is what creates part of the cost of bitcoin. The factors that contribute to the value of Bitcoin are: Hardware costs to miners for maintaining hardware, electrical costs, the supply of new coins into the network, and of course the value investors give it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:01:48
That's sounds like a really great idea! I wish I could do it if I didn't live in such a dangerous area. But what do you do if it's a slow crypto week?
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:44:52
Its always funny when I see what are peaks because then you look back after 3 months and realize how little that was. Just hold my my friend, soon we will all be rich.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:40:11
I'll do that as soon as you can tell me which one is the real bitcoin, I'm so confused.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:12:15
Nope. Segwit isn't even active yet, just locked in so it's assured to be active.

Well I'm a miner and I just think that sounds immoral and not at all like that Satoshi's dream their always going on about. It sounds to me like they are exploiting the system secretly and they don't want to admit it.

Oh ya man! Do you know the story of Bitcoin Pizza Day? Since I can't talk to you in real time and you only have 10 dollars I'm going to assume you don't so here it is: A man bought 2 pizzas in 2010 for 10,000  Bitcoins, at the time only about 40 dollars, now those 10,000 Bitcoins would be worth 40,000,000 dollars. So one day my friend.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:15:46
Don't cry during the correction. But congratulations. Now get that money out of coinbase and on a Hardware wallet.

@_date: 2017-08-10 02:17:48
No I understand. I've been reading up on it I was just worried because I've heard a lot of BCash supporter propaganda about how Lightning Network is vulnerable and we were all idiots. It's good to know that Reddit still has douche canoes who can't take a joke thought.

Thank you my friend, much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:20:15
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. There are 2 bitcoins both claiming to be the real Bitcoin and both bring up mildly decent points, now there might be 3 coins, then the moral of the lightning network, and the argument for block size and even pruning the blockchain, only a month blockchain. So yes I'm confused what do I do?!
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:20:32
That's true, that's true. But maybe you could run an Ethernet cord down the pole and to a nearby wifi repeater.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:00:29
Well ya it does matter. I don't quite follow your logic of of how our money should be controlled beucasr the places we send it to are. I don't think we share the same dream for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:10:37
Status is an app, bitmessage is only on desktop, but it's a lot more anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:32:47
Yes it would be faster mining, but the part about public keys is what I am worried about as well. It would literally break bitcoin, which is why I think just for safety we should upgrade and add a stronger defense.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:29:33
Ya I hope this works, hopefully they will release it soon enough but it's better to release a working product late than a broken product quick.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:32:58
Here's one: $ for $hitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:28:25
Best thing to do is wait. Transactions will drop after about 3 days and then you can resend it with a higher transaction fee. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:11:17
No way to cancel it but you can override the transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:22:53
I don't think so, Bitcoin is a huge targets for governments, and quantum computing as I mentioned could come as soon as in the next 2 or 3 years. SHA-256 also has been suspected of being crackable by quantum computers, and besides, why not upgrade? It would put us on par with other altcoins that have already though about this.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:34:32
....good explanation.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:57:38
There is bitmessage, and I suppose you could include status, but bitmessage is better imo.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:15:13
To be fair this is technically what we wanted, a large audience to be attracted to Bitcoin.

However it shows how fast this tech is advancing, so why aren't people even slightly worried about 3-4 years down the road. I mean why wait until then when we can future proof our coin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:07:32
Easily the ledger Nano S. Its the simplest and cheapest of the the main wallets. There are other options like the Trezor but I prefer the Ledger purely for its size and discreteness. It cost about 70 dollars and they accept bitcoin at their main page. You can also pick one up at the bitcoin store.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:24:56
Well they accept my card. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:45:13

@_date: 2017-09-03 04:29:58
Also if you look at the phycology of human, we like things in 3s so if we hear 3 good things in a row about something we are more likely to like it. So we have crossing 1k this year(1). Segwit activation (2). crossing 5000(3). So when this happens people will have 3 good memories about Bitcoin, triggering a better response about it, and of course only good things come after this, atomic swaps, lightning network, Blockstream's satillite, and the list carries on!

@_date: 2017-09-03 15:32:47
I don't care, the price will overall continue up, market cap must rise to compete with similar currencies, if you can't handle dips even with knowledge that the price will continue up, you should probably leave. That being said things will fall, people will lose money being dumb, but at the end of the year I'll walk away with profit.
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:20:49
2020, the whole store.
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:43:48
I completely agree with your lesson but only semi agree with your claims, it is possible that this will drop but I highly doubt that Bitcoin will drop over the course of years, especially when you think of it like this, Bitcoin is at the current moment a traded asset, so why isn't it being used as a currency like it was supposed to be? Because the market cap is so low that you can make so much money trading because there isn't enough volume to supply the world with Bitcoin, which is why the price will continue to rise now that people realize this. So now you have to look at everything that is coming to Bitcoin: lighting network, atomic swaps, different side chains that could so incredible things, Bitcoin may dip, but it's known for volatility, it won't die.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:06:56

As with literally every other dip the answer is always yes.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:15:31
Reading this was entertaining, you see most people right now see Bitcoin as a store of value, or as we call it, "Digital Gold." Bitcoin's market cap must continue to grow so that more people are able to hold more value so that it can be used as a currency in the future. But for now, while the market cap is still rising we use it to hold the value of our money since fiat falls in value. So right now it is an investment in the future of money, not money at this very moment.

Honestly it would be great but it's highly unlikely, I've seen the charts and I don't think it will go that low. If it's China than it will go away after people realize how much drama China caused, if it's a head and shoulder tend than this is the bottom.
