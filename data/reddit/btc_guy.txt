They have a mining page as well

A market maker lets their order sit open on the order book. A market taker's order is executed instantly against a market maker's order. Every trade is a match between a maker and a taker.

It's definitely implemented, it was shown in CNBC this morning.

It's great to see a16z throwing down some more bets in the space

1 bit = 0.001 btc... I think your conversion is off
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:20:48
Yes, exactly.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:58:45
How is 21 not the best funded miner?
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:39:03
Do you have a link?
@_date: 2015-09-01 13:51:43
Barclays announced yesterday they're accepting it.

How were cct shown to be weak? I saw that they require more cpu cycles per transaction but the crypto appeared to be fine.
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:19:05
Just add +coinbase to the address, so name becomes name+coinbase You can still receive emails but now you can tell where they're coming from.

There's no way his lawyers will let him discuss details about the case online haha.
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:03:22
If you're solo mining and getting 0.1 btc per day, it would take ~250 on average to find one block. The expected returns are petty close to identical with significantly less variability in pooled mining.
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:40:47
It's silly to critique a 24hr average with an arbitrary number. It broke 1PH on the 24hr estimate. Obviously it won't break any of the larger averages for another few days. What is the point of stating the obvious that a larger average hasn't broken 1PH yet.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:39:24
I agree with you, but to be fair the Internet was originally created as a military communication network
@_date: 2013-06-14 13:54:27
Ugh, they really need to straighten out the miner / MSB situation. The current guidance is pretty ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-10-10 13:40:29
Wow... As crappy as this is for the people involved, and the complete lack of morals by the person that wrote it... It's still pretty genius
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:51:34
The recent FinCEN guidance explicitly described virtual currencies in a way that made it clear they were talking about bitcoin. They need to be registered as an MSB to exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:03:56
Wow, this is actually way bigger news than the first Baidu announcement
@_date: 2013-08-02 15:48:17
Your quote makes it look like this was from the article, which it is not.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:29:04
There were two separate accounts that were seized. This one wasnt Dwolla.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:18:35
You completely ignored the part of the presentation where he said exchanges are basically fully legal now. Considering that the US has stonewalled exchanges so far, this is a huge advantage for china.
@_date: 2013-06-20 19:30:37
The main problem is that's not really actionable... If you actually want to exchange money you need to pick one exchange. It's possible that you can do a volume weighted average, but what would you get from that?
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:05:52
It's not surprising given the low volatility lately. Lets see what happens if that picks up again.
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:26:20
504 blocks is pretty arbitrary. On the 24hr average, which OP is using, it broke 1 PH. That seems pretty reasonable.
The longer you smooth out the speed the lower it will be.

When a company IPOs in bitcoin, the funds raised are usually used for operating the company. They aren't getting anything in return for selling shares if you still retain your full bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:56:37
How useful will this be for people that don't use bitcoinj? Do most companies use that?
@_date: 2013-05-23 03:37:10
The author said in months.... February was a few months ago son.
@_date: 2013-06-29 22:49:40
What evidence is there that "Millhouse" was solely responsible for these moves as he claims? It seems likely that adding these coins on exchanges would have a significant increase on price regardless of his opaque actions.
@_date: 2013-09-20 17:33:02
Cool application of SSS, but why not just have shareholders vote by registering addresses and sending small transactions instead of co-signing one?
@_date: 2013-09-28 03:36:54
You said they issue 100 shares for 100btc. The issuer needs to spend that 100 btc to operate the business. That 100 btc no longer available to refund if they collapse.
@_date: 2013-06-22 23:41:36
Clearly did not listen to the podcast, or read TGB's post
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:17:59
What's the take-away? Bit messages can be associated with IP addresses if a goes to a compromised website?
@_date: 2013-10-02 01:03:06
I don't understand how exchanges can expect to launch without a market maker onboard, or a maker / taker model.
@_date: 2013-08-19 19:36:26


Bit-coin... Cringe
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:28:09
Since the number of coins mined constantly increase they will need to continuously add more
@_date: 2013-07-19 16:07:24
2 months late but at least it's shipping.. Should still make a good return.
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:27:52
" However, they stated they would look negatively on such a service, but they wouldn’t be able to legally take action against it as is."
What does look negatively mean? That they're waiting for torbroker to slip up somewhere else?
@_date: 2013-05-22 12:09:11
Most likely acting as a cash interface for bitcoin transfers. Deposit cash at one location, they transfer bitcoin instead of using the the existing payment network, and your friend can pick up the cash at another location. Also, just acting as a cash exchange  where you can buy and sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:06:58
It's pretty weird how well all those curves match... I'm curious how this looked after the 2011 bubble.
@_date: 2013-07-11 12:53:03
You shouldn't be leaving money on exchanges, to mitigate that risk.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:42:43
What is this change?
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:22:57
Haha! I guess that's why my spell checker didn't pick that up.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:32:45
What is this based on?
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:13:12
To be fair, she wouldn't have done any of those things when Facebook and amazon were as young as bitcoin is.... Not to say bitcoin doesn't have growing to do, but it doesn't happen overnight.
@_date: 2013-08-26 19:30:14
It has nothing to do with funding in bitcoin. It's about funding it through an unlicensed security and then using that company to defend intellectual property
@_date: 2013-08-16 15:25:23
The point of the article was that it's going to become centralized... I don't understand what your comment is saying
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:14:24

Pegging a deflationary currency to an inflationary one... That makes no sense haha
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:03:49
Considering how few people have been able to get fiat out, I'm surprised this much volume is trading on it at all
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:58:19
How are you going to enforce a legal copyright using an illegally created security? The SEC would shoot this down as soon as it got to court.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:09:47
It's crazy looking through this and seeing the obvious power grabs. Hopefully the CFTC doesn't prove that the US government can't keep track of it's arms and legs.

*Analyzes - can't correct post titles... ugh
edit: Nevermind.

Really? It seems normal to you to be sitting on a ball during an interview?
@_date: 2013-08-02 15:17:27
This was stated in the article... And the later is just conjecture.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:00:48
Just a heads up... The site runs really slow on an iPhone 5 on 4G... Waited a min for it to load and gave up
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:26:51
The scary part is it would probably only take 1/100th as much money as that right now.
@_date: 2013-06-18 13:24:07
Need to define what short, middle, and long are since people have very different perspectives.
@_date: 2013-07-11 12:50:37
An order thAt isn't shipping yet is a pre-order...
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:52:27
People said that in 2011 and it went &lt;$4... It's scary when its that low
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:40:20
What's the downside to open sourcing this?
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:50:29
Both NY and CA regulators have not approved bitcoin exchanges, which is why everyone is launching as non-us for the time being. They are not approving these companies, nor telling them what they can do to be approved... Just sitting on the applications
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:57:56
It's not official

There was a DDoS issue fixed in 0.8.4. You will probably be fine if you upgrade.

It was on Tuesday... If they're going to post videos it usually takes a couple weeks

Wow... I wish I had ASICMiner shares. Any idea what the dividend will be?
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:16:59
In their network growth numbers they're not considering the fact that ASICMiner sold thousands of blades and USBs. They had the ability to control a lot more of the network if they wanted. Additionally, they're rolling out a v2 of the blades that should be even more impressive.... 160 TH in a few months isn't as ridiculous as it may sound
@_date: 2013-05-28 01:50:45
The reply wasn't actually the tip bot
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:32:03
Don't basically all wallets have to be open source? No one should trust their money to a program that can steal all or their funds.
@_date: 2013-08-20 16:03:40
Seems like google likes investing in "open source" projects like ripple and buttercoin that end up going private
@_date: 2013-08-25 15:05:18
They can still use it if it were banned.
@_date: 2013-07-17 13:06:45
I'm fairly certain those are self-deleted... Moderator deleted posts don't stay up. I think reddit keeps them so reply chains are still visible.
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:49:32
Holy crap, did you guys hear Mt Gox had one of their accounts frozen?
@_date: 2013-08-16 12:54:21
The info in that video was a year old and nothing has happened so far
