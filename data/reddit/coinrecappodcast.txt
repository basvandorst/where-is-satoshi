Thats certainly not good advice, especially if buying a large amount. I would feel safe with 2 confirmations, 1 is pushing it, zero is out of the question.

Dms is essentially a compressed archive file. Depending on what info is in there, you may just have a shell.

I recently listen to a podcast where they stated they couldnt afford a bitcoin so they bought litecoin instead.
I know this sentiment is very real.
Adoption is growing thanks to people like you. Just wanted to share my gratitude for actually spreading awareness and correct information to the uninformed majority.

I cant dig too far into the block explorer at the moment, but 50k transactions for an address serving this purpose since 2013 seems like a low amount. Is there a discrepancy or a break in the transaction dates anywhere? That info could give a clue or two to unravel the mystery.
Edit14: words.

I respect people like you immensely. 
Just wanted to say thanks for your actual effort in helping growth by adoption.

If I had to guess, I would say that multibit saved it as DMS under the assumption that it would be faster &amp; take up less space as a save file, and that the coding wouldnt be a problem since multibit could read and open the file extension. Have you tried the electrum wallet fix to read it?

Hey it's me, ur change you wanted to see in the world.

He says it's because after you take away tax evasion money laundering purposes, there's very little use case.
&amp;he correctly predicted the "crash" in December because of the same reasons...
Apparently it's 2014 all over again. You'd think Harvard economists would be a little bit more thorough in their research, &amp;a teeny tiny itsy bitsy bit more intelligent.
Using a distributed public ledger for tax evasion and/or money laundering makes as much sense as the "bitcoin bad, blockchain good" narrative these people try to push.

I don't think youve fully grasped what a fork is. Debate intelligently, dont troll for the sake of trolling AND be inaccurate.

Im getting downvoted &amp; thats fine. You guys are minimalizing the users banding together and showing that miners dont completely control Bitcoin. As if the NYA wasnt held because of the issue a UASF wouldve caused.

You only mentioned one of the changes, and I WILL DIE BEFORE YOU TAKE AWAY THE MEMES

It's not whatsoever. It simply shows corporation interest in the space, which shows adoption, but fuck paypal. I hate them with every fiber in my being.

As long as its fully secure, they can take all the time they need imo

Hope it works out and you find a gold mine. Dont forget to claim your forks if you find some in there!

Ive heard him talk good about the impact smart contracts can have if they are debugged and implemnted correctly. I dont think he has ever said anything about ETH being a contender or overtaking btc.
I also havent watched/read everything he has ever said, so if you can provide a source, I can easily be disproved. It sounds immensely out of character for him, pre &amp; post donation.

I see a lot of people calling you dumb. I think that you are just looking at this the wrong way, &amp;hopefully sifting through the insults will show you why it's not a good idea.
To me, it appears you're thinking of ways to eliminate market manipulation, but also dont have a full grasp on what margin trading is. I think your hearts in the right place, just do a bit more research bud, &amp;hold tight. The day-to-day prices wont matter in the bigger picture a few years down the line.

Depends on what you mean by "broken phone." If its a broken screen, you can easily pull the info out via remote access. If the wallet was on an sd card, you're also safe.
This us a good time to remind you guys that when enabling 2fa, take a screenshot of the QR code &amp; save it in cold storage (offline usb drive), so you can access it in the events of losing access to your device.

My jaw dropped seeing that it was only worth $3 &amp; some change.

Wealth redistribution is a good start. Look into David Hays Venezuelan initiative if you wish to help in a humanitarian effort. The Pineapple fund has also done some big donations to the right places.
It's not all moons &amp; lambos, &amp;I love seeing what happens when it's not.

A large majority of miners refused to signal for segwit until a UASF was threatened, I can understand that because upgrading was a bit complicated, &amp;the vitriol for Roger taking a stance against segwit is one of the biggest catalysts for his miners not signalling for it, due to political reasons. Why would you deny that? Regardless of what side of the fence you fall on, facts are facts.

Sick compliment to that reply!

Im interested in the suicide hardfork also. How do I claim the classic chain?

Doesnt exactly look like a pkace where people will be zooming by, mistaking bitcoin signs for highway signs and driveways as exits.
