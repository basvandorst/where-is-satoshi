I know, the next thing will be to test if people can earn bitcoin just by being active on an instant message platform.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:23:20
We have great apps for each industry so imo the the killer app will be the one that will enable Bitcoin for all the others. Probably makes no sense what I'm saying but Telegram will play an important role in Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:12:02
Actually I'm not trying to setup a website for this, there are lot of them and people are reporting that the work there is boring. So what I'm trying to do is to explain people that they can do the same mturk work from a group chat from their mobile phone, instead browsing facebook they can keep an eye on that chat and earn some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:52:56
it's not about luck, it's just a matter of time until enough people will understand how it works and how simple it is.
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:03:34
The only thing that I've heard about Blockchain.info was to not use it but nobody gave me an answer why not to do it. 
Check [Bitcoin Chat]( It's a place for both beginners and experienced users. I'm sure they will be able to give answers to most of your questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:16:19
man, I really need your help, please install telegram and join the group, the first HIT will be to collect as many details about mturk operation and it seams you're aware of what's going on there. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 03:18:43
You should rent the flat for eur and give 1% cash return in Bitcoin. Someday, those people are willing to buy their own flat with that chunk. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 03:39:43
So I have in mind in doing this on Telegram, it's similar with Whatsapp, but when it comes to group chats, has  better management and other nice features, plus that Bitcoin community on Telegram doubled since January. A list with groups is available on 
I want to use this mechanical turk concept to reward people who chat with us and are able to provide ideas or answer to different questions that will make coin.army a better platform, as you can see, shitty design and a lot of features missing. On the past iterations I've used  to transfer bitcoin to participants, it's fast, simple and has no fees. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:19:27
send me a pm with your telegram username and I will add you to the group.
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:51:08
Do not leave your coins on an exchange longer than the time needed for trading. Use a real wallet, not a website. This is rule that everybody should be aware of. 
Lot of beginners lost their coins with blockchain.info because of [multiple]( phishing attempts. 
At some point I've used it for the BTC -&gt; SMS feature.
@_date: 2016-08-19 04:03:13
I'm sorry, but this is unexplored territory for me also, plus that I'm a terrible writer.  I really don't have so much money to pay, but I'll try to do my best and pay the fair about of bitcoin to each person who take part of it and come with ideas to improve the system.  
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:53:44
Check your local Telegram community, they will probably be able to come with a solution: 
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:40:05
30 minutes Bitcoin chat. 0.00063 BTC
@_date: 2016-08-19 04:29:42
This has nothing to do with mturk, I just used the name for people to better  understand the concept. 
At the end I imagine a list of telegram groups, that users can join and be part of discussion. If they will be able to solve the tasks or create good content inside of those groups, they will earn small amount of Bitcoin and reputation, otherwise probably the group owners will ban them.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:00:52
I think this is totally different that regular faucet, I have in mind to keep all members into a group chat, ask questions and reward those who get involved and provide valuable answers or ideas. This way, by using a live chat and also a reputation system, I can use the crown to mine different ideas and projects, and trust me, this won't be a boring task.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:50:39
I'm just trying to test the concept  now, not to compete with anyone. I want to use micro payments on telegram to hire members for different Human Intelligence Task that will help us build a proper platform on coin.army. 
 
About people usd and bitcoin, they can learn by their own, I really don't need to convince them. There are more than 100 communities with 20k members inside that they can use to feed their curiosity about crypto. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 03:16:13
If you want to make it cheap, I really don't think Bitcoin debit card is the solution, I use  if you wanna check their offer. 
Check the local Telegram groups, if you're looking to sell small amounts, you can easily find someone to buy your Bitcoin, even without a commission. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:03:52
There are multiple faucets websites but none of them allow Requester to discuss directly with Workers into a moderated group chat.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:48:37
No, I'll give you a way to earn Bitcoin directly, you won't have to work for mturk anymore.
@_date: 2016-08-23 06:18:29
Why don't you give it a try on Telegram. Create a group and join

@_date: 2016-08-19 16:03:29
At this time I'm not able to offer same type of work/pay. But if the concept works on Telegram, the operation costs will be very low and we will just need to take care of escrow and members reputation.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:30:33
Very interesting, with Bitcoin can be so much cheaper. Check the Mturk pricing list is [here]( 
"20% fee on the reward and bonus amount (if any) you pay Workers. HITs with 10 or more assignments will be charged an additional 20% fee on the reward you pay Workers. The minimum fee is $0.01 per assignment or bonus payment."
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:52:11
Check the [home page,]( there are more than 100 groups there.
@_date: 2016-08-19 03:48:05
I'm not sure how long you have to wait for the Amazon payment, but our idea is to pay turks instant, this way will be competition and those who spend more time on the platform, will find more tasks and earn more, plus that this will bring lot of competition between turks.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:31:54
because onecoin is a scam
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:07:08
How much amazon earn from this mturk?
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:25:20
True. This should be a coins post
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:31:53
Great to hear that. Check the other groups also, there are lot of interesting things hiding on that website. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:44:57
I want to have a couple of people into a telegram group, so I can pay small amount of bitcoin for different tasks, like mechanical turk. 
So today at 06:00pm UTC I will be online with couple of other members discussing about this coin.army website, everyone who is willing to participate and is able to suggest different changes or ideas will get paid.
@_date: 2016-08-19 03:42:27
The difference is that you will get Bitcoin, you won't need to swap your balance for gift card to monetize your balance. You will be paid in Bitcoin and you will be able to spend them anywhere you want.
@_date: 2016-08-20 05:43:19
I'm not the only one, but the only difference is that I think and try to build something for my friends not for my investors. The Revolution Will Not Be Centralized.

Similar with Whatsapp, it's a multi-platform messaging client which Bitcoin community use to share trade ideas, news and chat. A list of Telegram Bitcoin communities is available on  
I don't know hot to explain, but imo telegram will be the killer app for bitcoin. Currently you can get a wallet on Telegram in less than 10 seconds,  0 fees and you have access to a wide variety of communities that will answer your bitcoin related questions.
Telegram will be for Bitcoin as Google is for the Internet.
