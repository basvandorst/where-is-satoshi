Perhaps, I have no idea what the accuracy of the calculator is, but even with an order of magnitude more, it's still 10x more. 
A separate question is the effectiveness, perhaps one million or 500k would've been much more useful at some earlier point in time to address some specific problem, also cost disease is a factor, it does seem nowadays nothing in the US can be done for cheap, so that 5 million might be swallowed up by the city budget without making a splash. Who knows, not me.

@_date: 2017-12-25 14:37:25
I think most modern ones do, the problem is the one I used just gives me one option which is equivalent to the cost of the whole transaction. No thanks. 
edit: Now it's offering me a rbf that's equivalent to 10% of the transaction... I guess I might go for it... ugh no I misread it's over 100% of the transaction to rbf... :(

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:47:47
The mobile client I'm using only offers a higher fee option of about the same amount the transaction is worth. I sent a lot more for less 2 months ago in 48 hours, I'm not going to pay a 100% fee to send 50 now, just on principle, I'd rather the millibits be lost in limbo.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:18:28
I made mine using bitaddress which doesn't seem to have an option for segwit wallets. Oh well it was a learning experience, paper wallets, fees, transaction accelerators, segwit and soon, I suspect, altcoins. :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:27:35
Well, I hope it wasn't much, mine is just .0035. A couple months a go I sent everything I had (Not that much unfortunately) with a dangerously low fee to sweep an old multibit HD wallet, it confirmed after 48 hours and some cold sweat on my part.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:56:13
Yeah I tried to make a paper wallet with .0035 as a gift, it hasn't confirmed yet after 2+ weeks and when and if it does I have no guarantee it will be spendable... :( 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:47:22
That would be nice, I have a 25 s/b transaction that's been in limbo since 2 weeks, I was wondering if it would expire. It's supposed to be a Christmas present so if it confirms tomorrow that would be ideal...

According to this "coming back to the wallet" is just a client deleting the transaction but it's not really a feature of the network

@_date: 2018-09-09 10:14:09
Fair enough, but a warrant canary isn't going to protect against this either, isn't it? The NSA would put the backdoor into a client covertly and it would have to be very discreet about how it phones home else it would be spotted quickly...
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:32:33
I understand fine, I'm just pointing out that my relationship with say, reddit is very different from my relationship with the various  crypto client manufacturers. In the former a canary is relevant but in the latter not so much. 
Reddit can be compelled to turn over info about my extended participation on this site, the various client manufacturers can give them an ip for a single download. 
Governments can hack a client to include a vulnerability or backdoor, but that would be a covert operation, not a subpoena mandated legal move. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:38
I tried to make some wallets to gift small amounts to friends. The first one hasn't confirmed after a week and the only option to resend asks for a fee equal to the amount being sent so I'm nixing that idea. A couple months ago I sent almost $2000 worth for less than 50 cents, it took 48 hours but I didn't think it was too bad. This however is just not practical. I can't do my usual dollar cost averaging purchase if it's all going to be eaten up in fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:49:22
I do own the keys but I don't know how to make segwit paper wallets, anyway the send transaction is the main problem right now and that one would've been non segwit regardless. I need to empty that old phone wallet before it becomes unusable. .

@_date: 2017-12-31 01:09:22
Haven't really looked into vanity addresses, you're saying the fact they have readable sentences and repeated numbers suggest they're not a product of a private key but they're just something someone wrote directly in the wallet format?

To be fair with old media the authors ALREADY received the money, since publishers and editors and labels fund stuff in advance, take risks, etc... so they do deserve some support. 
"I don't want to pay for this book because only 5 cents reaches the author" ignores the fact he lived off the advance checks the editor cut him while he was writing the book in the first place, that kind of risk deserves a reward. We haven't had kickstarters for that long...

The writer Charles Stross explained he didn't take donations on his site because he would then owe part of the money to his editors, publishers and etc... Creators at the top of the current food chain exist in a web of relationships with the industry they work in and they can't just unilaterally cut the middleman.
Instead of feeling guilty about not giving money to these creatives who are really doing quite well with the old system try donating to indie creators who are being screwed on both sides, they have to compete with the established ultrapopular big budget creators in the traditional area and with the pirated free versions of these same competitors on the supposedly indie friendly free web.

Bitcoin is cash made of math you can carry around in your mobile phone.
Millions of computers around the world come together to agree who paid who, when and how much. No single computer is in charge. 
Only 21 million coins will ever be made. People can lose them and they get harder to make all the time, so they will always become more valuable. 
But each coin can be split into tiny pieces so you can send tiny, or huge payments anywhere in the world to anyone you can reach with the internet.

Exchanges and people's wallets are hacked all the time, but the network itself remains secure. Paradoxically, if you could hack the bitcoin protocol itself what you stole would become worthless just by the fact you were able to do it. 
It may come to pass that quantum computing will be capable of compromising bitcoin wallets, so the network will have to migrate to higher security cryptography that is quantum proof. This would leave "lost" btc and static but known caches such as Satoshi's bitcoin vulnerable, unless they are moved. If Satoshi was dead (I think Hal Finney is a viable candidate to be him) then those coins would be up for grabs and would have quite a massive effect on the market.

Back in December I had a stalled transaction for over a month  ;)  Insufficient fees meant no miner picked it up for processing. The second transaction probably can't go through because the unspent outputs from the first one are uncertain - you need the "change" from the previous transaction to make the second one.
It probably won't be so bad. You can wait, or try to resend with a higher fee so it'll be picked up quicker.

Actually I've seen charts measuring work time vs. buying power and those aren't anywhere as bad as the ones charting loss of buying power for currency amount. A dollar doesn't buy what it used to, but we get paid more of it. What OP is pointing out is that a meeeleon dollars might not be very impressive soon. Honestly, it already kind of is approaching the price of a so-so house in certain jurisdictions, so I'd argue it's pretty close. 
So the question is what a satoshi can buy.

It's open source software terminology, since open source software is "free" anyone can take it on a completely new direction if they want to so if you get a bee in your bonnet about turning the office suite libreoffice into a chess game you could declare a fork and start building a chess game on top of the existing code.
Of course when the disagreement is a little less retarded than my example then people can argue which version of the fork is the "real" one which is the case here. 
Also if you owned bitcoin before august you now own an equal amount bitcoin cash (Worth less money, but still worth *some*), people are hoping they'll get free money again this time 'round.

Seized is a word usually employed in relation to legal entities, taxation, fines, etc... bitcoin is traceable so an authority can know how much bitcoin you have and compel you to hand it over, i.e. "seize it". People joke about losing their keys in a boating accident to prevent this, but good luck with that. 
 It can't be "stolen" by anyone who doesn't know the private key, yes. But they can still make you hand those over.

Can't I create another wallet in the same client?
I ask because I had a multibit wallet, I drained it so it's empty of bitcoin but I wanted to recover the BCH, I thought I had the wallet words but no joy creating it in electron cash. I tried to reimport it as a separate wallet in multibit to check and the transactions are not there so I think the wallet words are wrong but perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Think of it in terms of your clean money being worth more, if you need motivation. Isn't that what people say when a HD full of bitcoins is lost? Thanks for increasing the value of everyone else's? 


Sure, and here we have for the first time money that can be confidently claimed to be "clean", as it's born from pure math. Might be worth keeping it that way, or valuing it more for it.
(Sure you could say that the carbon cost of generating the bitcoin already has a moral cost, but let's just assume bitcoin is born virginal and without original sin for argument's sake)


I could see "used" btc being tainted with different tags that would be relatively more or less acceptable. I wouldn't care about btc that had gone through say, a porn company's processing, or medical pot but I might draw the line at blood diamond's btc. Other people might have the opposite priorities.

(I already set up a couple of domains for people here last year, though they just wanted to hold the domains, no site)

Open coinmarketcap, click on view all and when it finishes loading, hit the end key. Work your way up from the bottom. I imagine there's a solid thousand we can all agree fit the definition.

All these bitcoin patreon clones popping up... why should I use them as opposed to just putting up a bitcoin address on my website for people to donate direct? 
I mean, I get it if you want fiat, but I'd rather have the btc...
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:37:25
Bisq works well, but there have been some restrictions to account age due to recent shenanigans, so if you don't already have an account you may be limited...
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:27:34
Yeah, not even a proper btc address beside it, I can understand maybe both but only bch?
I'm guessing Scott got paid for that by someone, he's talked a lot about micropayment systems and ways to finance webcomics back in the early days of the net but he's a fairly big name

I'm actually happy I'm getting another chance, I was dollar cost averaging until summer 2017 when the price got too steep and I didn't have the money anyway, and by december it looked like 100-ish Euro purchases were not even going to be viable anymore due to fee costs so I thought I'd lost the chance.

I opened a segwit wallet last year, tried to use it to receive a sum from some service, wasn't accepted, went back to the old one. Changelly, I think it was.

That's what the escrow is for. My last purchase I got distracted so I forgot to click "payment made" so the seller's coins reverted to him even though I had completed the transfer. Fortunately he was an upstanding guy and he reopened the trade and everything went well. The escrow is there so you don't have to trust the seller, his btc are kept by localbitcoins and if he lied about not receiving the money they would verify it and release the coins to you (Ideally)

Well in a kickstarter or patreon style model, I state "If I get X amount of money I'll do Y" and having a public address people can see the amount has been donated is a feature rather than a bug.
If you want to get fancier you can install electrum on your server, but I don't think that's going to have the same mass appeal as joining a website to do it for you...

Isn't a multisig wallet with 3 owners that can be authorized by 2 not something that already exists? That ought to work as escrow...

Isn't he the ultimate hodler? With about a million of early mined btc?
I mean, he's welcome to it if he has it, I don't begrudge him, but selfless it's not

I was going to post that buying a single satoshi would probably be more complicated than a whole bitcoin but I'd forgotten about lightning. Cool.

He's ridden a Streissand effect wave to mega-popularity. Like you say, nothing he says is that terrible, but his opponents act as if he was some sort of walking memetic hazard that must not be talked about, making more and more people check him out just out of curiosity.

Did I step through a time warp into the 80s? And what's the price of btc right now? I bet I could get some really cheap....

Oh you definitely read it and it made an impression. 
Although, quick check of my own shows Watts doesn't actually use the word spandrel in [blindsight]( (Gotta love Creative Commons).  
Sapolsky's lectures? That's where I've heard the term used in this context (It's apparently an architectural word)
