I think many people knew you already, you was the most famous one at the time!
I'm with full respect to what you have done for yourself and all Mt.Gox victims.
You are a true man to stand out for the rightness!
I am also one of the Mt.Gox victims, and due to Mark Karpeles: a liar, a dishonest fucker.
I lost almost all my life savings, and my life became cruel and pain!
Everytime when I saw it claim itself as an "innocent person" at social media, I feel so angry!
It even do not try to correct what it had done to us! What a bastard!
To reminde the others, I would like to say something more about this:
As early as 2014, the notorious Mt.Gox shutdown, and it bring us a 3-years long bear market.
We all know the head of Mt.Gox was Mark Karpeles, he was arrested and prosecution on suspicion of having accessed the exchange's computer system to falsify data on its outstanding balance. I am not going to repeat the whole story, I am going to tell some facts.
*Mark Karpeles was a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation.*
*Executive chairman Peter Vessene has business relationship to former board member Mark Karpeles.*
*Former vice-chairman Charlie Shrem pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business related to his role in assisting agents of the online marketplace Silk Road.*
*About half a year before Mt.Gox down, people already can not withdraw dollars, all withdraw in Dollars just stuck there.*
*In the same time, members of Bitcoin Foundation / person that have relations with Mark Karpeles can withdraw what ever they want.*
*There are many people already knew that there are something wrong with Mt.Gox, but none of them warned the community! What a SHAME!!!*
*The Mt.Gox website, it's core code was written by Mark Karpeles, and he is the one to take responsibility of lost customer funds.*
