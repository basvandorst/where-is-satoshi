I think it is alright to think of bitcoin as pure manipulation just as is the oil market and the Saud House and their mentality to play chicken with the world. Bitcoin too will be manipulated, it is money, but loaded with new possibilities and applications . Just keep in mind that technology will make inroads--eventually. It may not turn out as the ideological dream come true for many, but it will change things. At least through crypto we can channel our plutocratic rag doll at the wall once in awhile and that feels good.

Yes, I agree and that likely could be the scenario that plays out. Yet, there are some unforeseen factors, the unknowable, maybe as analogous mutation of how we attack the problem, because it is a problem and the solution is unforeseeable--nature works that way too, or maybe a river collapses from a rock slide and cuts off and isolates to stop exclusion, a certain adaptation develops and we got a new animal. In any case, I enjoyed thinking about your analogy, but on a more optimistic level.

Yes, but without trying to be hackneyed in this statement, it will be the already ingrained community that could potentially pull dogecoin ahead. When you get a lot of people's heads together, further development surely follows. I also see the involvement of women in doge as a huge factor for further traction and this is super important for crypto growth, and importance beyond any one technological feature. Women's spending decisions act as an organic mirror and authentic representation of a real spending society, it just feels more balanced and authentic. Dogecoin offers a potentially wider and more diverse social grease to spread it to a waiting mainstream.

I would think a simple answer to make bitcoin work as a remittance service is to set up similar console services that look and feel like Western Union--teller operated or automated atms that accept cash on one end and covert this to bitcoin (these mechanisms are linked to the exchanges and spot buys immediately and coverts bitcoin immediately back to the desirable national currency) The person then could withdrawal cash manually like they would normally at any Western Union with some moblie app two party signatures and proof of identity all off the blockchain, ID is not even needed. I would think a service like this could skim between 1 and 2 percent to make it profitable. All along bitcoin, the machine that runs beneath it--purring like an engine money Ford Mustang. Actually, that is a pretty good name: Mustang Remittance.

This quote from the article is a doozy: 
“We know that bitcoin itself is a complete failure and shows the number one law of programming and software: that anything that can be programmed can be hacked. So nothing is completely secure,” said Willem Buiter, Citi’s chief economist and former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee. “The cyber boys . . . they believe that this is something that can just work on its own and allow a seamless web of costless transactions across the world. Forget it.”

If the SEC wants a vehicle for secure and safe investing...and bitcoin is not going away and has been determined to be a new kind of asset, they might be inclined to pass it just so investors can come in from the cold (from unregulated and unsecured crypto landscapes ) and be safely exposed to this thing called bitcoin.  If their main objective is safety, they may be more inclined to take the activist role.

The key excerpt in there: 
"Under the new rules, companies will have more flexibility to engage in intrastate offers through websites and social media without having to register their offering with the federal government. Companies now can also raise up to $5 million per year through other amended rules, which could facilitate the development of regional offering exemptions at the state level to permit companies to raise from investors in a specific region. The previous limit was $1 million." 
SO as this applies to bitcoin--if there is indeed less regulation ( in general) the culture would seem to benefit bitcoin going forward in a less hostile environment. Although, nothing in this decision pertains to the bitcoin ETF. Not sure if this is linked to tonights mini-spike.

Most people in the mainstream and public are unaware of the existence of a toxic community, they just think 'bitcoin' this new thing that keeps rising in price outside the influence of government and compared to gold. I would not call the community toxic (a word that keeps getting thrown around lot). The community is ugly and noisy but all directing towards an eventual consensus, coin split or no coin split. I find this not a fault in bitcoin, but rather shows the seams of of real growth while all the various power structures fight over it. Again, showing it as an organic growth mechanism, bending, almost breaking, getting stronger...

I like Ethereum. I own it and trade it. But, there is a weakness ( though now a strength)  in that it has connected itself with other tech companies through its alliance and offerings of smart contracts and research proposals.  One of the features and strength of bitcoin is that it exists outside the system and is a weird speculative and value proposal that is kind of dumb and sitting by itself. If there is one day a stock market crash or black swan event, we would see the value of Apple and Microsoft, IBM stock go down and also see the utility of Ethereum be greatly diminished because it depends on the general health and well being of the traditional system legacy tech economy.

Your post is a prudent, and nothing wrong to diversify, but the crypto currency world has always had its exuberance and focus on trends. Recently we saw the alt coin expanding by leaps and bounds. Markets act in waves, and this current wave and focus is on ETH.  Who know how high this will go, but I would say that ETH is having a excitement and positive moment even more than Ripple had a few weeks ago, this is a market trend, and market trends don't last forever. BTC is never guaranteed for its top spot, but realize it is in the middle of a debate about scaling, plus and lots of noobs entering the market and seeing the price of ETH moving up fast which accelerates its rise in price even further. It is a great sign that BTC is securely in a steady price range atm.

I see this happening only if the dollar collapses or is under threat of collapsing and they would want a reboot in place. By that time the crypto with the greatest infrastructure, foothold etc, would be already the place to transact. Yet, if they forced taxes to be paid in this new fedcoin the immediate market forces would place value on it just like any  other alt coin and it would be likely no stronger than an administrative token.

Ethereum is a company, that can make fast decisions and buy great marketing. Bitcoin is a different animal, it is more organic, almost deaf and dumb, slow, we need to talk to it like tracing lines on a keller hand-- more in the spirit of a decentralized consensus machine. This is why there is fighting at the moment, we are all questioning what will bitcoin become and this in turn makes it valid and a stronger case for crypto IMHO.
