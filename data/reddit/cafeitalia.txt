The graphs don't even look similar. Go back to business school and take finance 101 to learn how to graph...

Price will drop to $800
Slowly and steadily all throughout 2018
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:50:32
Buy more! That is the only way to stop this nonsense. Hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:49:09
And then you realize bitcoin is backed by nothing as well...
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:55:03
It is about protesting the money system you are forced to use by being forced to pay $100 to transfer some bitcoin that is worth $10 or wait 12 hours for confirmation and pay $10 fee instead. Great protest! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:34:19
$250-$400 in 2018

USD is backed by these...
And nobody can match even one of these.

In 1913 a person was making $300 a year in median income. Today it is $60k.

This is the time to buy for me. I cashed out my 401k, sold the house the car the gold bars I had and bought bitcoin with all the proceeds. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:30
That is why I just keep on buying. I sold the boat and then got a home equity line of credit sold the cars I have not driven a while and sold many clothes. All the money I got I am buying more. But dang it, the transaction fees are high as hell and wait times are 2-3 hours. This is better than actual fiat currency. It makes sure you are sure as well. Nothing is instant. It is the best currency out there.
It is the best investment because block chain technology is only done by bitcoin. No other company can do this. They own the patent for 100 years and if any other company decides to do the same thing or even imitate they have to pay bitcoin $100 trillion. Bitcoin is the future. I have invested so much at 12k-19k and I am still buying. Originally I bought so much at 5k. I will never sell. Never sell and always average down!

That 0.07 bitcoin will be worth 0.007c when he goes to college.

Exactly. A paltry 128 locations with a deadline of April. By then the merchant bank they work with will renegotiate the terms and they will continue accepting Visa. And the fools that jumped into clickbait news will search for another clickbait for some mental feel good hysteria.

It talks about a subsidiary of Kroger. Not Kroger itself. You should read the article yourself before asking others if they read it.
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:28:32
When April 3rd comes Visa will still be accepted at those 148 locations of local grocery store chain.

Anything that moves in value20-50% within weeks months etc can not be used as a stable means to purchase goods in a widely accepted fashion. Exchange of goods require trust in value, if the means of exchange is not trustworthy in the average consumer mind due to volatile changes in value in short or long periods of time, consumer will find alternative means for the utilization of exchange.

Without funding from the banks none of those internet companies would have existed.

Are you joking? Any good dealer will pay at the least the spot price minus 1-2% commission for the American eagle any time of the day. If it is one of the sought after coins he will pay much more. Heck even if it is Swiss coin, or with American etc you will still get paid spot minus commission. An ounce of pure gold is just like cash anywhere you go in the world. If you are trying to sell gold as jewelry, well that is not investment grade gold and will never be.

It is not $3 yet. Give it another year or so for the price to hit $3.

$7 fee to buy $500 worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:58:52
Nothing can be done about this sadly. Bitcoin or any other crypto is not legally accepted currency by any government for any transaction value. They will not even investigate the theft.

We had a serious financial crisis about 10 years ago, were you on diapers back then and don't remember anything about it?
What happened? Did your parents not get any money from the bank while you were sucking on some glass of milk?

I will sell when it hits $225 this year.

Hodl forever!
I have $800 invested since 16-14-17-10k and I will Hodl. This will be at least $1m. McAfee said that.

Investor lied! He should have said bitcoin will be $70000000 and replace everything including gold and all other currencies
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:24:52
Yes Bitcoin will save the day because there is so much debt that can not be paid. And the logic for this is? Millennial logic hahaha.
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:34:51
Hells no! No selling ever, because if I sell to whatever price doesn't matter $1000000 I would then be a total hypocrite. If I am anti fiat then why would I ever convert my Bitcoin to fiat? That would be shameful. I bet all of you agree with this as well. But I am holding until 28M and when it hits I will sell all and start a mission to Venus. It is a great planet to inhabit all by myself.
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:30:53
Think of the day Bitcoin will hit 1755000 usd. That day is the day. Keep thinking of that day and you will never sell. One million seven hundred and fifty five thousand usd for one Bitcoin. That day is very near!
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:01:31
It has 45000 written all over it. Holding with my 0.3 coins.

You will go to sleep and it will be 88008 one day one morning. Hodl forever.
