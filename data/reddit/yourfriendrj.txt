An exchange engaging in fraudulent behavior should concern us all. Nobody said they were insolvent afaik, but there's good evidence that they forged signatures and attempted money laundering, among other things. It's reasonable to be worried that shady business practices could occur in their dealings with users and their funds.

Childish? I think it's good that he made this public. Why would we want to trust our funds with an exchange that engages in such shady business practices and is so incompetent at everything from paying people back to handling legal matters? 
They literally took a contract, added a silly clause that Ver obviously would never agree to (complete with a misspelling) at the end, and forged a signature on it. It's like a kid writing a note to his teacher "please don't make johnny do any work at school today" and copying his Mom's signature on it.

Pretty low-effort attempt at drawing attention away from the OKC scandal with crappy reposts.

Well, although I don't like to say it, I think he has a point. Sure, there are ways around those problems, but could they really be worked into a system that was as convenient as Apple Pay etc for the average joe?
The best option I can think of would be a system that holds fiat and uses btc for transactions. But how to handle fiat deposits? Currently there are almost no companies that let you buy btc with a credit card if you're in the US, and with good reason.

Nice try, Karpeles

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not, but either way it's hillarious

It's like the Bitcoin Wizard of Oz, with Karpeles behind the curtain. With his head sticking out a bit and starbucks stains on the floor.

Karpeles is a really shady character, but I agree with you. This sub jumps to conclusions too fast when it comes to mt gox news. Wouldn't surprise me if he had a hand in it or if he knew, but him masterminding the whole thing seems unlikely.

Face to face? Jesus, how did he pull that off?
I've had people try to scam me many times on localbitcoins, too. Just insisting on escrow and never totally trusting anyone has kept me out of danger so far, but the thought of some guy trying something shady in person is scary.

Yes, I never said bitcoin should be reversible. Building a service on top of bitcoin is exactly what I was talking about

Adding assassinations into the mix! This would be such a great movie

This is actually good for bitcoin

I've always joked about how Karpeles is mentioned/suggested as a culprit in this sub every time some new scandal happens in the bitcoin world. For example, during the Bitstamp debacle when people kept mentioning Karpeles as somehow being involved. Like, he's the evil villian mastermind of the bitcoin world ("he was behind it all along!"). 
Now, I see this article. It's just perfect hahaha
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:25:14
If something like this turned out to be true, wouldn't this mean that almost all of bitcoin's early rise was an elaborate drug money laundering/profiting scheme from Karpeles? That would definitely be a story for the history books.

Looked it up, and I can't find the source anywhere. Would love to have a go at an android implementation. It looks like something to be done at the kernel level though, not easy for a non tech savvy user to install

In fairness, I've had lots of shady experiences on lbc. People insisting on meeting in random neighborhoods instead of public places, asking if I can bring vanilla reload cards instead of cash, do the transaction online, etc. Most of the time they stopped responding after I didn't fall for any of these things. In fact, I couldn't find a single local seller who would both accept cash and meet me in a public place. All had either 0 reviews or only reviews from unverified accounts with only 1 or 2 purchases

This is from a 1 post account. The other guy talking up jua also has 1 karma and has a similar "advertising" tone to his post. I think we have some shills here

The 980 gets excellent x11 speeds (around 10 mh/s with the right kernel using cc miner). In fact it would be the best single x11 mining card if it wasn't for the price.

Why do you need coinbase? Why trust them instead of using an encrypted wallet on your pc with backups on your phone, flash drives, etc?
