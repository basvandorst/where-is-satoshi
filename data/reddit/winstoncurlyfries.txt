How far do we think Bitcoin will fall before it bottoms out and hopefully comes back up?

That didn't explain your comment of "wrong fact". Do you mean that he is wrong and it's a fact that he's wrong, or did you mean his fact is wrong? Explain your statement so that people can understand what you're actually trying to say.

I understand that because I know that there are people who want BU. Others who maybe don't know about it don't know what he means. I was hoping to get a little bit of clarity out of the poster for those who don't know.

I wasn't aware that fact could be wrong, please elaborate.

By the same token, he didn't specify currency, so who's to say is not in Zimbabwe dollars, or Yen?

The only thing Bitcoin has that is even close are 2of2 or 2of3 multisig wallets. A 2of3 wallet with an impartial the party would be the best way, but you could probably also make a 2of2 wallet work.

Hi there! It's always cool seeing people develop new software and programs to use Bitcoin. Now on to feedback.
1. I would definitely consider paying freelancers in Bitcoin
2. I have not paid freelancers in Bitcoin, nor have I used them.
3. I think that good features to include would be: a built-in wallet with either a decentralized escrow system, or 2-of-3 multi-sig, definitely a way to check up on your workers' productivity and a way to contact your workers through the program, maybe a screen viewer?

1. I have not heard of you.
2. It seems like a better version of local Bitcoins
3. That I'm not using it yet

From my understanding, Mycelium creates a new public address each time you open it; this may be what you are referring to.
