After all Bitcoins will be mined. What will happen? Since miners are rewarded for mining by Bitcoins right. But if there will be close to none  Bitcoins to be mined...how miners will be motivated to confirm transactions?

So do not use it if it is against your believes...just “vote”...

Can this be related to growth of LN?
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:38:15
No, by “voting” I ment that if you will not use it, you basically “voting” against it or not supporting. I believe that is how it should be done

Amazing talk from different perspective - from Economist point of view in contrast to more common technology talks. Really amazing global economy and government implications. Bitcoin can be really much more disruptive technology and instrument then it seems...

Give it some time. This wallet is out there (in matter of LN mainnet) just for few weeks I think. Just two days ago they enabled recieving LN payments...

They are working on this. In each release they are publishing new features and fixes. Just play with very small amounts for now to be safe. And see how it will develop. I started with 1 USD. Now I have around 7 USDs since I won in few roullete spins... :-D

Amazing! However, you should consider to convert fee selector also to chosen currency and not display it only in satoshi - common users does not have idea what 40 sat/byte means. You should also enable setting of displayed currency (USD, EUR etc.). BTC is still not that common so you could have sense if 0.004523 BTC is ok for coffee or not. You need local currency for that still. Anyway, amazing start.
