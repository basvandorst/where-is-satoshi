yeah but long term might be in 6 months or so, and feeling like shit because you don't know if its actually gonna go to 0 or skyrocket is not nice.. Idk, then again I invested what I was willing to lose, I didn't put my life savings into them
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:17:48

listen to this guy hahaha
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:14:36
hmm yeah I don't fully agree with you. Loads of people bought it at 2500+ and they didn't sell it before the drop. They thought like everyone else that the price would go to the moon, a lot of those people still hold their coins. Only a few sold with loss, cause everyone thinks and hopes that price will go back up.

@_date: 2017-06-06 05:55:27
Yesssss pls need big crash 
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:34:25
if bitcoin do go through with sigwith, any idea what will happen to litecoin ? will it stagnate or also go burst like btc ? Cause then I will diversify my funds, and go 50%btc/ 50%lite . I know you can't know for sure but you look like you know the stuff really well
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:53:55
basically to recap, if the chain splits the chance that bitcoin will drop to 0 is very high, and if the bitcoin remains the same, the price will rise to the moon ? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:48:34
alright thanks for your help man I appreciate it
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:22:27
man idk what to do either.... 
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:15:02
Bitcoin will rise to the moon cause scaling issues will be resolved
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:00:19

@_date: 2017-06-01 17:22:28
