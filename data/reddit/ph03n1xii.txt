What I've learned over time is that even the best coders are very often not better on the market than the rest of us when it comes to human weaknesses like greed, ignorance, wishful thinking etc. That's not even about knowledge, because everybody knows that exchanges always involve some risk - even the best ones can't be 100% secure and trusted. But still: Some used Gox as wallet, like a bank-account.

Yes, I understand. I believe it's possible that you're right and what I believe is a fact, but a question of time: The established financial system will have to face big problems, much bigger than Lehman Brothers. But what I'm unsure about is, if Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general are that strong like they are often seen. But we will find out in the next 2 to 20 years.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:08:33
Rootstock - yes, maybe. I've never made much research if any about it. I believe smart contracts will have real-world applicability in future but that it's too early for the complex ones. But not too early for the first steps and to do research about it. 
That's why I think that Ethereum (but also some others besides Bitcoin) will be an important part of Crypto-history. Even if not in a way like those believe who invest big money and hope for mainstream-adoption etc. 
I really like the whole market. Of course, there is a lot of scammy shit but also a lot of innovation and it all is very fast and transparent. Maybe it's a little bit like the hundreds or thousands of garages in the 70's in which Nerds started big companies like Microsoft and Apple. And we can look into those garages on BCT, Reddit, etc. and follow it all - and make some bets of course. ;-)

That's not really new. I was a newbie at that time, bought my first BTC right after the "crash" in April 2013. And MtGox already had lost reputation so I decided not to register there. With other words: Even a newbie like me was able to recognize that MtGox seemed shady. There were a lot of concerning infos and I never understood why so many trusted it with huge amounts. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:35:20
- What I understand is: To lose money when an exchange gets hacked or insolvent out of other reasons. 
- What I don't understand is: To lose huge amounts.
If somebody believes it's needed to hold huge amounts on an exchange, I believe there is only one reason: Greed. And I don't judge about that. We all are greedy. But everybody needs to face the consequences out of such a *greed-over-risk-management-decision*. 
And regarding MtGox: I would have expected that smart people, and especially early adopters proved to be smart, would have been more carefully. But many still deposited Bitcoins because of the "high prices" while they should have withdrawn their wealth long before And really, I was a newbie in 2013 and without much knowledge about the times before, but I just thought wtf?? ;-)

Like I've said: I'm not a coder. I learned a lot from it regarding the market, psychological questions, hype, trigger and reactions etc.. And I can't answer your question what exactly technical persons can learn from it. But I know that many coders looked deep into. It's obvious because of a lot of articles I've read. One example: I follow Emin Gün Sirer on Twitter. And he wrote many articles about Ethereum and it's not as if he just thinks "bullshit". And he is not the only one. We don't need to discuss about that. My point was more that I believe that it's kind of a laboratory and I don't believe that it will be used beyond that. But maybe you'll find answers here:

Weiss doesn't have a good reputation and especially the comparison between some of the projects and how they were rated show superficiality and don't make much sense. Projects that are concepts only until now got a high rating (Cardano for example), Bitcoin got just a slightly better rating than Dogecoin and so on. People understood in seconds that such ratings are irrelevant. So it's good to see that it doesn't have much if any impact on prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:05:55
My prediction is: If the price keeps on to be "stable" at that level it's a very good sign. Thought a lot about the question if this could turn into a bearmarket, like it started in late 2013/early 2014, but I believe it won't. Perspective is much more positive now, with Segwit &amp; Lightning and mainstream-attention etc. But I believe it's good if everything cools down a bit. 
What I believe to be the most relevant question for Bitcoin is if it has the potential to stay on top or if another Cryptocurrency will overtake over the next few years.

That's an interesting point, because what you seem to see as weakness is a strength in my opinion. 
First about the "it's no company": Because it is no company, Bitcoin can not go bankrupt. Bitcoin as a currency, or a store of value if you want, could be seen as product without having the need to be profitable and a company behind it. The inherent value is not missing but lays in it's functionality. 
If you think about value in general you'll see: It always is about function, that is even true when something is only valuable for an individual and without objective functionality (like a painting). Also psychological function is function - under the line there is no other function, nothing objective to find in anything. 
Bitcoin and also other cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-projects (of course by far not all of them) provide functionality while they are much more robust than companies. What I've figured about Bitcoin first, when I found it in 2013 and without understanding much if anything else, is exactly that: The combination of functionality and robustness, so I came to the conclusion that whatever the price might do, it's very likely to "always" come back. 
The only real risk that I see is that Bitcoin might be dethroned and lose relevance over time, because another Blockchain/Cryptocurrency might take over. That's still a possibility, maybe even with high probability if we think in longer time-frames.

1. I'm invested, yes. I've never made a secret about that fact. 
2. If I invest in something I make deep research. So, I'm informed. 
3. That I'm invested is the reason that I'm informed, which is the reason that I know that you lie about Factom.
4. But even if I were not invested I would disagree with the way you spread lies not just about Factom but also about people involved. 
5. With about 300% in the profit-zone it's not logical to call me a bagholder.

That article is an attempt to twist the truth about Factom. Not Factom twisted the truth. About the chat with Paul Snow: **Long Version**:  **Short version**:  The discussion goes on and on but nobody ever could say where Factom (or even the Reuters article) claimed that there is a signed deal.

Again and again you spread you accusations without ever giving proof. Everytime you are asked to show evidence you leave and you don't reply. But sure, you don't stop, you just move to another place (LTB-several Threads, than your show, reddit - several topics, Twitter etc.). Brighton36: "Alright. I admit defeat. I know when things have gone far enough. You're right, I have nothing.

You told lies about the chat and you're still telling lies, using quotes without context, hoping people won't read the entire chat. Another example? Here:  Did you reply? No, you left the discussion for days. You was never able to discuss the subject on an objectively base and you are still not.

@_date: 2015-12-01 15:59:49
That's interesting. Everybody who wants to know what you're doing here and is interested in Factom should read the whole thread - Paul Snow discussed the subject in detail! Chris, it's just a matter of time that people will come to their own conclusions. You lied about the chat with Paul Snow, you lied in your "show", you lie in the time-line, you're lying here. Periodically you admit all that, but you are so obsessed and so desperate that you are constantly reloading without having a single bullet. For some readers here it's maybe hard to get an overview about the discussion but it's just a matter of time. And my prediction is, that you won't be the Community Director for Counterparty and a member of LTB for long. And sure, you will claim that you was censored (like you're already doing) you would like to give the impression of a conspiracy as if you'd be Edward Snowden, you'll keep on spreading lies. So, like I said before: good luck with that.

About me you said I would be a paid shill, and you said that several times. But: If somebody did his research and believes that Factom is a great project, is invested in Factom, why not giving informations and support the project? That's obviously enough for you to try to discredit somebody. But your biggest problem is, that you are known after all the discussions. As a troll. You are using Factom to burn your own credibility with your lies about it. Time will tell, so go ahead! ;-)

4. Wasn't it you (Chris) who used a sockpuppet-account? 
5. Is it right or wrong that Paul Snow replied on absolute everything, but you weren't able to answer his questions about your own accusations on him and Factom?
6. Chris, wasn't it you who said this two weeks ago: "Alright. I admit defeat. I know when things have gone far enough. You're right, I have nothing. Go ahead give me the label."

Europe is economically strong in comparison to many other regions on this planet. But the financial system, the EURO, is fragile. Reason is, or at least a major one: One currency does not fit for so many different countries with different economical strengths. 
The Euro is too strong for weaker countries that would down-value an own/national currency, what would have a positive effect on exports for example and make it more attractive for a lot of reasons. Since that is not possible they have to go deep into debt. Stronger countries, especially Germany for example, become additionally problematic because they dump wages, develop a huge export surplus because the Euro is too weak for them. And the biggest problem is: That becomes a trap for all Euro-States and the financial system (international) as well. 
Another problem: The Euro always was promoted as "peace-currency", that it would ensure the cohesion of participating countries. But reality shows the opposite. Many south countries hate Germany for example (not saying germans per se) and as a german I can't even blame them, because the game is not fair. Germans on the other hand are not all that rich that they like to see the problems in other countries and Germany (and other stronger states) give guarantee for debts of other countries. And that leads people in all countries, Germany included, to vote more extreme. 
I can not see any real solution or just a "way out" of this that would not be damaging. Everything else would be a miracle.

Yes, I agree. But good solutions will take some time. And raising the Blocksize-limit would give time. And it's about time, because the whole economy will change and it's already changing.

I agree with the guess that 99% of all altcoins will go to zero, but to say Bitcoin is the only one worth investing in - that will turn out as wrong. Plus: It's possible that Bitcoin will be overtaken. I hope it won't be, but it's much too early to be sure about the future of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain and Blockchain-projects.

Yes, of course it's normal to have risk factors. And there are much more. But I'm not sure if it's normal to have so obvious potential conflicts of interest. There are also other risk factors that are very special because Bitcoin is different, like all risks that could result out of a hard fork for example.

What I mean becomes clear if you think it into an extreme-scenario and think about how it's done. Let's say 50% of all chinese would be able to sell their Yuan for a foreign currency (or a Cryptocurrency) and do that. Yuan would go down in value. And if that would be combined with capital flight, that the value leaves the country it would be even worse. Let's say chinese billionairs would get their money out of china and buy land and houses and whatever in foreign countries. Take a look at Greek and you know that something like that can turn into a huge problem for a country - Greek is different and there are a lot of other problems as well, but capital flight is one of them. It's something every country and government is concerned about.

I believe that they (chin. government) are in a situation without solution. Banning Bitcoin could theoretically work, but they want to use the blockchain-tech and that makes things complicated. If they would suppress Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies as hard as possible they would suppress innovation. And in general China seems to be Blockchain-friendly. So they try to scare people but without taking hard action against it. That's at least my theory and already was in late 2013. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:27:31
Yes, the Yuan doesn't leave and the citizen also don't leave. But that doesn't change the fact that it's possible to get "value" out. Let's think extreme to make it clear: In some years Bitcoin could have solved it's scaling-problems, the chinese Fiat-currency could come into (more) trouble (like others as well of course) and people flee with their money not only in Cryptocurrencies but additionally it's easy to send it  everywhere in minutes, also to sell it for other countries easily. If you believe that governments don't fear such a scenario you are simply wrong in my opinion. There is a reason why china has that strick [capital controls]( And there must be a reason why they believe that it needs the [Great Firewall]( Of course Bitcoin doesn't mean much right now - for no country. But they don't like the tendency.

Yes, that's a possible scenario. But what I think about, even if highly speculative: Would it be possible that huge mining-farms may wish a fork and a split?

I wouldn't say it failed to attract applications. Lykke is not very known yet, but building a semi-decentralized exchange using the colored-coins-protocol: 
*Lykke Corp is a FinTech company based in Zurich that has launched the first global marketplace for all asset classes and instruments, using the Colored Coin protocol on blockchain. (...) Every financial instrument can become a listed security on the blockchain in the form of a digital token, through the so-called Colored Coin protocol. Colored coins follow the idea of ''coloring'' a specific Bitcoin - the issuer guarantees to hand out the underlying assets to the person, who returns the colored coin. For example, the Federal Reserve (FED) can issue a colored coin in the same way as it prints paper money; it would take a fraction of a Bitcoin and then insert the ''I Owe You'' statement of the FED, like a regular bank note. The same mechanism can be used for any other financial claim. Colored coins are different in nature than cryptocurrencies, because they have a specific issuer and are backed by a real financial asset. (...)*

I think it's hard to predict any numbers but yes, it might be possible that we will see an increase like that. But the most important requirement is a solution for the blocksize-problem. It's already obvious that there is some pressure on the price every time the mempool is full. And a fee-event even could bring the price down in a very hard way. 
Plus: As long as there is no solution the possibility of a network-split is there, a Core-Bitcoin and an Unlimited-Bitcoin for example. Such a scenario doesn't need to come into existence to raise uncertainty if it just should be discussed and that will most likely increase.  
I believe the price already would be much higher if there would be a solution or at least a clear direction for a solution.

I believe it is very unlikely but possible. Or to be more precise: It's most likely not possible to "completely destroy" Bitcoin, but it may be possible to overtake and compromise it. If the chinese government would be able to concealed overtake chinese mining-farms, it would have control and could compromise the blockchain. But that would be very hard to do without getting revealed. 
Plus, and that's the most interesting part in my opinion: Some Bitcoin-Maximalsts have a very bad opinion about all Cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin. I believe: They protect Bitcoin. Because it wouldn't make much sense to waste a lot of money, power and credibility to attack Bitcoin since another CC would overtake and replace it very quickly. It's like a hydra.

Lykke is not just a coin. First it's the project, the company Lykke. And yes, the coin represents shares of the company (100 LKK = 1 company share). 
But, they clearly say in the FAQ you link: 
**Can you legally market these coins?**
*We can legally market and offer Lykke coins to anyone who is not a US, UK or Canadian citizen.*
And yes, I'm an Investor in Lykke and I also help them with communications. 
The other three projects are not comparable and also not really in competition to Lykke. Lykke will focus on all kinds of digital assets using the colored-coin-protocol and it's build on top of the Bitcoin-Blockchain. It's also about Fiat and FX-trading and that's something Lykkes founder Richard Olsen has tons of experience in, since he is Co-founder and former CEO of Oanda. 
If all what you want to point out is that Lykke is only about making a quick buck - it's simply not true.

I'm from germany so I couldn't even vote if I would want it. But with candidates like Trump and Clinton - no chance that I would would vote for one of both. I consider both as corrupt and dangerous narcissists without any not selfish intention. More interesting is the "outside-perspective" in general. My impression is that the USA are on a suicide-track and that the election-campaign shows a huge underlying conflict that will break out at one point, no matter who will win.

Of course such a price is possible - could even go higher. But it also could come to a fee-event with impact on the price. I believe there are two main-aspects right now: 
- Increasing demand, also because of current and coming financial crises in a lot of countries all around the globe. 
- Scaling-problem. And it doesn't seem as if there would be a solution any time soon. 
That's why I consider Bitcoin as a good but very risky bet right now.

In 2013 (when I was new to BTC) I was concerned that governments all over the world could ban Bitcoin. But what I've underrated at that time is, how wanted the Blockchain-technology is. Countries that would try to ban Cryptocurrencies would most likely be not just not successful, but getting in a disadvantage-situation. It's possible that Russia [changed it's opinion]( because of that. 
My concern now is more that they'll try to use the technology to track peoples money. And they target the more centralized points like exchanges: [Court Grants IRS Authority To Demand Identities Of Bitcoin Users At Coinbase]( Under the line the situation seems to be that they want to use the technology but of course, they don't like the currency.

What exactly are the genuine concerns? China is "far off"? Those Companies just claim they want to use Factom but there are no real customers? Any evidence for self-written press releases? And just by the way: The english articles (ibtimes) just picked up articles that were in the chinese news days before:  [iSoftStone, chin. article]( and [Ancun, chin. article]( And regarding iSoftStone there is already a confirmation that's not from Factom but from [iSoftStone itself]( So, you really believe it's all a big fake? 
@_date: 2016-02-28 21:32:15
Partially I absolutely agree. I do think that it's good to ask questions and also to be at such an event to ask questions and to get answers of those who want to speak. But it should be about informations and facts, not about personal attacks. I don't agree with all the accusations they spread around, often enough underlined with lies or that they speak with somebody and talking shit about that person afterwards, implicating quotes that never were made etc. In general it's too often too selfish and too much drama-show in my eyes to be good journalism. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 15:09:37
And why do you think Factom is seen as valuable partner by iSoftStone? Or why did Microsoft add it on azure? Or what is about the Shanghai Blockchain Hackathon: *"Third place went to the Medical Records team, which developed an idea, built on Factom, for a platform that uses blockchain technology to store medical records and prescriptions immutably, which could reduce the insurance fraud and costs with a simple medical history verification process."*  Or the winner of the hackathon, cargochain: *"In the future we intend to include Factom as an additional source to store document hashes at for further security/verification."*  They are all wrong and you are right with your "arguments"? ;-)

If the situation should turn into a worst-case-scenario (similar to MtGox for example) it would have huge impact on the price without much doubt. And while I would get my funds out if I would have an account on finex, I although believe that it's not the time for panic  regarding the price...yet. It's absolutely possible that finex is ok and that the suspension of withdrawals has it's cause only on bank-side. 
A reason to be carefully in case that one has funds on finex are these in my opinion - quote: 
- "Their site doesn’t have an about us page, so we don’t quite know. This led to some confusion last year, but their site still doesn’t list any personnel. It does not list any license number either, even though the company handles hundreds of millions." 
- "(...) in August 2016, the exchange was hacked out of nearly 120,000 bitcoins, worth at the time around $60 million, now worth just above $140 million. The exchange recently announced customers had been reimbursed the hacked funds, but where all this money came from no one can really say."

@_date: 2016-02-24 14:50:10
I understand your concerns. I bought into Factom because I believe it's the most promising project right now, and every time there is a new partnership I think I'm right. But if I forget my medicine I suddenly think: "Damn, those customers are unreal customers, working for fake-companies." I mean, one of my favorite movies is "Conspiracy Theory" and Fletcher was right with his visions. Can be scary! ;-)

It will be decentralized. Quoting Paul Snow: *"Milestone 3 is the last milestone. It will release the election protocol, which places the control of the federated servers in the hands of those purchasing Entry Credits."* 
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:26:29
Customers don't need to use or pay with an altcoin in Factom. They can pay with any currency (Dollar, Yen, Euro, whatever). The token is more like a protocol-currency to pay the federated server in a decentralized system. Here is an explanation of Paul Snow: 
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:23:55
Wow, a wish for more censorship and the reason is because it's in Bitcoin. I would bet a lot of money that something like that was unexpected in the more idealistic early days. Just by the way: Factom is a project built on top of bitcoin and I believe, if it will become successful it could turn out as good for Bitcoin. With other words: More than just one reason for me to disagree with your wish for more censorship here.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:56:16
Factom is dead? Where do you see that? Because of their [dead github]( or because of [zero volume?]( or maybe because [they don't communicate]( anymore, or because there are [no other news](

Did you read Paul Snow's posts in this thread? [This one for example]( . Please tell me how that would be possible without the blockchain? How would it be possible to avoid data-manipulation in a normal (and centralized) database? How would it be possible to prove that the data existed at all?

As far as I know there are no problems with Bitcoin-withdrawals, right? Because if that would appear (delays or even suspension) it would be a hard sign of real trouble. But that front seems ok until now...? 
@_date: 2016-02-06 02:09:56
I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. You believe any bank (or any company) would publish their data? Where would they publish all their data and who would audit it all and at which costs? How would that work with transactions? Would you like to see all of your transactions published? Or politicians would publish mails from today and they would do that today? Let's publish medical records? Other very personal data? How would you publish a work in progress *(edit: to have Proof of Process)*? Make it all open source? You have an idea (a song for example) and you want to prove your ownership so you publish it before the work is really done? And you say: *"in a data base you can see who logged in and made changes"* but in a centralized database it's possible to manipulate everything! But if all logins and all changes are hashed and timestamped into a system like Factom, manipulating becomes a lot harder. And how would it be possible to prove the negative without the blockchain? And just by the way: If it would be that easy, why it hasn't happened yet? I would really like to see just one exchange making all of their data public or one politician who would publish his mails nearly in real time (which would mean: mails = open letters). Would be fun to draw conclusions out of it. And of course: I wouldn't publish my conclusions. You? ;-). What I want to say with that: Something like that, if it would be realistic/possible, would open a lot of doors to new kinds of manipulations and misuse/abuse in a lot of different areas. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:13:59
I try to be realistic as well. But, let me share my view on it and you can decide if you agree or disagree: If buying cheap is a sign for being realistic I was realistic. I bought my cheapest FCT's at 22k and my average is somewhere at 70k, because I bought over time (also bought some at 250k) and did not sell. Maybe that's the main difference to you. 
But, more important: After it got my attention (right after it hit Polo) I believed to see potential because my question was: 
1. If Factom will be like it's planned - will there be demand for such a solution, will it be used? I still believe the answer is a big yes. 
2. Second question: Can it be done, is it possible? Yes. 
3. Will the Factom team be able to do it, are they serious and skilled in what they do? I believe yes, because I never saw any sign to believe something else. They are constantly working, highly active in all areas. Nearly every day updates in the github, they travel and educate about Factom, there is PR, there is communication with the community and so on. 
With other words: As an Investor I see all what I would like to see to believe in it's potential. And just some months after it's launch and before Milestone 2 of 3 there are already companies being interested in Factom. And I won't complain about it because that are "just" chinese companies (china could turn out as the biggest market!) while it's already added on Azure since december and without any bad signs on the horizon. Some months ago I would have considered it as unrealistic if somebody would have predicted the progress we've seen the last time. But I also would consider it as being unrealistic to expect that there won't be constant progress in future, regarding development and the business-side. And  I consider it as unrealistic to say Factom is ignored on other than the chinese markets in this early stage. Maybe I would say that if there would be several other projects like Factom with faster progress. Do you know any?

You have provided the answer to your own question: Why would MS add it to Azure? Because Factom gives them an additional service offering. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:35:18
You believe China is a 3rd word country? Export: 1st place. BIP: 2nd place. That might be a reason why Factom focusses on China. And maybe you should keep in mind that Factom has launched a couple of months ago. Next will be the release of Milestone 2 of 3. So Factom is not even totally finished yet, but obviously big companies are already interested. That's how you could see it if you would like to have a more positive view. ;-)

In that case many legit projects would be scams. Factom for example. It's the best project I know of. Factom already has partnerships, makes great progress a very skilled team etc. But they also hold parts of the premine and had an ICO. Reality is: Projects like that need funding. It's absolutely no reason to call something a scam. I hoped for more substance. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 13:53:23
All addresses are public and they are pretty open about the Nr. 1 - address about 1000 BTC. They call him a "chinese whale" and say that they know who he is. But: This is a big and very professional project. Da Hongfei (CEO) is very known and they have connections to other big names and all big exchanges and it's a very serious project with Fiat-implementation etc. It's definitely not a project of Kids like some other hyped up ICO's. It's more the other way around: While it's big in china it didn't get much attention from western Investors. We can talk about it again in some months. In my eyes this is a diamond in the Crypto-sand and will surprise.

@_date: 2016-02-24 15:12:29
Yes, you are right. I should have written "they **will** be able to (...)" because Factom is still in it's early stage. But it will be possible to buy Entry Credits without touching Crypto soon - after Milestone 2, which is expected in the first quarter of this year. So I'm basically right because I have some doubts that those deals will realize before M2 and at the same time it's close. And I'm not sure what you expect. That Factom should suddenly appear out of the nothing, completely finished, secure some deals on Monday and be widely used on Tuesday? I mean, do you think it's unrealistic to believe that Factom will become much more userfriendly for all kinds of Users and Customers in the near future (weeks and months)? And isn't it a promising sign that big companies announce that they plan to use Factom?

What I like is: They are big names in china (CEO is Da Hongfei) and deep in the Bitcoin-community and before all: Connections to all big chinese Bitcoin-exchanges because of the [Digital Asset Coalition Asia]( which is in fact a coalition of OKCoin, BTCC, HuoBi, BTCTRADE, YuanbaoHui and BITMAIN. Plus: ANS has former Huobi-Developers and there are a lot of hints that they will get listed on those exchanges. They didn't get much attention from western Investors, but once they hit Poloniex that is likely to change. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:41:02
It's good news that the pressure on the price is not caused by fundamental problems. At the same time the price was a bubble because (and considered the Gox-BTC are the main reason why it's down) the market didn't absorb those coins too well. Looking at the chart that's not really disputable. I believe that the Gox-Coins play a significant role but since in my opinion the price was in a bubble, they didn't cause the decline but intensified it. 
The real problem isn't that. It's the fear in the market --&gt; more selling is and will be anticipated if the Gox-Trustee doesn't decide (and make it public) to sell the rest OTC.

They got a ["verbal instruction"]( Most likely not that easy to explain in a blogpost. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:34:05
I have no doubt about their source of info because it seems they got it right from the regulators, but "verbally". What I really don't like, and that's a pattern since 2013: It seems as if China wants to bring down the market. They push out conflicting messages. First the ICO-ban, next day "we want to be on the forefront of blockchain-tech". Then a lot of rumors about banning exchanges, while today there have been more relaxing news first (no exchange ban but licenses etc.). And now the news are "exchanges" (unclear which ones) got verbal instructions. If they would make it really officially and as hard as they want it - it would be a huge hit but overcome, because then there would be clearness. But they prefer uncertainty and play it over time. That really is the same pattern how they acted in late 2013.

It's probably true that a majority of ICO's are "low quality" or even scams. Many of those projects will fail. But to simply say "ICO's are cancer" is totally superficial and ignorant. ICO's will play an important role in finance and while you say that mostly naive and greedy people invest, ICO's open doors to more equal chances to people with "small money". Basically everybody can invest in what he or she believes in. That can be shit or innovation but without any doubt: Innovation is happening in the ICO-space. It's simply about self-responsibility. Ignorance (ICO's are cancer) and arrogance (naive and greedy ppl) go hand in hand and that is absolutely nothing new. I would call that naive.

I think most ppl will agree if we state that only decentralized blockchains are real blockchains. And the problem is: It needs the token as financial incentive to support the blockchain. If somebody wants the blockchain-tech but not the cryptocurrency on top of it - that might turn out as a problem. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:13:17
The pattern I speak of is not that they are stupid and not that there is a problem with their official communication. It's about how they communicate in-officially, over media or even just as "verbal instruction". That can be done over time and of course it leads to rumors first and a lot of uncertainty. And I believe that is strategic. 
Of course one also could say that they try to find a good way over time, that they act carefully and that the communication only reflects naturally conflicting opinions. But I tend more to believe the "strategy-theory", also because of the timing. 
Just btw: I don't blame them or anybody. And I don't hold Bitcoin since some time. I'm just annoyed about the impossibility to ever figure out what is going on over there.

I don't see it that way. Even other Blockchains than Bitcoin are not necessarily opposed to Bitcoin. But before all: Especially Lykke is in no way opposed to Bitcoin since it's a semi-decentralized exchange built on the Bitcoin-Blockchain - [technical overview]( And since all kinds of value can be transferred on the blockchain, including real world assets as colored coins (Lykke focuses very much on that), I don't see why one should be critical about it. 
I even believe that the hype about Blockchain in general is also good for Bitcoin, because  1. competition is needed to ensure ongoing innovation and 2. I believe the advantages of Bitcoin (Blockchain) will become even more obvious, at least in comparison to "private Blockchains". 3. Everything what is "Crypto" is also part of a growing Bitcoin-economy.
@_date: 2016-10-25 14:13:11
I believe that other Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-projects even strengthen Bitcoin, even if totally independent (technically). Besides the market around it (speculation with Bitcoin in the "Alt-sector") it becomes clear that it wouldn't make any sense to attack Bitcoin. It's a "the ghost is out of the bottle - effect".

Imagine you offer an exchange-platform that people are excited about: They'll send Fiat and Bitcoin to your platform and exchange it - some buy and others sell Bitcoin and since you are a good guy people are free to deposit or withdraw whenever they want.

Greece is still part of the Euro-zone, so it's currency is stable. But I'm sure that Greece will have to leave the Euro (and not just Greece). I believe in general that the more the banking-system and Fiat-Currencies will come into trouble, and there is no other scenario, it's only about time, the more attractive Bitcoin (but also the whole Crypto and Blockchain-market around) will look like also for those who wouldn't think about it without a crisis. That's a reason why I'm more pro to increase the Blocksize because a huge financial-crisis-scenario in the EU could be near.

If we wouldn't know the news we would probably call it "healthy correction" (-2,94% until now). But yes, bleeding could continue since the arguments for the rejection are unlikely to change from today until the CBOE-ETF-decision. 
Interesting is: If the SEC delays the decision regarding the CBOE-ETF it's likely that ppl will see something positive in it like "They don't disapprove right away, so it must be different!". So I hope they'll delay the "no) until 2019. ;-)

It's a market reaction because of fear that the hacked amounts could be dumped at once. The first time the FBI announced to sell the Silk-Road-Bitcoins the price also dropped (I believe the second auction as well). And if just one of Satoshis Bitcoins would move the market would go down as well. It's about the fear of huge amounts in one hand. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:11:59
Unlikely. Corporations like that operate with billions of $. And besides the fact that Bitcoin is still a high-risk-investments the market is also still too small for the amounts of money big corporations are interested in. They would have to fear that they drive the price up and Satoshi dumps on them. ;-) Even more a problem: If corporations would invest it would be like a huge marketing-campaign for Bitcoin. More and more usual people would invest as well and the number of transactions would explode ---&gt; blocksize-limit ---&gt; fee-event. Bitcoins limitations would become very obvious. In my opinion Bitcoin is not ready for that.

While watching that interview, I again had the impression (I already know Lykke) that it's something that is underrated now because Lykke doesn't get that much attention in this early days, but it will be recognized more and more because they're fast in making progress. 
I really believe this project will have impact - and not just as another exchange. It's a great combination of the professionalism and expertise and also idealism. 
By the way, speaking about that: This is a very interesting speech of Richard Olsen (CEO of Lykke) that can give an impression about Lykke even if it's not directly about the project: [The power of the small world phenomenon](

Take a look at [Lykke]( They offer a combination of Wallet-App and semi-decentralized exchange - [technical overview]( - and they focus very much on user-friendliness and security. If you should install the app you get 12 backup words and I'm not totally sure but it already could possible to do that step offline. At least I know that they plan a cold-storage feature since one of their goals is to reduce all possible risks for the consumer to near-to-zero.

The biggest mystery for me is his first blog-post. And I don't know of any rational scenario that makes sense to me. Kind of funny is: It doesn't even make sense for an (rational) imposter.

What's very interesting in general: Nearly all what everybody does is compensation. The more somebody feels uncertain, dissatisfied, rejected, powerless, (...) the more intense the wish becomes to compensate that. If there is no real way to solve such problems, ppl start "dreaming", imaginations for their own, combined with hoping of course (soon...it will be better - everybody knows this "soon"). If there is a lot they have to hide of others, maybe because it's humiliating (in their own eyes), the more they try to impersonate an ideal-self in front of others - some even in front the own family/woman/children etc. That's something that leads into psychological-isolation (not necessarily physical lonliness). And if the intensity increases, and it's suffering, it can lead into overreactions. And overreactions are destructive and/or self-destructive. What CSW did so far was both. And I believe, we just recognize the tip of an iceberg.  
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:25:19
Nothing wrong about criticism and skepticism regarding G.A.. 
1. He had to handle a much more complex situation, also regarding the psychological aspect.
2. There is no totally "right" in that situation and no chance to be totally safe.
3. He has the right to believe whatever he believes and he never said CSW is in fact Satoshi.
4. He did more for Bitcoin than 99.9999% of all of us.
5. **While it's always right to be skeptical and also critical, he doesn't deserve a shitstorm**

Satoshi also holds a massive quantity of Bitcoin. If the value of transactions would be counted it's very likely that Alts would peak even more, because whoever wants to move money fast in the crypto-space will think about it if to use Bitcoin or something more practical.

Absolutely agree! And, btw, Gavin Andresen:
"Yeah, what the heck?
I was as surprised by the ‘proof’ as anyone, and don’t yet know exactly what is going on.
It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his– I assumed his post would simply be a signed message anybody could easily verify.
And it was probably a mistake to even start to play the Find Satoshi game, but I DO feel grateful to Satoshi.
If I’m lending credibility to the idea that a public key operation should remain private, that is entirely accidental. OF COURSE he should just publish a signed message or (equivalently) move some btc through the key associated with an early block.

My speculation is: He needed money. So he told some people out of his own milieu that he is Satoshi (but "psssst, don't tell any one") and that he is sitting on &gt; 1 Mio BTC, but locked in a trust (Tulip). They help him now with money, they will get it back later - and more. Who wouldn't like to know the secret of a legend and help this hero - plus: get it back later and much more? The more people he told this story, the more evidence he needed. So he doctored blogposts, mails etc. It's kind of a natural development out of the first stories about "I'm Satoshi, but psssst" (maybe not even for money but like a boy tries to impress a girl with a hero-fairytale) to a huge story built on many lies to defend the lies before, to doctored material, to leaking it to the press, etc. Something like that can lead into a weird and self-supporting dynamic. There is always the need to build more on top to not get outed. It becomes also a psychological dynamic, like "self-hypnotizing". It's as if somebody believes in the own lies, becomes the person he tries to imitate. And Satoshi is a projection. It's possible to mix the own believe of "nobody knows, but I'm a genius" and the own personality with imaginations about "how could Satoshi really be?" and public informations about him. Such a psychological dynamic can be much more complex and self-supporting than many would believe. But: If you build lie on lie, you will need more and more convincing stuff. His masterpiece was to convince Bitcoin-VIP's, maybe he even hoped that would give him the final peace. But it wasn't possible to give proof to the public. And now it's again about the tulip-trust which I believe, never existed. If I'm right with my theory: A lot of people gave him money because they believed his story. Most likely people near to him. Gavin Andresen and John Matonis were not the targets. He needed them to convince. If you convince Gavin Andresen and he says "Yes, I believe him" it's enough to convince those you owe money. But... it's much harder now and I would make a bet, he gets a lot of mails and phone calls, a lot of questions if the tulip trust exists, if he ever will be able to pay back etc. 
Just a theory, maybe totally wrong. But that's my personal scenario at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:07:12
I believe it's more a psychological dynamic (drama), that it began with some kind of "imagination" like 12 year olds dreaming about being a super-hero or whatever. Wright could fit into that because there are signs that he sees himself as a misunderstood genius. He also shows some will to let the world know that, he shows vanity and craving for being recognized how he would like to see himself (an idealized self). That would explain why people around him seem to believe he is Satoshi. It would simply be because it could have started like *"Hey, I never told you but I have a secret. It's so hard to be the only one who knows, but did you ever hear about Bitcoin? I'm the creator... but please, never tell anybody."* (of course, more complex in reality and just speculation). The thing is: Something like that can grow and it isn't just a simple lie. It has impact on the own personality. It's as if somebody forgets sometimes that it's a lie which leads into a behavior (reactions on questions for example) that seems very consistent - because it is psychological consistent. It's hard to explain why, but we all play roles in different situations. The more intense those situations are the more we believe a role is real. It's not even unnormal regarding the principle. The difference is more about intensity and how separated a role is from our "day-self" (how we are in a normal situation). Regarding Satoshi the separation is part of the reality, separation is part of the role. What I try to say is: Even those aspects that are not consistent can be used to let it seem even more real. Satoshi is not perfect? Who would expect him to be... he is just a human, right? Satoshi has tax-problems, has a more or less shady past? Why should he be perfect. He acts like being mad/stupid/irrational? Genius and insanity go hand in hand. psychologically broken? Who wouldn't believe it after years of hiding parts of his life? Satoshi is nearly perfect as a projection-base because it's not just possible to project weaknesses in it. It's needed to make it real.  
***highly speculative of course****

The economist already steps back and demands more proof:
"HAS another Satoshi bitten the dust? Only 90 minutes after Craig Wright, an Australian businessman and computer scientist, had posted online what he claimed to be proof that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, it was debunked as fake on Reddit, a website. Instead of providing a digital signature, which would show that he is indeed Mr Nakamoto (because only he could have the cryptographic key to generate it), he posted a string of numbers that is publicly available and can be copied and pasted by anybody who knows where to look."
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:05:15
Maybe it's because of my limited english, but with "act" before all I mean the first Blog-post, wich is totally misleading. Or to say he would prefer to stay anonymous but sitting in front of a TV-Camera for his Satoshi-Outing. I believe V. Buterin is right and CSW choose the noisy way - which is hard to understand and not in line with his own words. The whole story has a lot of irrational aspects, a lot of manipulative aspects. It's not even possible anymore to write about it in a short post. It would already need a book. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:56:25
Quote: *"Here's what happened.
On Monday evening, I suggested to Wright's PR firm that if he could send me a fraction of a coin from an early Bitcoin block - which of course I would return - that might show he had Satoshi's keys. But Wright's team came up with a different plan on Wednesday afternoon.
They sent me a draft blog in which he outlined a scheme that would see Matonis, Andresen and the BBC all send small amounts of Bitcoin to the address used in the first ever transaction. Then he would send it back, in what would be the first outgoing transactions from the block since January 2009. We went ahead with our payments - I sent 0.017BTC (about £5), which you can still see in the online records. Matonis and Andresen sent similar amounts.
Then we waited. And waited. Then my phone rang - with the news that the whole operation was "on hold", with no reason given.
Eighteen hours later we are still waiting for the payments to be made - and now Wright's new blog says that is not going to happen."*

Yes. I don't think it would be a better metric than marketcap. But all these theories miss one point anyway, a very simple fact: The alt-market also becomes stronger because Bitcoin is stuck. And that is a result of ignorance plus arrogance in my opinion. I'm absolutely no fan of BU but I believe: Bitcoin and the community would be in a much better situation if core would have agreed to increase the blocksize - also Segwit would most likely already be there or close. Many celebrate the high price but I believe that it's pretty much a worst-case situation and that there is the possibility that Bitcoin becomes irrelevant once the celebration about the price turns into the opposite. The price will come down at a point (it's a natural), Alts will fly even more because ppl push their BTC into Alts, and if nothing changes: Bitcoin will still be stuck between two fronts or split. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:37:26


It's not just that way, because the market is never independent in it's decisions. If a majority of miners would make a decision for one chain and promote that, it would't be without any impact on the market. If you add some companies and "VIP's" it would have even more power. 
In my opinion all economical-systems are psychological-feedback-system and since everybody who would want to analyze such a system is such a system himself and part of it - there are no objectives to find. And in terms of Bitcoin I consider the race as open, maybe for years.

Didn't she also say somewhere on twitter that CSW told her at that time he is Satoshi? I ask because it seems as if he was pretty vocal about it.

It's not just about Block 1 but also about Block 9, because there is not just G.A. but also Jon Matonis: ["For cryptographic proof in my presence, Craig signed and verified a message using the private key from block  newly-generated coins and from block  newly-generated coins (the first transaction to Hal Finney)."](
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:32:47
No, something will happen. What I wonder is: I have a lot of doubts that CSW is Satoshi, but at the same time there is a lot that implies some kind of proximity to Satoshi. He must have some knowledge to convince Gavin Andresen, he doesn't seem to fear that the real Satoshi outs him as Impostor, it seems to be true that he holds a tremendous amount of Bitcoin and so on. 
His acting is in no way what ppl would expect from Satoshi, but if he is not, it's not unlikely that he knows who Satoshi was (in that scenario I believe Satoshi is dead). Of course, it's highly speculative but in the current situation there is near to nothing not speculative. 
In short: If he is not Satoshi or a member of a (former) "Satoshi-team", I believe that he could be close enough that the truth could come out - that the current situation maybe leads to the real Satoshi. Not sure if that would be good or bad, but I don't believe that this story will come to an end soon.

But Gavin Andresen says this: *“He signed, in my presence, using the private key from block one—block number one, the very first mined Bitcoin block, (...)"* 
If Wright really is Satoshi he has the private key from Block 1, and the other way around: If he doesn't have it he can't be Satoshi - but somehow he was able to deceive G.A.

Of course one can simply say all is fine and Bitcoin just becomes expensive and something like the "gold-standard" and "non-trivial". Nothing wrong with that, but there is a risk: If that should continue there is a high possibility that Bitcoin will lose relevance because there is a demand for "cheap". And since the whole sector is highly innovative it is likely that another Cryptocurrency (maybe several) will overtake - at least if we think in 5-10 years.

It's all about the tulip-trust-message, which looks doctored/fictional in my opinion. I also don't believe that the trust would send a message to JVP who would have to give it to CSW and on it's way to him he uses a slack channel first, to blast it out to the world. Quote: *"I also have a message for Dr. Wright from the trustee of the Tulip trust that is controlling the coins that he wants to move."* I don't even understand why there should be a trust. But even if, this all wouldn't make much sense. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:05:09
There is one little problem in that scenario: He was (was he?) able to prove it to Andresen and Matonis (signing Block 1 and 9). If he isn't able to do the same for the public, it raises some questions. Also the "excuses" doesn't fit in my eyes. His post is under the line: "Sorry, I don't want to/ I can't". The tulip-message is "The trust doesn't allow it". It's as if there is more irrationality than strategy. And I don't believe the tulip-trust-story. I don't think that it makes sense. Safe is: They wanted the message out there and that shows intention. In my opinion it's just rushed out damage-control and sand in the eyes. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:46:53
Jon Matonis is convinced that Wright is Satoshi and tbh, he (Matonis) also sounds convincing for me: 
"During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical. Based on what I witnessed, it is my firm belief that Craig Steven Wright satisfies all three categories. For cryptographic proof in my presence, Craig signed and verified a message using the private key from block  newly-generated coins and from block  newly-generated coins (the first transaction to Hal Finney). The social evidence, including his unique personality, early emails that I received, and early drafts of the Bitcoin white paper, points to Craig as the creator. I also received satisfactory explanations to my questions about registering the bitcoin.org domain and the various time-of-day postings to the BitcoinTalk forum. Additionally, Craig's technical working knowledge of public key cryptography, Bitcoin's addressing system, and proof-of-work consensus in a distributed peer-to-peer environment is very strong. 
According to me, the proof is conclusive and I have no doubt that Craig Steven Wright is the person behind the Bitcoin technology, Nakamoto consensus, and the Satoshi Nakamoto name."
Edit: I'm not so convinced anymore:

We agree too often. ;-) The problem I see is: Bitcoin is an attack on the financial industry. All decentralized cryptocurrencies are. Factom found an elegant way to combine and to connect both worlds. And I would love it if it should become true what you say *"When people start getting routinely paid in Bitcoin (...)"*, but what I believe is: 
National states will go Crypto. Yuan, Dollar, Euro - on Blockchains. But of course, totally controlled and with a lot of features to control us even more. I mean, I hope I'm wrong but I think it's a possibility. And they will fight Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies they can't control - even more if ppl should use it as flight-opportunity. And I believe we will see that as well. The next crash could be near. 
In short words: In my opinion, the fight has not even really started yet. I really doubt that we will witness a time where people get paid in a decentralized currency without control of the state/s we live in. They won't hand it over to nerds. ;-)

It wasn't necessarily meant as "we" have learned from it. I for myself am not a coder and I believe it's needed to be one to be able to determine what's good in ETH and what is not. I personally don't believe that a very complex system will be the solution. But what we can see as fact: A lot of companies are paying attention. IBM and Samsung for example. A guy from IBM even commented on the HF and ETC. And I have some doubts that they've learned nothing yet, but just watching the show.

I don't think that it's that unlikely that G.A. and J.M. were deceived. But what I wonder is, if Wright is not Satoshi: How can he be so sure that the real Satoshi wouldn't react on him. The real Satoshi would be able to end his claims with a single signed message. So, my conclusion is: If Wright is not Satoshi at least he seems to know more about him, maybe that the real Satoshi is dead. But that would imply that he was near to him in some way. 
If he is Satoshi... I don't understand why he wants to prove it for the public without being able to do it until now. If he was able to prove it for G.A., using the key of Block 1, it shouldn't be a problem to do exactly that yesterday....today...now.

I've mentioned Factom as an example for what I would like to see, if possible, for smart contracts. And they've found a good solution in my opinion. While they use a cryptocurrency (Factoids) to pay decentralized server, customers don't need to touch it. They can buy Entry Credits (no currency, not transferable, just to get access) for Dollar and in a fixed price. Not sure if you mean something like that with *"What is missing is the connection between digital tokens and the analog world."* but what I believe is a barrier for potential customers: high volatility, regulatory issues etc. Factom solved that problem. And maybe something like that could be a economical design to copy for a smart-contract-project. And: Anchoring in Bitcoin.

Crypto is and should be about self-responsibility. And besides Scams (and there are also a lot of Scam-Schemes out there that didn't start with an ICO) Crowdfundings are a legit agreement between Dev-teams and Investors and in best case a win-win. Investors help to pay those who have the skills to realize innovative ideas. Not all will survive, but not all projects that will fail are planned Scams. 
Calling the SEC is pointless. Who believes they see Bitcoin more positive than ICO-projects must be a dreamer.

I get lost when it comes to knowledge about coding ;-) ...but of course, I've read some articles since the DAO-disaster and some say that solidity is flawed, some go beyond, and what is obvious even for noops: ETH-Devs were not able to develop theDAO secure. So, yes. Seems to be kind of ambitious to code something on and to feel safe with ETH. 
But, the question is if smart contracts can be done in a much better way. I have no clue about those deeply technical things. I believe it's maybe to early for smart contracts. That it will need years to find out how to do it. 
That was always my concern with Ethereum. I mean, the chance that it starts in 2014/15 and will be the leading platform in 2020 - near to zero in my opinion. But I'm also not so sure if it will be Bitcoin. I hope it, but I believe we will see a lot of innovation in the coming years. And if Ethereum would be better, the chance would have been high that it would go on top. With other words: Should be something like that show up in future (a most perfect ethereum) - why should Bitcoin stay on top? I'm really not sure. Maybe we will see something like "google" in Crypto in some years and nothing else will have much chance any more. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:02:38
I basically agree with what you say about Ethereum. I'm not sure if Bitcoin will still be leading in 10 years, but I would like it if. 
Question: Do you know of any project with a focus on smart-contracts that has chances to deliver quality and to reach the "real-business-world"? 
My view on Ethereum always was and still is, that it has a lot of value as a scientific-project, as something to learn about/from and I believe that's still the case, maybe even because all the mistakes they've made. But I don't know of any project I would say: Yes, that could become the leading platform for smart contracts. But tbh: My knowledge about that is very limited. That's why I ask.
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:40:06
Yes, I hope you'll be right and Bitcoin will be a base for a lot of good projects to build on top and around it - which would also be more decentralized than a "one-in-all-system" like Ethereum. 
What I would like to see is a project like Factom, for example, with a focus on smart contracts. That's why I've asked about CP. And yes, you could be right that it came out too early and it's expectable that there will be professional competitors in future, most likely more than just 2 or 3.

That might be that those BTC are on some kind of list or you are under suspicion? For example: Would it be possible for you to make transparent how you got the BTC?
