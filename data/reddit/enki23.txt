Would be even more convenient if the store was in Colonia del Sacramento, which can be reached from Buenos Aires by ferry in ~30 minutes. Argentinians used to stand in line at the Colonia ATMs for hours to withdraw USD.

Coinbase's Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, would tell you the same thing. You don't get these banking relationships unless you're already big, were early, or get someone (hedge fund, venture fund) to vouch for you.

The algorithms can be updated. See 
Realistically, we're probably still decades away from practical Quantum Computing. I'm not losing any sleep over this.
(In a previous life I've worked and published on quantum cryptography)

That's why we should make a protocol change that requires all blocks to be padded to full size.
That way empty and full blocks propagate at the same speed, and there are no incentives for miners to mine/propagate empty blocks.

Hey if you're interested in chatting with us (we might not always be responsive - we'll try to tune out from internet while discussing/coding) come here:

I've worked with erlang before, and it's not very easy to get developers that can actually wrap their mind around the syntax and architecture.
Having something that's readable by a lot of people is a big advantage.
v8 (node's vm) is one of the fastest VMs out there. about 5x faster than python. Also I think the problem is mostly I/O bound not CPU bound.

working on it with a team in sf right now. let me know if you're local!
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:41:42
send me more info of who you are and what you can code and how you think you might be able to add value to enki :D

finally i understand
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:41:08
think about it as an executable spec, that's easy to implement in whatever language once needed

Having worked 16 hour days for two weeks with a kick-ass team: I don't think so.
We're - what's the opposite of dead? - alive and kicking ass!
Short status update here:

skip lists, b-trees, whatever data structure you want for having cheap inserts into the buy/sell order books. the most important step is to move the work from disk to memory. :D

Thanks! Right now early coders who can help shape the fledgling codebase are what's needed most, but just keep us in mind and spread the word! :D

I've seen how TradeHill operated with fiat while it was doing 10-15% of the 2011 volume (second largest exchange at the time). 
I intend to support what I believe to be efficient workflows based on that experience.
There's a chance I might start a reference exchange down the line, but I am intentionally not thinking that far. I don't think the money is in running an exchange, but in making Bitcoin succeed for all of us.

@_date: 2013-04-14 16:24:04
oh, and yeah.. we write the initial spec in node. if a million times faster than current exchanges won't be good enough, we'll rewrite the tiny portion that is the matching engine in whatever language until it's even faster
