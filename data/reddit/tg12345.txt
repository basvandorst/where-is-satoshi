What?  I thought breadwallet was a good wallet for iPhone.  Will my BTC have no value if I stay with breadwallet?  This fork crap is confusing.  I just want to hold my BTC.  Maybe I should just use a paper wallet?  I ordered a Trezor the other day based on this board's advice...will I be safe once that arrives?

Thanks Rusty.  I will look into hardware wallets.

No, my BTC holdings are kinda by accident.  A few programs I work with (Bodog/Bovada for one) will only pay commission in BTC since about a year ago.  I'd heard of Bitcoin, but I was more or less forced to figure out how to accept it as payment, etc.  Calvin Ayre seems to be pretty heavily into BTC.  He's a facebook friend. :)

Thanks Bankless.  I'll start with Trezor, since Rusty mentioned that one as well.

Thanks.  Why do you say I should leave some coins in Coinbase?  My ether is there, just because that seemed to be the simplest wallet.

Thanks Cannon.  I guess breadwallet isn't "cold storage"?  I appreciate the advice.  I'll look that up next.

Thanks everyone!  I wasn't expecting so much help so quickly. :) Great community.  So, I guess I'll get a Trezor hardware wallet.

Thanks Cannon.

Wow man, I really appreciate the time you took.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:28:56
I get a few every month from my business.  I'll be a hundredaire soon enough. :) Thanks for the reply.

Okay, so that was another question I had.  If I have the coins on a Trezor and the fork happens, can I use them on either side of the fork?  Core or Unlimited?  And why are they screwing around with it?  I've read some other threads but I don't understand the driving force behind the whole mess...

As long as you're cool with being a lazy fat-ass, no big deal.  What did you need to buy?  inb4 pint

I'm sitting here thinking about doing almost the same thing as you.  I can cash out most but hold on to 21.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:54:36
.1 BTC for anyone who helps me get them.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:42:10
Okay, if any of you can actually help me recover this, I'll send you .1 BTC as a fee. :) I've jost gotten tired of looking at this stupid balance that I can't use...
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:01:42
I've got a couple transactions hung up today...seems like bitcoin is going to shit...
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:36:39
Wow!  Thank you so much for your reply.  I will take this information back to the people who attempted to send it to me back then and see if they are aware that the transaction never took place.  I really appreciate the time you took.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:39:07
Hmm...I click on "View at blockexplorer.com" and "View at blockchain.info" on Multibit and it shows me transaction not found.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:37:20
I don't seem to be able to figure out how to post a picture.  I think this might be the transaction ID:  02a1e2c2aa58e1fb3bfd821202137c84b4b263728997985f7d283bc79c0ac017
