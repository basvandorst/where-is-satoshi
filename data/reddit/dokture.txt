Hang in there man. Looks like a waiting game. You will have better luck if you post in [Coinbase](

Kill the ego and get back with us.

Dude, nobody knows.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:43:16
What are you getting at? Do what you have to do and get over it. You think you are the only that has to go through this lengthly process? Who else remembers the only way to find a thorough guide on acquiring Bitcoins wisely was on the Dark Net? As Walter would say - "Fucking Amateurs".  
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:25:47
Buy what you are willing to buy and get on with your life. Our lives do not revolve around BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:31:39
How much are you asking for the BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:12:18
Why don't you go create an account on coinbase.com? Don't you think you will find the answers to your questions there?
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:39:22
Took 16 business days back when I did it in August. Can anyone imagine how long it would take now given how popular Bitcoin is becoming...
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:58:45
Here is what you could do. Locate all the MultBit folders and data on your computer including the .wallet, .key, and ect. Then drag those fuckers to a jump drive. I believe this is the right way, but I could be wrong. Insight would be appreciate.

"What's that based on?"
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:14:35
They call this 'no discipline' and 'fine greed'. Your life should revolve around one them. The choice is yours.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:18:08
Do you buy coins through your bank account on coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:59:01
and an interesting experience nonetheless. Best of luck!

Yes she is down. She will be back up in roughly 4 minutes. Maybe 7 mins if she has to wipe her face off.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:17:46
No discipline!!!
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:19:03
Congrats OP! Keep it real!
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:05:27
Losing all hope is freedom. It's your money. Invest what you are willing to invest and carry on with your life. You're not the contents of your wallet anyways. Let the chips fall where they may.

Sources claim Metta World Peace of the New York Knicks is changing his name to Metta World Bitcoin. Why you ask? We do not know.

It'll just be a matter of time before we say.."Man! I should of bough at $814.03.." 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:42:09
This is a terrible way to prove your point IMO
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:00:14
Where would you fall?
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:34:11
144BTC x $725 = $104,400. Not $109,100,000. Sorry but you are a bit off pal. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:33:18
Don't make this so hard on yourself. Go up to someone and say "Excuse me, do you have change for a dollar?" Problem solved mate.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:44:31
Are you a total noob to *research*  too?
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:45:14
You're right. My mistake. Sorry OP!
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:50:18
The washer and dryer may in fact damage the BTC. Head over to the sink and use some ketchup on the BTC. I heard that works great!
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:00:21
Each time Bitcoin goes "down" it will be higher than the previous "down". Since you believe in Bitcoin long-term buy at anytime.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:09:45
Make new addresses is simple and no big deal. Don't be so hard on yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:23:01
This is only if you go through eBay. Next time message the buyer and ask if he would be willing go straight through pay-pal instead of ebay. However, there must be mutual trust between you guys. Anyways, if you do it this way you will receive your money instantly and dodge the ebay fees.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:19:24
Withdraw from an ATM. Then purchase a MoneyPak card or a Vanilla Reloaded card from Walgreens, Wal-mart, ect..Head over to localbitcoins.com and find a seller that accepts one of the cards mentioned above. There you go, you are now set.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:14:37
localbitcoins.com has several payment options. If everything goes according to plan you could have coins within hours.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:11:52
Yes you can. It won't be by any means "quickly" though.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:43:49
Do your own research, make your own choice. Learn to lead not follow.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:07:25
Abusing the system does not make you an advocate. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:38:57
Dude, what are you talking about? They have drop down box for you to pick USD or BTC..
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:37:51
Why wouldn't you make a post BEFORE signing the contract wondering if it would be good or bad?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:56:00
Your post is as frivolous as your diet.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:23:00
Took an aganizing 16 business days back in august. May take longer given how much attention btc is getting since then
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:48:20
Financial ligo? C'mon mate..reading the graph is common knowledge. Nothing hard about it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:12:18
You might have misunderstood me when I say go straight through pay-pal. When you go straight through pay-pal eBay is not involved whatsoever. Anyways your right, no biggie. Bitcoin to the moon! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:06:17
Sell shit on eBay that you know people really would really want and accept Bitcoin and Bitcoin only for the payment.
