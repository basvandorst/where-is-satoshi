If I was a cop the marketplace would be called DonutRoad and we would all be morbidly obese

If I see that there is a significant enough demand for anything that it is worth more than the potential amount of customers we will lose I will add it regardless of my morality, relevant statistics could be easily obtained with quick surveys.
Anything you buy on a black market could potentially be obtained by violence, violent people tend to have self harming tendencies and don't last long in the business.

It has a couple of items, items are scarce the same way they were in the early days of SR 1.0

I had hoped to have an intelligent discussion, I don't really like chatting with junkies/degenerates the breeding of which is tragically a price we have to pay for our liberty. I am sure that there are plenty of brilliant people there too so I have opened another discussion there anyway.

They laughed at my nose...

Given the choice I wouldn't buy alcohol from a drunken Russian that boiled it in his bathtub and sells it by weight to addicts, I would buy a bottle of wine in a high class restaurant.

Fees are hedged against USD and adjust automatically according to number of sellers, we review sellers carefully and ban ones that seem to cause trouble. Paying legal fees for troubled buyers would also be pretty amazing if implemented correctly.

It is moderated, we will step in and resolve any problems should they occur, we also have categories that change according to the needs of the public so you can't post something if the public doesn't demand it.
I guess you meant a second marketplace which specializes more in soft narcotics rather than other highly illegal goods? No we haven't considered a second one however I encourage others to open one independently if they are up for it knowledge wise.

Not only that, once the snowball is going I will disappear into the void, you will not hear from me neither on the forums or in the media.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:25:16
I guess we think that the benefits that we bring to the table by being centralized outweigh the additional taint and other cons provided by multisig, we want purchasing goods to be as easy as possible.

I am not going to get into the nitty gritty technical details, if you are so sure in its success implement it in your own market, we will have no choice but to follow along with the rest.

I am not belittling anyone, so far all of you have been great. I have previously made a discussion on SR and was contacted by sellers that are barely capable of writing coherent sentences let alone use PGP. We are trying to get honest sellers as well as honest buyers, in a free market it would be the sellers responsibility to stop selling and help the customer to get off drugs should he get addicted, most marketplaces encourage junkies on the contrary.

If you want you can try different exploits as a user with standard privileges, our admins try different exploits every day with raised privileges, how can you possibly get any less obscure than that without undermining our efforts?
Should we give you the details such as what firewall/OS/webserver we're running? You guys are hilarious.

There are 3 PGP keys that belong to GR, one for support, a global one and a single personal one for the original LordVoldemort.

Rather show his mom my magic stick, seems like a much more humane and elegant solution.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:14:56
It's like wearing iron armor and considering upgrading to titanium while your crotch is fully exposed plus it would take more time for potential buyers to reach our marketplace over i2p so it just seems like an unneeded hassle, at least until we see other marketplaces go down due to tor.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:01:25
We bring a lot of new things to the table, there is however no viable alternative to us holding all the account balances. Until some kind of decentralized marketplace comes along my best advice to buyers is deposit a little over the cost of the product(s) that you want to purchase and never use any marketplace for storing wealth.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:30:02
Yes, I have the foreskin of a moose.

I wouldn't speak for everyone, I'm sure that I'm not alone and that there are many people similar to me.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:52:51
I doubt that child sex slaves, gore, vore, CP or snuf films will ever make it to the categories. I am an anarcho-capitalist, such content would serve no higher purpose than to shock the average pot smoker looking to buy, it will be counter-productive in the long run. I am however pretty sure that explosives will make it, firearms will make it without a doubt.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:02:49
What leads to tor hidden services getting popped isn't the tor network, it's the nature of men and their foolish ways. I have yet to see one marketplace go down because it's on the tor network, the achilles heel are the admins, not tor.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:20:26
I am not scared because I am not doing anything wrong, I am concerned for my future sure but who isn't?
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:28:09
PGP is forced client side if JS is enabled (which we don't recommend to enable but take advantage of in case it is), if not then we encrypt the message as soon as it reaches us server side, this is done by default so no plaintext messages are ever stored. It is still flawed in a sense that we could potentially be compromised or get compromised along the way and begin storing plaintext copies however it's a step forward regardless.
We also have very open forums and no undercover annoying admins that contradict themselves with every post, our whole approach is different.
The emphasis so far has been on security, I would love to tell you all the details but that would defeat the purpose :)

Snuf films are not always obtained by violence let alone organs, some people agree to be killed/eaten on a voluntary basis, plenty of people sell organs.
Just to be clear I am not pro or anti organ selling nor snuf films when it comes to the marketplace, I will list it regardless based on whether the public deems it appropriate and it making financial sense not because I am seeking to maximize profits but because I favor evolution.
You're welcome, thank you too for asking them.

No I just give up on the morning twinkies and cheerios.

If I was a drug user I wouldn't buy from a dealer that sells to people who are obviously addicted since trust is a big issue and it is indicative of a lack of morals. If that person is willing to sell to the addicted or willing to exploit addicted women then what stops him from crossing you when the opportunity presents itself and there is a  strong financial incentive?

Everyone is entitled  to his own opinion.

We are superior, we have put a lot more time into development, we are better organized and we force PGP on every message on the road. I am not trying to pitch anything to anyone, all I want is for people to remember us once all the others scam or crash, everyone already had their share of disastrous bugs, we had none.

Our line of work prevents us from enjoying the luxury of using illegal substances, even ones that are widespread in use such as marijuana.
