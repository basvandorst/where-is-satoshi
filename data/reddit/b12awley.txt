You actually trade bitcoin for siacoin to use Sia...so there's one example for you.

Best news I've read all day.

Someone higher up on the thread said you haven't lost until you've sold. Everyone is losing value right now, just like you, but just hodl if you want to get back to where you were.

I almost did the same thing in a panic, but my wife is smart and talked me off the ledge. She's the one who's hodling.

No no.  The 10,000USD in less than 12 parsecs is the best news; I lol'd

Well there is a bank in the middle of the CC transaction, so they aren't really that comparable to btc transactions. It could take a year to verify your CC transaction, but the bank is still going to credit the merchant and take the funds from your account at the time of purchase.

For fraudulent CC transactions, the merchant is probably covered by insurance, so they don't actually have to trust you. They do have to trust the bank and the insurance company are going to take care of them though.  And you make double spending sound like you can just do it and get your coin and stuff for free every time, like there are no safeguards built in and a merchant is taking some big fraud risk accepting bitcoin.

If Ripple can do in seconds what SWIFT can do in days, why wouldn't banks use it?  Plus, banks get a discount on transaction fees for using XRP, which will be protect from price flux by escrow type services when it is fully implemented.

Haha that was easy

I would agree that Sia is just about the best buy right now, but Ripple has a ton of upside and is cheap.  What's the risk in buying a little and reaping the benefits of it replacing swift in banks one day?

The hamster market is so hot right now.  I'm bullish on anything hamster these days.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:36:32
Also don't be that guy and buy Sia right now, and some Ripple.

I was hoping it was just a Dragonball Z reference.

Don’t know where to gamble against crypto prices and not actually own crypto? EToro!
