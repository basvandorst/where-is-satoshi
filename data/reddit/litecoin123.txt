Someone unloaded around 3 million dollar worth of BTC, instead of doing it slowly it looks like he/she tried to create a panic by unloading it all at once. However, 3 million dollars worth isn't a lot of money and it looks like its going to recover within the hour.

invest in litecoin. 
I am speculating it will trade 1ltc/.25btc and a major catalyst would be the adoption of LTC in their exchange sometime this month.

but nobody is focusing on the fact that China said its okay for people to trade BTC, just don't use it as a currency. The Chinese weren't buying it in hopes of using it as a currency anyways, they buy it as a store of value and to speculate.

i am a 25 year old dude and i have just been charmed by Mr Berwick. He looks so good, and he was able to keep his calm and not lash out when those hosts were bashing bitcoins. I want to be like him when i grow up.

11 million bitcoin in existence. if bit coin was to drop to $30/btc the market cap is $330 million. Anonymous money (drug money, tax evasion, preventing government from asset seizures like cyprus) is worth hundred of billions.

This guy has been predicting doom for the last 30 years and the opposite happened. If you wiki him you will find out he is a hardcore Christian who : "North favors capital punishment for a range of offenders; these include women who lie about their virginity, blasphemers, nonbelievers, children who curse their parents,[22] male homosexuals, and other people who commit acts deemed capital offenses in the Old Testament.[23] North also favors capital punishment for women who have abortions.[24][25]".  
He predicted Y2K would be the collapse of international economy because he was basing his predictions on faith and not science.  
This guy has no credibility at all, dogs who bark the loudest usually have the weakest bite. Only the uneducated will fear him.

EDIT: The problem with his "predictions" and like most old people (ie. Greenspan), is that they are making assumptions based on the belief that economic systems don't evolve. If you can travel back 1000 years and speak with economists back then do you think they will believe that the most powerful country in the world is able to operate on $17 trillion debt with no gold or any tangible asset backing it? But that is the case now, and many people have gotten rich off the system.

Does this means their entire system is now on a halt until they can catch up verifying everyone?
