That's debatable. I am going to go ahead and say that graph is 60% wrong. That list is not by any means complete. Canada is not even on there. There only useful if they are 2 way. Even now here in Edmonton, AB I have to drive 3 hours to use an ATM that might work.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:40:15
I use bitcoin. Make that I "used" bitcoin functionally until there was not 2 way. When both of the 2 way machines that were here got pulled at nearly the exact sa e time. Now I just stack. Need to be able to withdraw to fiat until all the retailers accept bitcoin. That is all for now young fella.
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:47:24
Clearly photoshoppered. You can see a tile of images on the left and the one with buddy does not have the bitcoin logo.
See here white arrow - 
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:53:51
Not sure what you mean by "All the known machines in Canada are there".
In Edmonton for instance there is no more ATM at Remedy Cafe. AaronBuysGold stopped purchasing bitcoin and the ATM at West Edmonton Mall is only 1 way right now.
These ATMs are only useful if they are 2 way.
What good would a bank atm be if it was only deposit?
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:02:54
90% of these ATM's are 1 way. Meaning you can only buy bitcoin and not take out cash. Even in Edmonton Alberta right now you cannot take out cash for bitcoin. All the ATM's here are one way only and we were the first in the World to have one. I have to drive 3 hours to sell my bitcoin.

Sent you some free bitcoin.

I have been trying to give away free bitcoins.
No one is interested.
See this post: 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:57:55
"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 
BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 
650,000 BTC."
If 670k BTC found this is enough to reimburse clients.

In cult.
Giving away free bitcoin.

That's not cool.

1. I am giving away small amounts of bitcoin for likes and re-tweets.
2. Yes. It is being moved to scalable hosting in the next few days. We are experiencing a very high traffic rate. All of our pricing is priced using a real time feed so with the extremely high visitor rate the site is experiencing up to a 10 second page load time on the catelog pages. Checkout and account features should be quite fast though.
3. At this point in time our minimum order is $50. This is because of shipping, insurance and delivery costs. Our custom BTC embeded coins are also already fabricated. The come in 0.1 and 1.0 denominations.
4. Coinbase works in Canada. I do not withdraw fiat via coinbase. We use Cavirtex.com for that. (our Canadian exchange).
I hope this helps.

Either way no one is interested which makes me wonder.

Please don't what? Its almost amazing that no one wants free bitcoin.
You always see the beggars in troll box then when you try and run a campaign, nothing.

This could be actually happening
"We have realtime onsite backups on a separate system, and offsite backups at regular intervals. We are working on modifying the system to have a multi-site cluster working **(working with people from Percona to reach the best system on this)** - which would allow us to have a node of the cluster used to make backups way more often"

We need ATM's that you can withdraw from.  Not these vending machines. It's not rocket science guys. People need cash until all retailers accept Bitcoin. 2 way so we can send bitcoin to Greece and they can withdraw fiat.
