I had a similar issue and was unable to sync properly or send transaction from mSigma. Transaction failed to confirm in mSigna despite having thousands of confirmations on the blockchain. Every time I would try to send a transaction mSigna would crash. I spent 3 weeks upgrading schemas, rebuilding vaults, and syncing transactions. Version 0.10.6 specifically stated that it would fix the situation yet still failed.
After 3 weeks of dealing with mSigna's bugs I tried to get the private keys out so I could sweep the keys. It's extremely difficult to get the private keys for each address without knowing the derivation path. In the end I generated a transaction with mSigna and had to broadcast it to the blockchain manually. This method worked perfectly for me and I safely got all my bitcoins and Bitcoin Cash out of my corrupted mSigna wallet.
I highly suggest finding a new wallet option ASAP and NEVER use mSigna again. **mSigna is unstable, poorly supported, bug-ridden, and a danger to your Bitcoins!**
-Create backup of vault file
-Disconnect from node/localhost
-Determine appropriate fee to ensure transaction is approved by blockchain. Example site: 
-Create 'Send' transaction using different wallet address
-Enable 'Coin Control' option and select coin
-Send full amount of specified coin **minus the fee**, make sure 0 funds remain to prevent bitcoin being sent to 'Change Address'
-Sign transaction
-Export 'Raw' transaction to clipboard
-Broadcast 'Raw' transaction to blockchain with online tool or node CLI. Example site: 
-Monitor new wallet for transaction to be confirmed
-Repeat with all coins
-Once all transactions are confirmed destroy your mSigna vaults and don't ever use mSigna again.

Were you able to get your coins out of msigna?  Mine are also trapped.  I tried using various tools to derive private key but the wordlist and BIP-32 .priv are generating different keys.
