Is this a good sale price or should I wait for Black Friday prices?

I mean this in the most sincere way, and not directed at this post specifically... But am I the only one that feels the feud between the two coins is trivial? I don’t see why (and I mean both sides) bicker back and forth... why can’t people like what they want, and just focus on the tech. 
I have a vested interest in both so have never commented on the endless shit posts back and forth on each other, I just wish I could scroll both subreddits without a majority of the posts actually having any legitimate content.
“Can’t we all just get along?” :(

From website:
BACKUP &amp; RESTORATION
Your accounts are backed up on a recovery sheet. Easy restoration on any Ledger device or compatible wallets (BIP39/BIP44).
This assumes you do not lose your pass phrase/word list

Device breaks, you can restore wallet using your security words/phrase. 
I just got my nano s this past week as I went over 2btc now. I learned the device pretty quickly since I upgraded firmware and decided to use words to restore wallet instead of creating a new one. (Had t moved btc to that wallet yet so could have just created new, but wanted to try it)
The USB cord that came with it was not working as it didn't plug all the way into device, but I have tons of extras so didn't bother complaining.
Play with it first, test out wallet restoration, move a little to it first before moving whole amount and never lose pass phrase/words!

Do we really consider this a crash? I mean, if it was at 200$ sure... but 8-900 isn't exactly chump change despite the 1170+ spike?

I'm new to btc but seeing recent events last night I finally setup my armory wallet (seemed like a decent pc app) for managing my own. I also have a phone app but never moved any there. 
So much to learn, so little time. I'm pretty sure most new users don't read as much as they can or should. (I'm still total n00b) But I was already aware of the mtgox incident so made me a little wary of keeping my btc's under someone else's control. 
I just hope I don't ever lose my pass phrases ;p

Mugged for everything except wallet and expensive watch?

I'm a Nigerian prince and I would love to help. Unfortunately all my funds are tied up until I pay my taxes and they unfreeze my bank. I would be more than happy to help you with a small donation of $20,000 worth of bitcoins, but I first need to raise $5,000 to unfreeze my assets. If you could help me... send bitcoins to: 
Thanks in advance.....
