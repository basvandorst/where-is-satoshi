List them all. Let folks get their feet wet and let the better exchange get the business. Unless their is an affiliate option in which case cash in.

Also, so what?

AH! lol.

Unfortunately I ordered from this site before it was known to be a scam,  I will say this I spent .9017065 btc
That transaction... 100% fraud. My first major bitcoin purchase after mining the btc myself only to get bent over.

I'm sure the same thing was said when the United States of America declared its independence, and the subsequent years following while it went through a learning phase. Obviously their are wildly divergent groups with different goals participating with bitcoin. I find it hard to argue with how many millionaires were made out of nothing in the last three days. But keep laughing as long as that commission check is coming in. This is nothing more than an experiment; their will be a multitude of casualties along the way all in the name of said progress.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:51:55
Fake or Not I will hang that transaction on the wall like a trophy. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:50:40
Simple strategy. Think long term. No matter what happens in the next 30 days, you should be thinking the next 365+. Get to mining or develop a buying strategy and stick to it. Do not put more into the game than you can afford to instantly lose. If you aren't certain then do half of whatever it is you have the itch for and wait to see what happens.

And rising. I'm going to say before the weekend is over $275.00
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:24:10
I jumped in on the train. I'm an affiliate marketer, etc anyway. Have the powerful gpu's sitting most of the time and several computers. Hell why not? If not just to exercise libertarian values, but to also generate a possible passive income stream for now. Possibly investing in more serious hardware to lend more legitimacy to the idea behind this currency and to potentially make bitcoins to use at a later date!
@_date: 2013-06-19 01:48:05
To think I had arranged a deal with this guy to buy several @ 1.1btc. Nope, not even once. Sorry you got scammed OP, but thanks for the warning before I dropped my dime!
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:05:48
Good advice. Lot's of folks are going to be making assumptions or doing nothing at all and will one day awake in a world of troubles.

Must have been pretty cool to be at the ground floor!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:50:25
I'm sure it is possible! I've seen a few for sale, along with nice cars. Would make sense to make your money work for you!

This was a reality check thread. If you are thinking this is bad, you need to reach out and talk to someone. Suicide is never an option.

Want to buy anything with your btc? Maybe I have it for sale for portions of a btc? I'd like to earn my first BTC.
Let's talk turkey!

That was a tongue and cheek say hello... I'm well aware :) But they have proven to be a very important part of our community, and I thank them for it.

That is pretty awesome, and goes to show we have a great community of people. EFF is an integral part of all of our lives here in the digital world whether we know it or not. Ever since reading my first 2600 magazine and seeing some of the work they do... Hats off to those that donated, and hats off for the re-donation. It makes a huge difference! Tell Kevin Mitnick we said hello :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:29:23
Make it rain! I've witnessed this in affiliate marketing, internet marketing, and even with some of those amway type folks.
When the only legitimacy is the people backing the idea with their time, fortune, and work. It spreads like a disease  when they spend a little on the community, chump change, it makes a difference, folks get excited and things start to happen, and often more times than not the 10% that go on to be as successful as those that had that moment and thought to tip or throw money at people will be duplicated again.

It happens. And it will happen again. Stay Calm. Mine.

I'd say risk half of what you can afford to loose. Keep the other half just in case.

This is what happens when you rock the boats of the big boys. They have no friends int he bitcoin game whereas golden parachutes for all of them in this fiat currency market. Don't even let it bother you and just play their game. Maintain an exit strategy of course :) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:15
HOLD THE LINE. RELAX ON THE LAG, and PROMOTE bitcoins to all the major players in the digital game. It should not take much for them to see what they can gain from adopting early. Play to their liberal sensibilities and show them how it can make them money while leaving the traditional banking system in the dust along with all the corruption, and control. FREEMARKETS BABY! FREE M-A-R-K-E-T's!  Time to start buying cheap bilboards and putting up ad's to plant the seeds of bitcoin in the populousness head! In it to win it folks!

Right man at the right place at the right time with the right motivation for the right reason.
I wish I had something to offer the project besides moral support, but thank god for folks stepping up and taking on projects like these for the reasons they do!
Thank you.

You have to think that George Soro's is watching this. This man no matter how vile or evil you feel about him, made a few hundred metric shit tons of money off gold in his life. If he took several billion and flipped it in our market... JFC $1000 by the weekend.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:35:13
IF. IF......... unfortunately it is a matter of when, and maybe even who, but it will happen someday, sooner before later esp since their is so much money to be made.... No pun intended.
