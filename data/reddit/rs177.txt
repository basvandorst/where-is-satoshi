I didn't see how it could infinitely deflate until I found out there's a finite supply.

Thanks

I don't want to invest a thousand, let it grow to $10,000, and then have Bitcoin fall apart and turn out to be a scam.

That's true.

The problem with these questions is that they're too long so Google can't find any answers.

Then how does it operate? How can it be finite if no company ensures it is?

I'll make I read it before I purchase.
Do you think Bitcoin will infinitely gain value or will it eventually crash?

If a scam bank can take money and close shop, why not Bitcoin?

How does Bitcoin operate without some sort of company?

I'm not willing to pay $10,000. Can I buy a portion of a Bitcoin for $1,000?
If Bitcoin is stored on computers, why can't hackers give themselves a ridiculous amount of Bitcoin? Why can't someone create so many Bitcoins that the value crashes?

So will it eventually fail? I'm certain it'll have to fail eventually.

I struggle to understand how Bitcoin works and how it continues to deflate. Why would a business accept Bitcoin? Bitcoin is just a theoretical currency because it doesn't physically exist so how can it translate into money? Is the entire point of Bitcoin just a way to hold money online and then turn the Bitcoin back into money? If so, how could a bank turn a Bitcoin into something valuable?

Thanks for the link

Can you elaborate on this works? Can I load bitcoins onto a debit card and use the debit card in any location?
