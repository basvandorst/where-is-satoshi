* Videos
I *really* like the videos section. Awsome :)
* Help?
Is there any help/introduction section somewhere?
For example: What is the difference between the "Credits wallet" and "Bitcoin wallet". Can I use both of them at the sale/trade sites?
* Sell page
Flash is needed to sell an item (or at least there is a red bar at the top of the page that complains that I don't have it installed). Does that mean that it is impossible to create a sell page from mobile? :(
* Sell page2
So I just switched to my laptop and then the Flash-warning disappeared. It seems like it was the "Upload Images"-functionality  that needed Flash. However, nothing happened when I pressed the Image button. So now my [first item for sale]( doesn't have any pictures :S
* Shipping Info
You have to enter a "State". Even if you come from a country that don't have states! 
* Shop
Is there any way to hide those alternatives that can't be shipped to me? Right now it is a bit frustrating to look at an Item and only find out after I've had pressed the "Buy"-button whether I can buy it or not. Does "Item location" mean "Only available in"? I think that should be clearer.

So far the only places I've seen is in the "Pay listing fee"-part of the sell and trade pages.

* On registration page:
ToS is a javascript link instead of a real link so it is impossible to middle click it and open it in a new tab.
* On Tos Page:  
For some reason the scroll doesn't work for me. I can see the text continuing off the page, but I can't scroll down to actually read it.
* Overall:
The site gives a good professional, perhaps somewhat crowded impression.
