China Taking Profit
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:00:53
Here is one for starters ---&gt;
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:14:13
Coinbase to buy and if you want to use there exchange you can just for bitcoin, but I like to use BTC-E and diversify my cyrpto in LTC/PPC.... I did trade DogeCoin on Cyrptsy and had my coins out way before they locked up transfers... Holding onto those Doge for a rainy day when they are magically worth like $.01... That day will come.... I will be drinking a out of a coconut the next day... :)
Still don't understand why Dogecoin is in the top 10... I mean it's worth almost nothing but still has a market cap of over $17 million in 6th place on the list of the top 10... Just ahead of PPC by $7.5 million which makes me scratch my head...
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:15:05
Flip a COIN...
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:34:44
I understand what you are looking for, I have yet to find any concrete interpretations of the the Bitlicense for a small business. Everything is very vague or general in terms of what it actually means or implies for any one trying to conduct business in the space out side of being a money transmitter. That's why I posted here to see if the community could clarify things. 
I'm going to open shop later this month and I'm going to accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Peercoin as direct payment options for my subscription  graphic design service. I feel as if cyrpto is a better alternative for those that do not want to handle credit card numbers and information  over the internet. Besides that I will be taking paypal for internet payments as the only other alternative . I don't want to have to bother with storing personal information beside e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and names  of my clients.
@_date: 2016-06-09 20:39:48
YES!!! Sign me up! Is this only with Ether Though? I mean I hold multiple cyrpto but what is the default CC for this?
EDIT: Found this "Bitcoin currency transactions over cards are handled exactly as those done via Mycelium wallet, meaning that Mycelium does not "touch" users' bitcoins. Bitcoin currency transactions in the size of few satoshis per fiat payment are needed to transport color coins, network operator has to take care of these small expenses."
So i guess BTC is de-facto and can integrate other CC's.

Can't have SHIFT card in NY state....

@_date: 2016-06-12 17:02:09
This is Awesome!
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:15:47
So basically this is going to spur more interest into Bitcoin because online payments are getting taxed and capped... Can't really do that to Bitcoin... HOLD THE DOOR!
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:42:50
I agree with you. This is why I got a bitpay card. Every day little by little becoming my own central bank... :)
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:05:18
Dump your left over fiat that you can afford to invest... Get a solid position before the next price spike up.

Using my Bitpay Visa card until this comes out... Also very excited for
This is how I would have imagine using Bitcoin on a card without converting it to USD first like on the Bitpay Visa card.
@_date: 2016-06-06 20:31:15
I'd say it's a 50/50 shot at this point... What it means for Bitcoin if it does happen... 3 words, "Hyper Inflated Prices" in USD...
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:16:43
HOLD THE DOOR!!!
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:03:47
Well... If you haven't bought yet.. The Boat has left...
@_date: 2017-01-17 04:58:08
This is great!
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:56:54
I mean... There is a Bitcoin funded debit card by Bitpay. I have one, but you have to fund it by converting your BTC into Dollars. So it works the same as a re-loadable pre-paid cash card.  It would be nice to actually have a real BTC Debit card that holds actual BTC instead of dollars when used. I suspect Bitpay was forced to hold dollars in their model for Government compliance and to cover margins due to price fluctuation.... Would be nice though to actually just have a card with BTC on it so when price goes up so does your buying power. It can work in the other direction though too which is a down side.
Cardless transfers are the way to go though. Soon you will be able to scan a QR-code off your watch or tap with your watch/ring and send bitcoin between one another. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:35:56
Thanks for this... just set this as my new background  
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:07:38
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:37:06
Yeah, They know they are fucked...
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:51:55
I'll add to this... If it wasn't for Bitcoin I wouldn't have been able to drop my down payment on my lease  in 2014... 
This new rise in price is gonna do the same this year for another. 
Whip'n and Hodl!!!

So are they whale hunting, tickling catfish, or trolling for crawdads...?
Hopefully not all of the above, but I can't see it worth their time to chase the smaller transactions... They are going to have a plethora of data to sort through.

Oh man what a troll, lighten up and have some fun. I didn't take in consideration that Bcash has been causing some issues with Hash power that effects transaction times and fees...

Well, Lucky you... You must not be a NY state resident... We can't use SHIFT or Circle... Bitpay is the only NY State approved card as of now.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:23:58
So just use your card once every 90 day and idk buy a pack of gum... I have one too and it's great for when you want some quick cash from your BTC to buy anything... All pre-paid debit cards and gift cards ect have dormancy fees... Welcome to 2016 with NIR coming to a bank near you!

Nice idea and I like it, but until these things are $0.12-0.25 USD not very economical to just give to some 1 as a physical  cyberpunk like creds payment... Would also benefit from a e-liquid digital display to show balance. Just an idea to add to a cool innovation

If you want to send $.50 then use LTC, PPC or another form of crypto. BTC should be reserved as a store of wealth and for "Bigger" Transactions all together... Just my opinion... 
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:23:07
Ha... Well missed that one... Must have just posted that up there.
Thanks for the update!

Bank declares it is insolvent... People with that bank freak out... Then proceed to drain their accounts of every last penny until the bank can not give out more cash or send any more fake "1's" &amp; "0's" out of their accounts... This then effects other banks and their depositors do the same in fear of seeing one bank fall... A big chain reaction starts and the financial system begins to collapse from within... Hopefully the smart ones don't run and try to get money from a ATM when the bank declares a "Holiday". The smart ones aka tech savvy individuals will be on coinbase or their local BTC exchange draining their accounts into BTC. I know I will be one of these individuals if this happens. This is why I got a bitpay debit card so if my bank goes belly up, I have a backup plan to buy everyday things and pay my bills with out a bank. 
A wise man once said " Become your own central Bank" - Gregory Mannarino
Bitcoin allows the everyday individual to become their very own Central Bank where no government can come and seize your accounts nor freeze your transactions... No CEO or bank can give your account a hair cut... Libertarian AF...
(What I said above is worse case scenario SHTF)
@_date: 2016-05-21 14:11:24
Really... You trolled me on this...   ^ _ ^
Think about it though... You wouldn't buy a cup of coffee or 10 cups of coffee by chipping off a 1g bar of gold... I would rather use fractional silver like a mercury dime for or 2 for such a transaction and save the 1g bar of gold for lets say a designer shirt or nice piece of clothing... It's about relevance of your transactions and what medium to use in your transnational situation. This is why people have choices and not to be forced one way or another... If the fees are too high for your micro transactions use another medium of transaction for your cyrpto purchase. 
That being said just like they use to say "All roads lead to Rome"
It is looking like any way all digital money leads back to Bitcoin in one way or another...
