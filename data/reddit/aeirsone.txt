It's a seizable asset. And the appraised value is....

How do you know how much his salary even is? 
Also he said he bought during the boom few years ago so I'm pretty sure he's made a bit more than he has lost. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:39:53
Ah thank you. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:13:15
Does the ATM print them? Haha
@_date: 2014-11-17 08:07:54
Are these safe to use?  or susceptible to theft? 
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:20:53
Okay sounds good.  Do I need a USB drive or anything? 
I've never used bitcoin.

Smoking anything causes brain cell loss. 
Including cigarettes. Marijuana doesn't have to be smoked.

You must be a slow, sure money kind of businessman. 
Your type would've never came up during the initial boom of a almost unknown bitcoin crypto currency. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:49:03
Ah   I must start one of my own now. 
See y'all in bitcoin heaven. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:49:48
Does mining mean stealing other peoples bitcoins? 
Can someone please explain this to me?
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:58:03
Ah thank you.

The American confederacy were all democrats. 
It was the republicans(Lincoln mainly) from the north that fought and ultimately ended slavery. 
So about a 100 years ago the democrats had 3.5 million slaves.

Well. From the Feds point of view, it's *their* money. 
They represent the United States who's money was being used for unlawful dealings. They're trying to recover as much of it as possible.

Haha. Marijuana aside, lots of people that don't use drugs are bums too. 
Marijuana is legal where I'm from in the US. Now anyone can smoke without the stigma of being a "bum" or "criminal". It's normal and far less harmful than alcohol or cigarettes. 
Living under the queen has held your culture back from modernization long enough.

Can you buy bit coins at this ATM?
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:12:54
Where shall I keep the rest? Can I put them onto a USB drive from the bitcoin ATM? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:05:30
I'm assuming it's not illegal anymore. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:54:02
I'm not wrong, I'm just an asshole.

How do you guys feel about investing in silver or gold? 
@_date: 2014-11-23 12:28:11
I know. Our country is bad,  and we should feel bad. 
You can thank the Democrats for slavery. 
At least we are beginning to turn things around from the inside out.

Does the CIA sell cocaine? 
Care to explain why a CIA plane supposedly carrying prisoners of war crashed coming into America with 200 tons of cocaine? 
This man never touched drugs. He just ran a website. 
Drugs are not illegal in certain countries , like Portugal.

So, as more people buy in, do the Bitcoin become more or less valuable?
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:06:58
Mostly Everyone on reddit seems to love the democrat party and socialist ideas. Yet no one wants to pay socialist style taxes which tend to be high. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:17:15
It will just make the action illegal. It won't stop it from being done. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:47:01
A bill or two could change the rules here.

No. However whenever we exchange U.S. currency for bitcoins that's when we will be taxed. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:19:54
I agree. However the government here makes a point to invade all of our communications , I doubt they would have a hard time seeing who downloads tor.

It's hard to trust something that has inflated so fast. It makes me nervous to say the least.  Warren buffet says that when something is wanted by everyone you should sell or lay off and when no one wants said product that's when you should be greedy and buy as much as you can. Markets change. Don't get wrapped up at a high price.

Hi 
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:11:44
While this is true in some aspects. Most of us have a friend or family member that could safely hook us up. 
Also, the dark net markets carry much larger risk when it comes to breaking the law. Buying on the street would get you possession at best. Buying online is much more illegal. to the point that its not worth the risk.
