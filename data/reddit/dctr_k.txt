Start digging, clearly there is BTC there! 
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:00:49
Wow,  a genuine post on this sub.... I must be in the twilight zone

@_date: 2018-09-20 16:17:07
Who the hell is Santoshi
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:14:01
At the very least you need to transfer to a different wallet and pay from there
@_date: 2018-09-27 04:26:35
Youre mistaken
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:21:19
Sexy 
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:15:57
Why would you even entertain this
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:29:46
Shill hour in here
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:45:21
This shit is just getting weird
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:02:18
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:16:49
So far, yes
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:34:25
Hopefully, sick of these fuckers already 
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:41:20

@_date: 2018-08-14 13:13:41
Now were talkin
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:12:25
Ah yes, should've known! Thanks 2 day stranger! 
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:22:11
How could we possibly know
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:11:17
Imo, either of those prices will be good buys long term. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:22:49
Im just buying low and forgetting i even have it til December, can't stand all these drama queens on here freaking out because they invested more than they can afford to lose
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:02:04
You must be very bored, or maybe mad that you lost money? Who knows
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:16:43

People like to cherry pick for their bias. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:23:38
Why you in here if youre that pessimistic? You could say the same thing about the highs but you choose to see it negatively. Dont understand those of you browsing this sub that just come here to say how dumb others are for buying

@_date: 2018-08-09 20:22:23
O rly
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:57:19
I made less than 40k and saved 6k.... Bit confused what youre getting at here, who did i take from? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:27:34
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:16:04
In a utopian society,  sure i get what you're saying,  but in todays times, i earned this, and worked hard for it. I didnt take from anyone, i went out and earned it through my own will and dedication. This seems like a communism-esque theory, not that that's bad,  but just not realistic. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:29:58
Good luck
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:33:51
Nice man
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:48:06
I saved around $6k this year, are you saying i am 33% above average? 
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:41:42
Blue bell is good tho... 
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:01:38
"redditor for a day" checks out
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:28:26
Uh huh

@_date: 2018-08-09 12:52:54
Nope, waiting for the fall/winter just like every other year 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:49:39
Ouch. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:19:46
Seems like that kinda scheme tbh
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:08:30

@_date: 2018-08-24 02:49:59
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:46:48
Who even thinks 1k for an iphone is reasonable? What the hell?! Shits gonna break in 24 hours
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:22:36
The way i see it, having your cash laying around at home, its not going anywhere, and thats fine, but in the CC market you at least have the opportunity (highly likely in my mind) to get gains, and very significant gains. Just dont put eggs all in one basket, relax and focus on what you CAN control financially. Will save you a lot of worry, and your focus will shift from worrying, to improving your financial stability through other means, and before ya know it we'll be at the end of the year with a huge spike just like last year. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:15:16
Just wait man, all these companies are innovating, adopting,  creating debit cards, there is a lot of time and money being spent on this market and people who are trying to make it successful. Have faith, after all,  we all know you shouldn't invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:29:44
Your username suits you well
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:47:44
Neither, to deter 
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:54:47
Holy shit is this guy diverse
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:46:52
Nice spelling 
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:12:39
Weak 
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:42:06
What the fuck is this... 
@_date: 2018-10-02 03:52:29
Obviously... Why would they accept credit... Usually people use the term "credit card" interchangeably. If you dont have the money then dont buy it
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:19:58
Goodnight Irene!
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:28:03
They spelled "real" wrong
@_date: 2018-10-17 21:01:16
Ok we get it.... Why does this keep getting posted
@_date: 2018-10-14 22:11:50
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:02:56
Creepy ass cartoon guy right there

u/Kain_naiK pay up!!
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:51:50
That sounds insanely useful
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:16:51
What the hell was that
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:05:59
Why do these people even listen and report on this guy?!?!?
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:16:34
Im ny opinion, yes it is. But youd be stupid to trust anyone on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:27:19
Yes i always press report for "spam" on those piece of shit ads
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:10:47
The fuck is wrong with you
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:57:22
Simple motor and remote will get that door open!
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:50:35
Well...  *I* liked it
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:41:16
Thats what they all say
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:37:34
Just wait and see for gods sake..... 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:46:58
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:00:54
I think youll be looking a lot better come fall/winter. Especially your ETH, in my opinion 
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:37:21
More than we can imagine probably 
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:33:54
True but hes been all over the place with this kinda stuff before
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:52:05
Calculate the difference as a percentage
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:06:11
Holy shit he is, I didn't notice that
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:26:11
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:04:09
I dont get how thats funny 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:30:32
Wait what? This shit happens every year man, relax. Nothing to do with those dumbasses
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:34:31
Soooo many dummies in this world... Very concerning 
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:34:16
Hopefully he does 
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:57:55
What fuckin dummie lol. If anyone believes anything this Mcafee guy says, you sir, are a fuckin idiot
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:25:53
Price is low
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:31:09
Nope, this happens every year. Anyone panicking is a dumbo or a rookie. Either that or they invested more than they could afford to lose
@_date: 2018-11-12 17:11:56
What the hell is wrong with the people that are "the faces" of crypto? Seems like a bunch of uncivilized chimps
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:27:58
Dude this happens all the time. Anyone freaking out is a rookie or invested way more than they can afford.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:28:02
It happens every year.... This is not surprising at all
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:50:38
Didnt happen, cuz i didnt invest more than i could afford to lose. Also, i was well aware price fluctuates violently BEFORE buying. This happens every year. Dummies..... 
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:03:52
This looks so real. Anyone tried it? 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:28:35
Oh i know, whats even more pathetic is he isnt even doing very well at it
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:33:29
Well they always seem to pop up around here every single day
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:25:23
Absolutely no one knows where price is going. Maybe the whales, but that would be the only exception. 
Any one of you who think they can, are delusional and probably also have an ulterior motive.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:13:57
One thing all dummies have in common, is a lack of patience (among other things).
Oh, and also believing the masses. Absolutely NO ONE knows which way BTC will go, so there is no use believing any of these dummies who are trying to speculate the price 
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:08:31
Opium i believe 
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:02:13
Probly Craigslist 
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:29:24
Mad as fuck dude god damn. I bet lifes hard for you. Im sorry you invested more money than you could afford to lose and are now bored, mad as fuck, patrolling old posts. So much anger bottled up, likely due to poor decisions in life. What a sad,  strange little man. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:11:46
I dont get it
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:39:04
Sounds like you lost some money huh
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:36:13
Ok. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:02:57
Yep, idk why ANY dummies still think they know whats going to happen..... They dont... Simple as that
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:08:01
Yes, people do use the term credit card to describe debit cards, you must not get out much if youve never heard that. And many times on websites it says credit card as an option when talking about either. But lets talk about something else, about how youre a butthurt lil bitch haha. Did you lose a bunch of money bud? Youre really angry for no reason. Watch your mouth when you're talking to me, slut, and stop patrolling really old posts trying to stir shit up loser. Your moms calling, she wants you to get off your lazy ass, turn off your computer, and clean the god damn basement bitch. Chop chop
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:25:44
Finally he says something that is actually truth..... Still a dumbass tho
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:53:45
No no, 100-0 he means
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:15:05
On a max-veteran contract? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:26:42
Well we've been infatuated with precious metals for how long now? 
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:53:41
Use your brain better, and read the comment again. The other coins were once low priced too
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:52:22
No,  i think he bought in december. Which means....  Yes
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:24:38
Where is this at? Lmao, total troll with the drone
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:51:54
High risk high reward (potentially)
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:39:51
What a pathetic post....
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:59:50
Mustve been an accident 
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:45:34
Stop trying to sell us on your price predictions, NOBODY KNOWS
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:44:38
Because people saying BTC is dead are speculators, not truth sayers lol... And people who are saying it isnt are also speculators. No one can act like they know which way its going, because frankly, they dont
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:46:58
Why are you asking here? There is literally nothing but speculation here, no one actually knows anything about why the prices do what they do, or where they are headed 
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:19:54
Damn, youre probly gonna rake it in in January 
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:53:02
Firstly,  you didnt even provide a time zone dude... 
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:03:45
They gonna torture you dude, watch out
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:58:27
Came here expecting this. Was not dissapointed 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:37:36
Put it back in your pants man

@_date: 2018-12-10 23:54:20
Why do you need advice? You just got free 13 btc.... And thats it. Merry Christmas 
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:34:00
None of us can act as if we know where the market is going. No one knows. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:44:05
You had how long to buy into the bottom?.... I mean jesus, weve been sitting at the bottom for a loooong time
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:48:26
Looks like video chat to me
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:01:50
Yep, they do. Most websites will have 1 option for your card which says "credit card" and obviously you can use either credit or debit in it.
