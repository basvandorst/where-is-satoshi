Yeh exactly this is why bitcoin will never kick off 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:45:18

@_date: 2018-01-14 10:32:58
Fucking cunts.

@_date: 2018-01-04 08:20:00
Very true. But in 20year bitcoin will be worth 0 so she shouldnt hodl for that long
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:14:07
He worst advise ever
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:35:45
Crazy times buying legal weed with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:48:01
Exactly this lol
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:51:41
You lost 250 thats it really
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:43:31
I mean like actually using it as currency. Going into a shop and buying something with it
It will never be adopted. Ever
Theres no benefit of bitcoin compared to fiat 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:09:28
Is 2 enough?
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:23:49
No tell her to invest in gold
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:11:37
Just trying to make yourself feel better tbh
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:16:59
Iv tried shouting at it but nothing
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:10:30
Get a better paying job, you are a gambling addict
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:00:47
Yeh, or youl get held hostage until the transactions gone through, better get comfy with the theif cos bitcoin at its current state takes ages
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:30:58
Every January it has dipped
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:08:27
So your the kind of people who fall for this shit. Never thought id actually meet someone like this
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:38:46
And id totally stab and rob this guy. He even looks like the stereo type of guy to get robbed lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:16:48
All the money iv invested iv trained myself to think iv lost it, cant lose money youv already lost 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:40:34
I can already see a story where someone is held at gun point for there bitcoin, it wont be long before this starts happening
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:32:43
Better guy than i would be 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:54:02
All in time. The more places that accept it the more likely you are to spend. We are talking ten years away imo.
Once the transaction speeds are increased also
Hopefully in the future bitcoin will get to a point and stabilise like normal currency. 
Nothing wrong with hodl for now but in a fee years people will have to start actually using it for it to work
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:24:06
Bitcoin cash is a knock iff bitcoin. It will never be bitcoin, transactions are faster tho
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:19:55
Do you have to pay to adopt a kid? I know in the uk you dont, just pay for the kids expenses 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:03
High, will drop to 11 but will then climb past what it is now 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:41:50
Are you also a nigerian prince?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:40:33
Your thinking in the short term here. Do you think bitcoin will still be mined in 100 years?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:47:21
 Would also like to know
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:38:16
Ooooooooh guyssssss, look at me! Look at me i can spell!! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:59:41
Knew it, see you also told me you were a vegan before you told me i was correct;) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:45:25
He deserves it for trying to get rich quick. I bout some when it was 3k then again at 18k. But im not crying because i can afford to lose all the money i invested. No where near 300k tho. No where near
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:15:46
Shite troll is shite 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:22:56
Told you guys, sorry
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:39:06
I think its dead now tbh
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:46:13
Its women’s fault if they arnt investing not mens lol. Obvious troll is obvious 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:54:55
If i was your boss i wouldn’t believe you
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:53:11
This was the answer i was looking for
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:20:53
Do you know a midget who wants to move to the uk by any chance? Do the old switcheroo 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:24:43
Where did he get 17k from in the first placev
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:31:24
Credit card is faster, i only pay by credit card if i have more than enough funds to pay it off, pay it off early the next day anyway
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:27:12
I didnt get a picture?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:48:24
In the long run it balances out. Do you know how much energy it takes to physically produce hand held currency? Including all of the infrastructure that goes with it, atleast mining bitcoin there is scope to use renewable energy
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:12:50
I just sent £500, did it work m9?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:02:26
I said in the long run, the next hundreds of years, in the future there will be no paper money, all the energy that goes into mining will be worth it with the amount youl save over the long run producing real coins
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:27
Not tomorow but will be just after christmas
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:22:41
At least you can still hodl it 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:06:06
Its different than lodh 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:26:57
Okay m9 thanks i will let you know
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:11:42
I shagged bitcoin cash’s mum last night 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:50:55
Instead of there being 100 pretty corrupt people there will now be one super corrupt person, not sure which is worse
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:55
What is it then?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:07:01
Fukcing weak hands
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:01:33
Theres a joke in here somewhere but in real life its the vegan. 100%
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:10:36
Coulda, shoulda, woulda 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:52
Yes. It wont be long before people are held hostage and forced to hand over there bitcoin. 
With bitcoins transaction times you could be a hostage for awhile......
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:19:36
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:15:30
Just blew my mind
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:38:06
Fuckig piss take. Surely they want people to adopt? Not force them out of it. Theres plenty of poor homes that could more than adequately look after an adopted child.
Come to the UK to adopt then take them home  
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:57:11
Triggered would have been me calling you a cunt but i didn’t hahah if you get triggered by bad spelling your life must be fucking shite. Bet you’ve got loads of mates haven’t you looooool. Must be a right laugh at party’s
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:09:47
Inthink it drops every january
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:26:22
How long have you been riding the train?
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:32:02
Maybe not in our life time but thats a stupid comment to make. Theres every chance that in 100 years time there isnt a physical currency 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:04:12
It will push the value of bitcoin up, people will just factor the tax in
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:38:43
It will get to a stage where companies will be forced to adopt bitcoin, as other services accept it they will loose too much money.
Im with you on this one although i think it will happen in over 40years time. I will be 65 so im hoping the small amount iv invested in bitcoin will contribute towards my pension lol
In 40 years time bitcoin could be 1 million 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:34:53
Seems like abit if a shockwave of people shitting there pants, theres uncertantity 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:06:09
Fam. For god sake 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:38:43
Taccy

Doesnt seem so bad to me? It was at £5400 im sure. In a fucking noob aswel
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:29:56
I havent seen it this low in awhile 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:34
You fucking twat i hope you starve 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:18:55
Im not looking to sell ha, i wanted to buy more!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:51:00
I only have 0.1 of a bitcoin, wake me up when it reaches a million loool
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:28:24
How these kinds of people made 12k in the first place to loose boggles my mind 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:31:47
Thats my plan, im not in it for the short term, if i have to wait 20 years i will looool. 
I only put in what i can afford to lose, just want to know if its a good time to buy, its down alot since a couple weeks ago
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:47:01
I buy using credit card on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:10:48
All depends on your values in life. If being debt free is your end goal then well done
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:38:09
If you need your investment money to survive you are a fucking idiot. Everyone knows how volatile bitcoin is,  
Its a complete gamble. Only buy with your disposable income and as soon as you buy it, just imagine youv lost it and its gone forever. Anything you do make is a bonus. Just keep hold of it for the next ten years
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:14:16
Do they wear these? 
Your gonna make a kid whos already in a bad situation even worse, hes guna get bullied to fuck wearing them lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:02:10
What the fuck is that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:45:09
Its been in the news and on the radio this morning
Im from the UK 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:32:05
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:29:31
When will all the pending transactions be done? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:06:02
It wont be that low agan do it now,
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:49:49
I dont have that much bitcoin so when the price gets to 10million looool
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:30:03
Ooooh guysssss look at me with my bitcoin!! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:03:47
I use them to buy only, as soon as iv bought i transfer to another wallet
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:43:44
i think it will get to 10500 then dip to 9500 worst case, then climb to 11500
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:50:06
Why wouldnt you just send them how you bought them?
