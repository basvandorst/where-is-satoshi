Strengths - better mainstream understanding. More people will want their own keys rather than praying for ETFs.
Weaknesses - Bankruptcy laws, contract enforcement, etc. globally will have to make a serious evolution if not a complete rewrite. Despite the anecdotal precedents, seizing Bitcoin does not sound like a reasonable long-term rule. 
Honestly, realistically, seriously: $500,000 - $1,000,000. Bitcoin's only been *around* 9 years so I don't think it's unreasonable to see that if user adoption continues to accelerate. It looks like a similar patter to the tech adoption of cell phones/internet to me.

It looks like the difficulty is following the price rather than the other way around to me.

Hahahahahahahahaha. You're totally right, but even here I think you're going to get down voted. Alt coiners will view this as narrow mindedness or arrogance.

But hmm... Which one should it be?

-_- And who would be responsible for that?

1. I went to several in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018.
2. Detroit, MI, and Brighton, MI.
3. Not really - there are still meetups, but it looks like attendance has dwindled since the Q1 2018 downswing.
4. 
a. Brighton was explicitly about "Bitcoin politics". I thought it was going to be a discussion about scaling solutions or mechanisms of government regulation, but it was mostly hardcore libertarians/anarchists who had been in the space for years. I argued for the likelihood and desirability of stable governance and order in a Bitcoin dominated world. 
b. Detroit was supposed to be about the tech, but there was a lot of altcoin shilling and I ended up being one of the Bitcoin educators/main proponents of Bitcoin maximalism (to my surprise because I would not consider myself particularly knowledgeable about the tech compared to most). 
5. Getting to geek out with people who were actually interested in hearing about it.
6. The altcoin shillers. Why were there so many at the Bitcoin meetups. I wanted them to go away and attend "crypto" or "blockchain" meetups.
7. An 8. Very fun and a great release of excitement and thought to receptive minds.

This took courage to post. You are going to receive a ton of criticism from the pseudo intellectuals who will disagree with you using non-applicable principles and old-world thinking, but I agree with 90% of what you wrote. I find it hilarious that so many people lack the imagination to foresee the reality that is unfolding in front of our eyes, but it's nice to see someone have the balls to say it like it is once in a while.

The assumptions seem to be that only adults have money and that Bitcoin's Market Cap will be approximately equal to the Global Money Supply. Sounds pretty reasonable for the early 2030s.
