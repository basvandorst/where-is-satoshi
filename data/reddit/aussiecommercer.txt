PayPal + Bitcoin = "Lol lets charge a minimum 5% for that transaction n go against what Bitcoin stands for", only positive out of this I see is the adoption of new Bitcoin users which in turn see the benefits and move onto pure Bitcoin services.

Good story and I tend to agree,  I trust myself to do the right thing, its trusting the other person to so the same is what I see as the problem.

Openbazaar is an option for now, soon there will be a new site called Bit-ible which is purely a bitcoin platform for buying selling items for a flat fee of 5.25% and 4.75% for shop items. It will be beta releasing in Australia soon and shortly after will be going internationally.

Good question and you kinda did answer it yourself,  but short answer OpenBazzar has little to no overheads as they require the seller to operate their own servers etc... as Bit-ible is its own website with the normal everyday overheads, however also once the platform starts producing over a set amount per annum it would also like to start donating to World Vision.
Out of curiosity how did you learn about Bit-ible?

Bit-ible.com will be launching beta in a few short weeks which you can buy/sell any legal item for Bitcoin. Can be followed on Facebook or  on twitter.
