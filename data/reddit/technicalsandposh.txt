I may do exactly this, thanks.

I won't accept BTC as payment for anything, far too volatile and theres really no clean way to bring it in and pay taxes on it. I'm only really interested in operating the exchange machine and not sitting on BTC for any significant amount of time.

I'd certainly form a separate entity for this entirely, as I don't want any contagion on the front end in case there are issues bringing in the money. As I said in my post my chief concern in bringing in the cash and finding a bank that'll touch it. I'm sure I could find a web based bank and just keep it as operating cap for the entity.
You beg a good question about ID checking. Its only required for a certain $ amount per day, right? Would it be wise to simply limit the $ per day to avoid the hassle of retaining ID information? I have no plans to do anything illicit, but whenever I can avoid additional oversight I will.

I do enough to consider spending serious cash on ATM machines. However, its volatile and accepting it as payment for goods that I buy with real cash is simply too risky at this stage IMO. I can't pay my employees in BTC, nor can I buy COGS in BTC. I'd have to convert, journal the value lossses or gains and then deal with my CPA asking what the hell BTC is. I understand you guys are very zealous about it but i've got to keep priorities straight right now.

I do, but its retail deposits which is "clean". When setting up new dump accounts they ask if any income is as a result of buying or selling financial services, which this is. That brings me under a lot more oversight. Nothing fishy going on here, but I like to avoid additional oversight and regulation wherever possible. This type of thing takes a lot of time to review and maintain compliance with, which I seriously hate doing and don't want to hire someone to do. If they dip i'm sort of stuck. I'll be looking into it though.

I'd certainly do a full marketing rollout to drum up interest. Thanks for your input.
