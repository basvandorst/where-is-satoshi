Actually the international space station experiences enough drag that it needs to be periodically boosted to a higher orbit.

Can someone explain the purpose of bitcoin futures to me please? 
As I understand it, a bitcoin future is a contract to purchase a certain number of bitcoins at a specified price on a date in the future. So if the price of bitcoin goes up then I guess you'd get a good deal when the date arrives, but what benefit does that have over just buying bitcoins right now?

No, they're people who grew up around 2000. So they were born in the 1980s-90s. The generation is kind of fuzzily defined.

This video was disturbing to me. It was like a simulation of what I've heard schizophrenia is like.

I just installed GUIminer and it must be doing something because it made my gaming computer become really slow just doing browsing. I'm new to Bitcoins and I haven't mined any of those yet. I was getting about 390 khases/s, is that good or bad? 0 shares were accepted, 58 were stale or invalid.
Also my graphics card's temperature shot up to 70C and was rising, and then it fell rapidly to 53C within a few seconds after I had it stop mining. Is that normal?
