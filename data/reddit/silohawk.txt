There is literally no source on this claim.  I'll believe it when someone officially announces or has the balls to be quoted by name.

What if tech-savvy NSA agents were out there stealing bitcoins from people.  Would anyone be able to detect it, or is it a license to steal with no potential consequences?

I have a subreddit that has been fairly successful for about a year We have had a moderate amount of BTC transactions.  If it really did become a regular btc/pm trading site, I would be happy to begin offering escrow services.

Once again the arguments dissolves into semantics.  Greenwald may have been incorrect to state that the NSA has direct access to google, Facebook, Microsoft etc... But it seems they likely have access to and storage to support all of the data before it even makes it to those organizations.  That is a minute difference that doesn't change anything about the nature of the spying.  The the article goes on to further state that this has been going on for years so we shouldn't be all that outraged.  This reads like a press release from the government, not a well crafted piece of journalism that addresses the social implications of these policies.

I'm confused by the article.  How exactly do fears about monetary easing (printing money) equate to a decreased value of assets that cannot be wished into existence?  Doesn't the statements here suggest that gold/silver and possibly bitcoins should be increasing in value?
I own no bitcoins, but do buy gold and silver regularly
