if we modelled our govt on the consensus node networks that crytpos now use we'd take over the world.  The american founders just by dumb luck did this to an extent in an allergic reaction against the british monarchy.  But I think we could improve on it using new technology.  Unfortunately we seem to be heading towards the mob mentality of liberal monoculture vs right wing racial identity politics.  Which is pretty much the most retarded outcome possible.

not solvent, never was, noones thinks they are, noone cares
the whole point of a 'tether' is you sell a tether to someone who knows its a fraud, that person pays you 1$, gets 10$ worth of bitcoins from 'leverage', gets a 300% gain on it, and makes 30,000$ from 1000$ worth of tethers.  he then sells the tethers to anyone dumb enough to buy em, doesnt matter, he made 30k.
800 million tethers x 1/0.15 leverage = 5 billion$ fake money.  Thats if the owners didnt make their own secret accounts to buy with infinite leverage, which they probably did.  lol.

I agree, but tbh i've just gotten used to the volatility.  In reality everything is volatile.   We compare stuff to the USD so it seems stable, but its only stable relative to other currencies.  Compared to the DOW it's gone down in value 50% in the last 10 years.  Compared to real estate in new york, etc.  Compared to bitcoin.
The non-volatility of anything is really just an illusion.  Like motion, it's all relative, we're hurtling through space at 100k mph.

It's not even a debate.. the market decided this over the oh 30 years that Cc's were going through their growing pains and basically did everything bitcoin is going to learn the hard way going forward.
I've processed millions of $$ worth of  CC transactions in a very high risk market.  After some simple due diligence we got the fraud rate down to 0.8%.  Who do you think is or equipped to evolve a loss mitigation model?  Our business or our customers?  (I'm assuming B2C not B2B) Thats why visa does it that way.

If they'd call me asking for their coins back I'd say 'no thanks' and hang up the phone.  Then dodge legal summons for a few years.
When they finally sued me I'd claim i had a legal right to those coins, there was no expiration on a buy order, etc.. blow smoke til they settled for 30k.
If that didnt work, and a judgement was made against me I'd claim the coins were long since lost, and then just not pay them.  They'd sell my debt for 1% to a collector, then I'd just not pay that debt collector.  After 7 years my credit score would be back to normal.  Maybe I'd start chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings right as the court date approached, they'd abandon the case, then i'd cancel the proceedings.

When you sell a BTC on bitfinex im assuming you receive 8000 USDT in your account not USD.  I'd assume if there was a panic you'd buy as much BTC as you could with your USDT and withdraw it.  If that were the case then USDT would start to fall in value, bitfinex would maintain the peg by buying the USDT on the market with their own BTC/USD.  if they maintain the peg long enough, even if they're insolvent, they could outlast the panic, and things could go back to normal.  As long as the tide doesn't recede too far, noone will see who's swimming naked.
If they ran out of btc/usd to maintain their peg, they could start using btc/usd in customer's accounts, which is illegal but noone would really know.  As long as customers dont withdraw, or they get new clients faster than the redemptions hit, they could keep it going even longer.

its not a consumed resource.  People 'buy' 500$ worth of bitcoin, they dont care how many coins they're getting.
its value is based on new buyers hitting the bid up against old buyers.  Once new buyers are gone 1 market sell order could theoretically flash crash it to 0.  This is why so many currencies throughout history are now worthless.
Ironically the better the network works the lower the scarcity of bitcoin. Unconfirmed transactions are the life blood of bitcoin value.  I'm wondering if thats not the reason for the slow implementation of solutions there.

@_date: 2017-11-15 01:50:18
you just did.  Read their policy on maker/taker fees.  To actually do it you have to watch the order books for bidding price and asking price.  If you are selling you want to post a market limit sell order 1 penny (or dollar, some small amount) above the highest bid price.  It wont go through immediately.  IF there's an uptick your order will be bought or "filled".  If there's a downtick you will have to cancel that order and place a new order to adjust.  Kind of like danging a worm.
GDAX and all exchanges like people who fill their order books like this because it provides liquidity so they reward you with lower/no fees, etc.  You're "making the market" for them.
P.S. practice with a small amount first to make sure you dont make a stupid mistake and sell all your bitcoins for 1$ or something.  It takes a little time to learn how to do.

if it's anything like a mainland chinese company that money is parked overseas in real estate or blown in macau.
they dont even use dual entry bookkeeping 
cash is usually kept in a safe in the back of the owner's bmw or something lol.  If they need money to expand they bribe a state owned bank VP to give them a 'loan' (which is never paid back)  They are never, ever solvent in the western sense.   It's an entirely different system based on maximizing cash flow and debt (bad debt, course)
if that exchange is solvent an those tethers are real, it would actually be a miracle imho.
but i dont know if hk runs the same as mainland.  My guess is mainlanders own it and use hk to get around currency controls/easy money laundering.
None of their chinese customers think that the tethers are real, and they all have their own methods to make sure they get out safe.

it depends on what you think is more important, saving and having the economy gauge risk for every black swan event out there, or maxxing out productivity living day-to-day and relying on a bailout when a black swan hits.  I think our corporations show that balls-to-the-wall is the only way to win, get first mover, stay ahead of the pack bury your more stodgy conservative competition, and if you go bankrupt, oh well, try try again.  Do you want to be the civilization that invents the next gen of warfare and tech first or the one that just got beat by it (now you can use all that black swan rainy day money to rebuild your cities).  As long as inflation is in check, i think the aggressive approach is better.

people also forget that the nasdaq drops the losers off their index, and adds winners -  so the nasdaq of 1985 never actually recovered.  There are no bankrupt companies on the nasdaq.  The reality is the hodlrs of the nasdaq-1985 went broke.
As of October 2017, 463 companies have been components of the index. Of these, only four, Apple, Costco (through its merger in 1993 with Price Club (Costco, as a separate entity, did not become a component until at least 1989)), Intel and PACCAR, have been components, continuously, since the first dissemination of the index in 1985.
FOUR companies from 1985 are still around today for the nasdaq-2017.  Out of 100+.
the four everyone talks about as proving the 'nasdaq recovered'.  Well of course it did, after ditching 97% of the losers and adding 400 winners over 30 years.  Real tough to 'recover'.
30 years to break even that is.  30 years of being a loser.  Of not having $$ to send your kids to a good school.  30 years of financial misery.  If you'd have bought real estate in emerging markets, or any other fairly obvious move that many did make - you'd have gone up 1000%+.

even if they could show USD in an 'audit' that USD could be client accounts, or even borrowed with leverage itself, lol.  It would require a full arthur anderson accounting firm audit millions of $$ to properly regulate an exchange like this.  They could even partner with other off-shore companies to slush fund up highly leveraged assets.  
Basically. that's not being done in china/hk.  I dont even know if there's a firm capable of it over there.
Traders all know this, u deposit usd/btc, get a 7x leverage, go all in crypto, make a killing, and withdraw.  Odds of you getting goxed on any given day are slim.  It's worth the risk.

I want BTC mainstream, and all the current hodlr's to be bitcoin princes in 2020.  If we have to sell out all the lame neckbeards, so be it.

sorry if its 'tedious'.  I didn't read that book but I've read a lot of goldbug nonsense.
risk asymmetry - I'm assuming you are referring to bankruptcy protection and limiting losses to invested capital.  It's by design -  or else people don't take risks.  Most people just wasnt a 9-5 job, or just live off someone else.
centralization - i mentioned this before, rallying the troops in times of crisis
debt spending - why not? as long as you dont let it get out of control whats wrong with borrowing from future profits to tunnel through the initial start up cost barrier?
consumer society - seems like most people are happy with it.  I'm in china and they dont seem to have a problem with shopping malls either
credit bubbles and civiliations falling - ok what?  i think most historians point to internal strife, natural disasters, famine, war, etc not a housing bubble.  Tho they do hurt, hong kong goes thru them on a regular basis, and they save like crazy.  I dont see hong kong collapsing though.

we've had gold before.. it wasnt as great as you think it was.  It's not a conspiracy that all 200+ countries dont use it anymore.  It sucked.
Also.. uh 1 keystroke could change that 21 million coins to 210 million.  So.. yea.  Can you mine 10x the gold with a keystroke?  But it requires consensus.   So does democracy.  We can all 'consense' on 21 million just as easily as '210 million'.  Or did we evolve into some kind of better human that never changes its mind?
Decentralized?  How many decision makers really matter in bitcoin?
We could elect a hard money guy who forces back to the old standard, if we wanted to.  Most of u don't want it.  It's not that we can't do it, its that not everyone shares your viewpoint.

I follow the laws of the business community not some cult stuff which wants open source and free dev work but also wants to claim they own the project 100% based on someone's opinion.  Take it to court.
For the record i own both coins, and like both.  I think in the long run bitcoin will win because they have smarter people, but bitcoin cash has smarter salesman, so should be interesting.  Long both, to the moon for bitcoin cash, to mars for bitcoin.  price target 150 million for bitcoin, 50 million for bitcoin cash, by 2020.

Bitcoin is no longer unique.  There are 1300+ cryptocurrencies now.  Now we want to see it be  and continue to be   And to go.. TO DA MOOOOOOOOOOON!
Coinbase is a great example of that.  They are completely destroying bitcoins' anonimity.  But also 10x'ing hodlr's wealth.   Sell out a neckbeard ideal, get real $$.  That's what most of us want.  I know the devs wanna get rich too, at least i hope they do.

bitcoin generates no revenues.  In its ultimate form a transaction would go through instantly with no fees, requiring 1 bitcoin valued at 1 penny trading over and over, millions of times a second.

For now it benefits the holders that bitcoin is deflationary, great.   You dont know what will happen in 20 years or 200 years.  Gold and the USD have both weathered those time frames.  Are you absolutely sure bitcoins will be around in 200 years?   
You're just short-sighted.  You talk about history without actually paying attention to it.  Wars, disasters, plagues, earthquakes, volcanos, happen on a regular basis - they dont care when your next block is being mined or what the yellow gold stockpiles are. Yeah all the world leaders were total idiots for not letting people starve during a depression  - or shutting down their factories during a time of war instead of stimuating their economies.

Noone's just gonna 'play nice' and let 100 billion go unchallenged.  Wars have been fought over less.

There are few markets where bears make $$
And this ain't one of em.

why would you trade money that goes up 1000% a year for money that goes up 1% a year.

meant electrum not ethereum sorry
i know bitcoin cash is the original bitcoin satoshi made and all others are just altcoins, but i do like a few of them for the quick pumps they get

True, i just meant it's still extraordinarily volatile, and will be for the forseeable future - theres no chart which has a parabolic on one half without a crash on the other.  Which is a good thing, as far as im concerned.  If i wanted a stable currency i'd pick dollars or yen stable investment 5 year T bills.

if the algo is general purpose enough (inverse the passmark benchmark suite?), creating an ASIC that can solve it better than the latest intel would essentially be creating the next gen intel.  Even if you could out-intel intel, your new chip probably would still not have an order of magntitude advantage like vector based GPU's do over sequential pipeline CPU's do.

it wont crash until it runs out of buyers.. bubbles burst not when people panic sell but when people stop buying.  1 seller with no buyers can make the bid go to 0.
So it'll be the same bitcoin, same holders, just lower price.  It'll still function as a currency.
I know it seems like this is a mania, and it is and its definitely a bubble, but there's still a looooot of potential buyers out there.  So... ride it.. TO DA MOOOOOON!!

they're arguing for regulation groups that are decentralized.  Meaning they're more local and corruption-resilient, "grass roots".  What happens when the FDA gets captured by corporate interests, starts repressing environmentalists, etc.  It's happening where I am right now. 
The issue isn't the regulations, its the regulators.  We all want clean air and drinking water.  7 billion people will NEVER reach a consensus of 'yes i want motor oil in my water supply'  but one appointed FDA head sneaked in by an oil company, very well could.

i'm in china and the internet is fast as long as you dont hit the great firewall, which is always.  Even a captcha served by google freezes the site.
I'd prefer to be on my home comcast connection, using a VPN of course - which is also banned here (but you can find them still just a pain in the ass)
Is china part of asia?

Offer to buy the domain.

I agree but i think the consensus thing is by far the most important.
In China everytime you pay someone they look at the money and feel it cuz there's so many counterfeits.  But I dont see the chinese economy slowing down.  Is it annoying? yes.. does it really matter? no.  If china suddenly got rid of its 1% counterfeit rate I wouldnt expect the GDP to change.

there is no consensus.  bitcoin has a genius long term plan and bitcoin cash has a practical short term plan.  Both coins will rise in value.  hodl both.  If you had to choose one to just buy in and not worry about details go with bitcoin.  If you're more of a daytrader type go with bitcoin cash.  You'll make tons of $$ either way.
