You know, I was kind of split on the whole thing until I saw Roger Ver's interview on the Rubin Report. Good lord he's horribly misleading.

I mean, so long as someone doesn't donate to ISIS or something. That's a little hard to applaud.

While it's true that the headline is misleading, it also says that the ban doesn't go into effect until April 3rd, so...

I learned that I can buy fractions of a Bitcoin.

I sent a transaction about two weeks ago with a .00005 BTC fee. It pended for about a week and then it went through, much to my surprise.

Gresham's Law at work.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:57:21
What backs a physical item? Currency doesn't have any kind of inherent value, physical or not. It's called '[fiat]( because the government declares it to have value. This is an issue because the government can only force people to use it as currency; they can't force it to have a *specific* value without attempting to go against market forces. Neither gold not Bitcoin have that problem.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:04:56


I'd say that people need to be allowed to spend their money whenever the heck they want on whatever the heck they want. The government should not be in the business of trying to encourage them to do anything either direction, especially in such an underhanded way as inflation. The purpose of an economy is to move resources from a place of lower *subjective* value to a place of higher *subjective* value. This is the problem with the Keynesian model: Because they don't have a clue what scarcity is, they only care about money flowing at all, not about where it flows from or where it flows to.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:09:51
No, goods and services are bought and paid for with other goods and services. Money's nothing but a stand-in. Putting more money into the system does nothing but distort the underlying scarcity that prices represent.
Also, encouraging people to make *worse* spending decisions with their money because of the artificial time constraint does not help the economy. The flow of money itself is completely meaningless; money, goods, and services have to flow from places of low value to places of high value, and the people in the best position to decide where those are and when it should happen are the people actually involved in a transaction. By inflating, you're distorting those decisions by introducing the aforementioned time constraint. Or are you going to tell me that three people standing in a circle passing hundred dollar bills to each other every couple of minutes is a well operating economy?
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:58:37
A lot of people tend to look at it backwards, I think. Natural deflation is *not* because 'money is worth more', per se. It's all relative. Natural deflation happens because the prices of goods are falling due to competition combined with technological advancements/new resources being discovered/other similar reasons.
In other words, inflation is literally a system designed to undermine those reasons that deflation would otherwise happen. Tell me again that it's good for the economy, Keynesians.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:55:57
No it doesn't. It was a limit buy order.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:46:12
Yep. Triggered my order at $3,500.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:33:08
I hope this passes. Having to bother with the taxes was the main reason that I didn't use Bitcoin to buy a game the last time I bought one from Steam.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:13:43


Very true. I apologize. I'm all for societal encouragement of saving, definitely.
It seems that I'm on the wrong end of [Bastiat's little comment]( for once.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:34:08
This happened with Ethereum over on GDAX a few months ago. Someone dumped so much all at once that it triggered every single order on the books, including one for something like 350 ETH at like $1 each while the normal price was about $350.
Either way, though, this one triggered my buy order $3,500, so that's a plus, I think. Not quite what that other guy got, but I'll take it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:54:47
Yeah. Sorry.

I am quite curious what competition between ASIC producers might result in. Super cheap ASICs solving the miner decentralization problem on its own, possibly? That would be interesting.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:56:23
I'm on Android. I just installed Copay, too... Any suggestions for what I should switch to? The [Electrum app]( has some severe rating problems on Google Play recently, although it kind of seemed like every wallet does.
@_date: 2017-07-03 00:23:14
That's basically the reason for Gresham's Law. It states, essentially, that bad currencies tend to drive good ones out of circulation. After all, why spend the good one when the bad one is losing value relative to the good one?
In the case of Bitcoin, there's some extra incentive to use it due to the convenience and the belief that using it might encourage other people to look into it, but the basic principle still stands.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:00:15
I think it's simpler than that. Having both Litecoin and Bitcoin available is good for both as each can act as a backup of sorts for the other. For example, with all this political mess with Bitcoin right now, regardless of which side you're on, having Litecoin available as a nearly identical but more stable backup is quite nice, and that's probably the main reason for the price increase. The same thing could also theoretically happen the other way around down the line, although it probably wouldn't be as big of a deal due to the coins relative sizes.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:20:46
Plenty of cheap coins today. Just not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:11:44
Oh, crud. Sorry about the repetition. I posted here accidentally; I was trying to post to Woops.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:31:43
I'm going to be totally honest. Not knowing this was one of the main reasons I didn't buy any back around the $200 mark.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:52:27
[Google]( can.

The market will crash as soon as the Federal Reserve stops QE and all of the misplaced capital becomes worthless, resulting in a correction. If they hold off on starting QE back up, though, then it should recover pretty quickly and wind up better than it was before. What would happen to Bitcoin in the interim is kind of hard to predict, since it's never existed for that kind of crash before.
If they don't stop QE, a worse crash will probably happen at some point, and the market may never really recover from it properly unless QE gets stopped. The timing on that is darn near impossible to predict, though, which is why you wind up with all of these people seemingly constantly predicting a crash any second. They figure, correctly, that the bubble's lasted a while so it probably won't be much longer.

It's been about a week and a half and I'm still waiting. I used Coinbase in the meantime because I was getting tired of watching the price rise $500 while I waited for Gemini. ^(Ironically, the price fell $100 after I bought it...)
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:30:16
I mean the company and service in general. They're known, apparently, for having payment issues and then taking weeks to send anything other than an automated response to support request. I just started using them a few days ago and I've already had several minor issues with their system.
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:57:47
While that's certainly true, I'm feeling the tug of Gresham's Law. Why would I spend Bitcoins, which will likely increase in value if I hold them, when I could spend dollars, which are losing value?
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:36:26
It took three tries to verify my credit card, and my attempt to buy some litecoin through the Android app seemed to work, but it disappeared when I reloaded and seems to have done nothing at all.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:07:31
And here I am, watching the price rise and waiting on an exchange to run through the paperwork so that I can buy some...
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:44:12
Oh, so it's not just me.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:18:23
Oh, that's creepy. I just bought some bitcoin for the first time today as well, and I'm also planning on diversifying between the same three. I didn't buy as much as you did, though. Good luck.
My timing is impeccable, though. I started working through the exchange paperwork last week while it was $500 down, and now it's fallen over $100 since I bought it. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:20:01
Credit card.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:21:57
I wound up doing that too, but only because Gemini was taking so long. I'd been avoiding Coinbase because of the bad reviews, but eventually decided that it would be good to have multiple exchanges available anyways, and, despite the bad reviews, they *are* legitimate, so...
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:21:49
It was recently found that the wallet stores the BIP32 phrase using the same key for all installations, and someone found the key. Within a day someone had gotten access to someone's hard drive and stolen a bunch of money from their wallet.
To make matters worse, the CEO of the company that makes it says that they have no plans to change how it works.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:40:02
On the Android app I was able to get to the screen for inputting the charge amounts without actually charging the card first.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:11:24


I'd like to see the statistics on people who stuff millions under their mattress ^(and aren't in crypto). If people have more money they're not going to spend less of it. That makes no sense. Not to mention that, as I said above, the price decrease doesn't just happen for no reason and is not uniform throughout the economy. The price decrease happens because the people producing the goods can charge less and are forced to through inflation.


Companies *choosing to charge lower amounts because they can afford to* results in them firing people? What?
The 'deflation' I'm talking about is the general increase in prosperity brought about by a free market. It's the difference between the standard of living now and 200 years ago.
