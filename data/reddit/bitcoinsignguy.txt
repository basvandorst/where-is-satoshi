I'm not kidding about this.  Repeat this phrase outloud to yourself.  "I will remember the passphrase for my bitcoin wallet."  BELIEVE IT.  You're basically telling your brain it can be done.  It's meta, and defeats the " I can't remember" attitude.

It's not on my head or conscience if Jason absconds with the money.  Not that I believe he would in a minute.  The overhead  for acquiring and maintaining 501c would eat away at Jasons ability to actually help people.  i know because i talked to a lawyer about obtaining one for my own interest.  I promised the proceeds to Sean's Outpost and I intend to make good on my word.  And I'm not a college kid as the media reported.  I'm a dad wih 5 kids and a steady job.  I could have taken that money but I believe it will do better in Jason's hands.  Credit cards are not a good way to fund college btw. :)

I'm holding until I can spend bitcoins on everything I need (like cash/credit cards today).  I don't have a bitcoin-&gt;cash exit strategy.  Bitcoin is my exit strategy.

With Electrum, you can do the signing of the message offline, then jump drive over the message and signature.  Private keys never exposed to internet.  But I am not having any luck verifying.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:02:40
Not secure.  If you gave me your private key with 2 characters missing and 2 characters changed, then it would be trivial to brute force the real key and take the coins.

Right now, the IRS has no guidelines on Bitcoins that I am aware of.  Are Bitcoins a global currency, a commodity, a stock, or a new financial instrument that will take years to integrate into our current understanding of what money is?  The government is slowly taking notice, but there is no precedent!  I just want to protect myself come tax time.

[–]1040srockTax (US) 2 points 23 hours ago
It's great of you to be considering making a donation, remember to get a written receipt from the charity. At minimum it has to have names, dates, and the amount of the contribution.
If you give them within 1 year of receipt and Bitcoin appreciates in the meantime you'll be on the hook for the capital gains tax on their sale. (The amount will depend on your tax bracket, could be 0% to 39.6% + state equivalents...) [I.R.C. §1(h)] If you give them in 366 days you could take advantage of capital gains rates...and potentially the donation of appreciated property rules under I.R.C. §170.
I head about Bitcoin being looked into by the Govt. It could take years to get definite guidance from the IRS on the matter. But it's making for interesting Sunday evening reading. If anyone is interested in the GAO report to the U.S. Senate. It's here
 Also, I called a CPA today to setup a meeting. I don't want to be burned when the tax man comes for his dues. I'm trying to learn how to sign a transaction offline and then broadcast it to Jason tonight, but steep is the learning curve.

@_date: 2013-12-25 19:47:21
I would recommend trying to recreate the situation when you changed the passphrase.  Try to recall the day, the time, your mental state, what were you thinking about that day.  Who did you see, talk to, what websites did you visit.  Comb through your web history, phone call records, etc. All those things influenced the passphrase you choose.  I know this sounds crazy, but consider meditation.  Stop stressing about the lapse in memory and tell yourself with reassurance in the mirror that you will remember it.  When you're not even thinking about it, it might pop into your head.  Good luck.

Sign the transaction offline in Armory.  I had to learn to send coins to Sean's Outpost.

And you were part of the ESPN Bitcoin Sign Guy going viral!
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:38:36
The story of the ESPN Bitcoin sign making me 24k was exciting for me. :)

Make it right with Apple.  Go to the contact us form, tell them your story and honestly ask how you can make it right.  Chances are they will ignore you, but you tried ... This is the only way to free yourself of the regret and heal your open wound.  (IMHO)

I'll take two.  I'm starting up a company soon and these will be nice to show off to clients.  I need to verify they are scannable.
I'd like one side to be my famous [QR code](  and the other be a QR code that points to my website.  I'm PM when site is live.

Thanks!  It's a steep learning curve in the world of BTC.  Now, I want to send 6.7 BTC to [Sean](  so that beard comes off.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:58:25
[I know this could be shopped, but you can typed it in yourself too](  I think a space or indent was throwing me off.  Can someone now help me send some serious BTC to Sean so he can shave his manly beard off???  How do I sign a transaction offline in Electrum and then move it to my online computer.  I have a limited amount of time left!
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:52:24
Good point.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:48:42
You're welcome.  The attention totally took me by surprise!
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:54:38
Really, wow.  How did you determine that?  Like a reverse image search?
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:36:39
Just wanted to say that this has been a blast.  Attention all concerned parties, I'm cutting off any future donations as of 121 transactions /12-06-2013 from my statement about donating them to charity.  I am still on the hook to donate a second wave of coins to Sean's Outpost. I'm using the famous address for something new.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:55:03
I saw your sign and wanted to talk to you but it was hard to move around in there.  I saw a friend of mine with his BYU banner there.  All I could do was yell hi from a distance!

I didn't know the Bitcoin could do the Kickstarter or agent stuff!  That is mind blowing!!!

Seems like the best automatic wallet stealing malware detector, not general purpose malware detector.  Cool idea nevertheless.

Oh, I misunderstood you.  I was inspired by his work and hoped to make available something as awesome at a fraction of the price.  I think I just need to make some samples to prove capability and show them off when they are ready!  If they could be made for 20 bucks would you buy one?

Use Armory to control where the change of a paper wallet is sent.  Note, the change can be sent right back to the paper wallet if you so desire but it must be specified.  Here's how I was taught:
    Great. Let me know when and if you need my help.
    Here's the quick guide. With almost maximum amount of paranoia
**ON THE OFFLINE COMPUTER**
    Start Armory - Put it into either Expert or Advanced mode (might already be by default)
    Create a wallet in Armory. It will ask you to print the backup. I would leave that option checked. 
    Even if you don't print it, it will list a "root code" that you could copy down on a piece of paper.
    If you do choose to print only use You can choose to encrypt or not
    For an offline computer it's not all that important to encrypt, but that's up to you.
    Import your private key into that wallet by double clicking on wallet then clicking
    "Import/Sweep Private Keys".   
    Read the warning, basically what is saying is that 
    if you don't backup after you import the key the imported address won't be saved. Click OK.
    Copy your Private Key into the the field and click OK, since you are offline the Sweep option
    should be grayed out if not make sure the Import radio button is selected. 
    Armory should prompt you with the corresponding Public Address 
    (such as 1Kurt.... or 1HiMoM...) then click OK.
    Now click "Create Watching-Only Copy" of your wallet and save it to the USB drive.
    The Watching only copy does not contain the private keys. It only contains the public addresses, 
    so your bitcoins can't be stolen... it just so Armory knows you have an offline version of those addresses.
    
**ON THE ONLINE COMPUTER**
    In armory click "Import digital backup or watching-only wallet"
    Load the watching-only copy from the USB stick.
    Now click "Offline Transactions"
    Click Create New Offline Transaction
    Setup your transaction.
    Save your unsigned transaction to USB stick
**THEN BACK TO OFFLINE COMPUTER**
    Click "Offline Transactions"
    Click "Sign offline transaction"
    Click "Load file"
    Load the USB transaction file.
    Click Sign - follow the prompts.
    Save the Signed transaction to USB drive... 
    this now contains all the information to "Broadcast" a valid transaction, 
    so once it put on the network there's no going back
**Back on the ONLINE COMPUTER**
    Click Offline Transactions
    Click Sign offline transaction..
    Click Load file
    Load the signed transaction
    Click Broadcast
    And at that point you are all done. 
    The change will go to the address you specify during the transaction signing. 
Let me know if you need any clarification or get held up.  Following this process will minimize the chances of your private key being exposed to the internet.  That keeps your BTC safer.  You can see, BTC is not ready for grandma's savings just yet.  In a few years, the BTC landscape will be drastically improved.  More adoption by merchants and consumers and savers.

After 25 hours of work exclusively in paint and Paint.Net, I'm proud to present you, [A Bitcoin Adventure]( an original animated short featuring the Bitcoin Wizard.
Credit for some of the sprites I modified goes to megamario1234.  The short is rough around the edges, but she's got it where it counts.  It should be obvious to the most casual observer that an artist I am not.  I wished desperately I possessed the skills and tools to polish this into what my mind envisioned when I started this work.  Nevertheless, I am content to submit it to you for consideration.  
This work was done to enter a [contest]( currently taking place.
It would be fun to polish this up and add sound, but I dont have the time anymore.  I stayed up to 6AM finishing this baby!
[Warning: A Bitcoin Adventure Spoiler]( "The Bitcoin Wizard blasts the One Ring to Rule Them All off the tower and into the pipe.  That pipe is connected to the recently teleported pipe over Mount Doom.")

It's like the formatting of reddit and the weirdness of brainwallet's java verify code is trolling me.  I really wanted to send Seansoutpost the money before the matching period was over at midnight PST.

I don't want to screw up the transmission of BTC and the change wallets until I learn what I am doing.  I signed a message and you can verify in the comments below.
