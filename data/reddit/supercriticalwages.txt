BTC lost steam, and it'll keep losing market share as long as fees are high like this. 
Noone wants to transact. First because coins appreciate so fast that it gives a massive incentive to save at all costs. Second is the fees. 
Bitcoin is already centralized. Power costs did a lot of that. Big blocks could fix the fees, but centralize some more, and like you said there's no real solutions elsewhere, especially nothing that someone or many others won't find contentious. 
Bitcoin right now is good for digital gold, not much else. People are bringing out new stuff for bitcoin but atm it's really frustrating to even use bitcoin. I wanted to give presents for xmas of bitcoin. Can't do that. I'm not going to be buying any coffee, groceries, etc. with it. Noone halfway intelligent would right now. This is a really frustrating time to be a bitcoin supporter. Most of my holdings are still in bitcoin, &gt;70%. I still believe in bitcoin but all of thsi shit that's going on right now, it doesn't feel as if there's much of a coherent response for what's going to happen to make btc better in the near future.

Robbing one person is a lot easier than robbing a bank; I went into this on another thread and people called me crazy. Basically think of it like this, the payout for a bank robbery in the US is, on average, 10k$.
There's no way to spin it where bitcoin isn't a lot more tempting than a bank robbery. Plus it's a soft target, and if you succeed, there's no risk of cops tracking the bills. 
Secrecy is absolutely paramount to security. What I'm surprised at is how infrequently holders are targeted--I guess people haven't really put 2 and 2 together yet.

A bank robbery might pay 7k$ but robbing a guy who's bragging about bitcoin on his vanity plate would almost certainly net way more money, be easier, and less likely to catch after the fact.
If criminals weren't (generally) retarded a guy bragging about how much bitcoin he has/had is a flashing neon sign saying 'rob me!' It seems insane that people would stick their necks out like this but hey, you got to let people know you're a big deal, amirite guys?

For bitcoin to scale I don't see how big blocks can be avoided. I don't think bitcoin will ever make it to visa's scale but I've heard block size to handle visa levels of transactions would be something around 1.5 GB blocks. 
BTC deals with horrible levels of infighting at any mention of an increase even from 1,2,4,8 mb. We won't make it. Other chains might though, and that's why I think btc's market cap % is decreasing. It'll never be &gt;50 again.

The only problem I've ever had with coinbase or GDAX was due to them changing a rule on disallowing 2FA with a land line. That took about 10 days to fix.
They're hiring a bunch of new people and once they get caught up with all the backend stuff with support and all I think they'll be the top name in crypto again. Even with all the issues that others have had I still think they're among the most reputable.

13:30: I guess the opposite to the evils of fractional reserve banking is to keep 100% reserves, or some much higher level of reserves, to guard against a 'run on the bank' where the bank couldn't pay out all the people in the situation where everybody wanted to close out their accounts at the exact same time. This was around the time where they showed the main guys getting showered with bullets in the middle of the street, lol.
So great, let's abolish fractional reserves. All the people who are worried about the hypothetical bank run are happy, banks aren't. Banks can't make anything since they can't loan anything, or as much, out to people who want to take out the loans that the banks used to offer. If you need a loan then you're fucked, get it from the mob or something. Also all of the costs of the bank would be passed to the savers storing money there, including all the added security since each bank would be sitting on likely tens of millions of dollars (i.e. 100% reserves).
Basically think through some of the stuff they say. Think about 'what is seen and what is unseen'
Basically like most politically charged documentaries it ignores some stuff in order to make the most convincing argument it can.

You sound like a pussy ass little bitch.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:38:40
You will likely receive a notice from the IRS that they changed your tax return to reflect what they found, e.g. capital gain. Then you'll have to pay that and a penalty. The penalty isn't that much but if you want to stay on the right side of the law it's best to do your best to file your taxes as best as you can. It's more crucial that you do this the more money that you made: it looks a lot more criminal to 'forget' to report tens of thousands of dollars in gains than it does a few thousand.
The real answer is we're going to find out this year. I wouldn't be surprised if we would see a ton of unreported things this year, either from ignorance or people saying 'holy shit! short-term capital gains == big taxes!!' I think especially the day traders around here, if there are any left, are really going to shit themselves when they get hit with short term gains tax.

Have you looked under 'settings' 'limits'? You can request limit changes.
Afaik in the past the bank transfer limit was pretty much set but was automatically increased over time (like...10 months or something like that). I joined a couple of years ago though so that's just off of my experience then.
Check out your [verifications]( page, I'm curious what that says atm.

I don't even think of 'bubble' as a useful term...it's something people claim to see post hoc when they can see on a graph that it rose then fell. "See! I told you..." but they didn't...unless they can pair it with how they're basing what the value should be compared to what it is, just saying bitcoin is a bubble isn't really all that meaningful. I mean, we all know that crypto is very volatile right now, but telling it to people after the price drops doesn't mean very much when everybody already knows it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:32:25
I'm a hodler ('13). I believe in bitcoin... and I'm a bit anxious. Bitcoin's positioned well as 'digital gold,' it serves that purpose very well. But it's starting to lag significantly in other aspects and it's impacting its further adoption. At the same time other coins are offering what bitcoin offers but with fewer problems. I'm still going to hodl long term, but it's definitely something to at least keep an eye on at this point. Just my 2 satoshis.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:19:09
In general they don't. Because there's no method discovered that exists to reliably predict future market conditions/prices, the longer a given trader attempts to beat the market the more likely they are to, at best, match average rates of returns. 
Sure, there have been some good gambles. Just saw a vid of some guy who sold a mclauren to buy stellar. Will it pay off? Perhaps...but if it does, would that necessarily make him a 'good trader' just because he took a big gamble and it payed off?

If this is true, and I believe you, this reduces the number of active users. If each user has 2 addys, this means there is a total of some 10 million active users. Not many. 
I have visited that site each day though, and it seems that there is a trend to add more than 600k addresses each day. If this continues this will increase the # of active addys, almost doubling them. 
So..I guess since it's speeding up I'm contradicting what I originally said. Still, I think the number of active addresses is kind of troubling, it surprised me how few users there really are.

Got out of jail and been catching myself up on the market. I just can't stand it when people can't even look into oscillations before commenting on what I should do. If plebs here would just look into ta they'd understand how to predict the market often weeks in advance like I do. The simplest ta technique I know has a 100% success rate even. You just look at past week's performance and draw a line of best fit for next week. And if the market doesn't perform as expected, just delete the youtube video. Don't they know who I am?

If bitcoin goes mainstream the block size will need to be increased to handle additional on-chain transactions. There is no way around that that doesn't compromise the network in some other way, e.g. massive fees to force fewer transactions.

I'm just using past returns, I know, not perfect. But it's reasonable to expect an average 7% annual return on a passive index fund that tracks a large market. 
I took 1.07^2000 to get the amount it would be after 2000 years of average return. Then I trook that and multiplied it by 100. 
it was mostly a joke but the principle is true; if you have 2000 years to play around with, you don't need high returns to make out great, consistency would do just fine.
