I think people are investing in the Ethereum devs, so they chose to stick with ETH. Also 80% of the community (or something) chose to roll back the transactions, so it is unsurprising that the majority decided ETH was the legitimate coin.

Yeah I get that, but I'd quite like to see experimental data. 
There are a number of assumptions that need to underlie the maths. For instance I have no data limits so an increase in the quantity of data would not actually cost me anything, yet the premise of your argument seems to be that bandwidth would be prohibitively expensive. 
Edit: Changed from "I have no bandwidth limits" to "I have no data limits".

How many times have you seen violent crime taking place and been disapproving that it is so regularly men committing the crime? Be honest. I bet the answer is never, even though the statement would be statistically relevant. 
It is neither always men nor always women. Moreover, it is neither always black people nor always white people. 
The fact that you chose to single out race makes it very clear you have a prejudice towards black people. Saying "I have black friends" is not a defence against racism.

Even if exchanges adopt it, there would still be a widespread clusterfuck if it is up to the holder to implement for their own private transactions. Even if all they need to do is update their software, they would not necessarily know that they need to do that.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:46:33
I hadn't thought of that. It's not like anyone would need to convince the miners to jump ship in order to fork. It would be up to the individuals nodes as to which client they want to run. 
Exchanges would likely play a significant role. They would stand to gain significant interest on deposited coins.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:40:47
Okay, I take your point. It is more a thought exercise than anything.
Same to you.

It is a type of authoritarian rule, however that is not the only condition that must be met. TL;DR at bottom.
This is a difficult topic because there is no clear definition of fascism. The term fascism comes from Mussolini's National Fascist Party, and some people argue that was the only true fascist state in the same way that Germany was the only true Nazi state.  
Early definitions tried to define fascism by its causes and cast it as a reaction to Marxism, and therefore they all have significant Marxist overtones (i.e. fascism is a bourgeoise attempt to assert a hyper-capitalist state).
It was only in the 90s that people moved away from defining fascism by its causes and instead began to define it by what it looked like. The following comes from an essay I once wrote about fascism:




Under that definition, I would struggle to shoehorn the current Chinese state into a fascist category as there is no concerted attempt to remould society into an idealist vision form a previous political age. As an interesting side note, it is easy to see how both white supremacy and radical Islam could meet this definition of fascism. 
However that is simply one definition as proposed by Griffin, and you do not have to use it. As Zeev Sternhell puts it:


And Allardyce notes the difficulty of arriving at a consensus definition:


So if you want to make the case that China is a fascist state, you probably could, but you would need to justify it in terms of you consider to be the minimum requirements of fascism.
In the essay I then go on to say the term fascism has undergone inflation (i.e. devalued), and its usage in contemporary politics is quite different to how it might have been used in the past. This doesn't make contemporary usage wrong, just different:


**TL;DR: Maybe yes, probably no. Fascism generally requires remoulding of society into idealised vision of previous political epoch**

You can have quantitative easing without fiat, and fiat without quantitative easing. 
Also bitcoin isn't really that far from being a fiat currency, as it is not backed by any commodity. If the government declared it was legal tender, it would fulfil most definitions of fiat currency.

@_date: 2017-02-10 14:01:39
Okay, well that doesn't say anything about how much the extra bandwidth would cost or if it would prohibit people from running a node. It also assumes that ISPs will retain a cap on data usage, but here in the UK at least there are plenty of genuinely unlimited plans.

Are we reading the same article? I finished that with the overwhelming impression that block size would not negatively effect the number of full nodes.
Some quotes:
- **CPU:** "[A]s long as Bitcoin nodes are allowed to max out at least 4 cores of the machines they run on, we will not run out of CPU capacity for signature checking unless Bitcoin is handling 100 times as much traffic as PayPal."
- **Network:** "This sort of bandwidth [necessary for 2000 TPS] is already common for even residential connections today, and is certainly at the low end of what colocation providers would expect to provide you with."
- **Storage:** "The primary limiting factor in Bitcoin's performance is disk seeks once the unspent transaction output set stops fitting in memory. Once hard disks are phased out in favour of SSDs, it is quite possible that access to the UTXO set never becomes a serious bottleneck."

Supply of money is not only how much of it is physically produced by the central bank, but also the velocity of money. 
If I am confident that someone will be willing to pay me bitcoin, then I will be happy to spend my bitcoin. Bitcoin would be said to have a high velocity, and the supply of bitcoin has therefore increased. The price of a basket of goods would then also increase. 
If I am not confident that someone will be willing to pay me bitcoin, then I will be cautious about spending any bitcoin I already have. In this scenario, bitcoin has a low velocity, and the supply of bitcoin therefore decreases. The price of a basket of goods would then fall. 
Therefore bitcoin will still be subjected to inflation and deflation even once all of the coins are mined. We cannot avoid that fate, although the inflation and deflation in a bitcoin economy would be efficient and beneficial. 
Also this video fails to identify an important distinction between differing rates of inflation. Where inflation is below 1%, there is really nothing to be too concerned about. It would indicate a healthy balance between the devaluation of a bitcoin in your pocket and economic growth (in some instances). Inflation is not inherently evil.
Higher rates of inflation are obviously problematic.

I generally agree. I can't see Bitcoin making the jump any time soon even if PoS can become as sturdy as PoW has proven to be. 
It would also be vehemently opposed by miners, who would stand to lose their entire business model. I can't imagine them going down without a fight.

Thanks for your reply. I see that it is contingent on data limits in the US. Here in the UK, there are a lot of plans that do not have any data limit at all. I am paying £22 a month for completely unlimited data and 40Mbits connection. 
I wonder why it is that the US is not offering similar services. Perhaps it has something to do with the lower density of the population and the cost of maintaining the physical network?

Localbitcoins itself is a bit of an arse-ache. I use Solidi if I want to buy from a broker, which is often close to or better than the price at LBC, or Coinfloor if I am buying a larger volume.

The debate has moved somewhat. 
It started out with you trying to convince me math proves that nodes would become centralised with a large block size, but you then linked me to an article which didn't support your position. 
After that you ask if it is only middle class computer enthusiasts who get to run nodes, [but that is already kind of the case]( 
You then revert to making an assertion about Segwit and LN, which doesn't really have anything at all to do with my initial question. 
I'm not on either side of the debate here. I am trying to do thorough research into the topic. These arguments have not made any kind of compelling case that a larger block size would render a full node too expensive for the average user, which was my initial question.

@_date: 2017-03-05 17:40:32
Yeah it's the miners' actions that are most important in determining the direction. But if there is a hard fork then the miners need to mine the most profitable chain, which is where the masses come into play as it is they who determine the price. 
But others do have influence. If one side can put forward the most compelling argument, or show that their choice is the most popular, then that could sway miners.

So are coins almost destroyed then recreated in the coinbase transaction?
For example, in a situation where total inputs are 2 btc and total outputs are 1 btc, the protocol essentially identifies that difference and then is able to reward 12.5+1 btc to the miner?

I mean the miners and the people who hold ether (no one owns Ethereum), who have voted with their dollars and their hash power. These people constitute the community, and they have opted for ETH. It is a community decision.
I don't know of any cryptocurrency community where each member holds an equal vote to every other member. Community consensus in crypto doesn't work like that. If *demos kratos* is the rule of the people, then the evidence of the people's decision can be seen in the hash rate and price of ETH vs ETC. That evidence is contingent on consent and cannot be derived by any other method.
You need to read up on Athenian democracy. Only those people who are a) male and b) owned land were allowed to vote.
