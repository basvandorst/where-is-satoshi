That 1 BTC that you put on the channel is therefore 'locked in' on the chain, until you close the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:05:43
Yes, that is what i'm saying.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:50:00
Except no-one but you has control of your funds at any point. You can close a channel at any point in time, no matter what 'stage' it's in, and you will receive the bitcoin 'owed' to you from the channel.

Not when its in your bank ;)

Buying 1$ worth 1000 times has the same effect as buying 1000$ worth 1 time.

This is where we look back at the fundamentals bitcoin was created on. Permission-less, decentralised. A checking account is neither of these things, whereas the lightning network maintains them both. That is the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:33:13
Yeah, I mean 'locked up' so that they can't be double spent

Can you tell the future? Its perfectly plausible that banks will give some insurance, as if they don't there is less reason to use a bank. That is one of the benefits of bitcoin existing; banks now have to change the way they operate as people have an alternative to them (holding your own keys). Banks will no longer have a monopoly on currency 'storage'.

After arguing with this guy for a while somewhere else in this thread, I just noticed that he's commenting the same shit everywhere he can lol.

Security. They give you security in return. Money in the bank is insured, and removes to risk of losing your keys. Laymen will not be able to securely manage their own keys, or at the least will be too scared to. Banks are important. I understand to whole 'fuck the banks' attitude, but maybe instead of trying to get rid of them we should be trying to change and improve them.

Well that is kind of my point, people now have the option to trust banks, or to use bitcoin with their own private keys. If banks up their game, become more trustworthy, provide a service that bitcoin alone doesn't provide, then people will continue to use them. That's fine, you are free to use bitcoin the way you want, which is clearly with total control over your own money. This may not be for everyone.


Thanks, but satoshi's vision for bitcoin is not be\-all and end\-all. People are free to use Bitcoin how they like, and to the degree they feel comfortable with. And again, anyone who does have the same opinion of banks as you, are free to use bitcoin the way satoshi envisioned it.


Of course banks do more than just store money for people, I didn't expect to have to list all the other things they do. But as corrupt as banks are (which I do agree with), that does not mean that in the future banks are not less corrupt, and provide more useful services with more reasonable rates. Banks have their place in the economy, and by Bitcoin existing banks will be forced to change their ways.
I understand your views on banks, believe me. If Bitcoin was to become a *stable* global currency, I would  continue to hold my own keys just like you. But there are plenty of people that don't hold as extreme views as you, and would be happy to trade some trust for security, especially those that are less technically savvy.

Haha mate, sounds like you don't understand bitcoin now. If its not enforced on the protocol layer then it can be used how I please. Your idea of bitcoin is starting to sound pretty centralised around satoshi. Oh well you're clearly a troll so bye!

Update: Upgraded to 0.5.2, sent 10000 satoshi to get some receiving capacity and it's all working! Thanks for all the help.
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:57:34
Hmmmm not sure what's causing that! Can't find anything about it on google. Thanks for trying though, do you have any ideas what may be causing it?
@_date: 2019-02-14 08:20:49
On LND you can do lncli feereport
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:48:06
Are you thinking of Hal Finney?
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:53:18
Still not entirely sure it's fully up and running - I first tried 5 months ago but got really busy and put it on hold for a while - could anyone with more knowledge let me know if this is set up publicly and able to route payments? I've found it on 1ml: [
If it is working feel free to set up a channel with me - or give me your address and I will try set one up with you!
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:39:37
I'm using 0.5.0 - I see there are a couple later small releases, could this be the issue?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:34:05
I know this seems to go against the ideology bitcoin was founded on, but this is definitely good news. The masses are not technically literate enough to safely store their own keys, and those that are still have to option of avoiding banks.
There was no way that cryptocurrencies were going to replace fiat if this was not an option.

Here's a pay req for 50 sats to test: lnbc500n1pwxrsjupp5t55jkpvmkfh7az69ng5wr3jywrjymneznemcul9a26c4yn5zxpesdqqcqzysyf7036rjkl74xh20zd3dt4pmrhj338ff35lkfss9zdhp3k42fhy4ln8h3ux2tfvqg75zxrf42xjdtrl3rn0ya8fcadjk65rqmy8m8sgqckltfd
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:59:55
I'm adding more capacity now which hopefully gives autopilot more to work with, hopefully that allows for more routes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:52:50
What? Why wouldn't that have a mining fee?
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:47:39
Alright i'll try that - it'll have to be tomorrow though - appreciate the help! 
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:42:52
version 0.5.0. I've noticed that sometimes commands hang and I have to CTRL-C to quit, and some times they work (addinvoice, openchannel etc).
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:34:15
Ah didn't see this in time - invoice expired!
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:36:25
Here's an invoice for 10 sats: lnbc100n1pwxrsyjpp5fafdlmsht25lag44skuzefumr74d75jt3ryxhj5trr65derxrnpqdqqcqzysleqyx9rncevsrv0tfce92gxalpe3mxmmwey6cfe747qk6d7rttz33dcqks8nzpp8p0c900zh22plvffwv6gpsk7p7ey34e5d9uls97gpf60ufp
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:50:49
haha yeah I know this now, just regret not forcing myself to research more 4 years ago!
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:41:46
Great news, will actually consider running a lightning node now, hopefully this brings more attention to lightning and remove doubt that it's 'vaporware'..
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:34:56
Was it a long password that made use of numbers and punctuation? It's possible the security fault was on the machine you used to encrypt it rather than a brute force attack on the file.

If you make the paper wallet offline then it's a non issue.
Even if you were online it'd be pretty unlikely.
