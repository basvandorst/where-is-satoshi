Some wallets allow you to replace the transaction with higher fees
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:28:15
The topic is about wallet fees, which you can pay the amount you want to. If you are doing arbitrage trading, you are bound to third-party prices, which you do not control. If you don't like their prices, just don't trade with them.

I used ubuntu, from scratch, since it was booted from the usb stick. Does it make it less safe?
Also, I do not have the intention to spend these coins (i.e. make transactions), aren't paperwallets more recommended in this case?
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:41:34
Since it's encrypted, why not store it on your email, desktop, dropbox, i mean...everywhere?

Think of it as a bunch of people trying to solve a big sudoku. It's very hard to find a solution but It's fairly simple to check if a solution is right. Whoever gets to discover the solution by trial-and-error, keeps the bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:27:37
If you have a nfc tag, you can simply use a tag writter app to write the private key into your nfc tag, though I wouldn't recommend using a non encrypted private key

I've laminated three copies of the BIP38 string and keep them inside a box at three different locations. The only problem is that I memorize the password for decrypting the string (it's long, 47 characters, but something I managed to memorize over the years) and if I die nobody would have access to the wallet.
I just can't see the difference between storing hardware wallet recovery seed and BIP38 encrypted private key on a piece of paper or inside your head. Please enlight me haha
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:31:02
It's awesome how easy it is for businesses to setup a bitcoin wallet and start accepting it! To the moon!

You said people is tight on money because of holidays, it's not holiday for everyone, especially Thanksgiving 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:50:41
I cannot see a simpler way then managing an array of integers that represent each pair. Bitaddress let you download the whole html and generate everything offline

Last I checked thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated in the United States

When you create a new wallet mycelium, you have the option to make a backup. This backup is composed of 12 words, it's called a seed. If you ever loose your phone, you can enter these words on another phone with Mycelium installed on it, and recover all your bitcoin from the previous wallet, obviously.
It is recommended you store the seed on a piece of paper and keep it away from water, fire, moisture. You can have it laminated. You can also use Shamir's secret sharing scheme to split your seed into n shares and you need m shares to reconstruct your original seed. Ex: you split your seed into 4 shares and you need to combine any 2 shares to reconstruct it. Passguardian can perform that for you.

Desktop wallets and hardware wallets manage the change addresses for you, so you don't have to worry about that. With paper wallet there is no explicit change address. Imagine buying a 2 dollar coffee with a 5 dollar bill. You give 5 dollars and the cashier returns 3 dollars. If you try doing that with your funds from the paper wallet, there is the possibility that the change address is not specified, and you simply send your funds, expecting some change and get none. So always sweep your entire paper wallet to another wallet before spending the funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:16:15
Yes. I have been using paper wallets for some quite some time now but I'm moving from that because of privacy concerns
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:28:35
You mean withdraw from the paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:00:28
Yeah, but some day you might want to cash out, and when you do, you will need to remember to sweep the whole balance, just a heads up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:18:21
Nothing is stopping them. The market will value the most popular currency. I'm not sure if bitcoin is going to be the future of currency, but i'm pretty much damn sure crypto is here to stay

After buying from an exchange, you need to create a wallet, being that a software you run on your computer to manage your keys, a hardware wallet, a paper wallet, etc. There are many options.
The most basic, and common entry point, is to use a app on your smartphone. Check out Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:27:54
Yes, if you are willing to invest a couple of thousands of dollars, alright, get a better wallet. 
But if you are buying your first 5 bucks worth of btc, you can give it a try
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:56:18
Just divide the amount of money spent by your total amount of bitcoins. That's the average price paid. 
Now divide todays price by your average price. That's your profit.
Ex: paid $9000 USD for 1.7 BTC. The price today is $6155. The result is 1.16, so 16% of profit

if I use a wallet like electrum to sign a transaction with many unspent outputs, how dangerous can it be?
edit: I mean...sweeping a paper wallet using electrum given that this paper wallets has received bitcoin in small amounts at a time
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:56:48
Chances are your cryptographic algorithm is not as secure as you think it is. Just get an encryption algorithm that is known to be secure. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:58:01
[28:28]( is he talking about Segwit2x? lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:39:10
You would get the private key part of your printed wallet and use it to create a transaction sending ALL the funds to another wallet. In electrum, you would create a new wallet and use the sweep option. This would send all your funds to the newly created wallet.
If you are going the paper wallet way, educate yourself on spending your funds. You should never, ever, try to spend a fraction of paper wallet's coins. Always send the full amount to another wallet, than spend as you please.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:37:46
Electrum is a great wallet
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:12:24

Because there are a few big companies, which hold the majority of the hash power, who are trying to push a change down everyone's throat without asking people's opinion, behind closed doors, rushing the development process (yes, it's been rushed, software as important as this should not be developed with haste), with very little information available (go check their github), all of which goes against the philosophy in the first place. That's just not how things are supposed to be done, and since they are still doing this way, i'm not giving them my support. How far back have YOU read?
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:29:19


So does paper wallets


Same apply to paper wallets (both should be given proper care)


Not saying his story is fake, but this kind of exploit is not proven to exist (most people would not have access to it, if it does exist), so in case of losing your seed words (or private key, in case of a paper wallet), you are screwed anyways 


Poor caring for his important information led to this, being a set of words or a string of character

You do not need to wait for transaction confirmation, they will eventually be confirmed (probably). Do you charge people upon check-in or check-out? If on check-in, you can have them make the transaction and keep watching for confirmations later on
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:25:31
This sums up perfectly why I CANNOT understand why would holders want to use trezor over a paper wallet...the point of failure is still the same!!!

I'm not kidding. I said holders (those who do not transact).
My point is: it doesn't matter how fancy it is, at the end of the day, losing your a bunch of words or a set of characters on a piece of paper is what get your BTCs gone
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:50:55
Security is not supposed to be convenient. I personally think that a proper generated and maintained paper wallet is more secure than hardware wallets. See 'glacier protocol'
