I bought 2 BTC @ $580 yesterday. 
I bought my first BTC almost 2 months ago - this was just after the big crash caused by news that China was slapping restrictions on BTC (that turned out to be total BS by the way) and the price then was $540. I've been doing some dollar cost averaging over the last month as well, buying 0.25 BTC every few weeks when the price was fluctuating around $650 - $700. So I'm up to 3.5 BTC for the time being.
My buy/sell strategy for the short term: I'm going to sell 3 of my Bitcoins once the price gets back around $850-900 and hold the other 0.5 BTC. Then, I'll use the $2,550 - $2700 I got from selling my 3 BTC to buy back in once the price shoots back down to $580 - $620. I know I've been in the BTC game for a short time relative to others, but if there’s one thing I’m certain of, it’s BTC’s volatility. If you develop a strategy and can remove your emotions from the equation (easier said than done), I think many of us can profit from BTC’s volatility AND accumulate cheap coins along the way.

If you can afford the loss, plan on holding for the long-term, and believe in Bitcoin's viability, I'd say buy now.

If you don't agree with us, at least have a semi-intelligent counterpoint.

He gave you 0.1 BTC - not $82.42.
