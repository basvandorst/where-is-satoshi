Just pasting the bitcoin address on the webpage is fine.. If you want to make a link see here;
and you can turn that link into a QR code using google's QR code generator;
 here&gt;
[an example (taken from the URI page)](
but yea.. a plain old text bitcoin address that can be copy/pasted is probably still easiest for people to deal with.

mastercard/visa -&gt; liqpay -&gt; btc-e is good for small amounts. you get hit with your CC's GBP-&gt;USD rate and a 1% deposit fee, but could be worse. also btc-e seems to have cheaper prices than other exchanges so you may get a better deal.
for larger amounts (say &gt;£1000), a euro bank wire (SEPA) transfer to bitstamp.net seems like an ok option (you can generally do this from a uk online banking sites and the fee is around £10 - you also incur two fx fees for GBP -&gt; EUR -&gt; USD and a bitstamp trading fee). The double fx transfer is cheaper than sending directly from GBP -&gt; USD because only EUR transfers go through the SEPA payment system - and you want that otherwise intermediary banks will apply other transfer fees.

well the main thing that happened is that Dwolla changed their usage policy to explicitly allow them to charge back transactions - so yes, it's still 'as unreliable' in that sense. I don't know what happened with tradehill, I guess they may have been advised to just drop it as it would cost too much to prosecute without enough chance of success.
