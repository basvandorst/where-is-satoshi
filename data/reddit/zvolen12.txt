I was having the same issue for weeks, then I downloaded the Coinbase app and tried that way and it worked the first time. Hopefully it works for you as well.

Wow, if only.
I wonder what next year will look like and if we will get similar gains.

No problem, glad it worked. ��

I’m hoping it goes there again so I can buy more.

The wild volatility of the market has certainly subsided, I understand it is still swinging more than any other asset class but no where near what it did before. To be fair it is still early and things could change drastically in an instant, just surprising.

How will I be notified of my .01?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:42
Didn’t we just have post complaining that BTC had no volatility and asking where are the fluctuations?

Verified via ID? I’m assuming that’s what you are referring to? I had an account with Coinbase that I could trade with but with GDAX I had to verify via an ID, on GDAX it failed but when I used the Coinbase app to verify my ID it worked and unlocked GDAX.

My amounts were less than a dollar and all I had to do was enter the two numbers; for instance 0.52 deposited so verified 52 back on Coinbase not .52. Maybe that’s the issue?

I didn’t put my buy order LOW enough, never thought that would be the case.

It states BY 2018 not IN which is why he stated 12 days.

I had to wait more than 20 business days for my USD to clear once transferring from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro. I am already verified on both as well.

Even if you were there is no guarantee you would have acted on the information. Plenty of people were around and still did nothing.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:58:45
But didn’t he tell us his story anyways?
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:20:25
I see, thank you for the follow up and I’m sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:55:29
Merry Christmas all!!

When did you inherit the 3.5M? If you had a positive net worth prior how do you only show a 2M net worth now? I can’t imagine all that was losses or ‘fun’ money, what am I missing?
Also, good on you for the personal finance side but I don’t see this ad being a PSA for holding bitcoin, if anything it’s a PSA for buying early.
Congrats!
