Your mind is having hard time accepting new technologies, this is very common after 30, maybe you should leave BTC and blockchain to your children and stick to collecting postage stamps.
If I observe things from your perspective literally nothing has any value.
Gold is just a shiny rock, everything digital is 0's and 1's, diamonds are glass, love is just hormones going crazy...
Fortunately for us BTC holders our reality is very different. 
All that things you consider valuable have is tradition and emotional value, nothing else. Do a Google search on "history of gold" maybe it will open your eyes. Also do a Google search about new technologies through time, literally every single great invention was frowned upon by the greates minds of that time. (phone, train, car, radio etc). Also do a Google search about % of world population holding or using Bitcoin. 
At the moment Bitcoin has only emotional value and in time tradition will slowly come. 
At the moment value of 1 BTC is $3850 
In 20 years it will be $0? Bubble will burst? 
I don't know maybe I am blind or stupid, doesn't make sense to me...

100$ up 200$ down... Another dead cat bounce I can't believe this shitcoin biggest scam of all... 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:52:41
I hope we will not see $2900 it would really upset me

Something unrelated to Bitcoin. Failed company from the 90's that tried to create internet money. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:14:50
Buying coffee with BTC is ridiculous, BTC is an asset, it's not internet money.
And if you look long-term, why would I pay $2500 for a cup of coffee.

I am not here to fight buddy, it's all I'm saying 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:25:12
If you took the time to read the posts here you wouldn't be talking that way.
I am not pretending to have some secret insight, do you want me to say Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme? Is that easier to accept? I can't, sorry. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:57:14
Elaborate please? Reverse based on what? Reverse how and into what? 
If you look at the trading volume and the demand only, anyone that believes that BTC can drop to 1k knows literally nothing about trading.
Even if SEC rejects the ETF, if Bakkt never happens and we get bombarded with bad news every day through out 2019 Bitcoin will still not drop to 1k. It's mathematically impossible.
A week ago someone said that SHA256 was "hacked" and that all BTC pk's are compromised, I was amazed how many people have fallen for this prank.
If you put your money on something you better have strong reasons to do so.
I know I had many before I finally purchased BTC.

Seems like everyone lost hope, this can mean only one thing... 
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:37:01
I don't understand what you are trying to say, probably you don't understand your self.
Son I am not selling anything here, not spamming, if you are looking for an meaningless agreement I'm not the right person.
Cheers!

Only reason people are against BTC so much is because they don't understand it or they feel bad for missing out. Some even think their negative comments can drive the price down. Trust me your comment is just one drop in the ocean.
Sorry to disappoint you, but "It's a bubble" is not an argument.

So being a redditor for a longer period of time is supposed to give me some sort of credibility? :D
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:33:47
Keep proving my point. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:22:50
Being a Redditor means nothing, I wasn't born two weeks ago. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:24:59
I am NOT trying to predict the price here and I am most certainly NOT trying to pretend that I have some secret insider info about the future of Bitcoin.
I am just commenting the things I see.
BTC is going up, it's very obvious.
Forget about everything else and just look at the stock market... US Stock market size is about 30tn (not sure exactly), that Swiss stock exchange SIX only has 1,6 or 1,9tn market cap(can't remember exactly).
Traders will move into crypto in time.
Because crypto is new fresh interesting more dynamic faster, they will follow others, they will go where the money is.
Why aren't you trading stocks?
It's boring, complicated, it's 2019
BTC time is coming, but this is only how I see things. Maybe you think the opposite, can't wait to hear why... 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:32:42
People can see how these Redditors have nothing to say about Bitcoin, either for or against it.
All they are talking about is me, "you are not a guru", "you are not special", "you are redditor for 2 weeks", I am amazed how weak this community is, why are you even here on a Bitcoin sub?
You are obviously here only to flame each other, to spill your poison and negative emotions and maybe to laugh at memes.
I was hoping to discuss the future of Bitcoin, what a waste of time and words... 
Sigh... 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:49:17
Haha buddy I am the one to blame you either bought  or can't afford BTC not even 
This is the disbelief phase no matter who says it and for how long he is a member of some forum/social network
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:40:42
For little fishes it's the Grinch, but among whales it's called the Disbelief phase. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:30:06
 we are in disbelief phase
 traders are massively moving from stock market into crypto. Signals are obvious and it makes sense, it was expected, even if it's only because of the dynamic and the excitement of the crypto market. In time, BTC will take over stock market and that only will drive the price to unimaginable heights. New traders will be trading satoshis in 20 years.
 new technologies
 world usage(btc based MMORPG, btc loyalty programs etc)
And much more...
Educate your self, read about our recent history 80's 90's, Bitcoin is very predictable
Cheers!

Everyone can see that people that are "against" BTC are as I already said either bitter for missing out or can't afford it. Also there are older people that can't accept new technologies. Show me a valid argument against Bitcoin, can't wait to laugh at it... 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:47:31
Fucking pessimistic, why? Aren't you looking forward ETF, Bakkt, technological break through? Why are you even here if all you are hoping for is sub 3k? I see bright future ahead Bitcoin that's why I put my entire life saving in it, do you even own Bitcoin and why?
