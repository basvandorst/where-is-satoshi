It's not obvious.  I just started lurking forums after the price explosion and the majority of people said to use Mt. Gox or Bitstamp.  The majority of people said Mt. Gox is the largest most established exchange with the longest history.  And as mentioned the $100 premium could be attributed to being larger/more secure exchange.

On the whole we know a proven track record means something.  There are always a few bad eggs that commit fraud, but that doesn't mean you can't just throw out a proven track record as meaning "nothing". A proven track record is a very important factor, of course it's not the only factor.
A company that has a bad track record of screwing people over means nothing as well?  You wouldn't look at their history as an indication that you may be doing something foolish trusting them with your money?

The article doesn't say that.  The tagline only asks the question "Is the 'Mark of the Beast' the future of money?".  The article doesn't say that or even imply it.  It has the loaded phrase "new world order" in the article, but that means something different to everyone, from far flung fantasies to merely the way things will be.
The article has some quotes from Ray Kurzweil only.
Here is the real [article](  It's clearly a bait headline for clicks.

To be fair they typically bait something else, but they are young and boyish.

A bank uses that money though through fractional reserve.  It's still pumped into the economy through loans and financing.  Bitcoin hoarders money is stagnated, it's much more similar to putting it in your mattress.

Volatility isn't really great for an investment, it's great for a speculation.
Investment: the outlay of money usually for income or profit
Speculation: activity in which someone buys and sells things (such as stocks or pieces of property) in the hope of making a large profit but with the risk of a large loss
An investment provides a fairly well known dividend or ROI.  Picking individual stocks is speculation, buying the market is investing.  Bitcoin is speculation, not investment.
