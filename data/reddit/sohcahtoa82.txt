You're probably trolling, but I'll bite anyways.  No, the protocol can't just generate the missing coins, because they're not actually missing.  They're in the hands of thieves.  Even if the coins did just vanish, they'd be gone for good.  The network can't tell the difference between coins that disappear versus coins that just haven't been spent.

It *IS* their fault.  The "bug" in the Bitcoin protocol has been known for over a *year*, and *no other exchange was affected because they all worked around it*.  


Hah.  I'm not angry at all.  In fact, I'm rather pleased with myself.  I never really had the cash in hand to buy bitcoins, but once it started dropping, I realized it was my chance.  I watched the charts at Bitstamp and bought my first bitcoin from Coinbase for $544, only a couple dollars over the lowest price of the night.


The price dropped because Gox coded their site poorly and now they're under water.  Its very likely they've lost a lot of bitcoins and don't actually have enough to give everyone their money.  This creates a loss of confidence and people panic sell.
If Gox coded their site properly, this whole thing never would have happened.  This is **absolutely** their fault.


The issue has been known for well over a year and Gox never fixed it on their end.  End of story.

If you're CPU mining, you'll probably earn about $0.25 worth of bitcoins over the course of the entire year.  Meanwhile, you'll have consumed probably over $100 in electricity.
If you're GPU mining, you might earn $2.00 worth of bitcoins while consuming $200 in electricity.
You can absolutely forget about mining bitcoins on anything other than an ASIC.  You will burn through far more in electricity than you would earn.  Even if electricity is free for you, I would advise against it unless your electricity comes from a clean source (solar, wind, etc).
CPU mining on any coin that's worth anything is dead.  On the other hand, there are a lot of alt coins that are profitable to GPU mine.  Dogecoin, Vertcoin, and others.  Check @_date: 2014-03-03 08:36:36
The only way bitcoin could possibly be regulated is if the people that want to regulate it built a MASSIVE mining network and controlled more than 50% of the hashing power, which at this point would require a MAJOR capital investment.  Even then, all they could really do is choose which transactions to process and which not to.

I have $40,000 in student loan debt (I will finish my Computer Science degree in 5 more weeks and I'm already getting calls from job applications!), and when I got my tax return, I spent $1,000 on bitcoin when it bottomed out at $540 last weekend rather than paying off a bit of my student loans.  Does that count?
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:33:20


I bought $1,000 worth of bitcoins.  My risk is $1,000, which isn't much compared to the $40,000 of loan debt I have.
FWIW, I have zero credit card debt, and its not because I've been taking out absurd student loans to keep it paid off.

I accept that it is a big risk, and it could end up being a huge mistake.  I'm normally not a gambling man.  I've never been to a casino, and I've probably only spent about $20 on lottery tickets over the course of my whole life.
But its a calculated risk.  I figured that it would quickly recover from the crash from MtGox having a meltdown once people realized it really didn't mean anything.  It might crash again if and when MtGox re-opens withdrawals and people pull their btc out and sell it somewhere else, but there will be a lot of people there gladly gobbling up the cheap coins.
Unless a major fatal flaw is found in the bitcoin protocol (tx malleability isn't exactly a fatal flaw), I don't think it'll ever dip below $500 ever again.

ITT: People misinterpreting the OP
I think the OP knows that tx malleability *can* be used to steal coins from someone running a poorly coded website.
What the OP was *trying* to say is that coins cannot just be stolen from a random wallet.  I can't just look at the block chain, see some transactions that have already been confirmed, and just steal those coins.  Even more important, if I use the official wallet, and I send you some coins, you can't use tx malleability to fool my wallet and steal my coins.
Of course, I could be wrong, maybe the OP *is* an idiot and doesn't understand transaction malleability, but I'm thinking its more likely that he does understand it, and people are misinterpreting the thread title.

It's a simple statement of fact.  Merchants that take bitcoin through BitPay and have all transactions immediately get converted to USD is bad for the value of bitcoin.  Every purchase with bitcoin will result in an immediate sell, which will push the value down slightly.

Bitcoins are not files or values that are stored in a file.
Instead, the block chain keeps track of how many btc are held by each address like a ledger.  When you send coins, the block chain shows that X coins went from address A to B.
What is stored in your wallet.dat are your private keys.  It is *absolutely vital* that you *do not lose this file*.  If you lose it, you lose access to your coins, and there is no possible way to get them back.
This is why so many people recommend not using the official Bitcoin client and using an online wallet of some sort.  If your hard drive explodes, you lose your coins unless you made a recent backup of your wallet.dat.

@_date: 2017-05-30 08:05:13


A block on the block chain contains data about all the transactions being verified by that block.  Right now, there's a hard cap of 1 megabyte per block.  Since the Bitcoin protocol aims for a specific amount of time for each block, this creates a hard cap on how many transactions can be done per minute.  This means that Bitcoin can't scale to higher popularity since there won't be enough room on the blockchain for all the transactions.
There's a huge pissing match over what the solution is.  SegWit (short for Segregated Witness) is one answer.  Another one is just simply increasing the block size limit.

Help me understand something.
I can't help but think that ASIC miners are bad for bitcoins at this stage.  They've added a TON of hashing power to the network which has created an arms race that has priced out anybody who takes an interest in mining.  Its gotten so bad that even current-gen ASICs won't pay for themselves as the block difficulty is skyrocketing.
If mining has a NEGATIVE expected value, then what reason is there to mine?  Are some people really that interested in bitcoins that they would spend tons of money just to keep the network alive?
And what's to stop an ASIC maker to hoard all the ASICs they make to themselves and build enough hashing power to take over the network?

That doesn't explain hashes well at all, IMO.  It certainly doesn't make sense to *me*.
I tell them to imagine adding up each byte in the data you want to hash, throwing out any overflow.  The final number is a hash.  It is based on the original data, but you can't derive the original data from it.  I make sure, of course, to add that a real hash is FAR more complex and designed to make collisions improbable to the point of impossibility, like winning the lottery jackpot every day for a century, but that the general idea is similar.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:19:45
Let me put it this way...I mined on my 3.9 Ghz Core i7-3770K and GeForce 460 GTX in a mining pool over the course of 10 days.  I earned about 45 cents worth of Bitcoins while probably consuming about $5 in electricity.
A mining pool is a way of reducing the randomness in mining.  Instead of a single person getting the entire reward for finding a block, the reward is split over everyone in the pool based on the number of hashes they computed.  These days, I think you'd have to be insane to NOT mine in a pool unless you have an absurd amount of hashing power which you won't get in any CPU or GPU.  You'd have to have a huge array of ASICs.

To make sure I understand you right, when the site goes under attack, it just takes a few paranoid users to go "Oh shit, trades might take awhile to go through.  I better sell now in case the price drops!" which of course causes the prices to dip a bit.  Then people notice the price dips, so THEY start doing emergency selling.
Basically, its a couple idiots ruining it for everyone with their paranoia.
It kind of reminds me of another thread where people talked about how women hover over public restroom toilet seats because other women are hovering over the toilet seats and pissing on the seat.  If all women would just stop trying to hover and fucking it up, then there'd be no need to hover!
If people didn't start selling their bitcoins when MtGox is under attack, causing a price drop, then there wouldn't be a good reason to attack MtGox to manipulate the market and causing price drops!

It applies for any sort of investing, too.
*ALL* forms of investing are gambling.  Even if you diversify, you can *still* lose it all.

At least its beginning to seem that the panic sellers are starting to learn.

Guys!  Stop downvoting him for asking a question!  Not everyone on Reddit is a gamer, and not everyone has heard of the Humble Bundle.
Downvoting someone for asking a question is kind of a dickish thing to do.

Its pure speculation.  Take it with a grain of salt.

Stupid question...where is this page that you're showing?

I will add something to this.
If a restaurant fires a waiter/waitress because they're consistently making poor tips and they have to keep making up the difference out of their own pocket, its not necessarily because of greed and they're trying to cut costs.  A waiter/waitress that consistently gets poor tips is probably giving really bad service and is pissing off customers just enough to make them leave a bad tip, but not quite enough to make them complain to management.  Those are customers that might not be coming back.
As an ex-restaurant manager, one of the key things I told my staff was that just because a customer doesn't complain doesn't mean they aren't unhappy.

Line chart would be best.
