I didn't realize how bad it is. It's really weird.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:21:45
I'm all for gifting, as described in the book Sacred Economics (good read!), but it's just not part of internet culture to tip content creators after the fact. At least not yet. By having a 'pay-what-you-want' paygate, they have no choice but acknowledge the fact that yes, you'd prefer to get paid for your work but it's okay if they're too broke and can't afford it.

my bad, didn't notice it was a bandcamp link. i just think qr codes have no place on album covers. :) i thought you were just letting people tip/pay after the download. it's better to ask them to make that decision before the download imo. here's how i handle it for my ebook... 
the only thing is gumroad takes a higher percentage than bandcamp, so you're better off there for music.

i was wondering if i was the only one tired of this. where the fuck do they even get these physical bitcoins? lol
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:02:17
It depends what business they're in. If it's an auto repair shop, send them a link to an article about another auto repair accepting btc and how it's working out for them.

The solution is for the merchant to give a discount for using bitcoin. Just in the beginning. Once most of their patrons are using bitcoin, they no longer need to offer this incentive.

i just tested out this whole nlocktime funds recovery feature, and i'm confused about a couple things.
when i got the notification that the nlocktime transaction was expiring or has expired, it asks me to redeposit funds, why doesn't it give me the option to send funds to a new wallet?
from my understanding, this feature is in place in the event that greenaddress disappears and i need to recover my funds. in this case, what good would it do to redeposit funds back into my greenaddress wallet?
also, if greenaddress were to disappear, I'm supposed to use the Gentle tool to recover funds correct? i tested that out (after redepositing funds on GreenAddress) and it gave me a list of transactions and some key that i have no clue what to do with.
this is way too confusing.

Well it seems to me that we have yet to decide on what Bitcoins unique value proposition is to the masses. The one good reason the average Joe should care. We need to figure that out first and then communicate that message anywhere and everywhere.

I've been dollar cost averaging since the mid 600s, all the way down to it's lowest in 2015 near 200. I'm basically at the break even point right now. Maybe a small profit. You gotta be able stomach the volatility, but in the long run I believe it'll be well worth it.

I had an issue with US bank recently where they charged me an overdraft fee for an auto debit. I specifically said when signing up that I do NOT want credit, and if I don't have enough $ in my account for a transaction then that transaction should be denied. They had no problems with this. They said I would not receive overdraft fees.
Conveniently for them, this rule only applies to normal purchases, and not auto debits.

That's one way to do it, or you can do as author Charles Eisenstein does it with his book Sacred-Economics.com. He just gifts it and lets people donate after they've read it. 
This way your content can be easily indexed by Google vs just having your sales page indexed.

Not a bad idea but I feel it ignores the fact that, due to the internet, it is now possible to distribute your music for a very small fraction of the cost it use to take. For this reason, it makes sense for music to enter the gifting realm (See Sacred Economics). 
Using the blockchain in the manner you speak would be creating false scarcity IMO. There's no reason to limit the duplication of the files if it's a gift.
If you build up enough gratitude as a musician, artist, human being, you'll never be in need of money or material possessions. That's true security!

Thank you sir, I've been checking this out as well! I need to bite the bullet and figure it out. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:23:39
they've built their facebook pay from the ground up though.

My pleasure! Thanks for commenting.

It blows my mind that something can be considered a business yet not have a revenue model.
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:36:38
never sell for fiat. haven't you gotten the memo bro?
@_date: 2015-11-28 01:37:42
Trying to explain to that demographic is a lost cause IMHO. They'll either get it or they won't. It's the youth that we need to focus on. They're the future and are much more open to new ideas.

Try selling your prints but allowing visitors to name their price or pay what they want. In Bitcoin obviously.
If you can make it so they can purchase without registering for your site or divulging any other personal information that is a plus.

I'm adding a checkout process on the website soon! Thanks for commenting! :)

I've been looking at that library you wrote but I'm fairly inexperienced with web dev. I learned ruby on rails to build this site but I've never worked with PHP. I had tried the Mycelium Gear widget but it wasn't working right.

Can we get a list of such projects to help those who would like to support such projects but have trouble finding them? :)

So if I was in the market for a hardware wallet would you suggest I wait for ledger blue?

Please implement "pay what you want" feature making this like a "Bitcoin Gumroad". Thx
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:14:56
As others have said. Wordpress + Woocommerce + Coinbase or Bitpay Plugin. Here's an example of that using "MyStyle Theme" from Woothemes.. 
I also am using Coinkite's buy button to sell my ebook.. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:58:41
Coinbase Vault could have possibly prevented this but yea, Trezor or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:28:44
lol... shit
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:05:13
I was hoping somebody would help clear things up.
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:40:25
i'm currently using the coinkite buy button but it doesn't allow for automatic file delivery after payment.
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:38:44
They don't have the 'pay what you want' pricing functionality. Otherwise it's pretty much what I need.
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:18:09
I'm on the waiting list to test this out.

Create a daemon that scans the news for your death, at which time it'll release x bitcoins to an address of your choosing.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:04:08
Why would you put a cap on it? Let the visitor pay however much they want. You don't know the value they see in it. In fact there's many cases where bands have been paid way over the normal price of an album by using the "pay what you want" pricing strategy.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:38:30
exactly my line of thinking
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:09:49
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:28:39
thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:36:17
Sent them a message the other day. This was their response:
"We're keeping our eye on BitCoin (as well as all the other payment gateways and options), but for now we're PayPal only. It's great to see BitCoin gain traction so quickly, and it's useful to get feedback and suggestions like yours that let us know it's something people are interested in."

It helps to build awareness, gain credibility, increase utility. All good things for btc in the long run.

This. The two are complimentary. Bitcoin should be a better store of value over the long term, but Ethereum will be the platform for smart contracts IMO.

clever way to promote your shirt store. i like it.

Really cool, thanks! Anyway you could expand this to enable payments for digital products or services? Kind of like the "Gumroad" of Lightning Network?
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:11:38
 no?

Uber isn’t even profitable, not sure I’d hold them up as a beacon of success.
