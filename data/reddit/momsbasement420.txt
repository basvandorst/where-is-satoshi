The internet deserves social media outlets that don't regulate opinions too

Um that's a pretty significant loss for anyone that knows about investing, no matter how you slice it. 11% is 11%

I have some Chase premium card that I got through Amazon that recently upgraded to 5% cash back. Maybe I'm dumb for this but I honestly didn't know credit cards charged any fees as long as you paid everything off before the next billing cycle

Again I don't think looking at history is logical. Follow the news and that's it. Not to mention history has shown it can drop back to 200.
With that said I think it'll continue to climb over the year(s) but I'm just saying, 11% is 11%

Why did Local btc die?

I just checked and it's only for Amazon. This has not been my day

I'd like to think/hope that LSD is the LSD of every generation
but I get what you're saying

Not a logical way to look at stocks at all, and I'm not talking about the future. I'm talking about what just happened
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:18:45
My cash back is 5%
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:01:34
yeah electrum. I'll see if I can update it

Day traders all just cringed at this comment

Also, is there anything major going down this week that could make the rate go down again? If so maybe I should request a cancellation now while they would likely be happy to?

This one time I took L and had a headache throughout the entire trip and thought that the government had gotten control of the acid market and programmed all the blotters to brainwash us

yeah I wasn't planning on hitting up customer support anyway. They have a tendency to randomly delete accounts

I didn't buy to invest this time it was for sports betting
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:42:40
thanks man
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:03:20
Thank you I wasn't aware of this
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:48:25
it's not like they know my reddit username
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:43:15
wow I'm really dumb for that one. Any reason it's taking so long? I'm new to electrum
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:53:09
ah that would make sense. Last spoon-feeding question: you think it'll hit before tuesday?

The value of btc in relation to any currency is what I mean
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:57:21
I guess I should probably buy gold instead based on what I'm holding for. Just figured btc would be a goldmine if shit ever hit the fan
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:41:06
Last time I did that you guys closed my account with no explanation. No thank you mein führer

I don't have a utility bill in my name, and I'd imagine that's why most people here can't use it. They don't accept bank statements
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:08:48
fuck that makes sense

If the issue that I'm trying to find out about were that simple there wouldn't be controversy. Don't use oversimplification to persuade me, I'm not a liberal
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:34:36
You didn't explain anything
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:44:25
I don't know what either of these mean or what impact it would have

What's stopping the federal government from just creating the biggest pump &amp; dump ever and generating hella bread

[nitrogen sports]( is probably the best out there. Not sure about races though 
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:53:32
