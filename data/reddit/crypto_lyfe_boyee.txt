Seems like there was buying of the physical asset before the contract launch, then shorting, then massive selloff and contract profit.
Now that the price is down and they sold all their BTC, they go long and buy them back. Total guess on my part, but I've marked my calendar to see if it actually goes down like that. I mean, that's what I would do if I was a whale and working in a partially unregulated market at least.
Next contracts from CBOE expire on 2/14, Valentine's day.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:55:10
There's two things going on here. There's going short with futures, then there's actually selling BTC. Just buying the short contract can only cause the market to go down because of sentiment. 
What I'm saying is they bought Bitcoin, and ALSO shorted the futures contract. Then, they sell real BTC, which causes the futures short to succeed. It's a self-fulfilling prophesy.

It looks like a scam, but then why would they make is LESS efficient than the S9 if they were trying to get people to buy it? Maybe it's a clever trick, but I'd make it slightly MORE efficient if I was trying to rip everyone off.

@_date: 2018-01-19 00:26:44
Well, you have to have BTC in order to short it. I'm suggesting whales bought a bunch in December, so they could short the contract, then sell BTC on exchanges to drive down the price.
It's all speculation at this point.

I think this is a good idea, but it poses some problems too.
1. What if the coffee shop doesn't want their funds tied up for a whole month? Right now, if I pay with my Visa card, there's a fee, but the funds start moving towards my account right then. As a business, I don't want to wait until the channel closes to get my money, I need to pay my vendors and employees. If Bob opened a channel, and only bought one coffee per week, now I have funds I can't access, unless I want to pay TWO on chain transaction fees.
2. If the network fee is $20, Bob has to buy seven cups of coffee just to OPEN the channel (assume he's buying an American from Starbucks), then seven more to close the channel. Sure this can reduce network congestion if people actually use it, but we're seeing exponential growth, we have to consider this.
3. It's been months and only 10% of transactions are even using segwit. What makes us think that this will get adopted any faster? It seems quite a bit more complicated from a business perspective. I mean, now I have all these outstanding accounts and connections I have to manage. 
I think the best way to get people using LN would be with a third party that manages all this behind the scenes. If anyone thinks that a coffee shop owner plans on becoming a crypto expert in order to accept BTC, I've got news for you. But, until then, we need bigger blocks. When enough people are using this network, then we can see how much traffic it reduces.
However, holding people hostage unless they implement a complicated technology just shows the arrogance of the community. We need to come back to earth and understand how the average person thinks and operates. Is it great? Sure. Will people start using it right away? No way. This technology has to work behind the scenes or it will never become mainstream.

Other investments are regulated.
And yes, they can keep doing it, but they first have to buy enough to make the same play. So, when they do that, you'd see the price go back up. Remember, they just sold everything to make this work, so now they have to go back and buy back in, potentially reversing the process.

I don't want to piss in your Cheerios, but Lightning Network wouldn't have helped. You would have to pay to open a channel, then make your next to free transaction, then close your channel. So, you would have had three transactions, two with high fees and one with a low fee. Sorry mate.

Hi Luke, thanks for the response. I see your point, but I'd like to contend that while the cloud mining company might be centralized, the participants are not. So, I'm not sure it's fair to call it a scam. Maybe you could say it runs counter to the intentions of Bitcoin, but "scam" to me sounds like it's just someone selling fake watches on the street corner, not that it's an unintended consequence of market activity where profit creates unforeseen opportunity.

Well, then I have to contend that many things will become centralized over time just because of economics. Discussion about Bitcoin, for example, takes place primarily on this subreddit. Reddit is centralized, but again, the users come from all over the world. I'm not sure how that could be avoided.
It's kind of the same thing with mining. If I run a mining machine at my house, I'm paying 10x more for power than if I co-locate (host my machine somewhere that power is cheap). These are just aspects of a system that emerge from price disparity of inputs. What else would you expect someone to do?
Maybe things could have been different if it weren't for the ASIC wars, but it's too late to put that genie back in the bottle now.

One problem is that they think altcoins make Bitcoin worth less. But there's several flaws in this reasoning. First, Bitcoin's price has increased as the number of alts increased.

I have a question about how LN works. From what I understand you have to open a channel with someone, then you can send back and forth, then you close the LN channel and the funds "settle" on the main chain. But, while the channel is open, all the Bitcoin being sent back and forth can't "leave" the channel correct?
The reason I'm asking is because I envision a company like Starbucks going, "Ok, we want people to use Bitcoin for coffee, but we don't want a fee for each cup of coffee. So, let's put our customers Starbucks cards on the a LN channel, let them pay for coffee and recharge with Bitcoin, then we close the channel at the end of the month" or something like that. So, in that way all the transactions from people buying coffee, move off the main chain, except for when the channel opens and closes. So, in that way the fees are greatly reduced. Is this correct?

I'd like to add it's the same situation for scaling Bitcoin. I shake my head when I hear these executives blabbing about Bitcoin not being able to handle Visa scale. What they don't realize is that scaling will go from 3 tx/s to 1000 tx/s in just a few software upgrades. It doesn't slowly go to 4 tx/s then 5 tx/s then 6 tx/s, that's just not how technology develops. If you look at some of the other Cryptos now, they're already operating at this kind of scale.

I think you're correct in both regards, it will cause both selling and buying. However, I think the largest effect will be that when the economy collapses again, people are going to realize that the FED does not have the absolute control they think they have.

Banks can and will create their own blockchain based currencies. They will probably have a miner in each branch and just change the algo so it's not too costly. They will benefit from this, but the coin they create will not be censorship resistant or deflationary, or open source, so it can't replace Bitcoin.

Banks are just going to start selling people Bitcoin, it's already happening in Switzerland. It will be a huge business for them, charging people huge fees to convert from USD and to store "securely." Coinbase is doing that right now.

It means you can buy a bitcoin ticker on the stock exchange that equates to the price of bitcoin in the future. The only issue is that these contracts do not hold actual bitcoin, so it may just serve to increase speculation.

This is the most confusing chart. If there's more longs than shorts, why are the shorts shown as much higher than the longs? Not a fan of this view.

@_date: 2017-09-08 14:18:39
Not necessarily. Businesses are concerned with inventory turnover and how long it takes to get their cash back. Let's say I can make a miner for $1,000 and sell it for $1,500. It's true that in the long run I could use it to mine and get $2,000 back, but you have to weigh that against taking my $500 profit today for just selling the machine. 
If they were to just run the machines, they would have to build massive data-centers and incur other expenses they don't have now. Additionally, they expose themselves to price fluctuations as opposed to making a profit at the time of sale, and using that cash to just make more machines.

Good point here, "gain or loss on investment" would be the parent category. You wouldn't expect to see "gain or loss on Bitcoin," since there's not even a section for that.

You had me up until you started making fun of Libertarians. I don't think there's anything funny about the FED crashing our economy by printing our currency into oblivion. This is one of the main reasons we have Bitcoin, so we can regain control over our own money.

I agree, but it spreads awareness.

I think "Satoshi" was a group, and Craig is just one of the members. The others haven't wanted to come forward and so he's taking the lead. This would explain why his behavior seems odd but the "real" Satoshi hasn't come forward saying "I am not Craig Wright."
@_date: 2017-07-19 01:03:34
This might be a naive question, but could the spam actually just be mining pools paying out small amounts to many addresses in a single transaction? 
It occurred to me that if you're a small miner, you may only be getting a few cents or a day, and since most pools pay out every day an average transaction would cost more than a small payout.
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:44:02

People seem to forget that there are few ways to turn USD into BTC. Coinbase is one of those ways. Although long-term storage is not ideal, Coinbase does have two options that can make it safer. 
1. Time lock 48 hour multisig vault.
2. Google Authenticator 2FA rather than text message.
People have been able to call cell phone companies pretending to work for Verizon or T-Mobile and copy your sim card. That way, they just intercept your text message and your funds are MIA.
Sorry that happened mate.

It's the output of the price/predicted as a Z-score. The inputs are transactions (daily and total), the number of unique addresses and the price all in log scale. Transaction data is from the blockchain, not exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:36:09
"It's not backed by anything." 
It's backed by the network, which has been growing in log scale for ten years. The last time that happened we got the internet.
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:13:42
Well, the rabbit hole does get deep... But either one of those two things would have saved you in this case. You might want to call your cell phone company and see if the SIM was recently changed, or also check your security settings and make sure the 2FA box says "For any amount (most secure)."

If you're purchasing from your bank account it takes seven days. If you have USD in your coinbase account already, then it's instant.

Does he mean that facilitating the mining of others he makes money off the pool fee? Because in that case it makes sense, you still have to pay for power and engineers regardless of price swings in BTC (if you were hosting a cloud mine for example).

I think it's only in some cities. The link to Tulsa has a checkbox on the right for "Accepts Bitcoin" but in other cities, like Seattle, that box isn't there. This means it's either an A/B test (part of the population are seeing it) or it's related to whether or not there are actually enough businesses accepting bitcoin in that area.

I think governments have wanted to go cashless for a long time. It's only now that the game has started to change that they are seeing an opportunity to implement these plans. What's interesting to me is that when regular people see governments are switching to cryptos, they will realise the validity of cryptocurrencies. Then it will be the government controlled cryptos and the "free" cryptos as the two games in town.
