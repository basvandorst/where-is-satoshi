Just prolonging the inevitable correction imo. Makes for good swing trading though!

I used them a few months ago. Fast shipping and good prices. They only accept crypto.

BTG was also $1300 there at one point in time.

I asked myself the same question at 3k a few months back.... now we here. I don't think it's too late.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:42:44
I did the same pre-fork... trying to time it and all. Bought at $2700, sold at $2600 because of the recent past (dropping down to $1800). Ended up going full-hodl (always go full-hodl) at $3000, and now we here.

There must be more USDT pairs than BTC/USDT, right? The whole market would wat it if its true.

I dont understand the Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin comments. Bitcoin is still Bitcoin - it evolved and added an optional technology (Segwit). I think it's more accurate to say Bitcoin Cash was Bitcoin, as it just duplicated the old code, added EDA and bigger blocks. The whole "Satoshi's Vision", "True Believers" and "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" is cringeworthy on levels that surpass SJW mental health issues and identity politics. I'm open to both currencies (solely hold BTC though), but posts like that decrease their credibility IMO. The same goes for this subreddit, but in a different light of things. Focus on what Bitcoin has to offer and its future, and Bitcoin Cash should focus on theirs. Both can be communicated in a positive manner on separate boards, and both can exist.
It's getting tiresome to filter through the crap on both subreddits.

That's new! Cool stuff :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:02:23
Not implying, I'm stating. rBitcoin is full of hodl, memes, and BCH bashing. rBTC is full of "guess what guys, I got banned from rBitcoin", "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin",  "Satoshi's vision", and BTC Bashing.

The market has spoken.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:03:47
I don't see why not - I solely hold BTC and have nothing against the BCH crew. I'm just not a fan if "Bitcoin is horrible compared to BCH, da flippening mannn!!". That kind of stuff only hurts the credibility. Talk positive about your coin of interest rather than knocking another one, and people will be more attracted to what to have to say. This applies to all coins.

Yes it's gone forever, creating less supply for the high demand, meaning higher prices.
The $300M was most likely the ETH news today.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:47:32
I was in the same position with the other coin... was going to hedge before I left at $550... watched it quadruple while away. Was going to increase my BTC holdings with the profits.

I wonder if Jihan is shitting his pants with this - uncharteted territory with this competition. He probably has something up his sleeve though.

P = IV my friend.
You'd need a transformer so you don't wreck your machine, but you don't need to worry about that since the plugs are different.

Either stalk BTC ATMs and undercut their price or you could use Kraken/QuadrigaCX!
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:36:47
Yes. 
I'm relatively new to this myself, and asked the same question at 3k. Now we here.

Blood in blood out.

I saw a translated 8btc post from Chinese to English that has a strikingly similar narrative, posted on reddit end of October.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:05:09
For sure man, it's definitely an issue, and I agree with you. We need more posts like this, vise bashing and defamation.

Perhaps you're right, I've been wrong before.

Good thing BCH doesn't have a USDT pairing, otherwise we'd be in real trouble!!!

Yes, sometime in the future.

You can't abort yourself with Plan B, doesn't work like that.

I follow both, just like you. I got flak for posting a similar reply:

With that position? Lol... you need the cash now or something? Made it sound like you learned about crypto last week and bought at 4950, then sold low. You're gonna h8 yourself... got gt8ped.

You'd best be shorting.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:57:38
I'm going to go for it - why not try? Worst case scenario is that you catch it as it's taking off, and you lose out on a couple hundred dollars or so (in comparison to today's prices). Yeah, you don't get BCH, but you also don't get the drama.
