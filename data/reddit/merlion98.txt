bitcoinpaperwallet.com is another good alternative. It's based on bitaddress but has a nicer interface. Make sure you switch off your network (or at least put your browser in offline mode) before actually generating the wallets.

My preference would be to generate separate bip39 wallets for each student, and to give each student their own unique mnemonic as the paper wallet.
Also, check out the fee weather on  before loading the wallets to make sure fees are down in the 1-5 sat/byte range, otherwise it will cost you (and the students) a big chunk of that $5 to transfer your coin. Sunday afternoons are IME the best time to catch low fees.

They're just proposals. None of them are actually built into the software, let alone up for voting/activation.

I still think the *expected* wait time for a transaction before the next block is found is 5 minutes. Statistical properties are meaningless when you are talking about a single data point. When you look at a large number of instances (assuming transactions are broadcast independently of blocks), then they should be uniformly distributed between successive blocks, so the average wait time across them will be half of the block interval.

That would reflect what people are paying, instead of what is required to get a confirmation.

They're not refusing to confirm transactions. They are going to mine blocks as they see fit. This is in perfect compliance with the established bitcoin protocol.

No but I don't consider it a DoS attack on the network. More like a DoS attack on the node by itself.

It's amazing how there's opposition to a 'contentious' hard fork but support for a UASF-caused chain split that has a significant likelyhood of occurring.
