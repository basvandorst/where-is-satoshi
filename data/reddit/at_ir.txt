I thought the webserver was only accessible inside your network?
So if you set up an antminer it can be accessed from the internet?

Schools emphasise rote 'learning', that's why so many people are sheep sadly.

Everyone doesn't need to run, there are diminishing returns once you have 'enough' nodes.

Mining is to centralised, but I think small blocks and the LN will decrease the miners ability to abuse that power. I thought a about supporting large blocks, but now I see we must keep the block size small and wait a short while for the LN.

I think world wide adoption is unrealistic in the short to medium term, I don't see why core isn't scaling to meet current demand, which is much lower than visa.
Simply scale onchain while the cost to decentralization is offset by better usability. When the tradeoff is no longer viable stop.
Even if more people use Bitcoin, they won't use it for day to day things because it's are store of value. Larger blocks will allow people to reduce the utxo set more often, which is actually a good thing.

Yes I agree it's too contentious to increase the blocksize. I think this price speculation is temporary and should die down

What if everyone opens one channel to a mega hub to be minimize Fees, and thier so few onchain transactions that you need inflation to secure bitcoin when block subsidiaries run out. Is this a possibility?
Will people be ok with 0.5% inflation every year?

Segwit will double capacity when adopted, these exchanges just before have slow Devs but eventually they will do it.

If the LN is very deployed most txns will use it therefore L1 fees are much cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:30:31
Segwit does reduce your fees, txns are still expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:29:30
I don't think any exchange will use LN for deposits for obvious reasons. So we do need more capacity on chain so people can trade Bitcoin, which is probably the major Bitcoin use case atm.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:18:36
A Bitcoin exchange is already an of chain solution technically...

Less mining centralisation, small miners need as much advantage as they can get...
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:38:51
If the LN is introduced is it possible to reduce the blocksize via a softfork?
This would make spam and blockchain bloating even more expensive. I don't think it would be expensive to bloat the bcash chain

They make sure your wallet is following the right consensus rules + propergate txns is more accurate

We don't need bitpay Bitcoin is a store of value or digital gold. Who wants to spend 20 dollars on a game which is going to cost 40 dollars to months later lol.
