If someone pays for bitcoin and puts it in a wallet, and then you randomly guess the keys, you are stealing their money. They bought it, you took it when they didn't want you to.
Your argument is the same as saying "well they left their front door unlocked so it's mine now." Just because someone has lax security doesn't mean you aren't stealing. Don't do this scum bag, what goes around will come around

I'm listening to this interview and now I'm terrified tho. There's going to be a "paper" leveraged bitcoin market now. Short selling leveraged ETFs/IRAs is how the Wall St. vampires are going to manipulate the price. If you decide to go into the "paper"/IOU bitcoin market, make sure you hodl at least 1 "physical" bitcoin before that. Be safe. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:53:42
A normal bank lends 1 dollar out in anticipation of getting 1.1 back. If the company it lended to is a good investment, then the bank gets its 1.1 back and everything is fine. Same goes with a btc loan in this manner.
Now, let's say the bank lends the company 1 dollar in anticipation of getting 1.1 back. But now the 1.1 is due to the bank and the company doesn't it have it. This is called a "default." Since both the company and the bank will fail if that 1.1 doesn't magically show up, they go to the central bank and say "if we don't get this 1.1, everything is going to collapse." The central bank says "ya know what, you're right. You guys are too big to fail." So the central bank just prints up the 1.1 that didn't exist before and gives it to the lending bank bc the company couldn't pay it. This is called "malinvestment" and is thoroughly covered in the bitcoin standard. This is a "hidden tax" on all other dollar holders because the supply of dollars has just increased arbitrarily (inflated).
Now, if they were using btc for the loan. The bank lends 1.1, doesn't get it back, and there's no one that can just print up new btc and save the bank and the company. So the bank and the company are stuck in "default". It is impossible to transfer the default to the btc holders because in order to get more btc to cover the "bail out", they'd have to take it from everyone's wallet (which is impossible without permission). 
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:40:56
Absolutely great interview. Notice how she mentions the Mises Institute right of the bat?! Amazing. Everyone should read Mises and Hayek. 
But she also terrified me. They talk about how the gold market is manipulated down by the leveraged paper IOU market. Once these big financial institutions get involved, Bitcoin will be fucked with in the exact same way. That's why we always need to hodl "physical" coin and not their paper ETF/IRA leveraged bullshit! That shit is a trap. Beware.

It's an asset in the same way gold is. A hard commodity and hedge against inflation 
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:34:01
He clearly states in the book why he uses his definition of "asset". The reason is because you may own a house that is an "asset" on paper. But if the roof is leaking and the foundation is cracked, you are going to continue to lose money on it. Thus it becomes a liability whereas the traditional accountant will still say it's an asset.
For him, assets are whatever make you money while you sleep. That's why he identified bitcoin as an asset long before many other finance people. 
Here's a tip, try reading people in their own words and grappling with their arguments yourself. Just reading/citing blogs that miss the whole point of what he's saying is dumb. We can do better.
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:07:20
Reading that book helped me to identify bitcoin as an asset early on tho. Been hodlin since around 250 300 xoxo
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:46:52
But there is still only a limited number of bitcoin to leverage. Btc can't just be printed up indefinitely to save a "malinvestment". A bank can't be "too big too failed" and bailed out if we used btc because the btc would literally have to be taken out of people's wallets to make the bail out happen. The Fed can't just print up btc to bail someone out in the same way they print up dollars.

Yes! This is the problem! This warps the "time preference" of people and causes them not to save. This is the root cause of the Cantillon Effect and the reason our economy has a Boom-Bust cycle and depressions. It's insidious and fraudulent. To think that people wouldn't spend their money on goods they need because the value of their money is deflationary is the exact fallacy that has led to huge inflation and the idea that banks are "too big too fail" and need to bailed out with "quantitative easing." 
For the love of god, please read The Bitcoin Standard as soon as you possibly can. You have been brainwashed into believing the Keynesian lie that degrading money is somehow good for the economy and not just the method by which the state and banks tax us without having to take money directly out of our bank account. Keynesianism rationalizes the Cantillon Effect and allows banks to rob us of hard commodities, that's the reason the establishment loves him. 
If the economy needs money to degrade in order to work, how come the most prosperous time in America for the working and middle class was during the time we had a gold standard?

The principle is sound money. Fiat paper can be multiplied forever so it loses value over time. This makes fiat a liability by his definition. The whole point of the book is to build your asset portfolio and reduce liabilities.

Yes of course. Coal is the cheapest most efficient source of power we have. We have electricity, cars, trains, and airplanes because of coal and oil. How often do you use a computer? How often do you turn on lights in your home? The only reason that you can reliably charge your phone and have light 24/7 is because of coal. So, YES, obviously I am defending coal.
Restricting coal mining here in America does nothing to help global warming because the DEMAND for coal does not change no matter where it comes from. If we restrict coal here, we just buy it from China or some other place to meet the SAME DEMAND. Fucking idiots like yourself dont understand this.

3. When inflation set in, what were some of the most common objects and items that became valuable and were commonly exchanged to store value?

Giving a child puberty blockers is child abuse not freedom. When the child turns 18, let them cut off their penis. But adults should discipline and prepare kids for the future, not just say "Do whatever you want, be who you want to be." That's the worse advice anyone can give to a kid and it's the reason the Millennial generation is so lost and nihilistic. 
\&gt; No one said you don’t have to deal with your decisions. That’s on the individual and is the price of being free.
We're talking about a kid though! Should parents allow their kids to do cocaine and smoke weed and drink every day because "hey, that's freedom, maaaannnn"
\&gt; Who are you to tell someone who they should be? 
I'm not telling someone who they should or shouldn't be. Im just saying that we have a disaster on our hands and everyone is going to look back at this time and go "what in the fuck were these psychos thinking."

Answer the fucking question: Is it illegal or legal for an 11 year old to be in a bar at 3am in the morning?
\&gt; You're offended over someone else having fun...
Child exploitation = fun? What fucking planet are you from you spineless, moral-less limp dick?

\&gt; Do you think you need to sell your other capital to realize P/L on them? No, you don't.
What do you mean "other capital"? You have sell whatever coin you want to claim a loss on because the sale is a taxable event. When you buy it back immediately, that is a wash trade. 
\&gt; I can realize P/L on other capital I own without selling 
But the whole point of the article and the thread is a strategy to gain taxable loss on your coins. If you have some other asset you want to wash trade, good for you, go do it. But how is that relevant to the thread or the article?
Apparently you have other assets that you wash trade. Some people want to do it with their coins.

Ok. Cash out and cut your losses brah. It's headed to zero.

\&gt;  it was more about surviving than investing.
Even putting away 50 bucks a month can make you rich. This is what poor people fail to understand.

So you believe that when a 6 year old says "Im transgendered," they actually fully comprehend what they're saying? And theyre not just repeating the bullshit they've been taught by leftist perverts? When a kid says "Im a super hero!" or "Im a firefighter" do you take them literally?
\&gt; And then I would estimate that kids who fall into this category are even less. It’s not an epidemic.
\&gt;  there is an even smaller number of parents who would allow surgery,
These people are abusing their children correct?
\&gt;  I thought you were a libertarian
Im not an extreme version of anything. I actually believe in Universal healthcare but am not so far left that I believe the government should give everyone a job. Im a bit libertarian but not so far right that I think we should let parents mutilate or fuck their kids because "Hey, that's freedom." There is a moderate space between left and right that society should always be seeking to balance.
\&gt; You would rather legislate freedom of parents and teenagers then have like a 100 trans kids? 
So what if there was a parent that was fucking their kids but have convinced the kid to tell everyone that they consent? Is that just two free people being free in their own home or is there something weird going on that should be addressed?

Yes. Just yes. When you are young, your parents take care of you. When your old, your children take care of you. That's how life works.

It's exactly what it is. Here is the literal definition on Investopedia: [
\&gt; In my above example, the 10k gains were realized when you paid taxes on 20k in the second year.
You never had to pay taxes on that 20k unless you cashed out. If you simply bought and held and never cashed out the money, there was nothing to tax. Did you pay taxes on unrealized gains dumb ass? LOL
Seriously, explain to me what you think wash trading is if I am wrong.

You didnt know Bitcoin was a tool of white supremacists?

\&gt; You can *choose* to realize them without a sale.
How else can you realize gains and losses without a sale?

Why are you just responding with insults tho? Why are you calling me a Nazi for no reason? You are a psycho that is being conditioned by people who want the middle class to collapse and competing working class groups to go to war with each other. Just look at what's happening in France. It's all coming here soon. Cant you see this shit? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:46:23
Seriously tho. There's a reason why Judeo-Christian countries became the richest and strongest. When we throw it all away, watch what will happen. We can draw a straight line from Gay Marriage to trans kids and it took less than 5 years to happen. You think that shit's a coincidence? Have you hear of the LGBT group "Heart Progress" yet?
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:00:50
Wow. You are truly an NPC zombie. 
Seriously. What is something that you believe that no one else in the world believes? Is there anything? Judging by your responses there is not. You are a reaction machine, a mirror. Try reading Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil." You are what he calls "The Objective Man." Not a single original thought, never going against the grain on anything, completely and utterly programmed by the mainstream culture and media. What a mindless loser.

This is beautiful. Finally a bipartisan issue that everyone can get behind. BITCOIN UNITES PEOPLE FOLKS

\&gt; Facepalm. Taxes. It's called doing your taxes.
Lol wat? You need taxable events to report on your taxes!!! Are you telling me that you bought bitcoin at 10k, it went to 20k, you never sold, and then you reported a gain? Please tell me you are not this retarded PLEASE!
When you say "it's called doing your taxes," what specifically did you claim on your Schedule D? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:55:16
Bitcoin is going to 1k dumb ass. You should have DCA'd in.
