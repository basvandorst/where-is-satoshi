We currently work with Simplex for credit card purchases. Simplex fees are 5% and ours 3%. Also when you buy less than $200, Simplex takes $10 of fixed fees instead of 5%. The fee becomes a percentage above $200.
Regarding security, your wallet is locally generated on your mobile, encrypted with the highest possible security (for example, we use the secure enclave on iOS) and neither us nor anyone has access to it.

Yes, it is a SegWit-compatible wallet. Being able to set custom fees (and RBF) will soon be available, and Lightning Network is definitely something we have in mind.

Companies who are making GitHub repos and linking to them to prove that their apps are secure are hypocritical. There is no way to technically prove that a build distributed on the App Store or the Google Play Store is legitimately linked to a GitHub commit.
The trust you give to an app company shouldn't be based on the presence or not of a GitHub repo because it means absolutely nothing.
I can give you technical details if you want, feel free to ask. We used libbitcoin to build the wallet and your seed phrase is generated locally on your device, encrypted with the highest level of security possible (for example, the secure enclave component on iOS). Believe me, you should trust this as much as a GitHub repo as it has the same value.
We are eager of decentralizing as much as possible of our codebase in a close future, and only this will be an actual trustworthy material.

Hello, there is absolutely no KYC required in order to use the wallet. If you buy Bitcoin through our provider with debit or credit card they will perform a KYC like any exchange does.

Hello! It is totally decentralized as your wallet is created and encrypted locally on your device and we never have access to your seed phrase. We are a team of 9 engineers and have the founders of Ledger among our investors.

I totally agree with you on that point (it was hard to infer you were talking about this regarding your first message ��). There are a lot of different technical stakes and the way we are tackling them would surely benefit a lot from community inputs (entropy generation as you said, derivation, fee calculation, UTXO selection...), and as I said I'm really looking forward to open sourcing the codebase as soon as we can.
