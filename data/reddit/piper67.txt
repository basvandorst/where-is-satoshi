This is true, but in the grand scheme of things, millions of Europeans suddenly confronted with the very real proposition that their savings may soon be confiscated (or at least access to them severely curtailed), is probably going to have a greater effect than a few thousand tourists who happen to own bitcoins.
Nevertheless, if I were in Greece right now, I'd be setting up to take bitcoins. Can't hurt.

Actually yes, and they should (as should Argentina, Ecuador, Zimbabwe and so on).
But they won't, because the degree of monetary savvy required to understand the opportunity presented by Bitcoin is pretty high, and if they had it they wouldn't have got themselves into this mess in the first place.

Short answer, no.
Long answer, even if there was a bot, it's highly unlikely that it was solely responsible for the rise in price. Otherwise, it would be trivial for other bots to be doing the exact same thing now... A simple bot cannot explain away market forces, unfortunately. If it could, we'd all be gazillionaires.

LTC doesn't "affect" BTC at all, it rides on BTC's coattails. If LTC collapses, BTC will just churning along. If BTC collapses, LTC and every other alt-coin will crash and burn as well.
There is no discernible value to LTC or any other alt-coin, beyond it's use as a test bed for ideas that, if they're proven to be good, can then be incorporated into Bitcoin. This is especially true since the inception of sidechains.

@_date: 2015-06-05 13:54:00
Ugh... I hate walls of text that could be pared down to two lines:
1) The argument from consumption - You cannot on the one hand assume that Bitcoin's hunger for consumption is going to grow, and on the other hand assume that the supply of energy is going to remain static. You can, but you really have no elements to assume that particular set of circumstances over all others. For example, Bitcoin transactions in ten years could be mostly off-chain. Or nuclear fusion in twenty years would make energy cheap, clean and more abundant than ever. Fact is you don't know much more than where we stand today. And today, the energy cost of securing a monetary system like Bitcoin is pretty much where it should be.
2) Deflation doesn't mean what you think it means. It has nothing at all to do with the divisibility of each bitcoin, beyond its use case. The standard argument from deflation (that people will choose to not use a currency that will have more value in the future) has been debunked twenty times from Sunday. The deflationary tendency of Bitcoin has absolutely no meaningful impact on the consumption rate of the network, beyond a very loose correlation between price and hashrate. If the price explodes, and the hashrate follows, the energy consumed will still be energy produced for its consumption... and it will come down to the availability of cheap, clean energy in different parts of the world. In other words, powering the network from coal-fired plants in one part of the world will be more expensive than from nuclear fusion plants (in thirty years) in another. The hashrate will move even as it grows.

Negative, Will Robinson. The fact is, it wasn't too much of a problem for anyone BUT the one exchange that decided to use their own, custom software and even ignore warnings about how this could be a problem for them.
In other words, there was a bug, and it was found, and there was a solution to it... but only for those who chose to implement it. MtGox did not, and it got bitten.
Either that, or they've been fractionally reserving all this time and just using transaction malleability as an excuse and a way to buy into the dip to recover their bitcoins... but we'll leave that one to the conspiracy theorists.
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:05:13
relax, have a kit-kat... obviously, losing one's job is never fun, but you didn't buy BTC to get rich overnight, did you? You bought it because you recognised it for what it is, a really, really good idea. That hasn't changed.

no, I am fantastically aware of what a theory means, all three definitions (I suspect you're only familiar with one of them):
: an idea or set of ideas that is intended to explain facts or events
: an idea that is suggested or presented as possibly true but that is not known or proven to be true
: the general principles or ideas that relate to a particular subject
The basic problem is that people use the word theory in mixed contexts (Evolution is "just" a theory, for example).

The relevance of the actual journalist is pretty close to zero. There's been a litany of journalists getting it wrong when it comes to Bitcoin (shit, Wired declared Bitcoin dead back in 2011).
The difference here is that this particular journalist is pinning his erroneous assessment on a US legislator, which is somewhat relevant because, as others have mentioned, the US government right now stands to make some money from the sale of bitcoins.
The fruit of the poisoned tree theory holds that the state is not allowed to make an asset illegal on one side, and profit from its sale on the other.

@_date: 2014-02-18 21:33:36
Right now you CANNOT get BTC out of MtGox but you MAY be able to get dollars, euros, pounds or yen out. So people who want to leave MtGox (which is anyone with a head on their shoulder) are desperately selling their BTC hoping they'll at least be able to get the other currencies out.
If MtGox allows BTC withdrawals again, the process will reverse itself, because it will be easier to get BTC out of MtGox than dollars, pounds, euros or yen.

Just as a test run, I sent .2 BTC from my offline wallet to my coinbase account. It popped up on my transactions list and then, a few minutes later, it popped up again. Right now the original transaction is at 3 confirmations, but on my coinbase transactions list it still shows both (and that means my balance on coinbase is .2 higher than it should be).
I'll keep an eye on it. The way it's supposed to work is that when the first transaction gets six confirmations, the second one should be discarded. In fact, I thought that would be the case now, after three confirmations. But I suspect someone's playing with TXID's and trying to cause trouble.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:34:36
No, I just don't lend much credence to hearsay.
In case you didn't actually read my posting, there is no question that BTC and fiat were stolen (whether by Gox or a third party is hard to tell right now, though I'm leaning towards Gox). 
But 750K? No credible evidence to that effect yet.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:09:27
The answer, as usual, is that people want to buy more than they want to sell.
The reason for that? Who knows. Maybe Bitcoin has, yet again, proven its resiliency and new players are starting to get in the game. Maybe the whales who dumped all their BTC during the China bans think China has run out of bans. Maybe SecondMarket and Fortress are on the move. Maybe someone knows something that the rest of us don't.
Ultimately, these rallies are part and parcel of a completely new way of thinking about money and finance. It would be shocking if we didn't have rallies, dumps, rallies, dumps.

Totally technically non-savvy here, but doesn't the fact that the 5% chance of block solving is unpredictable make this attack not practicable?
In other words, if the evil miner and his evil customers knew which 5% of the time he'd solve a block, then it might work, but without that knowledge, when do the evil customers know to activate their double spend?
Again, I'm an absolute technical noob, just wondering out loud.
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:43:58
Fact is, if you look at the order book, you'd only be able to sell around 30 BTC or so before you reach 450, which is roughly where the price should be right now given the 10% spread between CAD and USD... might be worth it for some, but you'd really be making under 100 bucks for your effort.

If there ever was a "transaction malleability" problem (and that's a big if) it was fixed when it was first brought to everyone's attention back in 2011. The fix was to not use the TX ID as the final arbiter for whether a transaction was legitimate, but rather to wait until the transaction itself appeared on the blockchain.
That was the fix.
Now, if you're just trolling, then no, there never will be a fix for this problem, Bitcoin's dead, sell sell sell. :-)

I take it you don't bank with the RBS :-)
The difference, in case you haven't been reading other replies to your post, lies in how the merchant chooses to configure their POS when it comes to the number of confirmations. If they set it to zero, this just won't happen, and the chance of a double spend on zero confirmations is markedly lower than the chance of fraud on a credit card transaction. If they set it to one confirmation, for all intents and purposes it blows the credit and debit cards out of the water.
And whether you want to hear it or not, it is still early days. In fact, Bitcoin's still technically in beta. So do yourself a favour, go away and come back in a few years when it's better established.

TBH, I neither know nor care whether my email and name appear on that list. It's pretty much irrelevant, since they're available elsewhere and no one can do much with them anyway.
I do care that in the space of a few hours this morning I received two requests. Many others have as well. It's pretty easy to just blanket requests across the board and see if anything sticks. 
Mostly, it's just annoying, and it doesn't lend credibility or trustworthiness to a community that's already hyper-sensitive to hacks and foul play.
It would be trivial to allow us to turn off requests, making the problem go away, or as someone already said, just default to them turned off.

Since no one can get their BTC or fiat out of MtGox, the onus is hardly on me to provide proof.
However, for the sake of wasting some more of my time, the problems with fiat withdrawals go back to mid 2013 and the problems with BTC withdrawals go back to at least November, well before the issue of transaction malleability ever came up. If Gox had 90% of their BTC in cold storage, as they claimed, they should have noticed the discrepancy a lot sooner.
Either way, it should become clear for everyone fairly soon... I guess as soon as they find Karpeles and his team :-)

Bitcoin is THE cryptocurrency. All the alt coins are essentially riding on the coattails of Bitcoin. Some will rise, some will fall, but make no mistake, if Nitcoin fails catastrophically, the alt-coins are dead.
If people know any cryptocurrencies, they know Bitcoin. There's no one out there who knows about any alt-coins and doesn't know about Bitcoin, but the opposite isn't true.
That's what the network effect is, and that's why it's so important.

Only if they know exactly each of the addresses your customers are paying into. Most Bitcoin solutions create a new address per transaction, and it's not usually made public, so it would be a bit of a nightmare to try and figure it out.

The beauty of Bitcoin is that you don't HAVE to trust anyone. Print a paper wallet, put your bitcoins in it, bury it in the backyard. Done.
If you're going to keep your bitcoins online, then you will have to trust someone, somewhere, sometime. For the very few bitcoins I keep online, I'd rather trust people who, so far, have not been proven to be deceitful or duplicitous.

This has to be my last reply, as I'm actually quite busy. I didn't accuse Peta of being fraudulent, just of not communicating. Specifically, of not responding to my query. Much like MtGox used to. See? That's how they're comparable. On the other hands MtGox was an exchange, and Petamine a mining operation. That's how they're not comparable. But inasmuch as they both, at one time or another, have not replied to queries or concerns from their stakeholders, they are comparable.

No, if a fatal flaw was discovered in Bitcoin (which at this point is an extremely remote possibility), the damage done to the whole concept of cryptocurrencies would be so immense it would take many years for any coins to recover from it.

The thing is BTC withdrawals are officially suspended, but fiat withdrawals are only officially delayed. So people have a glimmer of hope of getting their fiat out but no chance in hell of getting their BTC. Ergo, BTC value drops like a stone.
The fact is, of course, that neither fiat nor BTC are coming out of Gox (quite possible, ever), and so they might as well be trading unicorns and diamond lattes for all anyone cares.
It's a virtual exchange, operating with virtual money and, as it happens, out of a virtual office. They are all but virtually dead.

Well, since I've been around Bitcoin (2011) this is the largest scale attack yet against the network itself.
Let's see how it handles it.

This is the basic reason why alt-coins are doomed. The fact is, because of the first mover effect, they're all riding on Bitcoin's coattails.
If Bitcoin rises, the supporters of every alt-coin will continue to yell and scream that their dogelitepeerkonyecoins are so much better than Bitcoin because of this or that.
But if Bitcoin collapses completely, no one will ever trust a decentralised p2p currency again, and with very good reason.
As Erik Vorhees very aptly put it once: "When I see what Bitcoin does to legacy currency, I'm inspired. When I hear about what alt-coins do to Bitcoin, I yawn".

The price is set at the moment you make the transaction... the verification process is ultimately dependent on what the two parties transacting agree to.

Except... Bitcoin is a protocol. The blockchain, the essential idea on which Bitcoin is based, is churning along, and far ahead of the game of any others.
With sidechains, other cryptocurrencies are likely dead in the water now anyway. But at any rate, their success or failure was always tied intimately to the success or failure of Bitcoin. If a catastrophic flaw had caused the value of Bitcoin to drop to zero, all the other cryptocurrencies would have followed suit.
The combination of brain power and investment pouring into the Bitcoin space right now blows all other cryptocurrencies away, and so it should. Those that are able to morph into sidechain iterations of themselves will likely succeed, those that won't will likely fail.
I'll stick by my analogy of Bitcoin as the internet.

It is a function of the value of what Bitcoin is likely to replace. Bitcoin is a store of value, a currency and a payments system all rolled into one. If it were to take a small percentage of the world markets in any or all of those three roles, you end up with a valuation of several hundred billion dollars. If a technical problem appears and can't be solved, the valuation will be zero. This is why most people think the outcome is ultimately binary.

Yes, and that's also predicated on 10,000, which may have been what "someone" predicted, but by no means what everyone predicted was going to be the case by mid-2014.
If you averaged out the positive predictions for June 30, 2014 you'd probably end with something closer to $2,000 - $3,000. Clearly that won't happen, but $450, if it holds, is logarithmically MUCH closer to $3,000 than to $10.

Well, reading the whole thing, you weren't so much misquoted as cherry-picked. And the problem is that you did leave cherries out there for them to pick. Whether that was done on purpose or inadvertently, as a consequence of your desire to be absolutely precise in your answers, is something only you can know for sure.
But here are a few cherries you left out:
- Volatility is to be expected in low liquidity systems. Increase liquidity and the volatility inherent in the system will decrease.
- While volatility is detrimental to traditional fiat and legacy currencies, it is a lot less so to Bitcoin, which is programmable money. What does it matter that over the course of a day/week/month the value changes if the computational power required to assign that value is inimical to the Bitcoin process, and each Bitcoin can be subdivided with the kind of precision that would be unthinkable for any other currency.
- IF YOU FUCK WITH THE SUPPLY PART OF THE ALGORITHM, BITCOIN (and every other iteration of crypto, I might add) WILL DIE!!!
Those would have been nice cherries to put there, but they weren't. You made the cherry-picking exercise easier for anyone who wanted to write an article that might, if taken in the proper context, detract from Bitcoin and support Ethereum.

Nope. All legal tender means is that it cannot be refused as a way to settle debt (and pay taxes). Lots of currencies and assets are not legal tender in the US, and are still very valuable.
Now, if a country decided to adopt Bitcoin as its national currency - or, more likely, decided to peg its own currency to a Bitcoin sidechain, for example - the likely outcome of that would almost certainly be the moon.
But it isn't necessary.

it's wrong. Trying to fit the square peg of old thinking into the circular mode of a new reality never fully works. You could just as easily say: "Bitcoin is like gold and the miners are like miners"... also wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:08:13
It's conceivable. Also, it could be argued that in the final analysis Bitcoinica worked out pretty well, at least for those of us who held while everyone else was panic buying, panic selling and panic margin trading :-)
As always, it boils down to timing, but the problem with Bitcoin is that you have no control over the variables that will affect the timing. It's so much easier for someone who already owns 100,000 BTC (obtained through mining or purchase back when they were sub $1, for example) to push the shorts and longs on Bitfinex, than it is for someone who is new to the market to do so by buying thousands of BTC today, at close to $500 each. 
So, on balance, a leverage and margin trading entity like Bitcoinica or Bitfinex will always depress the price, until the numbers just stop adding up, it disappears and with it so too does the downward pressure.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:24:29
"The value of bitcoin dropped substantially in December after it was revealed that the coin was not as safe as some had thought."
No, the value dropped, most likely, due to uncertainty and then hostility from the People's Bank of China, coupled with ill-concealed attempts at market manipulation and the collapse of what had been (but not for almost a year at that point) the largest Bitcoin exchange. No safety concerns then, no safety concerns now.

Yes, but my point is that the market rules still apply. All that's happening is that weak hands are meeting strong hands. Unfortunately for the Chinese who are dumping, they're not the strong hands right now.

Out of the whole diarrheic drivel, which I will ignore because I tend not to argue with little children, this one point is actually patently false.
You are aware that you can spend bitcoins even when they are offline, right? You know that they aren't really "coins", and that you don't need to physically hold them in order to spend them, right? I mean, if you're going to be trolling, you've at least done that little bit of homework, right?

Best shot at an offline wallet is to use Armory (or Electrum, I think). Second best is probably Blockchain, as they use client side encryption and will actually allow you to print a paper wallet.
And yes, you should be able to use Coinbase to buy BTC, with the caveat that since the weekend they appear to be using a floating exchange rate. In other words, the rate is not locked in at the time you buy the BTC, but at the time they get them to you.

This is a kind of logical fallacy, and has been around for quite a while (Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoin gold, for example).
The fact is, with each bitcoin being divisible to the 100 millionth part, there really is no need for a "silver".
I like Andreas in general, and mostly I'm in synch with his ideas, but when it comes to alt-coins I'm afraid I have to disagree. I think there is room for some development of alt-coins within the framework of the idea of sidechains (look up sidechains if you don't know about them already). But in general, alt-coins are vehicles that contribute nothing to the idea of cryptocurrency as a whole, and are fully riding on the coat-tails of Bitcoin.
In other words, if a total technical catastrophe were to cause the price of bitcoins to fall to zero, all the other alt-coins are dead in the water and it will take easily 30 years or so for the world to even consider accepting another form of digital currency.
Yes, Starbucks could issue their own alt-coin, much like they now offer gift cards. And conceivably people would use the Starbuckcoin to buy other things, much like in Canada some people use Canadian Tire money to buy other things. But outside of Bitcoin or sidechains, the alt-coins really have very little to offer.

Back in 2011, during MtGox's fist massive cock-up, they decided to prove they controlled a large amount of bitcoins by moving them between two wallet addresses they owned. At a time specified by MtGox, several transactions of over 200K BTC each took place between two addresses they claimed they controlled, and everyone was able to see them on the blockchain, proving they had possession of those BTC.
You can still see those coins in those addresses. They haven't moved. If some third party had been stealing BTC from Gox (especially if they did through an exploit of transaction malleability), there would have been a constant trickle of coins out of Gox. In fact, if you crunch the numbers, the trickle had to be a pretty steady stream lasting several years.
But the coins are still in those addresses... they haven't moved... exactly how they would be if MtGox and Karpeles had simply, say, forgotten the password to the cold storage.

We need to stop thinking of Buterin as a Bitcoin person. He's transitioned to something that he thinks will make him more money, just like others did with Ripple before him.
He's a brilliant guy, but not infallible by any means, and distinctly not up to the task of understanding how ideas translate into the real world.
It's too bad that the Bitcoin space has lost his intelligence, but there are lots (lots!) of highly intelligent people already involved with Bitcoin and more joining in every day.

The reward for mining (the way in which new bitcoins are created) started out at 7200 coins a day. Roughly every four years, it drops by half. In late 2012 it dropped to 3600, and the next halving is due some time in mid 2016. 
There are two schools of thought:
1) By dropping the rate of creation of new bitcoins, you make them more scarce, consequently there are more people vying for fewer bitcoins, and the price goes up.
2) The market knows when the halving is going to happen, and precisely by what amount, consequently it is already priced into the current value of a bitcoin.
As with everything Bitcoin, the adherents to either school are almost religious in their beliefs.

Nobody knows. A (relatively) small number of addresses hold a (relatively) large number of bitcoins. But there's no way of associating an address to a person unless they have openly broadcast it at some time in the past.
So one person could control multiple addresses or, conversely, one address or wallet (think MtGox, BTC China, Bitstamp, Coinbase) could control the coins of hundreds or thousands of people.

Nope, the wonderful thing about Bitcoin is that it stands on its own. Satoshi (whoever he, she or they may be) is just a name, not an all giving god.
Now, if Satoshi kept those first million or so bitcoins mined, and if Satoshi were to all of a sudden sell them, then the price would dip quite a lot for a while. I suspect it would soon recover, though, as it has in the past.
The blockchain endures, with or without Satoshi... just as he, she or they planned it.

Nothing to do with transaction malleability. Thousands of one satoshi transactions were sent to addresses throughout the network. But miners won't confirm a one satoshi transaction, because it is several thousand times less than the minimum mining fee. So those transactions linger on the list until they get discarded.

Yes, the decision to end the decimals at the satoshi was an arbitrary one and can be changed with a fork. In some predictions of Bitcoin's future this actually becomes a necessary step.
Or, you could build an entire chain on the back of that one bitcoin (or fraction thereof).
Also, I doubt the destruction rate will be positive. It barely amounts for a fraction of all bitcoins since its creation, and the overwhelming majority of lost bitcoins were lost when the value of a bitcoin was negligible. You'll find that the rate of loss is inversely proportional to the exchange rate :-)

Massively more widespread adoption and larger "market cap". When each bitcoin is worth around $20,000 the market will be more stable organically.
Right now, anyone can manipulate the price for just a few million dollars. And as volatile as it is, it's still more stable than it was in 2010 and 2011, when the same results could be achieved with just a few tens or thousands of dollars.
As the market and the adoption rate grow, the price will stabilise and eventually plateau, though I suspect we're still many years away from that point.

While the whole idea of recognizing patterns that may indicate insolvency is not entirely reliable, the fact remains that it would be trivial for MtGox to demonstrate their solvency, at least when it comes to BTC. 
Their steadfast refusal to do so, plus the delays and shady excuses mentioned in the article, unfortunately point to the conclusion that MtGox is, in fact, insolvent. 
At this moment, the only logical course of action would be for the Bitcoin community to write MtGox off as bankrupt and essentially isolate it from the rest of the economy. Will this happen? Not a chance. There are too many people willing to believe too many lies out of a desire to make too much money.
But if we want a precedent for how these things turn out we need look no further back than pirateat40, back in 2012. Same issues, same excuses and, I fear, same result.

Short answer is yes. I'm in Canada, and that's how I pay my people in countries with capital controls, where it's very difficult to send money (and then, when it gets there, the government keeps upwards of 30% of it due to the spread between "official" and "unofficial" rates of exchange).
The biggest problem you'll run into is on the Russian side. On the Canadian side you have a plethora of choices. You can choose to keep the bitcoins, of course, but if you want to convert them to CAD you can do it pretty quickly via one of the several exchanges (cavirtex.com and Vault of Satoshi are two, but there are others).
In Russia it might be more difficult for your clients to turn their rubles into bitcoins. But a quick search on localbitcoins.com shows several people willing to buy and sell bitcoins in Moscow... so the options are there.
Of course, the actual transfer of bitcoins from Russia to you is a non-event. The transfer itself is instantaneous... but if you want to be one hundred percent sure, you just wait three or four confirmations (30 to 40 minutes on average).
Hope this helps.

Sure, if you continue the delusion. But the reality on the ground is that Bitcoin adoption is, at this point, pretty much unstoppable.
Why would a government want to destroy Bitcoin when they can use it as a means of control and profit, both through manipulation and through selective targeting of exchanges and businesses.
Nah, the theory simply doesn't hold. At this point, if the government owned hundreds of thousands of BTC it would make a lot more sense to drive the price up to the moon, which they could easily do by throwing their weight behind another hundred thousand or so, therefore making the BTC they now own fantastically more valuable.

I'm leaning towards lost. Stolen and kept in 200K wallets makes very little sense to me.

This is an actual function of the blockchain. We can all see which address has how many bitcoins, but to then conclude that all those bitcoins belong to one person is just unwise. 
By the same token, many addresses could be under the control of a single individual... we simply don't know.
How many bitcoins were lost forever in the early days? We just don't know.
How many big early adopters sold during the many "crashes"? We don't know.
Until someone can tell me exactly how many bitcoins I have (and come to within 10% of the actual figure), I'll just assume all of these guesses are just that: conjecture.

I'm pretty new to the concept of cloud hashing, but it appears the ROI varies from service to service (and often from rig to rig within each service). Personally, I have no problem with contracting rigs and pointing them away from ghash.io as long as I break even... TBH I might even do it at a nominal loss, just to take hashing power away from ghash.
That being said, there are new players in the space each and every day. A new one was announced today (nimbus mining?) and I just got an email from Havelock announcing the IPO for another. Competition should bring efficiency, which in turn should bring marginally higher ROI.

Exactly. Unfortunately, as precise a language as English usually is, here we're running into a grammatical confusion: bitcoin purchases can mean 
a) the purchase of bitcoins, or
b) the purchase of some other item for bitcoin.
The first one isn't subject to sales tax (the way it is in Australia, for example). The second one obviously is.

Actually, their real share of the hashrate is likely quite a bit lower than that. The percentage on blockchain.info is based on blocks solved, not on actual hashrate, which would be almost impossible to figure out. There are pools like Eligius which control a significant portion of the hashrate, but have just been pretty unlucky in the last couple days, so they appear as having a much lower percentage than they actually have.

No, the inflation bit refers only to the pizza, not to the price of a pizza. 
You could say one pizza will feed eight friends who get one slice each. If you cut it into 16 slices, then each friend will have to get two slices to feel equally satisfied. The number of pizzas remains the same.
Basically, one pizza is one pizza is one pizza = not inflation.
Add pizzas to the equation and you get inflation.
Where it gets interesting is with the alt-coins. If you manage to lump a Litecoin and Dogecoin in with Bitcoin as a generic cryptocurrency, then you could argue that the combined result (Litecoin, Bitcoin and Dogecoin) is decidedly inflationary. But if you set an alt-coin as a Bitcoin sidechain, it wouldn't be... it would be like cutting the pizza into smaller slices.

Perhaps you missed the point. Margin trading in an illiquid market where a remarkable number of Bitcoins are in the hands of unknown players is unwise. It's easier for a kid who was mining in his basement in 2010 to dump thousands of coins than it is to persuade someone to buy thousands of coins at 500 dollars a pop. The pressure will always be downward until the numbers stop adding up.

Anyone who predicts where the price of bitcoin is going to be is either lying or is a scammer who has inside information.

as a precautionary measure. And incidentally, they did not close. They suspended BTC withdrawals but continued processing fiat withdrawals... which acted as a great incentive to get them back up and running quickly, which they did.
And only two exchanges did this (one for a few hours, the other for a day). Most exchanges quickly put up announcements saying they had known about transaction malleability (NOT double spend) for a long time and had taken the necessary measures to work around it. MtGox was TOLD about it six months ago, and told they had to fix their custom software.
But again, other than for the "claims" of Gox and Silk Road 2, not a single satoshi has been lost to this.

every transaction contains a fee (small fee, but there nonetheless). When a block is solved, all those fees are put together and go to the computer that has solved it.

This seems to echo the recent poll that shows a strong correlation between the desire to ban Bitcoin and a lack of understanding of it.
Something similar could be said of the early stages of the internet and five decades before the early stages of television.
The problem is we need to find a golden mean, whereby it isn't necessary to understand asymmetric cryptography to enjoy the advantages of Bitcoin, much like you don't need to understand quantum mechanics to watch TV or Special Relativity to use your GPS.
This is the juncture we find ourselves in right now, those who know the most about Bitcoin usually speak way over the heads of those who already don't understand it. We need either the middleman or the app that can bring Bitcoin to the masses without the need for a deep understanding. Just like grandma can send an email from her iPhone.

Actually, that *might* have been the actual error. The other possibility (which is somewhat likely, since their withdrawal problems began weeks before) is that they lost coins to either fractional reserve practices, another kind of hack, or running a Ponzi scheme where they paid out to investors with the coins deposited by customers.
Either way, they appear to be short of the coins they owe, and have closed themselves out to the rest of the economy.

According to their press release, the transaction malleability is causing them the same problems they would cause to anyone running qt 0.8 or higher (i.e., temporarily, two transactions appear on the list, until one gets confirmed and the other one discarded), which, coupled with the DoS and Enjoy Sochi attacks, means it's a good idea to temporarily suspend BTC withdrawals. But because their implementation followed the recommendations made because of this known issue, they lost no coins. UNLIKE MtGox, who referenced their transactions and coins availability to the TXID (contrary to the recommendations), and consequently may have lost coins because of it.

Something similar to the case with Western Union and other remittance companies. They could view Bitcoin as a competitor (and for a long time, they have), but they could also view it as a technology that will allow them to save costs.
To top it all off, you cannot really switch off Bitcoin, which means the savvy entrepreneurs are starting to look at ways of co-opting the technology, instead of fighting it.

Pretty early on a vulnerability allowed for coins to be generated at will. In 2011 Gox was hacked and the price dropped to almost zero. In March of 2013 there was an unforeseen hard fork of the blockchain.

I have no idea how long the attack will continue, but Andreas Antonopoulos seems to think the exchanges will go back to BTC withdrawals in the next 24 to 72 hours (probably depending on the exchange and how they are configured), and it seems reasonable to expect the devs to have a plan of action in place at least around that time as well.

No, from a technical standpoint they can attempt a double spend with a high probability of success. The double spend would be noticed, and the protocol would be changed such that it cannot happen again. All of that to ensure they can get away with spending some arbitrary amount of money twice. Following that, and assuming miners insist on pointing their rigs at a pool that has been confirmed as carrying out a double spend attack, the choice of protocol would be left to the nodes and users, not just the miners. That's what a 51% attack can do... in other words, at best they can get away with a double spend or two, at worst they can force a fork. That's from a technical standpoint.
From a game theoretical standpoint a 51% attack just makes no sense.

No, it was known and understood, and in fact was even fixed. The fix was to not assume transactions based on their ID, but rather on their inclusion in the blockchain. This is what Gox failed to do.
The devs (and miners and exchanges) are now working on a fix that will make that original fix unnecessary, even though they had warned Gox about it months before anything happened.

There's a whiff of a hidden agenda. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If you're making the claim that Bitstamp is insolvent, like MtGox, and that the same thing will happen to people who have bitcoins or fiat at Bitstamp as happened to those in Gox, then the onus is really on you to provide some pretty compelling evidence to back that up.
Either way, I don't have a dog in this fight... have never used Bitstamp (or Gox, since 2011, for that matter). But the frantic posts reek of FUD more than actual warnings.

Bitcoin is in an inflationary phase. Right now, 3600 coins are mined each day (on average). But it used to be 7200, and sometime in late 2016, depending on a number of factors, it will drop to 1800... four years later, give or take, 900... four years after that, 450... At some point, it will become inflationary neutral, given that some private keys have been lost forever, and probably some will continue to be lost.
The BIG difference is that this rate of creation of new bitcoins is not only well understood, but predictable and unchangeable by design. That's where it's radically different to fiat currencies.
And yes, in the end, Bitcoin will be deflationary... but not for a few more years.

It's always possible that this is an enormous ploy by Mark to steal 750K BTC. The problem is, the coins are actually in plain sight. And Mark will be in plain sight as well. If the incompetence argument is true, then the coins are lost and won't move. If a single satoshi from that stash moves, then the incompetence argument doesn't hold water.
I agree that when it comes to Karpeles and Gox we should default to deception. But we should also default to incompetence, because they have proved to be spectacularly unable to run the exchange even when it went against their interests to do so (think back to June 2011 or April 2013, to name just two examples).
Is it conceivable that the objective was to steal these 750K all the way back to 2011? Yes, it is. But then the question becomes why now? They could have kept this ploy going for years, watch and encourage the price of bitcoins to rise, and end up with a massively larger loot.
I still feel incompetence (on an almost unparalleled scale) is at the bottom of this.

Armory's main feature is that it can operate as a completely offline wallet. In other words, you can have one copy of Armory running on a computer connected to the internet, and another copy, which actually holds the private keys, on a computer that is not connected to the internet. That way, no one can get your private keys. You use the online wallet to start a transaction, but it gets signed by the offline wallet, which keeps your keys safe.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:20:18
Well, since I've been around Bitcoin (2011) this is the largest scale attack yet against the network itself.
Let's see how it handles it.

" Unless, that is, a lack of liquidity or some other problem in the market means that current bitcoin prices are artificially high. If that’s the case, the bidders have two possible motivations. "
Not necessarily. It could also be a good hedge against slippage, since the bitcoins will be auctioned off in neat 3000 BTC packages. You try and buy 29,000 BTC all at once from the exchange... the price you end up with won't be the price you started off on.

I'm Chinese, I have BTC in a Chinese exchange. I can sell the BTC for yuan, which I will then not be able to get out of the exchange because the PBOC has banned my bank from operating with the exchange... or...
I withdraw the BTC to the Bitstamp account of my cousin Leonard in Vancouver, who then wires me the money because the PBOC has not banned my bank from receiving wires from abroad... 
I send the BTC to my friend Donald in London, who then turns them into pounds, with which he purchases items from my Chinese factory.
I send the BTC to my son Wei in New York, who uses them to buy stuff on Amazon.com via snapcard.

His other issues have been raised well over a hundred times on this forum and bitcointalk. This "constant downward slide" he mentions is the premise on which his entire post is predicated, yet it's nothing compared to the "downward slides" of 2011/2012. 
Meh, he thinks Bitcoin's doomed because people have no interest in the aspects that make it unique. But that's a bit like saying GPS is doomed because most people don't understand General Relativity. Right premise, wrong conclusion.
The fact of the matter remains, what's prompting his post (and presumably his "divestiture") is the fact that the price isn't where he wants it to be. If bitcoins were trading for $3,000 and rising he wouldn't give a damn how much people understand or care about the fundamentals of it.

yeah, see the part about mutual substitution? that's where the little numbers printed on the bills come in. Each 20 dollar bill represents 20 dollars of value, but the bill itself is unique. We use it in a way that makes them fungible, just like we do with bitcoins (which, incidentally, by your reckoning would be fungible in Canada, Denmark, Germany, just not the US, because of the different approaches to taxation). But the bill itself, is unique.
Bitcoins would not be fungible if one of my bitcoins was worth more than one of yours because my bitcoins originated at a different point in the blockchain, or because yours were mined in a country that taxes them one way and mine in a country that taxes them a different way. But they're not.
Inasmuch as a bitcoin is the same value REGARDLESS of which bitcoin it is, they're as fungible as dollars... or as not fungible, take your pick.

The excerpt below is almost word for word what I have been saying for the last few months. It is remarkable to see my thoughts articulated with such precision. 
"Gox was robbed of a massive amount of coins (800k+) at some prior point in time, possibly June 2011, and has been operating a fractional reserve since.
Gox determined that it was better to continue operating the exchange, probably both for the sake of Bitcoin, and for their customers who would eventually be made whole from fees earned.
Gox knew of transaction malleability and had been keeping that scapegoat in their back pocket to use in the event of a bank run.  Or, they didn't know but the losses from TM were actually recent and minor.  Or, they didn't know but the losses from TM occurred over a long period of time and they never noticed because they never reconciled the books, because they knew they wouldn't match anyway because they were already fractional.
Fiat withdrawal problems led to an increased uptick of BTC withdrawals, outpacing BTC deposits and draining reserves to 0.  This may have been compounded by an actual problem with transaction malleability that accelerated the process.
Gox spent its fiat reserves and customers' fiat reserves to buy up BTC in order to keep the ship afloat until they could launch their rebranded Gox.com and Bitpocket wallet, which they'd hoped would provide more runway in the form of additional BTC deposits.
Gox doesn't make it happen in time and is forced to shut down, negative on fiat by millions and having lost all BTC."

If MtGox ever allows withdrawls of BTC again (and that is one almost insurmountably large IF at the moment), the value of BTC on MtGox will rise dramatically.

Nah, downward pressure is a consequence of:
a) Margin trading (much easier to short and put downward pressure than to go long and pump more money into the system), or, if you`re into conspiracy theories
b) Someone trying to lower the difficulty by bringing the price to where miners find it necessary to turn off their rigs, for example if the manipulator is masterminding a 51% attack in the near future.

Actually, this would curtail the risk for both the merchant and the customers. Remember, BTC prices can also crash, in which case the advantage would move in the opposite direction.

OK, so here's the problem with disruptive technologies: Our primate, pattern-seeking brains try desperately hard to make them fit into pre-existing molds. So it was with Bitcoin itself, where for a good two or three years the argument raged as to whether it was a currency, a commodity, a payment system or a store of value.
As it happens, it is all of those rolled into one, but it took our brains a bit of time to understand the new concept.
Something similar is happening now with mining pools. People are equating them to corporations: monolithic, bottom-line driven, single-minded.
As it happens, mining pools are a lot more like federations, in which individual miners make their own decisions.
This latest "fatal flaw" crisis, like the hard fork of March 2013, is simply another piece of evidence for how Bitcoin is supposed to work: A pool was coming close to 51%, it reached 42%, the community raised an alarm and just a few hours later it was back down to 38%.
Is it ideal? Not by any means. Ideally, someone will come up with a truly user-friendly p2p pool (and the community itself is encouraging this). But the miners aren't stupid and they realise that controlling 51% of something with zero value equates to a lot less than controlling 1% of something with great value... and they acted accordingly.

Two years ago, if you had 1,000 BTC you couldn't buy much with it (maybe the equivalent of 2,000 USD, give or take).
Today, with 1,000 BTC you can buy an airplane. That's a net gain.

Of course, it's always possible that MtGox was fractionally reserving BTC and fiat all along, and when they got caught they decided to expose this well-known "bug" and claim a hack, then using the consequent dip in prices to try and recover some of the coins... not unlike pirateat40 back in 2012.

They lost control of the BTC. They can't access them. Back in 2011, when MtGox screwed up for the first time, they had to prove they still controlled their BTC. They did this by announcing they were going to move half a million BTC between two of their wallets, that way everyone could see it on the blockchain. They did move 200K. That wallet is still there, and the BTC are still in it, they haven't been moved out. There was a previous post on reddit to this effect.
It's becoming more and more apparent that MtGox didn't lose the BTC to a hack, that they weren't stolen or taken away. They just lost access to them! There are a number of ways in which this could have happened, but it does boil down to spectacular incompetence on the part of Mark and Gox, something which truly should surprise no one at this point.

No, it's more like I am auctioning a baseball and open the auction up to secret bids. You, your brother and your aunt all put in bids, each for a different value... if I had three baseballs, I could sell them all, so the bids were for three baseballs. You don't outbid each other because you have no idea what the other bids were, but with your bid you are saying you're willing to buy the baseball at that price. So if I had three, I could sell them all.

The outcome for Bitcoin is binary. If it succeeds and achieves even a small percentage of its true potential, each bitcoin should be worth up in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The other alternative, of course, is that it crashes to zero.
There really doesn't seem to be a solution where bitcoins float around at their current price of a few hundred (or even a couple thousand) dollars. This is obviously a transitional phase... whether transitioning up or down is up for debate, but definitely transitioning.
So give it time. If it falls to zero, or near zero, then that's where it will stabilize. If it achieves a portion of its potential, then it will stabilize much higher than we are now.
Exciting to watch either way.

You are asking two questions:
"do you think he really "lost" 650,000 coins?" - nobody knows for sure, and it's quite possible nobody will ever know.
"Or are these 650,000 coins created out of thin air?" - no, they are not. A bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin. If it's on the blockchain, it's a bitcoin, if it isn't it's not. You cannot "create" extra bitcoins.

You are asking a question that has no answer because the premise is flawed. It's not the fault of those trying to answer your question. It's like asking how come the Earth is not flat if God wants it to be flat... you can't answer it based on that premise.
Bitcoin has value, and this has absolutely nothing to do with wallets or bots. Its value, like quite literally anything else that has value in the universe, is assigned and subjective. Right now it has value to the tune of around 670 USD, again, nothing to do with either wallets or bots, just what any two people are agreeing to value a bitcoin at.
You really should go to bitcoinbeginners.

I agree fully that Karpeles and Gox don't control the coins anymore. And I'm starting to lean quite heavily towards incompetence on a biblical level (lost passwords, lost key to the safety deposit box, something along those almost unbelievable lines).
But the forensics done so far does seem to indicate the coins haven't been stolen, just lost. And the difference between these two is unimaginably great, both in terms of the perceived risks of Bitcoin and in terms of the market influence of the Gox catastrophe.
I wish Mark finally came out and just said it: I lost the passwords, sorry! Then we can all start thinking of GoxCoins as one would of the Rai stones that never made it to the island and are sitting at the bottom of the sea. They're gone, even though everyone knows where they are.

It's probably dropping because the projected sale of the Bitcoins held by the government has caused one or more big holders to try and drop the price. The auction itself hasn't happened yet, but if you have your eye on those Bitcoins, then it's in your interests to make sure the price is as low as possible come auction day.

Hahah... right, they can only accept bitcoins from people who only have bitcoins with them. But that's a bit of a circular argument. And since they do accept bitcoins from other wallets, and since no one forces anyone to only keep their bitcoins with Coinkite and Bee, it's also a spurious argument.

I'm not sure how that might be measured, but I suspect we can divide it into two: social influence and economic influence.
Economic influence would be somewhat easier to gauge: when the price of Bitcoin stabilizes against other currencies, corrected for inflation, it will have reached its economic apex.
Social influence is a lot harder to agree on. Would you say the internet has reached its limit of social influence? Probably not, because among other things we really cannot predict further uses for it (voting via internet, for example, or some new technology that makes human interaction via the internet as complete as in real life, downloading of consciousness into a dropbox... who knows?)

About 20 times now, yes. If you have completed all the verification levels they may allow you to buy and sell instantly. But for those of us who haven't filed a credit card with them, it still takes the old six days. Since the weekend, the price is set not at the beginning of day one, but at the end of day six (in other words, when you get the BTC, not when you order them).
Since OP was asking where they could buy/sell instantly, my assumption was they don't have an account with credit card on file with Coinbase.

Yes, that's a problem for an exchange, but not for you using the reference client, since by definition if you spend the change you'll be spending less than you would have from the original transaction.
And that is why the exchanges knew this was a factor, and why they compensated for it by not using the TX ID as final arbiter, but the blockchain. MtGox claims that it didn't in its custom software, even though it was warned about it.

That's just for the hardware, at today's prices, assuming they can get it. It does not factor in things like the costs of operation, electrical, warehousing, etc.

I disagree. The comparison is valid, inasmuch as Ken Hess' approach is as much an article of faith to him as religion is to Ham.
But the value in this kind of a debate is that it would be posted on Youtube the very next day (next hour even), and the entire world would get to see a cogent, fantastically articulate position on one side (Vorhees) and a rehash of old, already debunked theories and magical thinking on the other (Hess).

Bitcoin is a network. It's better if that network is secure. To be secure, lots of computers have to use lots of power. They're not going to do that just because they're nice. They'll do it if they get a reward. The reward is 25 bitcoins (and it drops by half roughly every four years), which is given to the computer that solves a very difficult problem. So many computers compete to solve the problem and, in doing so, keep the network secure. For their efforts, the computer that wins gets bitcoins. This is called mining.

The premise of fractional reserve banking is that people don't need all their money all the time. If you use a service like Coinbase as your wallet (in effect, using Coinbase as a bank), nothing stops them from using those BTC, while at the same time showing them as your "balance".
If enough people used Coinbase, in the order of millions, they could make it work for quite a while.
But it's unwise, as Bitcoin is pretty frictionless, and "withdrawing" from Coinbase (unlike withdrawing cash from a regular bank) is just a click away. The slightest whiff of a bank run would topple the fractional reserve house of cards.

Nobody really owns a bitcoin, just the private keys that allow you to move the bitcoins around the universal ledger called the blockchain.
It follows that if you don't own your private keys, you don't really own bitcoins. 
Different wallet systems work differently. Some allow you to control the private keys, others don't. Do some checking, then decide which one you're comfortable with.

It's not zero sum. Economies grow and value grows, because value is assigned. Bitcoin becoming more popular doesn't necessarily mean other currencies become less valuable. It may mean that with some, and not with others, or it may just piggyback on top of the existing currencies.
Put it another way. There was a time, not that long ago, when there was no Microsoft. Then there was Microsoft, and its value soared, making some people very rich. But it didn't necessarily mean people not invested in Microsoft got poor.

Yes it's doable, and yes it will happen (hell, it's already happening in Ecuador and to a degree it happened in Iceland with auroracoin), but if it is to succeed in any meaningful way it will have to ride on the Bitcoin blockchain.

There is zero evidence that 750K bitcoin were stolen.
There's a lot of evidence that MtGox was insolvent, though whether that was due to malice or incompetence is still an open question.
How many BTC have been stolen (either by MtGox or from MtGox), is not clear at all. If they were stolen over time, chances are they've already been sold on other exchanges. If they were taken by Karpeles, chances are he wouldn't dump them all at once... mostly because that would be like a massive dot flashing on the radar screen of people who'd really like to find him right now.

Oh, of course, he most likely did sell "fractional reserve" bitcoins. But that's the risk you take when you don't control your private keys: your bitcoins are not your bitcoins. Essentially, all you have is an IOU for bitcoins, usually in email form.
But yes, in that sense, he might have "created" bitcoins out of thin air.
Some people have traced the original bitcoins on the blockchain, though. And it appears the clusterfuck truly was of biblical proportions, and Mark lost (or stole, or misplaced, or was forced to relinquish, depending on your particular theory) hundreds of thousands of bitcoins.

Once the price stops dropping, they will buy back again, and make a nice little profit.

It's a common assumption that since Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary eventually, it is deflationary right now. It isn't. At present, there are at least 3600 bitcoins created every day (and likely more than that due to the way the reward/difficulty part of the protocol works).
Right now, Bitcoin is inflationary, and will remain so for quite a while. If the price goes up, it does so in spite of its current inflationary nature.

@_date: 2014-03-18 16:34:08
If you think this is an either/or situation, that's up to you. Blockchain.info has more than one employee... they are a fundamental part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and it's incumbent upon them to keep their customers, and the community at large, fully informed.
Incidentally, the same "stop making them waste their time with updates" approach was used by many during each of the MtGox catastrophes, going all the way back to 2011.
Again, the coins are almost certainly completely safe. The optics of it suck. You don't believe me, check out the market.

As someone who has never held BTC at Gox, I'm clearly biased towards the lost side of the equation, and against the stolen. An inside job is possible, but it still begs the question as to why those coins haven't moved in years... with anyone else, I'd think that level of incompetence is just too deep to be real. With Mark... not so much.

In part, but as a traded company a chunk of the mining proceeds goes to the shareholders. They want to be a thriving, traded company, so people will buy their outstanding shares if they choose to do another public offering.
Beyond that, it's a matter of principle. I may not be part of the solution, but I sure as anything am not going to compound the problem. If Peta continues to mine on Ghash, I'll pull my money out of there and give it to someone else, who will compete with both Ghash AND Peta, and that will hurt their bottom line.

PayPal allows for chargebacks (you call PayPal, tell them you never received the goods and they refund your money). Bitcoin doesn't. So if someone sells you bitcoins for PayPal you could, in theory, take their bitcoins, then call PayPal and claim you never received them and get back your money from them.
It has happened in one form or another too many times, so the options for buying BTC with PayPal are very limited and usually entail high fees.

Sure, but the costs become factored into the equation (in effect, priced in). And none of those costs compare to the fact that, at least according to the going theory of the case, the PBOC has made it impossible for you to withdraw your yuans to a bank from the Chinese exchange.
Again, this is ostensibly the theory of what's going on. If I were a betting man, I'd say there will always be a way for you to get the yuan out of the exchanges (vouchers, ATM, middlemen, whatever) and that's what those trying to manipulate the exchange know full well.

SecondMarket is completely legit. They are not a Bitcoin-based business at all, they just added a Bitcoin trust fund a few months ago, and have been purchasing bitcoins for their clients, mostly off-exchange so as to have as little impact on the price as possible.
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:14:18
Well, the value of each bitcoin is quite volatile, in terms of its purchasing power (aside from the rate of exchange to USD, Euro, CNY, etc).
The thing is, if you support the theory that the final outcome for Bitcoin is binary and assymetric (either it will be worth a whole lot, or it will be worth zero), then you would absolutely expect the value of each bitcoin at this stage to fluctuate pretty much the way it does.
In other words, when each bitcoin is worth tens of thousands of USD (or zero), the fluctuations will be comparatively milder.

You may have missed the point (and in doing so have proven my point), that an understanding of the underlying theory behind a system is not necessary to use that system.
General relativity is to GPS as Bitcoin (the network and the protocol) are to blockchain.info, Coinbase, Circle, Coinkite

Or... he could've bought bitcoins instantaneously (localbitcoins.com, bitcoin atm where they exist), and sold them instantaneously.
Or... he could already have bitcoins.
In other words, in the middle of a highly volatile time, he starts off without bitcoins, chooses a system for obtaining them that takes several days, then complains about the volatility that took place during that time.
I use Bitcoin as a transfer protocol several times a month, often several times a week, but because I already start with bitcoins, and because I know I can get my hands on them instantly if necessary, the volatility doesn't affect me at all.

well, it's pretty unwise to invest all your money in bitcoins. But still, you haven't lost any money (nor made any money) until you actually sell what you have. So just hang tight, watch the storm pass and have a kit-kat
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:08:06
No way of knowing until you actually do it. But think of what would need to happen, if you're indeed Kmart. Someone would have to know exactly when a given customer is trying to put through a transaction, then attempt to double spend those exact coins. 
BTW, if you're Kmart, you can probably set up a wallet with Coinbase and when the customer goes to pay you ask: do you have an account with Coinbase? If the answer is yes, then the payment is instantaneous with zero confirmations required anyway.

value fluctuations are a function of lack of liquidity.
More liquidity = price stability
Liquidity relates to the amount of money entering the system, not how much Bitcoin is used as a currency. So things like the relaxing of regulations by New York State, the Winkelvoss ETF and the dozens of startups in the Bitcoin space are what's going to bring money into the system.
Give it a couple years
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:06:06
Nope. At its most fundamental level, the currency and the network are tied together, because the network is entirely dependent on the miners who are rewarded by the currency.

People often complain about unconfirmed transactions. There are many reasons why a transaction would take time to get included in a block (low fee, age of the coins, etc). Today is not special as far as I can tell.
Also, the confirmations happen *on average*  every ten minutes. But sometimes it just happens that 20 or 30 minutes will go by without a new block... and then sometimes you get three in the span of five minutes, because chance.

Hi Bruce. I take it Ken Hess was a no-show?
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:03:59
The thing is, the 24 hour rate is mostly irrelevant, since in order to pull off a 51% attack you'd need to have 50% plus one of the network at any given time. Also, the 24 hour rate is wrong, as evidenced by the fact that the hashrate has been consistently at 38-39% on an ongoing basis (and also if you check the 48 hour rate).
These things are estimates, so they can vary somewhat.
Finally, yes, it is troubling that one pool holds such a high percentage of the hashing power, but it will be troubling for the miners as well as for those who use the Bitcoin network, and ultimately it will sort itself out, like it did a few months back.
If the business model works for ghash.io (or cex.io), then it will undoubtedly work for others as well, just a matter of time until they're set up.

There are at least 3 proposed solutions to the 51% problem, as long as you concede a fork. And the network can deal with a fork, which was proven back in March of 2013.
But by far the easiest way of dealing with this issue is for two or three clones of ghash and cex to pop up, two of which already are on their way.

Bitcoin has first mover advantage over them. And, since they're based on the same protocol, they're essentially riding on Bitcoin's coattails. If Bitcoin thrives, they may or may not thrive, but if Bitcoin fails, they will fail. That's why betting on the alt coins is, in my opinion, unwise.

- No where has he said anything about Fractional Reserve banking or ponzi so now you're making assumptions
He hasn't, which is why I used the words "for example" to establish that there were reasons other than getting hacked for not having possession of the coins. 
MtGox could do a lot more than "say" the coins are safe. The could announce something along the lines of: "At 2:23 pm GMT we will move 42,357.8765 BTC from one wallet to another", which would effectively show they control 42,357.8765 BTC. They've done it before, and it's a really easy way of showing they still have the coins. But well before this "transaction malleability" smokescreen, they were already not letting BTC withdrawals go through for weeks. 
I have absolutely no coins in Gox, nor have I had any since the last time their incompetence screwed the entire Bitcoin community over. So I have no dogs in this fight beyond what their amateur tactics are doing to us as a whole, which is just as bad as it was in 2011, 2012 and April of 2013.

They're in the business of selling shares... you're probably right in assuming that once I've bought them, they don't much care what I do with them next. However, if I only bought a small amount on the basis of their promise to move, they don't know how many more shares they won't sell me (and many others) if we make the decision to not continue buying.
I accept that it takes time (though not on this scale, it could've been done in a few days), but the fact that they haven't followed up on their initial promise, nor kept us informed of what steps are being taken, is unprofessional at best, deceptive at worst.

@_date: 2014-03-04 15:53:53
To a degree that's correct, but there are tempering factors:
1) Only the miners get to decide.
2) There are forks and forks... if we get to the point where shifting the decimal back a few spots becomes necessary, but 5% of miners are against it because they are heavily invested in Litecoin, then the fork will still go ahead and that 5% will either have to go along with it or keep mining useless forked BTC that no one will want.
3) In fact, the greater the community the smaller the chance you'll end up with a fork that's close to 50-50, which would be the most problematic.

Bit of a chicken and egg, actually. I get the argument that if a store accepts Bitcoin, only to then turn it into fiat, it really isn't supporting Bitcoin... but it is.
It's not supporting bitcoins (the currency), but it is buttressing the support for Bitcoin (the network), which in turn will help move the currency along.
Early days issues, really. I doubt in five years we'll be talking about how many stores take Bitcoin, anymore than we talk today about how many companies have a website.

The difference is that Gox was showing signs of insolvency well before the malleability issue popped up on the horizon. For many months they've been delaying USD and other fiat withdrawals, and BTC withdrawals for weeks.
None of that applies to the other exchanges, so given that fact - plus their sloppiness when it came to using transaction IDs - it makes sense to suspect Gox of foul play, and not the others.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:37:25
Yes, but the whole think stinks of insider anyway. Consider this: MtGox claims it kept the majority of its coins in cold storage. So let's assume a savvy hacker managed to pull off a malleability attack on day one. You'd expect, after day one, that someone at Gox would go: "hmmm... it says here I should have X number of coins in the hot wallet and I have X minus Y. Tell you what, I'll just refill it back to X from the cold wallet!".
Nope, they've been BTC insolvent for a while, and they know it, and the malleability hack is nothing but a poor attempt at a smokescreen.

It does as a secondary factor. But the only thing that really affects the value of BTC is whether more people want to buy for more, or more people want to sell for less.

Nope. If it goes down in flames completely, then the outcome is already priced in. In fact, if it goes down in flames completely because Karpeles and his team have disappeared with hundreds of thousands of BTC, that would go a long way towards explaining the large drop in non-Gox exchanges over the last week.
If it magically comes back to life, and starts allowing limited withdrawals, then the operating word in the equation is "limited". And price will actually rebound very quickly as those holding fiat in Gox will want to turn that into BTC as soon as possible.
Can't stress enough how unlikely I think that scenario is, though.

Well, they wouldn't be able to transact single satoshis, but nevertheless your point is valid.
It does go beyond the use of each bitcoin, however. If stocks and bonds become traded on the blockchain, it follows that the blockchain itself will have value, and consequently the work done by miners in securing it will also rise in value, causing a rise in the price of bitcoin.
Also, we don't know anything about how they intend to implement it, but different implementations may have different requirements in terms of the portion of the blockchain they need to own (in other words, more or fewer bitcoins).

a) You're assuming the BTC are there or were there to begin with. If they were gone (either through a mysterious hack or, perhaps more likely, by running a fractional reserve system for months or years) then they're gone and you have nothing but "virtual BTC" left in Gox, which are valueless.
b) The US and Japanese government would most certainly do something about people being defrauded of their BTC, as there is already precedent through the pirateat40/Trendon Shavers court case. But even if they didn't, this catastrophe also involves a significant amount of fiat, and you bet your ass they would act on that.
My point is that there are two ways, or probably even more, of explaining the movement of the planets across the sky. But to justify any system other than one with the sun at the centre, you really have to go into convoluted mental gymnastics.

From yesterday's AMA:
How would altchains merge with sidechains on a protocol level?
Altchain is a generic term that includes both altcoins and sidechains. If you mean “Can an altcoin chain be a sidechain too?” The answer is yes. You can read more about this in section “6.1 Hashpower attack resistance”, in the point “Subsidy”.
If one wanted to turn an existing altchain into a sidechain or sidechain-compatible altchain, it would need to (just like Bitcoin) either use a softfork or federated pegging. Once that is in place, it would be up to the other sidechains whether they wish to accept that altchain’s assets being moved in or not in addition to (or instead of) bitcoins. If the current altchain is also desired to accept other assets (like bitcoins) being transferred in as a parallel asset to its native altcoin, it would be easiest done as a hardfork.

Pools aren't corporations, they aren't monolithic entities, they are made up of individual miners who quite likely have no great desire to see Bitcoin fail.
Also, read up on a 51% attack. All it means is that the pool get's to double spend whatever bitcoins they already have... they cannot "steal" bitcoins from someone else. And the network will actually know it's happening, so it can react to it pretty quickly.
But again, it's not even remotely likely to happen in the first place. As soon as the miners understand what's going on they'll point their rigs elsewhere or turn them off completely.
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:29:26
- This is much higher than it was in the past and also much lower than it was in the past. It has neither gone to zero nor to a million dollars.
This is not strictly true. Even in absolute terms, it's much closer to the top than to the bottom (don't forget the first exchange rate was in the order of 0.008 USD).
But if you look at it on a logarithmic scale, which is how you should look at it, the difference is even more dramatic.
Some people have argued that the bitcoin exchange rate could hover around the hundreds of US dollars per bitcoin forever. It's a minority opinion. Why? Because the potential for Bitcoin is enormous as a combination of currency, payment system, commodity and blockchain service. On the other hand, one serious technical flaw and the exchange rate would plummet to zero and likely not recover for years, if at all.
Consequently, most people (both supporters and detractors) align with the idea that the outcome for Bitcoin is likely binary... all or nothing, with supporters in favour of the former and detractors in favour of the latter.
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:54:56
No, the bug just means the client will show an incorrect balance while the transaction is confirming, and after it does, it will drop the wrong one (which was really the right one but under another name). For most exchanges, this wasn't a problem, as they were not basing their accounting on the transaction ID, but rather on what made it into the blockchain, which is the ultimate arbiter in Bitcoin of what is or isn't valid. From what MtGox claims, they weren't operating like that, and they would base their balances on the transaction IDs, something they were actually warned not to do. Because of that, it would have been possible to exploit the weakness and get the BTC. It was sloppy on their part, they knew about it, were warned about it, and still did nothing because they run their own software.
Again, never assign to malice what can be easily explained by stupidity or willful ignorance.

Again, just by looking at the blockchain you'd have no idea which transactions are made by Americans. Of course, you could resort to the honour system to make sure every American transacting in bitcoins reports it to the IRS... you could.
If the US government wanted to exact a tax from Coinbase, they could. I suspect they would soon discover that most of the clients will stop using Coinbase for their transactions, and therefore would only be able to tax any exchange of BTC for USD through Coinbase. It would go a long way towards making Coinbase insolvent, but it wouldn't achieve the objective of taxing every US bitcoin transaction.

You're mixing metaphors. You are not in control, because you (Western Union) are made up of employees. Sony sure as shit wasn't in control... and it's Sony!
If you fork the blockchain and create Rinocoin, regardless of where you're running it, you'll leave yourself open to attack. It isn't about the distribution of the nodes, it's about the hashpower securing the network. 
All the nodes provide is consensus to ensure everyone is on the same page.
The hashpower is what stands between the blockchain and an attacker who wants to alter the distributed ledger after the fact.
As I said, there are by now dozens of examples of failed alt-coins (you can create one yourself in about 35 seconds, btw, knock yourself out). They failed because either a) no one cared about them or, b) enough people cared about them to give them value and, as a consequence of that, make them appealing to those who would want to hack them and profit.
Bitcoin itself was only hacked once, very early on, and has been impervious to such hacks ever since.

The fee market isn't what's going to drive the price down. The optics of a system that is stifled by a team of devs that exercises centralised control over it, and that keeps it capped to an unreasonable minimum in spite of the growing evidence that shows a block size raise is necessary... that demonstrates lack of plasticity (not to mention intelligence), and THAT will push the price down.

It's only five years old, give it another couple years to establish itself.

It's a slight variation on the question: If each bitcoin is infinitely divisible, doesn't that mean there's an infinite supply?
As long as nobody engages in "fractional bitcoining", then we're still talking one pizza, regardless of how many slices you cut it in.
Of course, the moment someone starts offering "fractional banking" of bitcoins, you no longer own bitcoins, but rather a promissory note saying the entity doing the fractional banking will honour your bitcoins... that hasn't worked too well for the legacy banking system so far.

Of course it's worth that. The problem is that the refusal to address the block-size issue is going to drive the price of Bitcoin to the ground, making that kind of fee a much larger percentage of the transaction.

It's almost impossible to find one person with a working knowledge of all the different facets of Bitcoin (coding, networks, cryptography, economics, self-regulating systems, open source, and probably a few others I'm missing here).
Because of this, the first reaction tends to be "Sure, the part of it that I'm comfortable with works, but one of the other bits that I don't know about probably won't, so scam, ponzi, bad economics, bad crypto, bad coding, bad maths... won't work".
If you sit down for any length of time and start learning a bit about each of these aspects, you start to see how they all fit together in Bitcoin, and what a work of genius it actually is.

Back in 2011 Bitcoin was on the rise (a serious rise, not like $10 to $1000). Then, around the time the price reached $32 a few things happened, there was a massive theft and, crucially, the big MtGox hack. Those downward pressures, combined, brought the price to $2 for much of the remainder of 2011 and in fact kept it hovering around $2-$5 for much of 2012 as well.
Now, if you agree with the notion that the outcome for Bitcoin is binary - in other words, that it's destined to either drop to zero or be valued at several tens of thousands of dollars per bitcoin - then this drop in price is good news because it allows for greater distribution of the existing bitcoins. Just like the drop from $32 to $2 did back then.
If you agree with the premise that the outcome is binary, we're all early adopters, even those buying today or those who bought at the peak of $1200.

Can't be bothered with registering to comment on the Wired site, but this argument is dead in the water. When a bitcoin is issued, it is issued as one bitcoin, which at present has a value ever so slightly larger than one dollar.

Because the blockchain is secure. Western Union is more than welcome to try and institute their own blockchain (in fact, that's pretty much what they have done... without blocks... or a chain), but it's going to be either expensive, insecure or both.

Several ways:
1) As others have mentioned, this is a huge vote of confidence not just because of the amount of money, which in itself is significant, but because of who is behind it (New York Stock Exchange, big banks, a Japanese telco and the personal pockets of a really big banker himself).
2) The assumption with Bitcoin has always been that its outcome is likely binary. In other words, it's a really good idea, if it flies, it will fly incredibly high. If it crashes, it will crash down to zero (because of a technical fault with the protocol, for instance). This kind of capital, coming from these particular investors, is a strong message to the community at large - and especially to big money - that a catastrophic crash and burn scenario is almost impossible now. 
3) It lends credibility to the ETF proposals by the Winkelvii and others, and the multiple iterations (think other ETFs, hedge funds and so on) that will follow them.

The risk/reward curves intersect a bit into the future for hedge funds. Four or five years ago, the risk was insane and the reward potentially astronomical. Today, the risk is high and the reward potentially huge. When the risk is moderate and the reward is big, that's when they'll jump in.

It's a somewhat valid point. But let's not mix apples and oranges. The block size increase is a no-brainer. In fact, it should be MUCH higher than 2MB... and yet, 75% consensus is proving pretty hard to get, even on something most of the community agrees should have happened already!
The argument is that if someone comes around in a few years and wants to fork Bitcoin to remove the 21 million cap, they can do it with JUST 75% is a bit of a red herring.
It's taking a ridiculous amount of effort to achieve 75% consensus on a fork that will BENEFIT miners (and Bitcoin in general). Can you imagine the amount of effort it would take to achieve 75% consensus on something that would DESTROY it? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:09:23
The point is that it's irrelevant. There's already a relentless onslaught of alt-coins... it doesn't matter three rat's asses to Bitcoin, because the blockchain keeps plodding along.
Bitcoin exists and survives because it is in the interests of those of us who hold and use bitcoins that it exist and survive. That is what guarantees Bitcoin's presence and future... it really is as simple as that.
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:14:50
This if faulty logic. Firstly, I think the original argument is that they have no coins, not that they were attacked and lost them (they could have been engaging in fractional reserve, for example, or the whole thing could have been a massive Ponzi scheme).
Secondly, the claim that the coins are gone isn't an attempt to prove a negative, quite the opposite. Since the coins were demonstrably there at some point in the past, when people sent their coins to Gox, and they are now effectively not there, since Gox is refusing to release them, the claim that the coins are gone is in fact a positive claim. The onus is on MtGox to PROVE the coins are still there (which actually would be trivial to do, if you know anything about how Bitcoin and the blockchain work).
It is not for people who sent their coins to Gox and now can't get them back to have to prove those coins are gone. The coins ARE GONE, until such time as Gox releases them... if they ever do.

It means absolutely nothing. If you run your own Bitcoin programme (like Bitcoin Core), then simply switch to Bitcoin Unlimited, which will automatically follow the better chain.
If you keep your bitcoins in an online wallet, like coinbase or blockchain.info, remember that for the fork to take place, 75 percent of the last 1000 blocks had to have been mined with the new version. That is a pretty big number. And even then there will be a period of weeks before the new rules kick in. By then, if 75 percent of miners have already switched, the rest of the main players (including the coinbases and blockchain.infos) will have made the switch as well.
Either way, any bitcoins you own today WILL STILL BE VALID on both chains after the fork. Only at that point will you need to think, for a short while, about which chain you choose to spend them on. And again, if you have them online or on one of the apps, chances are by that point you'll be spending them on the better chain anyway.

"Limiting transactions is not going to determine the way Bitcoin will be used, it only limits the ability to use it."

That is almost impossible. By definition, the fork will only happen when 75 percent of the hashing power has already indicated it wants a fork... the other chain will die in minutes.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:00:26
Classic is Bitcoin... just like Coinbase is Bitcoin... or Armory wallet is Bitcoin. The blockchain has not forked... If I was running classic, I could send you... BITCOINS! They're running on the same network, their nodes are compatible with each other, they speak to each other and transact with each other... they're both Bitcoin. 
If a fork occurs, it will happen at a given date weeks after 750 out of the last 1000 blocks were mined with Classic (or XT, or Bitbombs Bitsoftware, or whatever else you choose). At some point after that moment, ONE BLOCK will be mined under the new rules and will be such that the nodes running Core won't recognise it as Bitcoin. Then, and only then, will there be a fork!
When that fork happens, there will be two chains. In short order (because it's already got the support of 75% of the hashing power), one chain will be longer than the other... THAT chain is Bitcoin. The other chain becomes an alt-coin, regardless of what those supporting it wish to call it.
Bitcoin *is the chain* ! The longer chain (the one with more work) is Bitcoin.
Incidentally, Bitcoin forks all the time (for example because a miner in Australia and another miner in China find blocks at almost the same time, and each keeps building the chain on the basis of their blocks)... but very soon, within just a handful of blocks, the network clearly accepts one chain as longer than the other, and everything resets.
This won't happen when some miners create blocks that other miners and nodes don't recognise as Bitcoin. But by definition, at that point 75% of the hashing power will already be prepared to accept those blocks as Bitcoin... the other chain becomes an alt-coin.
Classic, XT, Core, Bitcoinj... they are ALL Bitcoin! Until such time as a fork happens, none of those are alt-anything. They are Bitcoin, because they can operate, transact and exist in the blockchain.
This is a rather long video, but it might help you to understand: 
Core is just one Bitcoin client... nothing more, nothing less.

No, you misunderstand what an alt-coin is. It's a common mistake. If the chain forks it will be because 75% of the hashing power has indicated its wish for it to fork. At that point, Core becomes the alt-coin. The longest chain wins.

My understanding is that this was fixed in 0.8 and higher. But even if that wasn't the case, it's sending the unconfirmed change back to itself, so it doesn't mean you lose anything, it just means than until one transaction is confirmed and the other discarded there might be a discrepancy on your transaction list and balance.
I agree that this needs to be addressed, and it certainly appears like the core devs are addressing it. But in the grand scheme of things, if you think back to 2011 (when the reference client didn't even have wallet encryption) it wasn't a high priority. It was a well known issue and in fact it seems MtGox was specifically warned about it a long time ago.

Any bitcoins you own today will still be valid on both chains after the fork. The issue is with transactions that occur after the main chain forks, then you'll have to be careful as to which chain you are on. My feeling is that after the fork one chain will die out pretty quickly (no one wants to keep worthless bitcoins, so once momentum is established, the swing to the good chain will be fairly quick). Ledger will likely make its intentions public before the fork happens, as will all of the other main players. But you can be certain that if one chain dies, Ledger will be on the other one... they have no reason to stick with a dead chain.
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:22:45
Half right, half wrong. GBTC is not bitcoin, but it is a bitcoin denominated asset. In fact, it's the only way, so far, that about 9 trillion USD held in IRA's and 401(k)'s can be exposed to bitcoin. So while it isn't bitcoin, it very definitely is related to bitcoin.
Put it another way. Suppose a crucial flaw in the Bitcoin protocol was discovered tomorrow, the kind that is catastrophic and would send the price of BTC plummeting to zero. Do you really think the price of GBTC shares would hold? No, it wouldn't.
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:40:06
Man, you're dense. No, Classic isn't an alt-coin because the blockchain hasn't forked! If and when the chain forks, it will do so with at least 75% of the hashing power... when that happens, the longest chain (most work) will be Bitcoin, the other chain will be an alt-coin.

The problem with your argument is that 1 and 2 are NOT mutually exclusive.
Yes, blockchain.info could create the necessary tools to properly calculate a fee in the present circumstances.
And yes, the Core devs are being unreasonable blockheads, who are actually acting contrary to the best interests of Bitcoin and the wishes of the majority of the Bitcoin community.
Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate both of these: A plethora of online wallets, each with its own set of features, and a consensus mechanism built into the protocol, which gives miners and (tangentially) the community at large the final say on how Bitcoin should be run.
It's not a conspiracy if they actually ARE standing in the way of Bitcoin's advance.

For whatever it's worth, Jeff, I also prefer your proposal. The problem is two-fold:
1) No proposal at all contemplating larger blocks was even considered by the core devs.
2) The main forums on which the community can hold a debate on which proposal is best are now heavily censored with the approval of the core devs.
But if someone were to release a version of Core that includes BIP 100, I for one would likely switch to it.

I fundamentally agree with your post, but there is one problem. Neither side wants to have this whole argument all over again in five or ten years... I mean, they really, really don't want to have it. Unfortunately, that means that the prevailing sentiment is "Let us deal with the block-size issue once and for all"... and it's that "for all" bit that has caused the entrenchment we find ourselves in.
So I think you'll find that given the option between a medium-term compromise that just kicks the debate can down the road a few years, and a final decision on the block size issue, most devs and even hodlers will tend to throw up their hands and say: Just do it.
And when you think about it, perhaps it's better to be going through this turmoil now, than five or eight years down the road, with different (and hopefully much higher) adoption levels and exchange rates.

If I may, Meni, I think here is the crux of the matter. Of course neither position is ideal, each with its own flaws. But if we are not able to discuss these issues in the main Bitcoin fora for fear of being banned or having our posts deleted, then how on Earth are we ever supposed to hone in on the one solution that is the least flawed?
I too was on the fence on whether to switch to XT, but Theymos made my decision for me. If I cannot speak to the issue itself in the most popular fora on Bitcoin, then the only "voice" I have is to add XT nodes to the network.
As you, I am very much hoping some intermediate solution will present itself (though how we're to find out about it if the fora are censored is beyond me). I am hoping that a strong enough presence of XT on the network will persuade all devs, Mike and Gavin included, to try and work towards that least flawed solution.

Nope. His proposal always was BIP 101.

It doesn't have to increase so that all transactions fit. It can easily increase so as to allow some predetermined percentage.

If you're thinking of forking the blockchain, you'd better make damn sure most people are with you. You need a majority that is large enough to ensure that after the fork, the minority has no viable chance of winning the blockchain race. 75% achieves precisely that. If we fork with 75% of the network power, the other 25% will have no choice but to switch, or THEY will be the altcoin.
Consensus at work.

Consensus? Consensus among who? Just among the devs? That's not consensus at all... Consensus, in Bitcoin at least, is defined as consensus of the majority of the hashing power. 
Contrary to the opinion of the core devs and some forum mods, Bitcoin doesn't belong to the devs. It belongs to us, the stakeholders and users of this technology. I for one never relinquished my right to have a say in Bitcoin in favour of the core devs, and their refusal to even consider a raise in the block-size limit is the biggest dishonour to Bitcoin there can be, because it has been held against the wishes of the majority.
So, at least with Bitcoin, the consensus that matters, the *only* consensus that matters, is that of the majority of hashpower. That's what Bitcoin is.
If you want a system where a handful of devs decide what constitutes consensus, and then proceed to censor anyone who disagrees, it's already out there, it's called Microsoft.

There is no downside to running XT. If the fork happens, you're automatically on the longest chain. If it doesn't, you're plodding along as usual.

I, on the other hand, see a dynamic block size feature as analogous to the difficulty. After all, miners have little incentive to expand the block size as that makes the fees lower. Smaller blocks, as a rule, are what a miner wants. But if most miners are greedy, one of them might want to increase the block size, and the network should find its equilibrium.

So here is why the 21 million cap won't be changed: Bitcoin works on the basis of a consensus algorithm (if you haven't, watch the Andreas talk on this that was posted several times in the last week). That consensus algorithm means that even if miners were stupid enough to try and raise the 21 million limit, it will be up to the nodes to verify any transaction made after that change. Quite simply, if the majority of those running full nodes choose NOT to change their software, and if just one miner decides it's not in their best interests to raise the cap, Bitcoin will fork into two: original and new. Guess who most people will think is valuable? As soon as someone starts exchanging "new" bitcoins for "original" ones, the "new" ones will plummet in value.
Jon Matonis is speaking right out of his ass. Not sure why, he always was pretty reasonable, but no one knows what's going on behind the scenes, and money can obfuscate even the most intelligent people sometimes.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:50:26
Yes, and as I've said all along, if the core devs stopped being blockheads about this (blockheads, get it?) and just incorporated BIP 101 or any other reasonable way to address a block size increase, most of those who have switched to XT, both nodes and miners, would happily switch back.
This was never about XT, or about Mike Hearn, it has always been about the need for bigger blocks to stay within the vision of Bitcoin that most of us have.

@_date: 2015-08-19 14:26:47
You don't need to do anything at all, because NOTHING is happening.
If and when 75% of blocks are mined by XT, and only if this happens after January of 2016, there will be a period of two weeks during which everyone will have time to decide what to do. AFTER THAT, but nobody knows when, an XT miner will mine a block larger than 1 MB. Then, and only then, will we have a fork.
So for right now, for the near future, and who knows for how long, you need to do absolutely nothing at all. It's still all Bitcoin.

Usually, the way the consensus algorithm works in Bitcoin is by miners and nodes "voting" (they do this by choosing among different versions on solved blocks). Once a certain percentage of the last x number of blocks follows the new version, the consensus is assumed to have been reached and the network switches to the new version.
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:02:51
"Printing" money and "issuing" currency are one and the same today, but that is a relatively recent phenomenon. In principle, they are two entirely separate things.
It would be trivial for a country like Greece to "print" money, redeemable for bitcoins. In effect, they would then have a currency that is backed by the "Bitcoin standard".
This is what countries historically have had: currencies backed by a standard (most commonly gold), which is what kept their currencies honest.
The moment you sever ties with the standard (and even more when you allow fractional reserves for banks), the "issuing" of currency becomes a jumbled mess, where both government and banks participate and, without fail, the majority of the people stand to lose out in the end.

It means all the coins are already in existence, controlled by a single entity, distributed by that entity at will, and with the distinct possibility that the same entity will decide to mine more of them in the future.
None of which applies to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is no more premined than gold. The fact that some people got in early and were able to obtain more of it than you doesn't make it premined.

No. Again, you should watch the video on how the consensus algorithm works. At best, they would achieve enough consensus for a fork... that's all... then we'd end up with the original bitcoin and an alt-coin (call it "inflationary bitcoin" or "QEcoin" or whatever you will). But those of us who do not make the switch will continue to mine, propagate, validate and transact original bitcoins. So people will have a choice, the original, deflationary bitcoin or an alt-coin (possibly also called bitcoin) which is inflationary. Which do you think most people will choose? Hint: There are already inflationary alt-coins out there...

Ah, fairly typical response. Your argument gets shattered, so you just move the goalposts.
This conversation wasn't about what the result of a possible fork would be, it was about how the consensus algorithm works and whether it can be manipulated.
If you're worried about what would happen in the event of a fork, you really need to look no further than where we are now. There are dozens of alt-coins, many of them straight-up Bitcoin forks. And yes, they muddy the waters somewhat, and yes the media can at times get confused. But no, they haven't dethroned Bitcoin... nor will they.

Oh, I am sure some people will view a hard fork as being game over, just as some people (and we can all think of at least one) view the lack of a hard fork as being game over.
What some people may think is quite irrelevant, as long as there are other people who think the opposite. 
The Bitcoin blockchain forks *all the time*. These forks resolve themselves pretty quickly and the blockchain keeps plodding along, exactly as designed and advertised.

I don't think you understand how the consensus mechanism works. There will not be CoreCoins vs ClassicCoins, certainly not for any coin created before the fork (like the ones you'll be holding). Your coins are and will be bitcoins. You will be able to spend them on either chain... if you're afraid of what might happen at the fork, just don't spend them until you know which chain is longer. Since a fork will only happen with an assured 75% supermajority of the hashrate, you will know that the new chain is longer. BTW, *that chain will be Bitcoin*!
I suspect you are right in that a fork is unlikely, not because of your theory of miners and civil wars (there are no civil wars when one side has 75% of the power). But because if a fork appears to be inevitable, I have a strong feeling that Core will agree to increase the blocksize to 2MB. 
Then again, so many of the Core devs are in such a conflict of interests right now between Bitcoin and Blockstream that anything is possible. But regardless, the actual fork, if and when it happens, will be a non event.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:02:35

Yes, and I could technically start a new alt-coin (in fact, fork it off the Bitcoin blockchain) and call IT Bitcoin. It doesn't mean that it is, though. We don't end up with CoreCoins and ClassicCoins. We end up with bitcoins and some alt-coin (which you can call CoreCoins, they will call Bitcoin and the rest of the world will quickly call nothing, because that chain will die off...).
Think of this in the real world. At some point, 750 out of the last 1000 blocks get mined by Classic. At that moment the clock starts... the fork cannot even happen for weeks! What do you think will happen during those weeks? That will be crunchtime for the Core devs and their supporters... they will be facing a fork, and they'll have a decision to make: Stick with a low work chain, or agree with the majority of the hashpower (and community) and expand the max block size? If I had any vested interest in Core, as I have in Bitcoin itself, the answer is pretty obvious.
The only imponderable is the role Blockstream plays in all this. But Blockstream knows full well that while small blocks makes their ideas more valuable, even with larger blocks their ideas are still HIGHLY valuable. The very notion of sidechains is simply awesome for a million reasons that have nothing to do with transactions per seconds, for example (want a country to have its own currency based on a Bitcoin standard? SIDECHAIN!).
So logic dictates we won't even have a fork, let alone a contentious one. If there is a fork, there will be no contest. If at that point you choose to sell your coins (in your theory at a lower value already due to the glut in the market from people who think like you), then please go ahead. I'll be right here, buying them :-)

You take a bitcoin and you create an entire chain off that bitcoin. The entire new chain will always be worth one bitcoin, but you can give it any characteristics you want... You can call it zoochain and create billions of zoocoins from it... but the whole thing will always be the equivalent of one bitcoin because it will be pegged to that one portion of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Any coins you have before the fork will be valid on both chains after the fork. So they're safe, and after the fork happens (if it happens) it will be up to you whether you transact your coins on one chain or the other.
If a fork happens, though, it is extremely unlikely we'll end up with two parallel chains. Since by definition one chain will get started with 75% of the hashing power, the other chain will die off pretty quickly.
And, as has been said, there's a 28 day period from the moment a fork is agreed on by the network to when it activates... meaning you will have plenty of time to decide what to do, and those who would otherwise stick with the weaker chain will also have plenty of time :-)

@_date: 2016-02-23 18:51:00
When it comes to banks and financial institutions, one of the main factors (if not the outright most important factor) is security.
When it comes to blockchain security, Bitcoin is miles ahead of everyone else. The Bitcoin network is by far the most powerful network in the world.
Any bank, or any person for that matter, can start a blockchain in a matter of seconds. Believe it or not, there's an app for that.
But starting a blockchain is nothing, securing it is everything. Anyone who thinks they can secure a blockchain (free, open, distributed, decentralized) without an incentive of the kind provided by bitcoins is absolutely deluding themselves.
It's a little bit like companies back in the 90's starting "their own internet". They sort of missed the whole point of the internet, and eventually they had little choice but to join it.

You have no idea how many people in the world own which percentage of bitcoins. Today you learned something wrong. You could, I suppose, affirm that 957 *addresses* hold 50% of all bitcoins... but that doesn't tell you anything at all. One person can own unlimited addresses, and one address can represent the holdings of unlimited people (think Bitstamp, for example).
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:33:18
You could also argue that someone could print a bazillion dollars with their own face on them. Yes, they could, but no one would accept them as real money.
And while it might be true that NOTHING is ultimately unhackable, if someone manages to hack the cryptography behind Bitcoin, we have MUCH bigger fish to fry, as every bank, government and military installation in the world would then also be hacked.
No, the fact that something can get hacked in theory doesn't mean it actually will get hacked in reality. There are over 6 billion US dollars in bitcoins out there... that's a serious incentive for hackers. Yet the blockchain plods along, not hacked.

As more Classic nodes come on line, the opportunity to buy cheaper bitcoins will increase. A blocksize increase will ultimately push the price up (way up, in fact). The FUD that will obviously be spread around the fork issue will ensure that those spreading it (and some of us) can get cheap coins before the value rises.

One of them :-)
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:42:08
Yes. Essentially, when 750 out of the last 1000 blocks are mined with Classic, that will trigger the fork, which will only activate 28 days later.
Any coin mined before the fork will be valid on whichever chain dominates after the fork. The coins we got back in 2011, that are in deep cold storage, that no one is looking at, they will all be valid after the fork. Actually, they'll be valid on both chains (if the weaker chain somehow manages to survive). But with 75% of the power behind it, the stronger, longer chain will dominate, and your coins will be valid on it.

@_date: 2016-02-23 19:47:24
Thanks for the tip (I'll pass it along). 
Pool operators do have some power, inasmuch as miners may not be willing to switch away from them (when Ghash.io was misbehaving, they were able to do so because their low fees made them very attractive to miners). Also, some miners may not be watching the pool all the time.
So if I was a pool operator who somehow found myself steering a really significant portion of the hashing power, I'd have to think long and hard about how to turn this to my advantage.
Clearly, I already have an advantage if I do nothing. If most of the hashing power is going through my pool, by definition I am also making the most money.
But let's say I know that I am in that position, but the rest of the community doesn't. For example, I am actually in control of two or three different pools, which unbeknownst to the community actually are under my command. Well, in that case I could reach a deal with someone else (the good folks at Ethereum, for instance), and when no one is expecting it, push a double-spend through my pool.
Now, I can likely only get away with a double-spend once. And it's even doubtful that I could, but I could try... once.
Nevertheless, if the double-spend is significant, and successful, then a well timed campaign could persuade bitcoin holders that Bitcoin is doomed, and that Ether is the way to go. If I had some ether to begin with, I'd stand to make money.
But, mostly, I'd do nothing, as I already have the advantage of the hashing power.
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:10:31
So move those same bitcoins to another wallet, and then use them any way you like
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:22:56
Mining pools down hold the hashing power, they channel it. The actual hashing power is owned by the miners.
For a miner, it is trivial to switch pools. In the past, when one pool has misbehaved, miners have left it. They're not married to the pool, they just use it. They can easily mine elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:59:39

@_date: 2016-02-04 18:09:17
Because the fork will only happen when a supermajority of the hashing power supports it. This will result, very quickly, in a pair of blockchains of which only one will be viable. The smaller chain will die off in a matter of hours. Coins created before the fork will be transactable on both chains (crucially, on the longer, surviving chain), so the entire episode should be a non-event for the vast majority of users.

Funny how now the devs are saying how excited they are about how excited we (the non-devs) are about a conference on scaling.
It would have been nice to see the fruits of this excitement a few months, or even years ago, when it started to become obvious that scaling would be an issue.
So, writing letters is nice, but if you're a dev, then dev. Write code, submit it and let others look at it, incorporate it into some iteration of the software, see if the community at large agrees... you know, like some other devs have.
Let us then have an open, intelligent and *uncensored* debate on the pros and cons of each proposal, and then incorporate the one that has the broadest consensus into the protocol.
And. Do. It. Now. 
A scalability conference designed to focus in on ideas that will then be hashed out at a future conference? Excited? Really?

No. Gavin proposed one block size increase, was shut down and compromised down to half of his original proposal, then was shut down again.
The crux of the matter is who does Bitcoin belong to.
One camp argues that it belongs to the devs and core devs, and therefore "consensus" means a consensus among them.
The other camp feels that Bitcoin belongs to anyone who uses it, in whatever capacity (devs, miners, holders, startups) and that consensus means a consensus of that larger community, and not just among the core devs.
As it turns out, the protocol bears out this latter notion of consensus, as it is up to the miners to adopt a BIP or not, then it is up to those of us who run nodes to do the same, and ultimately it is up to the community at large to decide (in an absolutely worst case scenario), to leave the Bitcoin blockchain.
Each issue is different, and each issue necessitates its own punctual consensus.
On the block-size issue, I firmly believe the limit should be raised, at a minimum, or simply dropped. I will follow the course of action that most closely aligns with that belief, provided it doesn't hurt Bitcoin in doing so. If I mine, I will mine BIP 101 (only because as of this moment it is the only other choice to "do nothing"). If I run a node, it will be XT until someone comes up with a version of Core that supports BIP 101 (again, or some other solution that lends itself to scaling). If I transact via online wallets, or deal with Bitcoin-related companies, I will do so first with those that support a block-size raise.
On the other hand, if Mike Hearn added a patch to XT that dispensed with the 21 million hard limit, for instance, I would revert to Core. I assume so would the majority of this community. But if they didn't, and for some weird reason everyone agreed to fork Bitcoin to get rid of the 21 million hard limit, I would stay on whatever chain keeps it (or exit the cryptocurrency realm altogether, or a combination of the two).
The consensus that matters is the consensus among us... this is open source, and the notion that a group of devs "owns" it is antithetical to the very idea of open source.
And as an aside, had theymos and his mods not censored the debate as heavily as they did, a host of other opportunities might have sprung up, which never had a chance to. That very well might have resulted in a better solution than BIP101 or BIP100. It still might, but in spite of the efforts to stifle the debate, not because of them.
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:27:23
It's a common mistake to think pools are homogeneous. They're not. They're made of individual miners, who decide where to point their rigs on the basis of a number of interacting criteria.

No, every day it closes the previous bids, which need to be reset. So as that process is happening, the bids will come alive one at a time.

Someone needs to explain to me the difference between a "permissioned" blockchain and a database.
"Permissioned" ledgers are a bit like the world's tallest midget. Sure, you've got the title, but no one can pick you out of a lineup.
It's a bit like saying "This Internet thing is wonderful, we really should make our own so we can control it"... it worked for AOL for a while, I guess.

Try localbitcoins.com and do a search for buyers in Argentina. Many of them will deposit directly into the bank account you tell them, and the BTC are kept in escrow until you're satisfied the transfer is complete.

@_date: 2015-09-01 19:12:58
Rubbish, and you know it.
Not denouncing the censorship while at the same time posting in favour of the established position of he who is actively engaging in censorship is very much actively supporting it. 
The ONLY reasonable reaction to the rampant censorship of the last few weeks was to come out and criticise it outright.
The next best thing would have been to distance yourself from the censorship.
Anything else is revolting.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:08:51
Something like that, yes, though the work we do is about as niche-y as it gets. I doubt it could ever really translate into a broader marketplace.
Still, now that you mention it, perhaps some enterprising soul could start an international market for workers, all based around Bitcoin... you know, go online, see who needs what kind of work done by category, do the work, get paid in BTC. Would be cool.

This issue has come under heavy censorship implies not just that the censorship is occurring, but that it may have occurred. And not incidentally that it may have occurred with the blessings and active support of some of the people whose signatures appear on that letter together with Amir's.

Let's assume for a moment I buy them with US dollars. The problem in Argentina (or any other country with capital controls) is that the government there decides what the rate of exchange for the peso should be. Unfortunately for them, it's not the real rate of exchange (what someone is willing to sell or buy pesos for). So if I sent dollars through a bank wire or transfer, the local bank in Argentina would have to convert it to pesos at the "official" exchange rate, which is 30-40 percent lower than the actual rate.

Oh, my goodness, someone can cut and paste!
The open, intelligent and uncensored debate ought to be had on the fora (that's plural for forum, btw) where the vast majority of the Bitcoin community and stakeholders gather and communicate. That is r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk.org, primarily, and not a conference in Montreal and another conference in Hong Kong. 
But no, the debate in the Bitcoin fora has been stifled and censored by mods who have supported (and been supported by) many of the signatories to the open letter.
Devs speak through their code, not through letters. This is the equivalent of a judge saying one thing in his judgements and another in an open letter. Unfortunately, him being a judge, it is the judgements that count.

Well, the evidence keeps popping up. Not all of it is confirmed, however. 
Back in 2013, the thing everyone was really looking forward to was the deal between MtGox and Coinlab, to take care of all BTC operations in the US and Canada. It would have resulted in an entity a bit like Circle and Coinbase combined, allowing North Americans to seamlessly buy, sell and transact bitcoins, as well as integrating with large companies like Amazon and so on. 
That deal fell through, pretty suddenly, when the US government seized about 5 million USD of MtGox's assets in the US. This, in turn, appears to have been what triggered Karpeles to start fractional-banking the BTC in MtGox's possession, which led to the collapse we all know about in early 2014.
It now appears that one of the rogue agents (Secret Service, apparently, not DEA) was the one who signed the asset seizure of that 5 million USD, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME he and his DEA partner were profiting left right and centre from the BTC they extorted out of Ullbricht and Silk Road.
If any of this is proven in court, there's a strong case to be made that the collapse of MtGox (and the ensuing decline in the value of BTC) are ultimately due to criminal actions by two rogue US federal agents. If that link is established, I will be fun to watch.

@_date: 2015-03-31 16:09:17
If the allegations are true, and the evidence seems to be pointing in that direction, then you're looking at rogue DEA agents having a hand in the original seizure of MtGox assets in the US, which is what appears to have precipitated its collapse. In other words, US federal agents were criminally extorting people and lining their pockets while harming Bitcoin in the process. 
The fact that they were caught thanks to the blockchain is deliciously symmetric... and should make some non-rogue government types think.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:58:33

Not necessarily. The question of decentralization, like that of competition, is itself far more complex than a simple yes or no answer. Best posting I read on that one makes the analogy to languages. In the case of languages, decentralization and competition would not be a good thing. 
The advantage of decentralization refers almost exclusively to the notion of control. It is good for a system of wealth management and distribution to have decentralized control. But it would be catastrophic, for example, for it to work with decentralized code. Can you imagine the mess?
The internet itself is a good example. Just a handful of protocols (literally no more than about four or five), but with decentralized control, have resulted in what Andreas Antonopolous very aptly calls a "dumb" network that pushes the intelligence to the periphery.
I have no qualms at all with the "language" (in this case, the Bitcoin protocol) being centralized so long as the "control" (in this case, the mining and consensus algorithms) continues to be decentralized.

Nope, because this is a protocol, not a finished experiment. As others have said, altcoins are riding on Bitcoin's coattails right now. If Bitcoin succeeds, any given altcoin may or may not make it. But if Bitcoin fails catastrophically (which is extremely unlikely at this point), then all altcoins would collapse, as the whole notion of cryptocurrency is by now tied to the idea of Bitcoin.

But the notion that a protocol (or as was so brilliantly put on this thread, a language) can benefit from diversification, is just spurious. Any protocol designed at having humans communicate with one another, be it ideas or value, gets better as more people share it, not worse.

In other words, you want the block size to be determined dynamically (much like, say, the difficulty is determined as a function of the hash rate).
It's been discussed for a long time, and I for one think this is the way it will go in the end. Everything else about Bitcoin is based on an elegant equilibrium, there's no reason the block size should be different.

There's no question that Bitcoin has value, but it isn't intrinsic, because NOTHING has intrinsic value. Value is, at best, a subjective agreement.

Hmmm... I stopped reading when he called Bitcoin a fiat currency. People really ought to educate themselves about the meaning of the words they throw about.
Then I continued reading and every single point is just a spurious - yes, most exchanges require ID, but you can also transact BTC off-exchange (and in a way that is every bit as anonymous as cash). Yes, Bitcoin is secure (exchanges have been hacked, but that would be akin to saying the dollar isn't secure because a bank was robbed). Yes, bitcoins are fungible, just like dollars, which are each stamped with a unique serial number.
Not mincemeat, not even a dent. No ouch.

I really haven't looked deep into the SecondMarket option. Maybe I should, as more and more people are asking me how to get into Bitcoin these days.
But my understanding is that the actual fund IS bitcoins. In other words, whatever money you've put in, minus the fees, gets converted into bitcoins and SecondMarket then essentially holds them for you. It's just a way for people with money who don't want to be bothered with securing wallets and cold storage to have a position in Bitcoin.

That's quite irrelevant. A fraction of the original will still be a fraction of the original. Now, it is quite possible that we'll end up subdividing each bitcoin way past the current 100,000,000th limit. But the cost of each fraction will still be the cost of each fraction of the total.

Bitcoin is a protocol... It's like asking "are there any dark sides to html?". Well, if a terrorist group puts up a website detailing how to build bombs, that's a dark side, but it isn't a dark side to html, it's just one of the dark sides of terrorism.
Bitcoin can be used for anything you can use cash, with the added advantage that you can transact it anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. That set of conditions means it can be used for good or evil, but in and of itself, it isn't a dark side.
Finally, the only way of "banning" Bitcoin is to shut down the internet... it can be done, but not easily.

Actually, Bitcoin is three (at least) things all rolled into one: A currency, a store of value and a payment system.
The problem is that we have never encountered something like this before, so people are doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to fit Bitcoin into the existing models. Some compare it to a stock (and misguidedly use phrases like "market cap"), others insist it's a payment system like PayPal or Western Union, and some firmly hold the belief that it's just a currency.
But it's one of those things that happen every now and then in our history as a species: something actually new comes along, and we don't have the words for it. Physicists are still trying to grapple with the concepts like spacetime or the particle/wave duality.
I predict economists and sociologists will spend decades trying to fit the round Bitcoin into the square pegs of currency/store of value/payment systems.

"Coinbase is a company ran by about 8 people; 10k people a day sign up for its service; this week the passed 650k active accounts.
If just 0.1% (probably a low figure if this sub is any indication) of these people sends an email each week it would be 93 emails a day. Assuming an average response/solution every 10 minutes (which is unrealistically low); it would take over 15 hours a day to do nothing but answer these emails."
And your point is? Coinbase is a company that offers a service. If they can't provide it as advertised, and that results in them holding my funds, I will send them an email. If they don't reply to my email, and they don't return my funds, I will take further action. 
The original post is about Overstock. The most recent articles mention they're trying to decide which payment processor to go with for their Bitcoin sales. My opinion is that they should go with a company that exemplifies the best in Bitcoin (BitPay) as opposed to one that exemplifies the amateurish approach so many others have taken in the past (Coinbase, MtGox and so on).

Because it's still ridiculously small. As the reward drops and the value of each Bitcoin rises, the current transaction fee (which incidentally is just a suggestion, you can change it to whatever you want) should suffice for the next few years. Eventually, when mining becomes more about the tx fee and less about the reward, that figure will be adjusted in a pretty organic way to reflect the needs of the network.

a fairly well thought out article. Unfortunately, the number of variables and assumptions is just too large to be able to reach any sort of satisfying conclusion.

You're asking two different questions. In the title line, you ask when will we see a decline in production. The answer to that is that production will stabilize around 6 blocks an hour and difficulty will increase or decrease to reach that goal. So production will decline, pretty radically, when the next reward halving happens (my money is on early to mid 2015 at this point, but we'll see).
Your second question is when will it not become worth your while. That one is unanswerable by anyone but you, and even you will have trouble with it, as the exchange rate for BTC is unpredictable. Sure, mining 0.01 BTC a week doesn't sound like much, but if each BTC is worth $190,000 then it could be quite a bit. :-)

It would be temporary bad news. If you stick around Bitcoin for a while you'll see these bad news events happen every so often... the price tumbles, sometimes quite fantastically, but it doesn't alter at all the essential qualities of Bitcoin, and the fact that it still is a really, really good idea.
It was one back in 2009, it was in 2011 after the MtGox debacle, it was in 2012 after the pirate fiasco, and it still is today, even if the news from China is true.

No, the valid chain is still churning out blocks with ALL the transactions, including those in the non-valid chain. The fork happened about 16 blocks before everything came to a stop. Another half an hour until the miners switched back to 0.7 (the big pools did it almost instantly), and right now the blockchain is processing all the transactions that went in those 16 or so blocks. It's just a matter of time, a few hours at most, until all the transactions appear in the valid chain, and then we'll all happily motor along.

Throughout history, we didn't do too badly when currencies were deflationary, and we've always dug ourselves into a deep hole when they were inflationary.
There is no problem with a deflationary currency that can be divided endlessly.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:26:38
the deflationary spiral model is a fallacy. It is based on the premise that people will ALWAYS do what's in the best interests IN THE LONG RUN.
The fact of the matter is that people will always act on an incentive, not on what they perceive to be their long term best interests.
Take the deflationary spiral and turn it inside out. The DS model says that people who own a currency that appreciates over time will never spend it, because they stand to make more money from it in the future.
Well, we all know intimately the other side of that coin, namely, things that devaluate over time. Right off the top of your head: Iphones. You know that, no matter how new and shiny your iPhone might be, there will be another one coming out in a year that will be newer, faster, shinier... maybe even cheaper. According to the DS model, people would never buy an iPhone, because the minute they do, it will start to depreciate.
But guess what, people do buy iPhones. Why? Because they want them!
So yeah, if I own bitcoins I have a real incentive to keep them, except when they come in really handy to buy something I want more... like food, airline tickets, dollars... or iPhones (all of which I have personally bought with my own BTC in the last few months, btw)

The Foundation was formed a while back (in the last year or so), supposedly to advance Bitcoin and to give a sober and professional face to the project. As part of that, it undertook to pay a salary to Gavin Andresen, one of the board members and also the lead developer of Bitcoin since Satoshi withdrew back in late 2010 or early 2011.
The recent events (which explain the price drop since then and, if you believe someone was acting with inside information, also explain the price drop before): 
I, like many others, was a member, and as such paid my dues, in BTC. The Foundation has different layers of membership, both lifetime and annual.
Why should you care about me leaving the foundation? You probably shouldn't, except if you also happen to be a member and are pissed off that one of the board members is suing another board member for 75 million dollars and in the process quite likely bringing Bitcoin down (albeit temporarily) with it. Should you care that the Bitcoin Foundation is being run by people with, to put it mildly, an unresolved conflict of interest between their goals and the Foundation's? That's up to you.

It's impossible to tell what the half life is for a bitcoin, since it's impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy how many have been lost.
A couple things are pretty certain, though:
1) As BTC rises in value, people will take greater care of the bitcoins they own. Also, bitcoins can be backed up more easily now than they were in the early days. So the rate of attrition is likely to decline over time.
2) Ultimately, it's not that significant an issue. Each bitcoin is divisible to the eighth decimal place. But that's just an agreement established in the protocol. If there was only one bitcoin left, it would be (reasonably) simple to make it divisible to the 16th decimal place, and just keep churning along.

The notion that the "big government" is out to try to regulate Bitcoin (and will obviously fail at it), is one held mostly by old-time bitcoiners. Three or so years of constantly repeating the same mantra has led some to actually believe it. All that is happening is that some levels of government, in some countries, are finally coming in contact with this idea called Bitcoin, and they're doing the only thing governments can do: look into it.
In and of itself, this is neither good nor bad, though on balance I would tend to fall on the side of good. Governments are typically not bright, because they're run by committee and that averages out the intelligence of their actions, but by the same token they're not typically stupid either. Everyone knows what has happened with previous attempts at regulating p2p networks, and nobody wants to end up with egg on their face.
My prediction, these inquiries will conclude that while Bitcoin itself is above regulation (just like the US cannot regulate the British Pound, for example), the trading and exchange of derivatives from Bitcoin can very much be regulated. And so it should be, to prevent thefts and fraud. In the end, this will be a positive.

The number of BTC on the MtGox order book is NOT the number of BTC available. As the buying has progressed, more and more BTC have crawled out of the woodwork, so to speak. People either have their BTC sitting on their MtGox account and not putting them up for sale, or they have them off site, but can send them to MtGox (or any other exchange) in a matter of minutes. If you check the actual amount of BTC sold in the last few weeks, versus what appeared on the order book a few weeks ago, you'll see there's a huge difference.
There are almost 11 million BTC out there right now. If someone wants to buy 680k USD of it, and they do it just a bit carefully, it shouldn't drive the market up so much. It might, but it won't necessarily.

Bitcoin being overvalued is an irrelevant point. Inasmuch as it works on a free market, the value for one bitcoin is what it is.
My problem is that you cannot be the board member of the Bitcoin Foundation and at the same time pull a stunt like this, in this way, with this timing and, arguably, with the kind of access to inside information that would explain a lot about what has happened in the last week to ten days.

My guess is that transactions will fall into three categories: small, medium and large. When all is said and done, it will be great to have 3rd party services for the medium level. If you own a variety store and someone wants to buy a coke with BTC, you're likely ok to accept them with no confirmations, because chances of someone trying to pull off a 51% attack for the price of a can of coke will be negligible. On the other hand, if you want to transfer enough BTC to buy a car, you can do it yourself and both parties can easily wait for six confirmations... they'll happen while you're signing the paperwork anyway. 
For the medium sized transactions, that's where we'll likely see the 3rd parties shine.

Best explanation I've seen is that if someone sits at a computer, doesn't know your name or your bank, and starts typing (or gets a bot to type) all possible combinations of names and passwords on all possible bank websites, he has a better chance of getting into your bank account than he does of a Bitcoin address collision.

This argument has been made several times, both on reddit and bitcointalk. The premise on which it's based, however, is false. The assumption is that a few people own a lot of bitcoins. But there's no amount of forensic work that can lead to that conclusion.
A few *wallets* hold a lot of bitcoins. But one person can have multiple wallets, and one wallet can represent the bitcoins owned by many people (think about the cold storage wallet controlled by MtGox, for example).
There have been many instances of large dumps of bitcoins into the market in the last few years, some of them with the obvious intent of diluting the supply and lowering the price. But they have been less common (because once you've dumped 40K bitcoins you have 40K fewer bitcoins to dump next time) and the price has kept on rising.

BTC isn't just a currency, it's a "commodency" if you will. It's a currency in some ways (and certainly was designed to be one), but because it also does things that no other currency can do in its native format, it can be a commodity. As such, of course one can invest in BTC, with the expectation that its price will rise against the price of fiat currencies.
So the question then becomes, what's likely to happen to the price of BTC if it becomes (more) widely adopted, and where are we now in the adoption curve.
I remember vividly people saying they couldn't buy BTC at 1 USD, because it was overpriced. They were waiting for the price to go down a bit.

The easiest way to get bitcoins, if you're going to be in a park filled with people willing to sell bitcoins for cash, is to create a wallet with either Blockchain.info or Inputs.io on your smartphone (possibly on the bus during the ride to the park, or even at the park) then buy the BTC for cash and have them transferred to the wallet. If the seller also has an account with inputs.io the transfer is instantaneous and the whole thing should take as long as it takes to take the cash, scan a QR code and push a button... probably under 10 seconds.

Yes, the blockchain stores every single transaction going all the way back to the first, and yes, every node in the network holds a complete copy of the blockchain (in fact, they all have to agree with each other, otherwise you'd have a fork). There have been some ideas regarding this, including the notion that, say, all the blocks older than a certain amount of time should be considered "clean" and could be erased, or consolidated into a smaller packet of data. Another option is to eventually have two different types of clients, one that keeps the whole blockchain (which would be run by the miners, the large exchanges and anyone else who doesn't care about storage space) and thinner clients that would only hold transactions younger than a given amount of time.
But no, nothing will ever be forgotten.

Possibly, but you don't really need it for two reasons:
1) The transfer is, for all practical purposes, irreversible right from the start. One confirmation makes it much more solid, two or three makes it all but impossible to double spend. Really, unless you're transferring a large sum, the confirmations aren't all that necessary. But, more importantly...
2) Any transfer within systems such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info, inputs.io or any new ones that might pop up is instantaneous already. These are processed off-blockchain, which means you don't really need to wait for confirmations at all. Now, clearly I'm not advocating keeping all your bitcoins in an online wallet, but you could keep your "spending money" on one of them, and your "savings" either on your own computer or in cold storage. Then when you make a payment, you do from your online wallet, and once a day or once a week you replenish it as needed.

If the merchant receives bitcoins, then sells it right after the price has dipped, then he'll lose money.
If he sells through BitPay, Coinbase or a service like it, where the BTC is automatically converted to fiat, he loses nothing.

If he sells for fiat and holds it, he loses.

It's most likely not stuck, just downloading the entire blockchain, which can take quite a while (many hours over a reasonably fast connection).
Don't panic. Whatever transactions you've made are still on the blockchain. Even if your client is stuck, the transactions are still there. If you have the addresses involved in those transactions you can confirm them by going to blockchain.info.
Once the client has finished syncing up to the whole chain, you'll see the bitcoins just where you expect them.

No worries. With regards to number 2, you can make digital backups of a wallet and put them in a microSD drive, which will fit quite nicely in your actual, physical wallet. It may seem like that's carrying a huge amount of wealth in your pocket, but if your wallet is encrypted, even if the drive got stolen, you'd be fine. It's more like carrying backups of your wealth in your pocket.
As for why I think the US government might be warming up to Bitcoin, since the Shumer affair of 2011 there has been a series of signals coming from the administration (most notably, the FinCen rules and even yesterday, as part of the Silk Road bust, the fact that the FBI claim specifically said bitcoins aren't illegal in and of themselves). You have to figure someone in the US government is keeping an eye on what other jurisdictions are doing, from the open friendliness towards BTC in places like Germany, to the obvious, tacit approval in places like China. What's the US going to do, be the only jurisdiction in the world to duck and roll? It would be like a country wilfully choosing to stay out of the internet in 1992.

Actually, no. There has been a growing number of cases in which there are unexplained delays in the ACH transfers from Coinbase to the bank. I'm actually sitting on one right now that is about two weeks late.
Coinbase is apologising (when they reply to a support email, which is usually days late, if at all), but the funds are still not there.
That being said, until this happened, I had only had positive experiences with them. I'm hoping I'll be able to chalk this one up to growing pains and move on. But right now, to put it charitably, my money is in limbo.

blockchain.info, coinbase and inputs.io are the three that I use. The caveat? I keep a really tiny amount in each... most of my BTC are in cold storage, some more in my own wallets.
The reason for keeping some in online wallets is that in some cases it allows for really fast transfers.
It's generally best not to use an online wallet, but if you're going to use one, those three are (to my understanding) the most secure.

Initially, I didn't get the sense that the goal of the Foundation was to centralise or subvert Bitcoin. Those of us who have been involved with Bitcoin for a while (or even those who are new to it) realise there was a serious PR problem in the making. It seemed to me that the Foundation's goals were to address it, as well as to establish a fund from which to pay Gavin for his efforts. I agreed with both these premises at the time, hence became a member.
Since then, it seems the Foundation has done very little. It's organising a convention on May 17th, which could be a good and positive step forward. But there is a tremendous conflict of interest when the top principals in the Foundation are businesses whose primary goal is not the advancement of Bitcoin, but their own. Often these two should be aligned, sometimes (like now) they are decidedly not. 
The right thing to do, if one is a board member and knows he's about to sue another board member for 75 million dollars (with its concomitant effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem), would have been to resign as board member first, then do that.
Could there be a Bitcoin Foundation that was a friend of Bitcoin? Yes, of course. In its present iteration, however, I tend to agree that it's more like an enemy, or at least a large ballast hanging from Bitcoin's neck.

1. People can already sell things for yuan (or USD) in China.
2. BitPay (or an equivalent, even a Chinese equivalent for that matter, say BTCChina, if they're ambitious), can deal with the conversion so that the businesses are actually selling their goods for yuan or USD, while the middleman handles the Bitcoin backend... pretty much what BitPay, BIPS, Coinbase and so on already do for thousands of existing merchants.
3. This guidance from the PBOC provides clarity, and specifically allows for Chinese citizens to buy and sell BTC as a virtual commodity (which is all they were ever doing to begin with).
Clarity is good. Allowing is good. You can try as hard as you can to squeeze a bad out of this one, but it won't happen.

If you spend an entire lifetime convincing people that money (i.e. fiat money) is a tangible, real thing. If you tell them over and over about the "value of the dollar", while all the time making that same dollar less valuable (but gradually, so they don't really notice). If you bombard them with advertising to spend money they don't own (credit) and then scare the living daylights out of them with phrases like "debt crisis", then money essentially becomes a religion, people like Paul Krugman become its apostles, and bankers turn into the church hierarchy. 
And religion has never really been a great fan of reason, has it?

OK, I'll take a shot.
1) Go to Virwox, open an account, buy Second Life Linden dollars with a credit card or paypal, convert the SLL into bitcoins, withdraw the bitcoins. Once you get the hang of it, you can do it in under a minute. You're paying through the nose in fees, but if you really don't want to wire money, or buy them through other means (in Canada you can fund the exchanges through online banking, for example), then the Virwox route will work easily.
2) What are you not afraid of losing? Your keys? Your books? Your baseball bat? Whatever it is you're not afraid of losing, print out a paper wallet and stick it to it! Problem solved.
3) To a large extent, what your government (any government) thinks of Bitcoin is irrelevant. The US government may try to restrict transactions or exchanges, though it's looking more and more like they won't. But other jurisdictions have already come out in public saying there's nothing wrong with Bitcoin (Germany, Finland, Belgium, to an extent Canada). It's a big world, Bitcoin will continue regardless of what the US says or thinks. Again, it's looking more and more like the US government is warming up to it, though.
4) How well do you understand quantum physics? When did that stop you from watching TV?
5) Big risk equals big potential rewards. You can always stick it out for the next few years and wait until Bitcoin is much more established, but then you'll be spending more "real money" to buy even fewer bitcoins. Your choice... and your wife's :-)

I'd be interested to hear from the devs as to whether this attack could be detected, and if so at what stage. But I agree, this isn't the kind of thing someone would do if they wanted to make money from it... as to a government trying to destabilise Bitcoin, they could do that a lot more easily by buy tens of thousands of BTC then dumping them all over the place, then having pseudo-journalists write articles about how a currency needs stability and consequently Bitcoin will never work as a currency.
Oh, hang on a minute :-)
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:17:17
Here's the conundrum the Chinese government faces: 
1) They need to keep their currency artificially devalued, or else their industrial sector will implode.
2) They need a currency with which to deal with the rest of the world when it comes to things like food, oil and other natural resources.
3) They need to make sure the US dollar doesn't collapse, since they hold much of the US debt and the US is such a large market for their goods, but at the same time, they don't want to buttress it too much.
Until now, they've been playing the game with gold, buying bullion like it's going out of style. It's understandable, given the shakiness of the US economy. But if they threw their weight in behind Bitcoin, as an alternative reserve currency, they could effectively use bitcoins and USD as "relief valves" for each other, shifting between the two as they see fit.
I highly doubt the Chinese government is not aware of the existence of Bitcoin, or of the multiple exchanges that are operating right now within Chinese borders. So either they're dismissing it as monopoly money, or someone, somewhere in the hierarchy, has decided that keeping the Bitcoin door open, for now, is a good idea.

it's a good argument.
My essential problem with the bubble theories of people like Schiff is that they're essentially unfalsifiable. Their theory is that Bitcoin is a bubble because the value is increasing, and that it will continue to be one even as the value continues to increase, because it's a bubble. The argument is pretty circular.
If someone like Schiff or Joe Weisenthal were to say "Bitcoin is a bubble, it will climb to XXX and then it will drop to zero, and this will happen by this day", then it would be fairly simple to prove them right or wrong.
But ever since Karl Popper we've known that unfalsifiable theories are just not very good theories.
By contrast, the theory held by those of us who have predicted Bitcoin's success appears to be unfolding roughly as predicted. It goes like this: Bitcoin will grow, the growth will come in spurts, it will go through surges and crashes often associated with hacks or attacks on the periphery of the Bitcoin environment, but after each attack it will return stronger than it was before. While the valuation is remarkably difficult to figure out, somewhere between 10,000 USD and 100,000 USD (in today's dollars) isn't out of the question. The period for reaching that valuation is in the order of years, with perhaps a decade to reach its full potential. Yes, there is a chance of the value dropping to zero, but the likelihood of it is inversely proportional to the number of days or months that have gone by since the genesis block was created.
There, that's a theory that can be falsified... now let's all sit back and wait and revisit this issue in about five years or so :-)

Each of the so called "paradoxes" is based on at least one, and often more than one, faulty premise.
Again, it is a failure of the imagination, as these are only paradoxes when examined through the crucially limited lens if the current system (be it economic, financial or political).
The fact is paradoxes are only apparently so, except in the realm of metaphysics. So, as an example, in your first "paradox", the false premise is that for Bitcoin to thrive it must not become a store of value. The premise is both false (Bitcoin could easily thrive as just a store of value) and limited (in the Bitcoin environment, a store of value isn't the same as in the current banking system, and new processes are being created almost every week to lubricate the relationship between store of value, currency, credit, asset and payment).
Never forget that the universe is what it is. If we discover a paradox, chances are we, and not it, is using a limited imagination.

It is true that in some countries anything that isn't specifically allowed is illegal. However, in those same countries, things that are illegal typically happen all the time, mostly with the government turning a blind eye to them.
I'm sure prostitution is also illegal in Thailand.

The answer is that while it's true there is a speculative component to Bitcoin, the same can be said for any other new technology when it first appears. Arguably, there was a speculative bubble surrounding Microsoft all through the 90's. That doesn't mean Microsoft didn't achieve the goals it set out to achieve, or that it didn't change the world... what value people assign to a technology is quite independent from whether it succeeds or fails as a technology. And it should always be remembered that Bitcoin is, above all, a new technology.

Nope. They do developing work, but any change in the actual protocol requires the consensus among the miners.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:27:14
The article just states that a certain number of Bitcoins were "collected" (whatever that means) by SR. Since most bitcoins were mined in the early days, and the value of them was less that one ten thousandth of what it is today, it stands to reason that in those early days upwards of 9 million BTC would've been transacted (at 10,000 BTC for a pizza, you'd reach 9 million fairly quickly as well).
But SR's relative importance to the Bitcoin economy has been in rapid and steady decline since 2010/2011. Today, the analogy between SR and seven times the economic impact of Exxon is factually wrong, and generally laughable.
SR is nowhere near the equivalent of Exxon times seven. And the fact that even in their warrant the FBI takes the time and effort to declare Bitcoin not illegal in and of itself, but simply as a ways for illegal transactions (much like the US dollar), makes the shut down of SR, if it ever comes about, positive news for Bitcoin.

Of all the explanations I've heard about the uncrackability of Bitcoin, this is the one that sticks with me the most.
If you sat at a computer, opened the website portal for any bank, and started entering random usernames and passwords, you'd stand a better chance of accessing someone's bank account than of cracking a single Bitcoin address.
Since at this time there's a lot more money sitting in bank accounts than Bitcoin, it would make sense to start there instead :-)
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:54:08
It goes down because someone wants it to go down. Really, it's that simple. Back in 2011, with Bitcoinica letting people short Bitcoin, it went down whenever someone who owned a lot of BTC wanted to make money shorting. Today it's something similar, except the stakes are now ten to twenty times higher.
Trying to predict the day to day, or month to month, fluctuations in this market is just insane. There are enough people with enough Bitcoin to be able to manipulate it either way right now. Over time, that will change, but it will take a lot more distribution of the coins that are available and at least ten times the amount of fiat coming in.

Because pegging a currency to another currency has never worked, nor will it ever work. Bitcoin has an enormous first mover advantage over the others. So far, Litecoin has managed to remain afloat primarily because the majority of the exchanges that even consider trading LTC do so exclusively as an LTC/BTC pairing. The moment most exchanges start trading Litecoin for fiat, LTC will have to sink or swim on its own, and with the momentum Bitcoin is picking up, Litecoin will never be able to catch up.
The other side of that equation is Ripple, which is being sold as a viable alternative, until you dig just ever so slightly under the surface and realise that it is a system based on trust. On trust! The point of it is that the value ripples through the system... unfortunately, it won't be long until they see that the scams also will ripple through the system.
Nothing out there comes close to the elegance with which Bitcoin has solved the cryptocurrency issue. In the end, elegance will win out over the rest :-)

why on earth would they hate it? Bitcoin is the ideal vehicle for the Chinese government. It would allow them to keep their own domestic currency deflated artificially, while at the same time transacting across borders with other countries via a hard currency that isn't the US dollar.
Heck, they have enough clout to push for BTC to be at least another reserve currency, if not the only one.

No, what I'm saying is they can't shut it down, which strictly speaking is what you were asking.
They can make things difficult, just like they do for drugs, illegal downloads and so on. They can go after the exchanges, or impose ridiculous criteria on Bitcoin businesses. Hell, they can declare all BTC transactions illegal even (although China would probably not give a damn).

And who exactly is dismissing it without due consideration. My understanding from the Forbes article is that Gavin and the top devs have read the damn paper, are giving it due consideration, and do not consider it to be critical. There's a wide gap between immaterial and critical, and this issue appears to fall somewhere in between.
The length of time someone's been working in a related field is largely irrelevant, though their actual expertise may not be.
Finally, I have been working in the field of communications since before most people on this reddit were born, and I can assure you the method in which this issue has seen the (recent) light relates more to someone's idea of their own importance and less to their genuine concern fir the welfare of this technology. Had the latter been the case, a quick email to the devs would have been many orders of magnitude more productive.

You're right, what could Bitcoin possibly have to offer to a country that is starving for an uncounterfeitable reserve of value to such a degree it is buying up gold in unprecedented amounts? A country desperate to divest itself of increasingly fragile USD in exchange for a hard currency with which to trade with the rest of the world (a currency that is already accepted as legal within the European Union), allowing it to set the rates of its own domestic currency even lower than it is right now, and keep their manufacturing sector pushing their economy forward?

Bitcoin is a currency, a commodity and a payment processor, all rolled into one. It's not a stock, it's a technology. So the People's Bank of China has an issue with Bitcoin as a currency in China, but not with Bitcoin as a commodity... that's good news.
It's also good news because it allows other jurisdictions (notably the US, Europe and, perhaps most importantly, India) to position themselves differently to China.
Nobody was selling goods for Bitcoin in China until yesterday... and guess what, if the Chinese want to start selling their goods for Bitcoin, they can easily do so as soon as BitPay moves in (or all4btc, snapcard or their equivalents).
In the meantime, all China has said is "if you're an exchange, you have to register", which is not only sensible, but is actually easier than in the US, where exchanges have to register with each and every state separately.

Underpinning the value of Bitcoin is the fact that people will always need a method for transferring value that does not involve carrying a goat to the market. That method should be as efficient and frictionless as possible, it should make use of the greatest achievement of mankind when it comes to transmitting information around the planet (the internet) to make the transactions smooth and quick. It should be uncounterfeitable, by smart use of top of the line cryptoghraphy the likes of which didn't even exist prior to a few decades ago. It should be immune to external pressures, most notably from governments who want to tamper with the value for short term political gain. It should be verifiable and predictable.
Sounds familiar? No? Then stick to gold and fiat.

We don't know who screwed whom, and likely won't know until all the evidence is in. But even if the allegations made by Coinlab are true, there are other ways of dealing with this (provided your goal is the advancement of Bitcoin). 
Obviously, if your only concern is your own interests, then you are free to sue whoever you think has wronged you, but when that action has a direct negative impact on Bitcoin itself, you cannot at the same time remain a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation.

I'd go the SecondMarket route for that kind of money. If he's feeling adventurous and has a bit of time, he can spread the money evenly over three of four exchanges and over a few weeks. But if he wants it all at once, SecondMarket is probably best.

I thought blockchain did... my mistake. But at any rate, the premise stands. You can even use a wallet with Mtgox, Bitstamp of BTC-e to do off chain transactions... just don't keep any significant amount of BTC in them.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:59:43
they sold for higher, and didn't withdraw their CNY, which are still sitting there. So they're now buying up the BTC for lower than they sold.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:38:54
Precisely. I actually do honestly like Coinbase, I had very high hopes for them. If they only came through with honest, timely answers, then I could still have a lot of respect for them. But this habit by Bitcoin operators to just ignore their customers (Coinbase, MtGox, Bitfloor, et al) is getting really old, really fast. It is ridiculously unprofessional, and inspires zero confidence, which is not good in - or for - the Bitcoin environment.
I just wish BitPay stepped into their niche.

The deflationary argument has been made many times, and has been debunked about as many. At its core, it goes something like this: You cannot have a deflationary currency because people would rather hoard it than spend it.
The problem with that argument is that there are plenty of examples in the real world that show it's incorrect. For instance, you have a great analogy in the technology world. We all know that our fiat currency is deflationary with respect to technology (technology gets cheaper over time, our currency gets more valuable, in relative terms). So why is it that people spend their money on an iPhone today, knowing full well there will be an iPhone 2 in a few months, and then an iPhone 3, and then a 4 and a 5? The answer is simple... they want the iPhone.
People will spend Bitcoins, and not hoard them, when they have an incentive to do so. Even the most bullish among us have spent our bitcoins at times, because we needed to or because we really wanted to get whatever the bitcoins could buy.
There's no real world problem with a deflationary currency, just like there's not problem on paper with an inflationary one, but in the real world the inflationary currency ultimately means the rich get richer (because they have the means to offset the inflation) and the poor get poorer (because they don't).

A government need not endorse Bitcoin as a currency, but still endorse it as a store of value (if I were a betting man, I'd bet this is the direction China is headed)
Government endorsement isn't a necessary condition for Bitcoin adoption, however. And in some countries, it would be to bitcoin's detriment if it were endorsed by the government.

Yeah, except BTC actually are traded for their market price, which makes the calculation of the BTC volume honest. 
Altcoins are traded for BTC (with very few actually traded for fiat at their "market price") making that calculation dishonest.
It's like Ripple claiming it has a market cap of billions. Yes, they have zillions of XRP, and a few of them are actually traded for a certain amount of USD or other fiat, but the extrapolation from one to the other is utterly dishonest.

The developer team itself is pretty decentralised, there are Bitcoin devs all over the world, and often disagree on certain aspects of the software and which direction it should move in.
More importantly, they're just that, developers. The adoption of the software changes is really in the hands of the Bitcoin community itself, specifically the miners. If you convince 51% of them to move in a certain direction, that's where Bitcoin is headed. As you can guess, the miners are even more decentralised than the developers.
Finally, Bitcoin is open source, which means those who know how to do it can go through it with a fine tooth comb and will detect any attempts at foul play on the part of the evil developers.

Erik Vorhees put it best (and I'm paraphrasing here a bit): When I see what Bitcoin can do to change the legacy banking and financial system, I'm inspired. When I hear what the alt-coins can do to change Bitcoin, I yawn.

In the context of this question, "risk" can only possibly mean a situation in which bitcoins lose their value but litecoins do not.

Absolutely nothing... though what exactly you would do with the USD at MtGox then is anyone's guess. You'd probably end up buying BTC again (likely at a higher price) and moving it some place where you can sell it and get back your USD... like, say, Coinbase!

On one level I agree with you completely. But it's also hard to call it just a currency. I like to think of Bitcoin as analogous to the particle/wave duality in physics. It's a currency that behaves like a commodity, or a commodity that behaves like a currency (or like a payment processor at times), but we only call it those things because our language is somewhat limited. In reality, Bitcoin could be something deeper than both (a transferable value asset mechanism? whatever), but we're stuck with the terms currency and commodity.

The false premise of this article is pretty clearly spelled out in its opening paragraph: "Bob Murphy correctly described a bubble as when people are buying thing X, not because they have any use for it, but because they expect to make a killing buying it now and then selling it someday at a huge profit. They buy it not to use, but as a gamble."
Well, no. People buy what they buy for a host of reasons, and for blended reasons. There are countless examples of purchases that are made for partial reasons (I may buy a painting because I want to hang it on my wall, but also because it may appreciate in value over time).
The fact is, the writer is lumping into the same sack those who truly have bought bitcoins solely for its quick, short term profit potential, with those (the absolute majority, if years of reading this and other fora are anything to go by), who have bought bitcoins for its long term potential, not just for profit, but as a viable value store and transfer mechanism the likes of which humanity has never seen.
In other words, yes, there are short term speculators. They will buy, they will sell, they will do whatever they want to do. That's gambling.
But there is an enormous contingent of bitcoin users, who not only use it today for purchases and money transfers, but who are counting on its FUTURE use as a currency, value store and transfer mechanism.
A lot more than 3%
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:40:36
It takes a few days for people to transfer money into the exchanges... that being said, volatile price is volatile. It probably has more to do with someone selling or buying large amounts to try and manipulate the market (or buy themselves a nice Lamborghini) than with any news.

No, if they are integrated, then Coinbase has already verified your coins when you first transferred them to Coinbase. So there's no need for confirmation when they move from Coinbase to Gyft... it's an off-blockchain transaction.
Not sure if the integration is with Coinbase, though. I just vaguely remember something about Gyft being integrated like that with someone, in such a way that if you already had an online wallet (with whoever it is) then the transaction to Gyft is off the blockchain and requires no confirmation time.

There have been many ideas proposed for dealing with the size of the blockchain *if* it ever became a problem. Personally, I doubt it ever will become such an unmanageable problem (and if you don't want to deal with the blockchain, just use a thin client).
Block size will more likely become and issue, and even then there are at least two or three ways of dealing with it.
