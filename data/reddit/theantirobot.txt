Don't forget social security, more than 10% more if you count both the required employee and employer contributions.

Yeah ok I think you are right, except we should change it to this:
"here are the conditions for living on this plantation. I will feed you and shelter you. In return you will do the manual labor I demand. If you do not prefer this, then please find somewhere else to live.  And also a bunch of people you have nothing to do with can change this agreement at any time."

For most of the nation's history there was no income tax, yet there were still roads and schools.  Is it not possible that government could be an effective venue for *voluntary* cooperation?

It's pretty shitty that some people object to criticizing the government.  The country would be a bad place if that were the norm.  Luckily people like you are an extreme minority.  You might find solace in a larger community in a country like North Korea.

Using that same line of reasoning, it is hypocritical for a slave to complain about not being free because the slave is benefiting from the master providing food and shelter.

Tell me more about what I know. Everyone has a right to speak out against policies they don't agree with.  The fact that some money the government takes from me is used to subsidize things I use in no way precludes or diminishes my right to object to my money being taken in the first place.

Juries can judge the law as well as the defendant.

If only there were some other way to know where you are when you are in a tunnel or a station, some kind of identifying feature, maybe a landmark, a building, or geographic feature.

I was actually being facetious.  Of course the conductor knows exactly where they are when they are in a station or a tunnel.  Just like you know what stop your at on a subway.
