I sold a set of RepRap parts for bitcoins last year, and I don't think I was the first either.

The most intelligent article I've read about the value of Bitcoin frames it in terms of the [Byzantine General's Problem](
Basically, the timed consensus based nature of the network is inherently valuable in that it provides a reliable, secure, decentralized way of synchronizing a large set of data (money) among peers.

Or better yet, a fixed fee like most electronic exchanges.  Or even better than that, the lesser of 0.6% and a fixed fee, to make small trades possible.

I assume the vast majority of hashing is from people running on GPU's, so it'll likely stabilize at around the break even point of the cost of electricity to run an ATI to hash.  Of course, that also varies based on the BTC/USD exchange rate.

The 32UC3 doesn't do USB High Speed.  That FTDI part is an FT232H, which can hit upwards of 40 MBytes/s when operating in synchronous FIFO mode.  It is also fairly inexpensive.  It's possible that the FT232H and 32UC3 cost less than just going with an ARM microcontroller with USB HS plus a ULPI PHY, but it is more likely that it was just for convenience of development.
In either case, the price of the potentially redundant part is vanishingly small compared to the cost of any delay shipping the product due to increased engineering time.
