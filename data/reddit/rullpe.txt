I think Coinbase recognise them. Samourai Wallet also handles this type of address.

Then I though that I could have tested migrating a testnet node but anyway, for now everything working as expected!

I have paired the HC1 with an SSD. The increase from 1GB on RAM to 2GB on RAM makes it very unlikely to use the swap at least for now. Much faster and very responsive.

To clarify, I didn't try to use "lncli create" with the old seed. I assume that this is for on chain-not in a channel-bitcoin. But it is an assumption and didn't tried.

I suppose that it is quite problematic to connect both at the same time...

My view is that, in order to be secure, Bitcoin  needs to consume a lot of energy. If for whatever reason bitcoin ends up consuming the equivalent of a nuclear plant (far less than it's consuming right now), the cost for attacking the network is that, another nuclear plant. This is too cheap. So the amount of energy used for mining has to be huge if bitcoin is to be secure.
On the other hand, the protocol doesn't makes a distinction if the energy is wasted or re-used and it doesn't matter in fact. The security of bitcoin is showing proof that you have used electrical energy to generate heat, an irreveesible thermodynamic process.
Right now all heat is wasted, but if a bunch of bitcoin users use mining equipment let's say to heat their homes or generate hot water, the energy is not wasted. The electricity is used both for heating and securing the network. 
The silly argument about bitcoin waste becomes then busted, those bitcoin users will use electricity anyway to heat their homes.
Miner obsolescence velocity is reducing as we approach Moore's law. This new generation of mining equipment at 7nm could last several years, more than enough to payback the investment for a miner for heating. 
If  a lot of people do that, of course the profitability is reduced. For people that heat their homes, it doesn't matter as long as they get back a fraction of the energy costs that they are using for heating. On the other hand, if profitability goes below the cost of energy around 0.07€/kWh, the big operators of mining will stop wasting energy because they doesn't even get back what the energy costs, and they will prefer to sell the energy (if they generate their own electricity) to the grid, which will sell it to people using mining for heating pourposes.

At the end, the more power is spent in bitcoin (doesn't matter if it is for heating, for agriculture, or from PV surplus) the more the network is secure against attacks. The market will decide how mining is used.
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:50:10
Yeah. Definitely. Don't worry you made the right choice. I have seen geothermal heat pumps payback in 2 years but for hotels and big consumers.
For PV solar, I also bet that your roof has a rather vertical angle, which is great for winter electricity production. 
And you know, if the electricity company does not pay you back the energy surplus feed to the grid (it happens in Spain by law), you can use a miner to get a little bit of money from your energy surplus and reduce the payback of your PV installation. And you will be helping the bitcoin network  with renewable energy!

Correct me if I am wrong, but I think you cannot use it over the internet, only on LAN. In case you want to use it over the internet, you have to go through a VPN.

They will overspend if there is an additional benefit. If not, they will loose money. 
For example, imagine that electricity costs in that region is 0.1€/kWh. The mining reward is 0.07€/kWh. So you loose 0.03€ for each kWh spent in mining. A simple miner will lose money so he will simply  stop mining if he is smart. A miner that uses the heat for his home is paying in reality 0.03€ for each kWh of heat(cost minus mining reward). Using a simple heater, the heat costs 0.1€/kWh because you only gets hear. he is loosing money from a miner perspective, but he is getting cheap heat because of the reward. So he uses the miner only for heating. 
Let's imagine that someone is even smarter and he generates hot water for the shower with a miner. He is willing to increase the total hashrate. If everyone is doing the same, the reward will lower, maybe to 0.05€/kWh. It is still useful to use it as a heater, but maybe other parts of the world will stop their operations due to the increase of difficulty.

You are damn right. It won't happen if miners keep being upgraded each 6 months. But take into account that the new generation of miners is 7nm! Moore's law is at its limits. Maybe this generation won't be upgraded for 3-4 years. More than enough to payback the cost for the miner. But this is unknown!
The noise is not that problematic. It hasn't been taken care of because there is no demand from now. You could use liquid cooling, for example.

That! The thing is that I think nobody will be able to count how many transactions are occuring, which is great by the way. Some routing nodes will make public their statistics but it will be only a part of the network (tiny part of the network if it ends up being decentralized). Either way, we can increase as much as we want the lightning network transactions without incresing the use of energy of Bitcoin.
I wonder if with Schnorr Signatures we will be able to open several channels on the same transaction with only one signature.
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:27:57
Hehehe how can they include lightning network transactions if it is not possible to know how many transaction are taking place in any moment? Only you, the recipient and the routing nodes on the path know only you are making a transaction. And the cost of each transaction is insignificant in terms of Wh. Bitcoin transaction on the Blockchain are not the only transactions taking place.

I feel that I am too optimistic. Maybe the most economic and only use will be to mine from coal, and that's it... I hope not...
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:18:43
Don't get me wrong! For me it is not wasted, it is far well spent right now. Having a robust and resilient network against attacks is priceless and maybe you are right in that it won't be used for heating. 
On the other hand, I don't follow your reasoning. The more miners mine, the less reward for each kWh spent (due to difficulty adjustment and constant global mining reward).
 If the reward gets lower than the cost of the energy in a given mining farm that does not profit from waste heat, that farm will stop mining, simply because it is cheaper to buy directly than paying for electricity and then get a lower reward.   At the end, only the ones that use the heat anyways can afford to loss money on mining because they get "free" heat.
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:10:54
Yes. But it will be more decentralised, because that firm will have to spent more power than the sum of: their competitors, people that use it for heating, carmakers that use them to dry the painting line, people that use the surplus from PV that is not used anyway because batteries are full (and they are isolated from the grid), mining farms with access to very cheap electricity, etc etc.
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:24:49
You are right in that the more side-uses to mining are found, the more energy bitcoin will use, because more people will be willing to run miners at a loss and difficulty will be higher. This is also inevitable as it is a market. Those not willing to take side-benefits, will loose more money.
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:50:57
Wooh, that's great! Thanks! Okay, right now we could get a fair fee reduction by batching, but with schnorr is going to be more interesting! Can't wait!
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:38:09
And also the fact that the cost of energy from renewable sources such as PV keeps dropping. Finally, the heat from mining should be recycled. It would be great to see an school heated by mining equipment, it won't be such a waste of energy in that situation.

I am with you! it shoud never be done. It is better to do everything else. Yet most people has an electric heater for domestic hot water. What do you use to generate domestic hot water? 
What do you use for your heating? natural gas? fuel? they have global warming potential. Do you use a heat pump? great if you are in locations over 0ºC, but below 0ºC the COP is nearly 1 and it is like using a heater. Do you use solar thermal? great! good luck getting something when there is no sun for 10 days in locations like Oslo. There will be better solutions? of course, but maybe a miner will end up costing a little bit more than a heater and people who cannot afford a geothermal heat pump or a solar concentrator, will keep buying electric heaters or burning fossil fuels, which is bad for the environment.
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:00:34
That's great! it is a good system. Do you know the thermal power? You could also assist yout heat pump with PV!
Solar in Oslo seems difficult. It was an example, but if this [weather]( is true, it had 25 hours of Sunlight during December, you won't heat any home, impossible. We have to admit that the only feasible way is geothermal heat pumps, but let's face it... they are expensive... but I think it is the best way to generate heat in cold climates.
And you know? The COP of a geothermal heat pump is maybe 4-5 (you get 5 units of thermal energy for every unit of electricity spent, which is like magic!). With the electricity price of 0.1€/kWh, your thermal kWh costs 0.02€ (very cheap heat!). Do you know how much does it cost a kWh of heat with an Antminer S9 after getting the mining reward? approximately 0.02€, (the mining reward is 0.08€/kWh right now), which shows that economically, an Antminer S9 is as efficient as a geothermal heat pump. Of course, it won't be true in 3-4 months and your geothermal heat pump will last several decades, so you are very good with your system!

This is a very good guide! Thanks a lot Stadicus!
 I've tried to run an lnd node on a virtual Machine, just to try it out. I haven't been able to run LND on the non-sudo bitcoin user. An error appears: "unable to open channeldb: invalid argument". And then LND shuts down. I have tried to install it from the official guide (installing Go and building it), but I also get same error. From the admin user, I am able to run LND with RPC communication with the bitcoind service running on the non-sudo bitcoin user. Anyone has the same problem? I suppose that the advantage of using a non-sudo user for both bitcoind and lnd are security aspects.
