Great website. Look at the articles on the right hand side...sheesh...

Good way to show you have zero clue what you are talking about. Impressive

That’s it? You are not going to engage any points I made, but dismiss my post, seeing from your patronizing tone, as one made by an obvious BCH shill (that is what I assume at least..)? 
That is just unfortunate. I am just a simple guy that read about Bitcoin back in 2013 and bought as an investment. Cold wallet ever since. I also immediately accepted that the money I invested might evaporate. 
So you might understand why I have no horse in the race between BCH and BTC. Hell, if BTC soars to 50k+ in 2018, I will be extremely happy.
Also, I hate banks. I’m a small business owner and the hoops I have to jump through to have access to banking services sickens me. 
And don’t get me started on meetings with my arrogant account manager. I want crypto to succeed just to give a big fat middlefinger to all these middle-management lowlifes who get away with talking to me like I should be grateful that they honor me with their presence. 
If you care to refute or disagree anything I said in this post or my previous one, you have my undivided attention of course. Have at it please. 
The dismissive tone of your answer reminds me of the same arrogance that I just described. 
Surely you can do better than that.

I 100% agree. I don’t have a horse in this race as I never sold my BCH after the fork, and use them as a hedge, exactly because of this.
I have worked with both types of people, the all dressed in black programmers with a slightly unrealistic outlook on the world, and the fast-car driving, expensive watch wearing salesmen that want to score no matter what. 
Truth is, in a traditional business model (if I can take the liberty to compare), you need a mix of both types of people. 
I’m not an expert at all, but the idea that these programmers control what could be arguably called business decisions makes me question many things. Are they strategic thinkers who know how to get to the next level, or rigid thinkers that stick to principles and losing sight of the fact they are swimming with the sharks? 
As said, I have no horse in this race, even though Ver really rubs me the wrong way, and I despise centralisation as it goes against the whole principle of why this was started in the first place. I just hope for the best.

Oh, that they are working on it is a fact, I have no doubts there. I worked at Equens around 2000, still have contacts there, and they tell me the same.
To deny people access to banking services in countries where banking is necessary, and established to be able to get paid, pay your bills, get taxed and so on, on the basis that they don't want to allow third parties to peek into their finances is a PR disaster. 
Consumer watchdogs will be all over them, and sane people (admittedly, not many, but I hope still enough to pack a punch) will naturally seek banking options that do not come with these conditions. The only way for this to become reality is if it is done across the board, and in order to avoid any party offering banking services that do not come with these conditions, laws need to be made.
I just can't see that happening. 
According to the article these things are done according to an European directive, but there is still a giant gap imo between explicitly allowing third parties to look into your finances, and not being able to open a bank account anywhere if you don't sign your privacy away. Which is what you seem to say, unless I totally misunderstood.
Also, the European Commission has shown a couple of times that they actually have a pretty sane view on both privacy and (de facto) cartel formation. This topic touches both issues, and I think, but first and foremost hope, that we will not see a future where you can't open a bank account without disclosing all your private financial information to the Googles and Facebooks of this world.
Then again, I might be wildly optimistic about this.
As a once co-worker of mine said :"Lawyers and bankers, rats in suits".

Just to add some context: one has to explicitly allow these companies/organizations to be able to access the bankaccount information.
Author has a fair point though when he/she states that the average user spends more time looking at a menu in a restaurant than reading t&amp;amp;c/privacy documents.

That seems illogical. Why would it work only one way? Can you please elaborate?

"Every billionaire is still spending almost every cent they have because to not spend it is to lose value."
Really? I wonder why, after this sentence, I should even bother to continue reading. What a nonsense statement.

Thank you all for your input, I am by no means a specialist, but this made things much clearer to me. And I am very far away from Wall Street...

Source please? This is the first time I hear about Iphones not being sold in Russia. 
I know Apple releases russian spec iphones, so really curious now.

So, stated very simply: blockchain needs a BTC that has a minimum value of X to ensure the integrity of the blockchain, if not, chances are everything falls apart? In that case....more usage of the blockchain technology would drive the price of BTC up, irrespective of the fact if BTC is used as a currency.....right?

Y'all need to get out more
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:45:52
Well, enlighten me please. And that is in no way meant to be sarcastic, just genuinely curious.

I've got a laptop. Can I do this too? Will it require constant power to my laptop? Anything known about bandwidth use? 
If somebody can point me to an ELI5/manual tupe of thingie, I will probably get involved too.
