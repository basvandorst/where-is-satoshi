Seriously the lack of knowledge that some people have on here is sad. This is why Reddit sucks. You single cell knuckle dragging mouth breathers who post shit. My gosh is your ass jealous of all the shit that comes of your mouths.
None of you work in Financial Services, none of you are or know CFOs CEOs or CTOs at major companies who are leading the industry. 
None of you know how DLT works, what a block is or how it’s produced. 
None of you know the difference from PoW and PoS which makes most you a POS - piece of shit. 
None of you know who any of the players in the game are at major hedge funds OTC firms and what the buys are they deal with. 
None of you know anyone in the SEC or have a family member who works there. 
None of you know what halving is and why it’s important and when it will occur. 
None of you know about Security Tokens and who is leading the charge this year that will flip the script on the market this year.
So keep jerking yourself off as it’s the only thing you are good at it seems but for God’s sake do the word a favor stop posting shit, following Q Anon on 4 Chan  and playing Fortnight and maybe you will actually learn something... but that’s too much to expect from the dysfunctional retarded trolls who suffer from rectal cranium disorder.... must be dark up in that ass of yours. 
Good luck fawkers - most of ya gonna be getting REKT.
