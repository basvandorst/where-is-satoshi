I sent $60 in bitcoin to the silk road, coin base said it arrived, yet it wasn't in my account, 3 hours later the silk road goes down. Those two events seem corelated.

I lost $160 in bit coin between these two events and I'm a low volume user. I can only imagine what it did to the vendors of the silk road and other people who have tons of bitcoin.

Diversify, buy 3k in the s and p, 3k in gold, 3k in bitcoins, and keep the 1k in savings or distribute it

Bought one at $300, sold it at $750 a bit later because t leveled for a couple days. Couple weeks later went up $1100 if I remover right. Can't be mad, made a cool $450 bucks and I was in high school at the time so that was pretty awesome. Parents were very impressed with me.

Are there people in this sub who are actually now millionaires because they got on the bitcoin train early? Like are there actually people in here who bought fancy ass cars with bitcoin money? Because if so, I’m incredibly envious. Please send me pics of your cool shit.

I don’t think my request was that outrageous. Like if you bought a Lamborghini, snap a pic. If you bought a house, snap a pic. Idk, I thinking becoming a millionaire off something as written off as bitcoin is awesome and you should flaunt your cool shit.

Considering bitcoin is a international currency used by people in ever country, this shouldn't be surprising
