It's not as if other products like the commodore weren't also being produced back then.  Personal computers were very much inevitable with or without him.

The US is bigger than europe.  It has a wide range of cost of living.

YMMV on that.  I always make sure it is turned off and I've had it turned back on in the past.  I had to make several phone calls and work my way up the chain to get them to begrudgingly refund everything.

Looks like a plastic wallet.
