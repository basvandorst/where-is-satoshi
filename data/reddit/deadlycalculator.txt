If everyone's just buying btc to invest rather than to use a better currency for regular day-to-day exchange... wouldn't a crash be expected soon
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:48:32
I'm guessing you don't use it because it's a small amount.

You'd rather have internet points over real money?

Sold half your dollars for bitcoin?
Don't you mean spend half your money on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:50:04
I started day trading last week, this drop in BTC took away literally all my profits.. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:12:16
So I'm on bitfinex, the thing about the other coins is that they're not as popular. Trades don't happen as often and it takes a while for someone to buy/sell your stuff. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:56:47
Why can't features be added to BTC?

I thought the other cryptocurrencies are just identical to BTC?

My bitcoin just lost 9% in value, I feel more *frauded* than any bank user.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:58:21
I know, but because the cost of anything when buying in BTC is dependent on the dollar value... 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:59:22
Why are you talking about the past? Don't people want bitcoin to be something in the present and future?

@_date: 2017-03-03 02:20:27
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:17:01
1-2% a year due to inflation. With btc, it's lost 9% in a day. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:15:21
So... Sell my btc for actually useful real currency?
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:06:28
Well, who else would they sell it to?

This actually feels like the end of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:46:10




I would go on bitaddress.org, turn off the internet, generate a bunch of paper wallets, print them out and save screenshots. Then distribute my bitcoin across all of them for long term storage. I'll be using maybe 1%.


The computer is 3 weeks old, and I have installed Malwarebytes on it. I plan on buying the system for my PC after the trail period has ended. Or maybe get kaspersky.. idk.  
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:47:02
Like, is it unsafe or something? So many exchanges don't let you withdraw without ID or personal info, but that's just for security concerns.

You need to get a TH/s miner for it to be worth it.

@_date: 2017-08-17 07:00:00
Like, I already paid $120 for a device that's meant to keep it more safe than having it stored on a mobile wallet. 
I feel like I shouldn't have to worry about this. I'm paying for the inconvenience of having all my bitcoin outside my phone. lol
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:16:33


Sorry but that will never happen with bitcoin :(

hardware wallet can't be hacked while phones can. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:07:34
Both were done. An increase of block size and segwit. Now you can choose which coin you wanna go with.
What scaling solution would you rather want? More efficient code or one variable change?

Basically people are starting to understand BCC is a shitcoin, and money is flowing from the new forked alt into bitcoin. Expect a correction soon. It rose too fast too quickly. 
I no longer believe it'll go down to $2300 tho :/

We can do the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:12:16
Thing is, do we even have any stats on what % of transactions are segwit transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:42:47
Uhm, we dipped $100 today. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:14:39


Ah, so nobody can predict whether the invention will be useful until it's put out in the open. Got it. 


Okay, someone with above average understanding doesn't understand the payment processor that's meant to be simple enough for everyone to use. Cool.


But adding people to the channel takes the same time and cost as one transaction today.

According to fork.lol, BCH has much less transactions per second than BTC. It's not really a good comparison since it's not popular to use.
Anyone can say litecoin is better because its low fees.

The process of creating a Segwit address is different on every single wallet program, app or website.

Why can't bitcoin do what xrp does? 
If segwit doesnt mean shit for transactions per second, I don't see the benefit.

But I didnt have 16+ bitcoin in my wallet at the time? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:41:49

So you have a source on this?
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:22:28




That's kinda me right now. But I buy it knowing that I can easily exchange it back to USD or buy goods with it. I recently bought some electronics off Newegg with bitcoin. As for a currency, it was fake money for the first few years until major governments put some legislation and actually considered it real money. 
If you took a finance class, you might know why it's volatile right now. If you knew anything about computer science, you might know why it's better than regular currency *in some ways*. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:23:24

Yea, I hear they're working on that.

It might take an hour to find what I want when buying with bitcoin instead of fiat. Then wait for the confirmations, you then get no receipt  Then the process of buying the Bitcoin back with fiat, paying the 4% purchasing fee.

I wrote the 24 words on a paper. I just dont know how the passphrase works. A second wallet.. in the same device? Decoy??
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:42:44
I get that you can compare forged cash to a paper wallet with a different amount of money. But you understand how it's... two very different concepts. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:53:02
They are the same thing.

Don't traditional casinos give you free plays, free money (&gt;$3), food coupons, all while being real and physical? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:11:04
How long did it take to make that couple hundred? I suggest buying bitcoin and holding, or investing in a day trader who actually knows what he's doing. 
When I first day traded I turned $1250 into $1600 and I was really fucking happy. Then it went down to $600. Might happen to you if you dont know how to read candle stick patterns perfectly.

For paper wallets, people are suggesting I download a new OS for my PC and use a usb and such. It's very complicated but then again, hardware wallets are expensive and.. kinda not available.

There's no limit to Bitcoin's fee's right? Theoretically, can't they be thousands of dollars?
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:17:35
How many confirmations so far? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:37:57
Wait, what bounty? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:28:01
What are unconfirmed transactions? Just transactions that are stuck and never send ever? Does the bitcoin get lost?
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:44:05
Tons of testing have been done to prove that people can predict rises and falls but not exactly when and how high/deep.
There will be a fall in price, I guess it hasn't happened yet. And when it does, I don't know if it'll fall $300 or $1000. 
Regardless, if you have shaky hands, you're free to buy back I'm anytime you want.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:43:05

Literally now. Bcash just dropped $100. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:24:21
In practicality 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:28:55
Segwit was priced in. People sell when they believe the price is right at the highest it'll be in a very long time. 
So after activation, they think it's the "peak" in terms of price and sell. This results in the price falling down to what could be $3400 in a few days. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:43:34
So it can't be cracked lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:45:45

@_date: 2017-08-17 01:33:37
I get that, but that can't happen. The blockchain will just get bigger, it's unsustainable. 
Bitcoin has it's uses. But won't replace fiat. At most, it'll match the marketcap of gold. 
But it's not like gold ruined fiat lol we have both. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:28:43
Bittrex is better
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:45:27

@_date: 2017-08-08 12:27:52
So... Us?
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:31:04
I don't think it's about the bandwidth, and more about the storage size.
Like I said, why bother changing one variable and hoping for advancements in technology to sustain what's needed for bitcoin to grow and continue when you can just write more efficient code. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:17:28
Yea, maybe it'll be 50 transactions per second :) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:44:58
Great, I got my trezor just a few days ago. Should I just destroy it and keep the 24 words? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:13:06


Uhm.. buying with bitcoin is only satisfying if the value drops after.


With companies that are insured, and have great customer service, hmmm? Yea, very secure. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:59:05
It's at $4210..
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:21:34
Every altcoin I've ever bought and still hold to this day has gone down lol
Bitcoins the only thing that went up.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:14:25
So I didn't broadcast another tx. If it stays unconfirmed, doesn't the money get returned back after a period of time? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:41:33
Paypal charges 2.9% when you withdraw money into your bank. A good comparison is coinbase, which charges 3.75% when buying bitcoin. 
To send money to others, paypal to paypal, it's 1%. I can send $10 for 10 cents. 
For bitcoin, $10 would cost me like.. $1.50 or something lol. And it would take 30 min as always at best. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:08:03

Even if exchanges aren't "easy to use" they're certainly easier than bank accounts. 
Try [QuadrigaCX]( You can go ahead and input some bitcoin, sell it for $$$, and withdraw in the form of cash mailed in, wire transfer or check.

We really can't do that. Supporters of Bcash consider Bitcoin Cash as bitcoin while advertising it on a sub that is meant for bitcoin.... while having almost the same logo. It can be really devastating to bitcoin long term if you consider the confusion it may cause.

Transaction fees are dependent on transaction demand. More people wanna exchange bitcoin from wallet to wallet, and thus it is really high right now. 
Segwit fixes the issue, so just wait.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:50:35
You don't have a large selection of stuff to buy if you're only buying with bitcoin.

4 variants of bitcoin.
Having 2 is enough to be harmful. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:37:43
Coinbase. Then hold on a mobile wallet such as Mycelium

@_date: 2017-08-02 16:03:46
He has a point. Normal people won't use bitcoin because transfers take too long. People expect faster transactions once segwit is activated but in reality, it won't actually be faster.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:59:41
Can you do month by month since 2011?
It seems very choppy this way. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:44:11
How do you mirror it though?
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:14:34
So.. why do they confuse people by saying their coin is bitcoin and telling me bcash didn't come out yet?
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:03:58
I'm deciding right now, and I'm leaning against a trezor. Just wanted to see why someone else would prefer ledger.

@_date: 2017-08-03 20:48:32


Thing is, it's made every bitcoin owner really wealthy, so it was in some very rich people's interest to split bitcoin. Problem with doing so, is there needs to be a certain number of people that *believe* in the new forked coin. Or else it wouldn't sell for as high as bcash currently does. 
If you split again and again and again, sure you can make more versions of bitcoin just for profit. Bitcoin money, bitcoin wealth, bitcoin new, etc... but they won't be worth that much. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:09:41
BCH is one of many **alt**ernatives to bitcoin, so yes it is. Fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:31:43

@_date: 2017-08-15 21:28:37
First buy bitcoin and then spend 10% on alts. Yes, that means buying 50k in bitcoin and then using 5k of it to put into altcoins. 
Where to buy bitcoin? Localbitcoins.com
Where to hold the bitcoin? Get a mobile wallet. Download MyCelium. 
Which alts to buy? SWT, ARK, KMD, SIA, and TKN. 
Where to buy the alts? Bittrex.

Bitcoin has been trying to hit 3k for a while now. I don't think there's no reason to make predictions, if it happens it happens.
I'll just hold right now. I'm starting my new job on Monday so that's it for me checking blockfolio every second.

Haha, I did the exact same thing just an hour ago. 
I got the tiny little seed card and everything. Pretty cool, eh?
Just keep the trezor safe forever. Write down your pin too. 
What I don't understand is, after having a 24 word seed and a pin number... what is passphrase encryption?

But when bittrex opens the flood gates, BCH will go to $1, so it will no longer be profitable.

Some people can have multiple trezors with the same seed. Idk how to do that. It would be nice because you can hold one and keep one in your parents house or something.

Right now, $52800 in bitcoin is given out randomly every 10 min.
I figured, if the block reward needs to be that high to keep mining incentive up, we'd need a LOT of transactions per second to fill that. 
Imagine if bitcoin achieved 200 transactions per second, $52800 can be rewarded every 10 min with transaction fees of 44 cents each. 
I don't know, that's still unreasonably high to me. I feel like there needs to be another hardfork in the future to allow fees to be logarithmicly proportional to the amount sent. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:19:02

@_date: 2017-08-20 08:14:09
The other guy linked a huge big list, but this is my tl;dr version from what I personally understand.
The blockchain is kinda big. Each block adds 1 MB to it. We need as many people to be able to run a full node as possible which means they need to have the entire blockchain on their PC. Increasing the block size means the blockchain get's larger, faster. 8 MB blocks means it'll be increasing 8 times faster. Less people will be able to have the entire blockchain, which leads to more centralization. 
What sucks is, after 8 MB, they'll want 16 MB blocks. After that they'll want 32 and so on. They don't know what they're doing! 
If it was truly only a "temporary fix" we would try having larger blocks, and then shrinking them back later on. But we know that's not gonna happen.

(1) Sell on hitbtc or bittrex
(2) Coinomi
(3) Coinomi
The thing is, as more people sell their bcash, the lower the price. If it get's low enough, maybe it'll die. But it's gotten so much publicity that I don't think I can see that happening. Coinbase is gonna have it next year too.

However, bitcoin isn't ready to be used by a large company like Uber just yet.

Yes, short bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:23:42
There are, but they aren't getting as many upvotes. $3000 is old news now, yesterday's news shouldn't make todays front page. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:26:29
If they accept bitcoin, there'll be a zillion more transactions per hour and it'll crash the network. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:51:46
It's money. Everyone uses money. Cash is easy to understand. 
You'll never see wide spread adoption in which everyone knows how bitcoin works. Accept the fact that most bitcoin users don't know how it works and will not learn it because they aren't advanced in computer science. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:54:16
Well this sucks. Bitcoin is meant to be used by normal people who shouldn't need to have the technical understanding of it behind the scenes.

One satoshi would be worth 6 cents then... maybe it would need to be divided further by then.

@_date: 2017-08-08 22:23:50
I'm kinda judgmental towards anyone from that sub since literally everyone there is just trying to confuse new people.
The thing about bcash is that it's a name for bitcoin cash. Some people didn't like it and decided to declare a *new* currency called bcash. So whenever anyone refers to bitcoin cash as bcash, they'll ask you why you're referring to a new altcoin that hasn't come out yet. It's all a big waste of time, just to troll people.

I just talked to someone about bitcoin during the eclipse yesterday. Apparently is *the* place where people come to to read up on bitcoin. I think people are capable of doing a lot of damage if they hit the sites and pages new comers go to read up on this.

Nothing is official in the bitcoin world, every investor you see will be as "risky" as any other.

Regular BTC and BCC are both improvements of the old BTC..
Regular BTC is getting Segwit and BCC is getting 8 MB blocks. They're both trying two different scaling solutions. Segwit is better than larger blocks tho.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:46:07
Oh man, I don't know. Even if it wasn't equivalent, what would you rather want:
The ability to process 56 transactions per second with 8 MB blocks that will have to be increased once again when bitcoin grows a little more or the ability to process a whole lot more transactions per second with 1 MB blocks and updated coding designed to be more efficient?

The market cap and volume needs to rise. The higher the market cap, the more money it takes to cause ups and downs across exchanges, the less it'll fluctuate. 
Look at gold (market cap of $7 trillion), it fluctuates here and there but it's market cap is over a 100 times more than bitcoin. Then look at the US dollar ($18 trillion), it fluctuates much less.

Keep in mind, why it's volatile. Look it up and maybe you'll feel safer? Regular forex trading (between regular currencies) is volatile too when done on margin. 
Paypal cheats their customers regularly and is much worse than bitcoin, I expect to see such an acceptance soon.

I was gonna do the paper wallet thing amoung 16 paper wallets but a hardware one is better. When you get a trezor, it comes in a sealed box so you know it's untampered. 
And it's open source so you can see the code for yourself.
And when you first turn it on, it wipes all prior data and install the fresh OS.

Fiat is better than Bitcoin. We will need a lot more upgrades before Bitcoin is just as convenient. However, with each upgrade, there will be another split...

Hardforks are changes in bitcoin. Upgrades need to be made time to time, right?
But the system is designed that if a percentage of people don't like the change, a fork happens. It's whatever.

Bcash is a short form that decreases confusion. **B**itcoin**Cash** = BCash.
New comers shouldn't think Bitcoin Cash is a "variant of bitcoin," it's just an altcoin. Keep in mind, supporters of Bcash call Bitcoin Segwitcoin or BCore... which isn't an abbreviation *at all*. They also consider Bitcoin Cash *as* bitcoin while advertising it on a sub that is meant *for* bitcoin.... while having almost the same logo. 
If we get wide scale adoption, this purposeful mix up can be really shitty. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:02:10
I wanna say gold because you can hand it over without the need for power/electricity, and that you can never track it. 
But I wanna say Bitcoin because you don't need to physically hand anything. 
But gold is used as a federal reserve to sell off for emergency money. It's a different use to what the companies are using bitcoin for.

You'll never have 100% support. Segwit had 99% support. 1% decided to create a new altcoin that was added to the list of 3000 other altcoins that already existed.

You don't mine bitcoin on graphics cards. You mine other forms of crypto currency on GPUs, but not bitcoin. So, as annoyed as you are, you don't need to post it here. 
You can visit r/CryptoCurrencies or r/gpumining if you want. You should just buy a high priced GPU and mine 8 hours a day every night. You'll gain back your loss in no time.

Bcash forked from Bitcoin. If you go there, they're using a lot of nasty tactics to confuse new comers and (in the long term) harm Bitcoin.
What is true:
* Bitcoin cash is an altcoin with almost the exact same logo and Bitcoin in it's name.
* Bitcoin cash is officially called bcash by several reputable crypto sites like bitfinex and trezor. 
* Bitcoin cash is segwit-free, so even if you called it a version of Bitcoin, it's a shittier version
What they falsely claim on * is a BTC sub that isn't dedicated to bcash or any other alt.
* Bcash is a completely different currency that will be coming out later (they literally made this up because they didn't like the name)
* Bitcoin cash *is* Bitcoin while the original Bitcoin *is an* altcoin they like to call Segwitcoin or Bcore.
* People here on are paid shills who are out to confuse boobs and sensor anyone who goes against us.
Now, let's say both Bitcoin and bcash continue to exist, they certainly won't coexist. Not until they change their attitude, name and logo. Bitcoin is getting attacked in the dumbest way possible.

That's an arbitrary unit. 1 btc is worth 0.067 kg of gold. Weird when you put it that way.
My point was, gold is used for jewelry, plating, and electronics everywhere. It's used for the federal reserve and sold as coins, bars and even foil. There's no reason to believe btc will come close to gold's market cap. 
I really hope it does hit at least 10% tho in the future. That means we get bitcoin up to $50000, right?

What's keeping the lowest smallest shitcoins from still being mined? Low difficulty, right?
Say the price drops and people stop mining. When blocks aren't found, wouldn't the difficulty continue to drop until *it is* worth it again. The difficulty has already been adjusted like 5 times.

Mining is the process of using computer power to analyse transactions all around the world. You get rewarded bitcoin for mining.

@_date: 2017-08-06 05:25:05
It just did. It dropped $100 in the last 12 hours. 
What type of predictor are you lol, you're calling the drops after it happened. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:32:38
Satoshi kinda just did 10 min blocks cuz he thought it was a good number. Shorter blocks seems better but if you dig deep into the computer science of it all, problems arise with shorter blocks. Let's say we cut the block reward by 10 and have 1 minute blocks. That's sexy, isn't it? Apparently not. I dont fully undersatnd either.
Litecoin has 2.5 minute blocks btw. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:59:35
I don't think that's how it works.

Trezor is for storing bitcoins long term. Maybe he already collected his BCH and just wants a place to store his coin.

The fork has already happened. 
Bitcoin had two scaling solutions. One was segwit while the other was larger blocks. Majority wanted segwit, the minority made their own coin.

Segwit is "locked in" but hasn't been activated yet.

It'll drop 10% at least, that's what happened when litecoin got segwit.

They'll send it anytime in the next 7 days. They're waiting for the price to rise so they can give you less.

The problem with the 8MB block people is that when that ceiling is reached a year or two down the road, their only solution will be to have even larger blocks. Not sustainable.

That can't happen, since the more people buy, the higher it goes. It's selling that causes the price to drop.

Sorry, but I need to downvote and tell you to fuck off. We can't users like you trick others from stepping a foot into that sub.
I was there for 30 min, and read comments like:
* Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin
* is for bitcoin alone. 
* The original bitcoin is the altcoin 
The amount of manipulation and confusion is gonna fuck up newcomers. What sucks is they blaim all the mess on They even got so triggered over the nickname bcash that they invented a new and seperate altcoin called bcash. If it wasn't against reddit's TOS, I'd fuck that sub up.

localbitcoin honestly is so archaic. It's like 1998 ebay. 
The shittiest part is, the buy prices are hundreds of dollars above the actual bitcoin price and the sell prices are hundreds lower. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:51:48

I really should stop watching the price of bcash, it's not like I'll ever buy it back. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:34:42
No, they do. Most people can get as far as understanding it's a decentralized currency with high fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:54:12
They're letting it scale through Segwit and LN
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:07:20
That's a longer process with more fees.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:47:31

Look up the vox video on bitcoin. It's a better payment system that it is a currency.
Visa can't do that since bitcoin can't handle so many transactions
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:50:09
I think I already told you, you can easily predict what direction the price is gonna go, but you can't (with good accuracy) predict how far it'll rise or dip. 
I now think it's gonna continue to go up tbh. I myself have been dollar-cost averaging this entire last month.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:28:39

We;re out of the dip. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:47:53
But on average, 4MB blocks could send 4x more transactions than 1MB blocks, right?
So how many more transactions does segwitt allow?
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:20:22
Why would segwit reduce fees temporary?

Consider this, there are *many* ways to make money. You could: 
* Day trade and look for patterns in the hour by hour charts. 
* Sell when it hits a peak and buy at the next dip. 
* Dollar cost average, continuing to buy more and more bitcoin day by day.
* Buy an altcoin you think will rise
* By an ASIC and start mining
* Consider a GPU miner, and start mining
* Invest towards someone who knows his shit, and will double the money *for you*
* Just hold it.

It really should be able to handle more transactions per second on-chain, but not by raising the blocksize.
The other coins you listed have a short life due to it's "advantages." They don't really need more transactions per second because they aren't used as often as bitcoin, yet still implemented these differences. If they ever were to get as big as bitcoin, they would have many problems. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:32:54
Consider your bitcoin wallet the same as a bank account. Only, since you control the money, *you* are your own bank.
It is an official currency. Many countries already considered it an official currency.
But to exchange it to *fiat* you just need to put it in an exchange, sell the bitcoin, wire it to your bank account. Selling isn't really recommended since the price will continue to go up. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:36:30

If I live in a rented place where the utilities are paid for, it's worth it. However, how long does it take to make $1000 BTC? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:15:41
The fuck is vertcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:37:30
Could I just turn off my wifi on my laptop while extracting the software or does it need to be a different  offline computer? 
And at what point do I order from  Is the private key another long chain of letters? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:37:31
Well what are the current prices of both types of bitcoin??
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:04:40
So can BTC start segwit activation tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:59:00
Two houses in Hamilton. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:57:07
Like, are other cryptos better? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:45:48
Bubble popping? $1575
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:44:34
So it sounds like they won't comply with the solutions and bitcoin will die as litecoin rises to be the new main cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:16:38
They'll have to update that billboard every day..
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:04:29
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:21:15
Oh okay then :) I didn't realize that's how it worked!
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:05:42
What's the mechanisms of a bubble popping anywho?
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:35:15
Because he could buy a lot more drills with that same bitcoin now if he had only decided to use fiat back then. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:30:47
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:30:21
So you're gonna accumulate and stop at some arbitrary value?
21 is a lot tho. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:41:41
But the computer that I get the paper wallet on needs to have internet, since they're emailing it to me.
And I guess I just send it to the address on the paper.. and the money exists in the paper??
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:09:27
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:05:53
I bought at 1588 when it dipped from 1630, I'm just waiting for it to go back up...
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:40:04
[100 years?](
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:33:23
So is this a good prediction of the price on Monday? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:33:24
Dude, stop.
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:14:29
Or google "bitcoin gambling sites"
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:38:25
How do you know how many bytes a transaction is going to take up? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:51:50
It's already priced in. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:59:04
Don't get bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:06:29
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:55:50
Sounds like Segwit is better.
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:43:30
WTF why
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:35:55
block cap? scaling?
What does it take for a solution to be agreed on? Do people vote or something? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:30:28
That seems kinda useless. 
Also, transaction fees are a LOT already and will go higher? :(
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:01:04
Hi, I'm new here. What?
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:50:05
So.. SELL SELL SELL??
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:29:03


@_date: 2017-05-05 19:05:27
Will bitcoin be replaced by another alt?
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:28:24
Yes but who cares, just UPVOTE good news.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:38:11
Don't you mean the average of the last bunch of trades?
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:03:33
Bitcoin stopped being worth mining on an individual basis years ago, you're very late to the game. Now only large corporations and businesses hold mining operations. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:59:15
Doesn't bitfinex and other websites get their price data from an external source?
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:37:36
Why is change tip shutting down?
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:41:09
And they're free to print?
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:12:48
Can I get a ELI5 of what Segwit is?
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:28:42
Force them??
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:03:00
So a blockchain is the history of a bit of bitcoin as it goes from transaction to transaction? 
It's already really complicated. In order for bitcoin to survive, both needs to be done, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:04:34
I'm using coinomi on my phone. It's incapable of sweeping a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:15:20
I bought all the BTC i can. 
It's just that, I thought the split was gonna happen in months. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:34:11
Isn't confirmations meant to take 10 min minimum? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:46:27
Same here. That's why I physically can't buy more as people keep yelling "BUY MORE BUY MORE" haha
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:42:12
I'm Sorry
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:22:22
Would the funds be safe? Can't you tread the prepaid card as your bank account? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:12:33
It'll dip in the next few days, don't worry. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:52:42
0:13 Don't know what Malleability/Scaling means in this context
0:37 Don't really know what blocks or blockchains are or what they're for
0:46 Just when I think he's about to tell me what blocks are, he just lists a bunch of things that I don't know. 
I tried to follow along ti'll the 3 minute point but it became too much. None of it is in [layman's terms](
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:32:07
It's almost like people complain about the rate of change in the price, rather than the current price itself. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:06:51
Coinbase takes 3.75%, which is better than 5%
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:21:52
Yea, you're money is in "limbo" and has a chance that it won't be coming back. 
Lol no I'm joking. If it takes longer than 72 hours, then it'll get sent back to the address it came from. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:36:07
It'll fall down to the price it was last month. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:18:45
I... excuse me, sir?
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:42:20
Do you have a finance degree? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:25:53
But if you have $1000 in BTC, you get $100 worth in BCC and BTC's price drops $100. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:18:39
So if I just store it in my app, print out the 20 words, and delete the app... The print out is kinda like a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:06:16
Tomorrow, people are gonna buy back into alts after collecting their BCC resulting in a drop in price :(
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:56:22


Yikes, you can say that with any app wallet :$
A Trezor is an offline wallet, right? Or would a paper one be better? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:04:04
Buy on the next dip. Today we had a rapid increase, so there's gonna be correction (tonight probably) when people sell for profit. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:52:19
The fact that it works on LTC means that it's tested already, right?
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:20:46
Why 21 specifically? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:33:12
People are not panicking over losing money they need, they're panicking of losing money they had.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:49:22
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:08:39
Do you think it'll happen? Segwit will go through?
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:38:16
Your paycheck or *my* paycheck? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:43:12
I think the calculator is really outdated... 
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:11:25
is a bunch of paid shills that try to induce panic. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:52:44
Are we gonna get above 80% again?
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:45:46
So if I decide to sell bitcoin for 100 less than it's value, for a fraction of the second, the graph is going to dip to the amount i sold? And could someone use that to their advantage to buy at 100?
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:04:34


How do we know that?
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:34:14
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:52:05
Yea do this
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:14:59
This man made $16600 in 13 hours. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:20:20
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:15:28
Is coinomi insured incase anything happens? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:53:45
Hey man, don't be so down on yourself. PM me your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:35:34
I know you're a troll, but if you doubled your money 13 times, you'd hit &gt;14 BTC. 
Some dumbasses here believe they can double their money in 2 months through day trading. So, according to their logic, you should be able to hit 14 bitcoin in a little over 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:57:38
So what is a pop?
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:02:46
So transactions come in packages, and they need to be permanently put on a blockchain? 
What happens when all the bitcoin's mined. How will all these transactions be processed? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:12:36
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:50:13
In about 15 min. 
Edit: See?
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:26:20
That's not how we adults talk here, kid. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:16:16
Try asking I'm sure you can just run your computer all night every night, and it might be worth it. I used an online calculator to calculate that *my* laptop would earn 0.8 LTC a week which is kinda nice, but I'd have to be running it 24/7... 
If you wanna try it, try it, you can google everything you need to know. However, I don't know much about mining so you should probably take this guy's word for it:


Aka still not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:33:32


Clickbait title, downvoted. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:37:21
Don't keep it on an exchange. You will get your BCC if you put it in Coinomi 
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:26:51
Dude is really secretive about the sites he uses, so idk :/ 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:01:57
For example, coinbase is insured such that if something were to happen (like a hack), people can get their money back. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:12:41
I thought that was something hardwired into the code that runs the whole smuck. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:26:11
You'll learn, everything in bitfinex is color coded to help you know what buttons to press. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:26:33
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:10:24
Ahh thanks :) But this graph is *only* useful if you trade on Kraken, right? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:47:41
So when exactly is the profit? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:29:07
A separate company decided to make a few changes to bitcoin. Unfortunately this will cause a fork or a split (bitcoin that stays as bitcoin will continue on it's path, but BCC will be created from bitcoin and go on it's own separate path). Since BCC is *worse* than bitcoin (no segwit), it's not worth collecting your BCC or being worried about the whole situation in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:32:31
How do you choose the fees it costs? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:03:47
This has scam written all over it
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:43:24
The first wave of media attention was due to it's price jumping from $130 to $1000+ in 2 months back in late 2013. It wasn't due to any forms of donation. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:23:40
It's popular because of the investment. If it stopped going up and was stagnant, it wouldn't be popular. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:46:47
Yea I saw it on the front page, maybe it's because i'm not a computer scientist, engineer or in IT.. but I didn't understand it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:58:28
... really?
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:13:58
People wanna jump onto the karma train
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:44:10
This is the only way you can get upvotes now. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:55:41
I'll have to find where I can get my hands on one and check YouTube for tutorials on how to use it. Thanks :) 
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:31:00
I knew that lol, but why are so many people's goals to stop at being the top million specifically? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:43:02
No you wouldn't
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:47:44
Engineering, you? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:47:57
So, say I was using copay. I would just need to scan the private key on my paper wallet and the money would appear on the wallet in the app? 
Which ledger? Nano S or Nano? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:33:16
How many of us need to 'want' segwit until it starts becoming a thing? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:22:23
Huh how?
@_date: 2017-05-04 02:10:58
But can BTC make jewelry? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:00:24
Wait 2 days, the prices are temporarily up. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:31:34
Look at the road map. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:50:26
Yes, but I need to input that same private key into a BCC wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:28:47
Will it always take 20 min? Even with the segwit upgrades and LN coming soon?
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:00:29
Bittrex has never had a problem in the history of bittrex.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:58:35
Youtube 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:27:48
Don't sell, you get free BCC on the 1st
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:44:19
Does most people's opinions matter? It's just the miners who need to make the switch. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:35:32
Due to segwit, bitcoin has room to rise to at least $5000. Buying now would be a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:42:36
srsly tho
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:43:15
Why not? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:16:56
So what have you been doing?
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:30:38
If BTC tanks, it'll go up again. lol
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:31:02
I have the Coinimi app. Is that not good enough?
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:03:24
Posts like this want me to stay away from bitcoin. 
It seems like as it rises, everyone celebrates but as it drops, everyone still celebrates? 
Bitcoin will never be treated as an actual currency if people just hold it regardless of what happens. Nor will it ever be good for buying/selling shit if the price fluctuates so madly. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:33:46
I don't know how that changes anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:49:40
Thanks for making some of us feel like shit. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:44:07
Why/how were they invalid?
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:15:46
Bitcoins price to tank and it to never recover
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:42:40
Coinomi 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:33:25
But what address should I keep it in now? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:24:16


I dont own a credit card. Debit purchases are instant and free. Bitcoin costs me 0.002 per transaction. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:17:04
A lot of the exchanges are safe. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:19:09
Lol they do paypal and cash delivery? That's really good. Don't know if it's trustworthy tho. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:23:45
Why are they trying to suppress bitcoin's growth? 
Also, if I remember correctly, litecoin's price dropped from $38 to $27 on the day of segwit activation. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:24:01
BCC will go to $0.001 so quickly that it won't even be worth the "Free money"
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:58:21
Don't collect it. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:54:08
Noobs are only going to try bitcoin a little at a time. So this massive fee is a massive problem. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:04:22
Do you know what he's talking about?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:12:16
I bought a donut for $1, how much of that is fees? 
Because if I send $1 bitcoin, the fee is gonna double the cost.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:53:45
What's a trustworthy BCC wallet? It could be a great way to steal other people's bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:21:44
OP knows this, he just wants us to see the QR code and send donations.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:40:54
So.... SELL SELL SELL?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:58:02
If all the bitcoin is returned, wouldn't that cause a drop in price. 
I can imagine most people getting their btc back will sell instantly! 
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:49:33
By good currency, I mean, can be used to purchase anything you can buy with regular fiat. And yes, more stable. 


I hope you're not complaining about taxes because that's pretty important. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:51:46
But nobody owns bcc yet
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:05:03
Purchase some now? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:54:21
You won't get a rate like this next month.
If you loaned 1 btc at 0.71% (the current percentage), it'll last 30 days, and you'd get 0.213 bitcoin (~$592) for free. :)
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:59:58
2x has to come after. It doesn't really have anything got to do with segwit itself, but just doubles the block size allowing for twice as many transactions per second. So like.. 3.5 to 7.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:18:05
It's cool how these things work, eh? :) 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:02:37
So larger transactions take up more time/space? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:28:42
Sure, what's your address?
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:09:24
After Segwit and 2MB block size, how many transactions will it be per second? How did we get so far with only 7 per second lol
The bitcoin community must have been much smaller than I thought lol. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:57:04
It means it'll be very hard for bitcoin to drop below $2800 on that particular exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:01:02
Bitcoin is upgrading, that's all.
Most people agree with the upgtade, some don't. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:01:54
So is segwit a verb? Why don't we do it?
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:05:44
It's less one guy being a jerk and more, one guy being a jerk, others agreeing with him and you getting downvoted. 
Coinbase hasn't given me issues either. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:44:21
With everyone holding, and not spending. How will the price go up?
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:17:17
I'll start looking at youtube tutorials on how to work this thing now so i'm ready for my purchase later c: 
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:06:52
I lot of bragging going on in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:43:55
What apps are good for cold storage? I have coinomi. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:44:20
Leaving money in an exchange for a few days is fine.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:11:40


Isn't the whole point of getting a debit card is that it's physical? Like a physical card? Why even mention that it's plastic if it's a virtual card? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:17:06
It doesn't
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:58:20
years ago.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:28:42
You just purchased what could easily be worth $1200 some day.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:34:14
Back in 2013 I discovered it. Managed to get 0.3 free bitcoin from nice people here on this sub. Gambled it all away. Got kinda mad when it went up to $1000 but dropped. 
Thought it died when it dropped to $200 and I didn't feel as bad. I then rediscovered it recently at $1300. Have also heavily invested ever since. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:34:38


*hoards bitcoin* 
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:04:16
I was around back when faucets gave out 5 bitcoins every 30 min :) 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:27:31
Oh, me me me :)
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:46:17
Yes, because credit cards use dollars. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:39:54
It's a fun game. Read the comment here on and see if they're an avid commenter on or @_date: 2017-07-22 03:27:30
It's $2700 USD, not CAD. 
And yes, once people start selling.

what did Alphabay sell, just that?
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:34:03
I feel like everyone who doesn't truly believe it'll happen in their life times will have a certain point at which they will decide to sell all bitcoin. 
All the coins will be mined by 2140 or something. And btc isn't even meant to overtake fiat, it's meant to work along side it. The technology isn't capable of 2000 transactions per second world wide and takes 20 min minimum. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:29:23
It only takes 1600 upvotes to reach now? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:49:49
Says the btc "noob" who is a trading expert. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:47:49
When I first looked into btc, I got 0.3 in tips back in 2013. I was really new to it all and I loved the concept of anonymous money transfer. 
4 years later, here I am with thousands invested into bitcoin and a few other alts. I'd love to help spread the word. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:12:15
Yes but you can buy almost $1000 worth of bitcoin with $1000 cash. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:08:00
Found it lol. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:56:33
So BTC-E hacked MtGox, and put the money into their own exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:42:16
Smart me would have sold at $2200 after the $250 drop and bought at $2000 after noticing the rise. 
HODL me just held throughout the whole thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:47:13
I don't think I'd trust my private key with that.. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:15:27
The red area? I don't really understand that graph. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:19:20
I feel like most people would disagree. Since all exchanges have their own minifluxuations. And it's these fluctuations you rely on to make money. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:55:49
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:03:54
Yea, but did he do it by converting any to fiat? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:38:17
So what happens at 89.7%?
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:12:35
Well, you don't really need to import it until you want your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:56:03
I don't think "living on bitcoin" counts if you convert stuff to fiat.
Any monkey could have purchased $50 worth of bitcoin back in the day and lived off the profits by selling btc.

I think you messed this up. The one with heavy blocks have heavy txs and the one with light blocks has light txs. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:09:03
Which is why bitcoin will never become a currency. It's just gold coins to you guys. Something to hoard.

Still $270 to go. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:34:25
Segwit will allow for more transactions per second, but the difficulty needs to be dropped BAD allowing for confirmations to happen ever minute.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:49:16
Isn't this a good thing? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:47:58
If you start day trading now, making 1% a day, you can easily hit 4.53 bitcoin in a year.

But I heard private keys will be meaningless after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:24:16
You're lucky to find such a big difference. There are bots out there that scan all exchanges for price differences like the one you found, and then does the purchasing and dumping automatically.

Reddit's a battle field. Nobody cares about the TOS. People will get paid shills to post and upvote whatever they're paid to do. Scam scam scam.
Nothing wrong with fighting back with larger numbers, we're a bigger sub. Why can't we go over there and downvote anything against Segwit. Comments, posts, etc.. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:18:53
I want a faster one where his hands are flailing behind him. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:36:23
Bitcoin is undergoing a change, which it's done many times in the past. Like previous changes, it will improve bitcoin's technology. 
People don't like this change because they have investments in other alts like XMR and ETH. They'd rather see bitcoin die, so they'll try to spread [FUD]( 
Ways people do this:
* Hiring redditors to spread shitty comments on crypto subs
* Creating fake news 
* Making funny memes like the one you see here
All of these have scary sounding words, and will usually point to the plummeting price ironically caused by their own FUD. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:53:19

How is that possible tho if bitcoin can be split up into bits and move around. Unless it's the history of each Satoshi. 
The thing is, you're making it sound like this solutions need a consensus since *everyone* needs to do something different? I can't imagine this happening. Isn't there one team of people who decides this at the end? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:23:32
It's like a baby typing! 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:12:34

Amazon is bigger than Walmart. The blockchain can't handle that many transactions. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:08:44
$25 isn't a lot. If bitcoin goes 10x, you still won't have a lot of money. 
I don't see bitcoin going past ten times it's current value *ever* so either buy more or gamble that $25 to get more. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:34:39

@_date: 2017-07-16 02:34:41
Well, could have been $50000 if you sold it a week ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:41:51
By export, you mean, obtain it, right?
And once I have the private key, just input it into a different wallet that supports BCC to collect them. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:28:42
Why would you want those worthless shitcoins?
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:33:52
I'll blame the devs. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:04:53
You need to rely on technology getting better and more advanced before getting bitcoin ready for mass adoption because the old code is obsolete.
You can get the job done with much less computing with more efficient code developed in the last couple of years. 
I don't see the point in rejecting advancements because the old method will be able to work just as well in 10 years with expensive hardware upgrades. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:09:25
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:22:49

@_date: 2017-07-23 04:35:25
I've been buying some bitcoin here and there everyday for the last month. My goal is for bitcoin to reach high enough for me to sell out into fiat, and live comfortably. :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:14:18
It fell in 2014 to 20% of it's value. Only difference now is that lots of things are competing to "break" bitcoin. So many alts right now can get the upper hand. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:28:03
Apps are downloaded FROM the internet, but work without it. They store your private keys on your phone. 
Paper wallets can be generated/printed without the internet. 
I'm sure you can return your Trezor. The guy above said it's 108 euro, isn't that like.. $125 USD?
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:05:56
Do we really think it'll hit 10k with the rise of altcoins and shit? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:32:01
Just gonna report this now. I really think it's scummy for someone to try to scam someone else on reddit. Especially coming from a 3 week old account. 
You don't know where he's from, or how much he's selling, and you're all like "I gotchu."
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:30:35
I was given a 18 word phrase that I hold. I get that the wallet is an online wallet tho, and offline is best. But I don't exactly know how that works. If bitcoin is stored on the blockchain, how is it truly with me on an offline wallet? 


Where is a good place to buy a Trezor? Ebay has them but... it's ebay, ya know? 
Damn, shit's expensive. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:33:16


Hopefully this won't be a big issue after Segwit
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:32:52


The volatility doesn't make BTC any better than Forex trading using fiat currencies, since you can margin trade Forex with 200x trades. 
On another note, does looking for patterns like hammer, inverted hammer, hanging man and shooting star actually help you with your day trading? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:11:34
Already did. All the videos show how to make a paper wallet but the only ones that show how to get the funds out for some reason do the demonstration without any bitcoin... Also they all use different sweeping programs. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:21:43
F2Pool and Slush are doing it now. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:05:04
You need to consider *why* people don't like Segwit tho. If you dig deeper, you'll realize it's bullshit.

@_date: 2017-07-24 04:06:24
Prices are destined to rise to $5000 to $6000 after Segwit. When that happens, 21 BTC is a life changing amount of money.

They're not your coins apparently :)

Shoot me your address
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:52:21
I get that. The reason why I want to keep a hardware wallet is incase the app I use to store wallets on get's hacked. Right now I'm using Coinomi. What if they get hacked and the private keys are taken? See what I mean?
I was wondering if it defeats the purpose of using a software wallet if it requires these types of apps anyway.

@_date: 2017-07-15 14:11:31
It'll be cheaper tomorrow
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:46:26
Does it matter? What ever happens will happen regardless of what you do. Just hold onto your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:31:22
I'd like to but transaction fees are too high.
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:11:32
That article was confusing to. 
What I think I know is that there are "blocks" which are programs in computers that are constantly processing transactions. The people who run these programs are miners that are rewarded with a little bit of free bitcoin. And segwit is a more efficient way to process transactions that people don't wanna do for some reason. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:36:42
Damn, I still don't understand bitcoin terminology :/
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:57:44
Is it stored on the paper itself?

You can be careful every day, but it's all luck when it comes down to it. The chance of failing is low, but you're making a gamble every day. And when you fail, it'll be a big loss, matching your earnings of the last 10 days.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:49:43
Good. Because you don't need to... because it's not worth doing. But to explain it simply, the way you can collect your BCC is if you input the private keys of your regular bitcoin wallet into a BCC wallet. It's not worth the trouble in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:28:37
If buying ETC is a scam, why move ETH to ETC?
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:48:09

It'll go down to $1300, then you buy.

Bitcoin Cash is the same bitcoin but with 8 MB blocks allowing them to do more transactions per second then before. What sucks is, they're changing one parameter that will take up more computing power rather than upgrading their code. Their plan is to eventually move up to 16, 32, 64, etc... MB blocks because they don't wanna change their code.
Regular Bitcoin is just gonna go ahead with what most people want, the Segwit upgrades that will allow for faster and more numerous transactions without the need for extra computational power.

@_date: 2017-07-31 18:15:56
Segwit allows lighter blocks, but more to happen at once, allowing for  each transaction to be less expensive. 
8 MB blocks means more computing power is necessary. They plan on increasing the block size further and further, to 16, 32, 64, etc... Which means miners will need more expensive ASICS resulting in less profit for the miners.

Why can't physical bitcoins be a thing? Paper wallets exist, so many a round metal coin version of one. 
A coin that contains a very small amount of bitcoin, that would require physically destroying the coin to get it out. Maybe have the private key inside and the public key outside for people to confirm that it has the bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-07 16:18:42


Money existed for a long time before bitcoin. Bitcoin seems to be a very technology-oriented version of money.


Aka bitcoin isn't mainstream. Don't people want bitcoin to operate in banks and stuff? That's why everyone wanted ETF approval, right? 


Cash doesnt run on a code at all. It's design is simple and known. Besides, other alt-coins are open-source too. So why not go with them?


Mostly due to faucets and day-trading. Also people are using bitcoin to buy other types of coins. BTC owned 85% of the cyrptomarket a month ago, now it's at 54%.

I don't know what those are but there's the sub @_date: 2017-07-23 21:45:57
I think coinbase is a good place to start, but I don't know if they'll let you buy 50k right away.

When it hit $1.60, that was the shit.

Even in developed countries, only 80% use internet. Only 5% of people actually know how to use bitcoin without fucking up haha.

I don't know what 2x is or who Jihan is, so I'm susceptible to learning new shit. I just hope what I'm learning and reading is real. 
Miners are afraid of segwit because of their profits. They don't really care otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:51:52
So 127 of 269 is 75.6%?

Doesn't really advertise bitcoin tho.

We're at the end of the hype bubble

That's the great thing about the buy line. You set the buy at the price you think it'll dip to, and you leave.

After segwit, transactions will still take 30 min to confirm 3 times :/
It would be nice for the next BIP to lower our thing to 1 min or something nice. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:29:14
You running out of arguments is kinda funny too. It's nice, people who read this comment thread will get a good idea of the comparison between BTC and BTH.

That's a good thing, right?

If I was a bitcoin trader years ago, and lost it all to a hacking. And then got it back years later... I'd sell it all and never look back.

What is an artificial fork?


How much will a BCC be worth? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:28:25
Not really. Imagine if I just sold now and didn't look back. Take all my profit without the worry of wondering "maybe this is the peak and it'll just go down form here."
That being said, I won't sell lol. I don't even trust any exchange to do it reliably.

Can't a few whales just get richer by doing that on a daily basis?

On coinomi, it's the default unchanging amount. It's not that much less on coinbase.

People doing this are just trying to make money. People like us can see it and go "Huh, I'll tip this guy to encourage him to keep advertising!" 
For a couple of 25 cent print out, how much bitcoin do you think that guy got? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:39:58
It's not that interesting. In stores or any forms of sales that accept bitcoin, everything is listed in dollar amounts. BTC is just too volatile not to.

There's so much segwit fud on so fucking much
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:46:05
Never. Why? Because I'll never own any BCC? Why? Because I don't trust the method of "collection"
Apparnelty you need to entire your private keys into a BCC wallet to get an equivalent amount of BCC as you have bitcoin. So if you own 1 bitcoin, you can get 1 BCC by giving them your private wallet. Fuck that. 
It's not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:04:54
Can't they just say "We haven't sent it yet" rather than make it look like the first confirmation is taking a while?

So is a 0-conf trade really as secure as a visa transaction? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:16:40


I started with 0.9 bitcoin, and got a bit higher just like you. But then I made a dumb trade and lost 25%. That one trade didn't kill my confidence, but it hurt losing how much I gained in a week in one day. Things like that happen more often then you think. You're gambling all your bitcoin, hoping it'll go up 2%... but reality is, shit can drop. 
It's not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:48:39
Is there a mobile app wallet that can do that? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:27:23
If you have an app that saves the bitcoin on the hardware of your phone, isn't that good enough? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:30:25
Keep in an exchange that supports both BTC and BCC. When you get your BCC, sell it for free BTC. Then move it off the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:48:16
Aren't most pools not supporting BCC?

My default setting is the same too, but I'm all out of USD to buy. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:46:22
Why do you think that'll happen, when it's obvious bitcoin isn't meant to replace fiat in every form of exchange. And when volatility never ends. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:27:11

@_date: 2017-07-13 06:11:23
Simple. Cuz anyone who buys anything with bitcoin will be kicking themselves as the price heightens. 
I feel like it's weird that people would consider it as actual money until the price stays the stagnant.

Is there a good video out there that shows how to input bitcoin offline?

The posts on that sub made me decide to not use quadrigx lol.

So just hold bitcoin for now. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:40:01
Most of that bitcoin is going towards the purchase of other alts. Bitcoin's market share right now is lower than it's ever been.

@_date: 2017-07-21 19:51:13
What's centralization? I'm sure LN has been done and tested with other currencies with no issue. 
But I feel like big changes will be bad for the miners. 
Also, another thing, I know that 10 bitcoin is generated every 10 minutes. But when there's no more bitcoin to be mined, the miner's reward will all come from analyzing transactions. This will make transactions VERY expensive if there aren't a lot per minute. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:21:39

Malware is usually a thing that exists on PCs and rarely on phones. However, you could get a new cheap tablet for $70, and use that for just holding bitcoin.
The thing about ledger is that.. I've lost a lot of USBs in the past. I don't think this one device would be any different. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:24:35
The price is artificiality high due to BIP91 hype. It'll drop in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:22:00
As I mentioned above, cash doesn't make nearly 100% of transactions in large businesses though.

The price of the bitcoin is changed all the time, and they convert to fiat RIGHT away.

You will have to claim it if you want it using a BCC wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:54:36


I feel like bitcoin is meant to work in tandem with fiat, rather than replace it. Bitcoin and fiat both have their pros and cons. But unless bitcoin has NO cons, it'll never replace fiat. I don't know how many updates that'll take. Probably a lot. Maybe another altcoin would have replaced btc by then. 
Regardless, I think it's a get rich quick scheme. Most people who invested do.

@_date: 2017-07-30 15:12:42
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:30:08
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:15:41
I wanna try it but I'm scared lmao
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:56:23
I know that if you never sell, you'll never profit. So I don't get this "HODL" ideology. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:18:54
Should have waited 8 hours. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:18:21


LOL. Fuck off. The only reason bitcoin is growing is because it's an investment. The price is going up due to greed. We all want it for ourselves. I'd lie and con my way for more if I had to. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:52:54
Yes, you got it :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:58:01
An ELI5 explination isn't ignorant garbage. If I wanted ignorant garbage, I'd go on @_date: 2017-07-29 19:24:55
But that voids the paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:06:32


So 2-3 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:23:23
What was the post? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:39:27
Do you wanna have a full coin?
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:28:13


What? Bitcoin transactions are transparent, they're very traceable. It's not monero we're talking about. 
Cash isn't electronic, and thus, isn't traceable until it's found by someone or put into a bank. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:02:09
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:25:11
Is it free? :)
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:59:59
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:41:01
You're gonna get a bias opinion here on @_date: 2017-07-29 19:29:56
Enjoy :)
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:18:07
Because their little political coin caused a whole lot of FUD in bitcoin, and will ultimately take away value from the legacy coin. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:18:37
So, when everything that accepts fiat also accepts bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:35:25
I told some guy to sell all his bitcoin and set a buy order for $2300. Just for the sake of my advice, I hope it drops. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:02:53
When will the dip be? And how deep??
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:51:24
Are you gonna sell moments before Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:24:33
I'm gonna just report you for following me around and being a troll. I've recommended coinbase to all my friends. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:02:32
Better to wait until after Aug first
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:21:55
I.. I don't understand :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:04:04
Thanks. And here I thought it was dumb af, turns out it's really smart lol
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:58:10
$2500-2300 by tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:17:25
Bitcoin will be better after segwit. The technology will get an upgrade, allowing it to continue to be a leading cryptocurrency. 
People who have investments in other alts don't like that and will use complicated words and funny comics to try to spread fear in the impending change. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:52:20
Yea, since you can buy a few things here and there with bitcoin.., except bitcoin could go down in value to 10% of what it's wroth. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:17:44
It wont hard fork tho
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:38:04
Bitcoin isn't being moved to anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:12:48
I can easily imagine $2300, what I'm scared of is $1000. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:53:07
Where's shapeshift? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:23:17
Ahh, so the trends you showed me before.. These aren't for 1% profit, these predict 5% profits over a longer period of time? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:25:00
That's normal. It needs to wait for 3 confirmations before you can withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:04:04
I'm kinda scared of people actually wanting BCC and bitcoin losing value to competition. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:06:50
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:56:00


Fuck it, I'm not gonna claim my bcc 
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:23:25
SELL SELL SELL 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:35:26
So I ran out of things to say, and just when I thought you could be right, I saw this: 


@_date: 2017-07-23 16:40:00
So it turns out, I need to download a chrome extension to input coins. But what if I want my internet off while I do the process? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:58:22
What software is this? Lol you should teach a class. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:28:02
What type of logic is that. You think people shouldn't be reported for what they say when posting on a thread? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:00:21
BCC will be worthless, so I won't even bother :$
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:10:50
Sell now and buy back after another 8% drop. Make 8% easily. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:15:09
Well, you need to choose to buy back in at 8%
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:24:36
I thought this was meant to happen in 8 days? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:27:08
No, it's dumb. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:28:21
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:34:08
Pawn shop? Or visit a jeweler. In an emergency electricity might be down lol 
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:11:15
This wasn't a pump and dump. It was a rise in price and a slow dump. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:46:54
Do nothing! 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:52:48
Of the prices are really screwy on that one exchange, wouldn't it be great for arbitrage?
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:51:08
How's the code looking so far?
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:18:27
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:13:36
The fork isn't "suppose" to happen, but it will because a few people want it to. It's not a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:53:47
Everyone's telling you to not put your coins in an exchange before Aug 1
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:39:21


Pls don't look at hourly trends. You need to look at the bigger picture. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:49:51
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:39:50
You're making that up. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:04:03
What's the catch? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:17:40
How is that worse than bitcoin fees? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:40:11
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:14:24
Sadly, there already is a reddit coin: 
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:07:50
I feel like bitcoin moves up and down much slower than it's alt coin counterparts. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:22:22
I thought of that. Well, if I was a business owner, I'd simply put up a different wallet ID to get paid from 90% of the time. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:41:40
Price will go up to $3000 in the next few days according to the chart??
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:40:09


By private key, do you mean the word-phase that we get from some wallet apps? Or is that the *seed*?


Where can I see live updates of BCC's price? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:19:05
You wouldn't. Doing so would drop bitcoin's value to the floor on every exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:38:25
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:59:38


Isn't that kinda dumb tho? Like, if I send $1 through paypal, I won't have a $2 fee. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:28:16
That will, but if I was OP, I'd care more about my 200k than a negative light on BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:03:15
I put in my life savings at $2800
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:19:20
It kinda already did when bitcoin dropped to $1850. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:15:59


No, it's fine. Coinomi and Mycelium are both good. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:49:27
If i inputted my private phrase onto mycelium, would my bitcoin show up?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:02:34
On your phone, download Coinomi. Get to a computer and transfer all your btc to your wallet on that app. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:50:21
Looks like he did 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:48:16
Regardless, I reported this post so it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:43:55
It's actually been getting constant negative light. 
Scams everywhere, MtGox bitcoin loss, Bitfinex hacking, August split, Coinbase being shit, noobs losing their bitcoin.
No laws, no government. No protection. Everything's on you, and the average person really isn't smart enough to handle their own money in the form of bitcoin. 
The only thing we have is the rising price of bitcoin, that's *all* we got. Up until 2 days ago lol 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:38:35
People are selling their alts for bitcoin last minute before Aug1 to collect some of that useless BCC. 
Expect a large drop after Aug 1st. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:21:13
Cash doesn't make nearly 100% of transactions in large businesses though.
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:22:13
Oh, that's trash
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:39:07
But to put btc into Trezor, you need to go through their website. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:54:49
Why does the website look like it's from 1996?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:55:27
No lol no no no
The longest you can lend out is 30 days, and the 0.7% rate isn't going to be different next month. So you can't really keep it up for an entire year. Also, once loaned, you can't add more to lend on top of that. So if you put out 1 bitcoin, you keep getting 0.7% a day on that 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:56:36


@_date: 2017-05-25 16:49:23
Sorry, I'm gonna have to dump it now. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:08:25
So what causes one transaction to have more data than another if it isn't how much is being spent? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:23:58
Doesn't this mean they'll signal it again later on? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:31:54
Literally anyone can cause a hardfork. This isn't a big deal.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:56:41
That's weird. I don't understand why it takes so much computational power to analyse 7 transactions a second. AND STILL have each transaction take like... 30 minutes to go through. 
If we wanted to have as many transactions as... say.. VISA for example, we'd need to have blocks of 300 MB lol wtf 
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:26:10
Isn't bitcoin gonna have 2 MB blocks in the future anyway, that's Segwit2X.. 
How do I claim my bitcoin cash if I have.. say 3 bitcoin right now? Would I need to input those bitcoins into this site to collect 3 BCC's. And then I can sell them right away?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:53:22
Does that mean bitcoin *doesn't* split? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:50:58
The more exchanges that support it the better? I don't want to move my btc from coinomi to get some BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:20:23
I don't think a PhD student should be getting stats from reddit. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:18:40
If BIP91 was a success why wouldn't BIP141 be? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:19:08
Source? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:53:29
That's cool c: 
I have coinomi right now, and my private keys are written down but also accessible by the app. Which means they can get hacked.
But to input money into the Trezor, it looks like you need to go through their website? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:19:45
Day trade your way to a bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:07:37
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:39:01
He's claiming $500 bitcoin is equivalent to $1000 in cash.
Is it still THAT hard to convert cash into bitcoin. C'mon people, it's 2017!
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:40:29
But this is an opportunity to make more BTC. When BCC comes out, bitcoin's price is gonna crash, and restore itself. If you sell now and buy when it crashes, you'll gain 15% or so more bitcoin to HODL.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:28:46
How is 127 / 336 blocks = 75.6%?
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:02:52
Actually, everything is lost the moment you buy. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:45:04
So what could the website be doing to fuck that up on their end? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:27:19
2 halvings? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:38:54
Is there a youtube tutorial somewhere? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:10:34
My reaction to every single roller coaster post.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:33:33
Was it worth the price of one? Couldn't you buy a cheap tablet for $70 and use that to store your currency on mycelium? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:52:09
But why
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:28:16
You own bitcoin because of the money problem in Venezuela? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:04:24
Eastern Time Zone
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:30:12
It was literally the first ever purchase made with bitcoin. Someone had to do it... 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:59:01
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:32:16
That means cryptocurrency has become worthless internet tokens that have no meaning anymore. Something really bad would need to happen to cause bitcoin to "break" and devalue that much.
At that point, you'd be buying monopoly money. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:33:40
Where do you see 65% or $4200 anywhere there? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:41:33
You can still take advantage of new altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:11:37
What do you consider the end? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:29:05
It literally just says bitcoin. Posts like this make me think people here are kinda wonky. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:53:54
Leave, kid.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:54:27
That was a typo, edited. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:47:37
It is free money
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:16:06
Is the lack of volatility only because of the larger market? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:24:34
I'd rather have it be at $1500 than in a bubble :/
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:47:59
I'm trying to learn as much as possible while avoiding info that might be coming from paid shills. It's really hard to do. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:25:31
Well, they did say keep your btc off exchanges during the split.. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:54:11
But how do you put bitcoins in offline? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:35:25


as an investor, that's all i want lol 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:53:38
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:57:00
$500000 in three years
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:19:15
What is the buy amount at right now? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:39:55
To be fair, I suck at day trading and I haven't *started* the masters yet, but yea.

Canadian here. Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:10:11
How would you test it?
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:48:33


So... cash?
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:41:02
I expected a dip after it got to $2900, which happened. We dipped to $2600. I just didn't know how low it would go.
I expect the drop to continue as people cash in profits. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:59:35
I'll have this open just for the music. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:48:06
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:59:25
Coinomi. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:10:19


Are apps like mycelium an online source? Because I think they save your private keys in the hardware of your phone. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:07:43
Isn't cryptocurrencies against the paypal TOS?
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:15:54
I wouldn't. :)
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:45:24
He has a point. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:23:07
Which were?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:56:47
Are you all in on ETH or XMR?
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:21:43
I see. Have any idea how much support they have? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:47:11
Okay, well, sure. Print it. Is everything I said above okay tho?
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:13:24
What is Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:10:34
Do most people here actually think that'll happen? Lol
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:36:26
If changes take months/years to implement, don't you think another altcoin could easily surpass it? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:17:56
Will it work in Canada? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:30:46
I thought it was. Why wouldn't it be?
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:24:42
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:54:31
So you need the ledger to take out all these coins from the chrome extension?
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:33:17


@_date: 2017-07-22 19:23:27
Has Visa taken away people's money in the past? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:58:58
Bitcoin's gonna hit $40 maybe. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:16:43
So I looked at your post history. You're from Shill alert! 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:37:26
Coinomi is better than mycelium
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:02:10
I dont get it. :/
If these bots are profiting off arbitrage, then the smaller exchange prices would match up closely with larger exchanges already. So the bots *aren't* really screwing stuff up. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:07:41
Oh okay, not a big loss then.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:14:36
You can look up popular bitcoin gambling sites. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:35:13
Why work on one when you can find them online? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:32:35
Why do you prefer it over ledger? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:11:04
What's google books? 
Can't they write an algorithm to recognize signs and cars the same way snapchat recognizes faces :/

@_date: 2017-07-22 15:32:54
Anyone know why we have to wait 6 blocks? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:46:27
Did you not see the evidence posted this week?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:39:50
Wouldn't gold be better then? Not to be ripping on bitcoin but, bitcoin can devalue to 5x less like in 2014. Gold wouldn't do that over a few months or even years. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:38:49
The thing about the parameter change is that it's going from 1MB blocks to 8MB blocks. It'll go from 7 transactions a second to 56... which is still 40 times less than what bitcoin needs to be for mass adoption. 
LTC isn't the only coin that has Segwit... you're not a developer. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:22:02

I have an 18 word phrase for Coinomi... weird.
And yes, I was talking about the word phrase. I'll look into it. The thing about my phone is that it literally has no internal storage left and I'm unable to move apps into my SD card. So, I can't have all the apps I want. So it needs to be either coinomi or mycelium. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:50:37
No chance there'll be a better distribution through crowd funding.

Better than ledger? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:50:51
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:36:06
Get a credit card?
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:12:46
I do tho. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:06:11
Bitcoin's gonna be volatile until it dies. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 05:53:44
I keep seeing this screenshot, but where's the video? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:50:53
The fees aren't a lot. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:36:21
Actually I'm waiting for the correction down to $2300-2500 tonight. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:59:17
ELI5 what or who BTC-E is?
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:10:49
Someone else explained it better than I can: 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:50:38
So my coinomi bitcoin can be placed in a USB key?
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:36:00
What about coinomi?
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:43:05
Like.. why would it? 
Is there a reason for that to even happen? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:01:57
I think it's a great coincidence that you happen to teach a small btc class to 7 white women. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:45:39
Like I said lol. Yea $2300
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:34:09
Bitfinex os goving 1.091 BCC for each BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:16:49
Bitcoin is used by businesses which immediately exhcange to fiat the moment they get the money.
It's simply too volatile to work as an actual currency. Its good for investment but most people know using visa, credit, PayPal, cash, is better.
On top of that, you can't really use it to buy much, transactions take 30 min minimum and it's expensive.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:10:21
Bitcoin isn't meant to be taken over by anyone, so that's good. I thought bitcoin core was the good guys tho. 
I also thought we're suppose to go through with the hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:08:51
No :(
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:24:30

Do you know what a "bear trap" is? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:45:29
I wanna have a phone notification to know if it drops under 80%, so I can sell before the dip. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:53:18


@_date: 2017-07-23 18:03:08
Was the cost of the device worth it? 
I mean, paper wallets are free. Or you can get a burner phone that's never been connected to wifi. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:07:10
This gif is already on the front page. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:36:24
Lol he converted bitcoin to cash to food. 
It seems like 80% of this sub believes that bitcoin will become *better* than fiat and there will (in the future) be no need to exchange to fiat ever when everything anywhere is available through direct bitcoin purchase. 
That'll won't become the reality, and advertising yourself as "living off bitcoin for 3 months" is just a false clickbait title since it implies that it was only bitcoin he lived off of. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:51:29
On that note, what about day trading bots? If the whole thing is based on patterns wouldn't it be easy to have an algorithm to everything?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:13:57


I feel like it would be nice if I got some discount :( 
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:29:34
Forgot your other bracket. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:23:16
Wait wait wait... it's under 10 transactions per second?
Billions of dollars in bitcoin mining equipment, tons of computational energy is put into analyzing 10 tx/sec worldwide? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:45:36


bitfinex? bittrex? 
I'm Canadian too. If your goal is to make more BTC, the fiat currency doesn't matter. It could be in USD or CAD or whatever. Your account is 8 months old, I don't think that's new lol. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:37:02
Telling people their high fee of 26% their original transfer amount won't be increasing isn't good enough. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:00:07
Anyone scream scam? haha
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:13:09
I started buying at $1300 too. Sucks. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:02:22
Why cant finding blocks be made easier?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:40:45
Yes, but hype comes and goes in waves. We're in a current wave of hype. Once it drops, it'll be the time to buy. The next wave happens in November. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:54:36
Paper wallet
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:26:22
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:33:14
You can figure that out.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:52:13
People wanna sell the profit. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:41:24
What's wrong with bitcoin splitting? We'll all have double the coins c: 
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:35:12
I just traded my 0.93 bitcoin for 48.6 LTC
Oh man but I can't buy goods with this shit. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:25:59
If it's 60 cents per transaction, wouldn't it be very expensive once we reach 21 million? When I first got into bitcoin, I thought one of the main pros were the fact that transaction were fast/free?
Why can't I just create a block and get 12.5 bitcoins? c:
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:25:16
Is there a list of other apps it works with?
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:27:47
I thought Segwit2x was just the same thing as regular old segwit. 
Wouldn't the 1MB increase in block size result in slower transactions? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:21:11
That was during the 2 weeks after segwit was decided, right?
Has such a rise happened in other coins that got segwit activation? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:02:35
I feel like more computers running to find the answer will result in the answer being found faster lol 
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:08:59
Lmao no!
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:01:40
So.. when do we buy stuff with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:01:15
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:46:53
This has been posted dozens of times
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:36:25
Because another altcoin can come in and take over?
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:55:11
We already saw altcoins dropping as people sell in exchange for bitcoin to get some more BCC. I'd expect the market to flood back into the alts after people collect their BCC. Causing bitcoin's price to drop. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:56:54
"segwit altcoin"
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:25:39
There are cheaper ways to do this.
Paper wallets are free. Also, if you download an app on your phone and store the bitcoin in there, your phone literally is a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:31:40
It's just that, I've lost a lot of USBs before :c
Doesnt' a ledger have to go through chrome anywho? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:33:14
Slow internet maybe? 
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:28:26
What about arbitrage? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:35:44
I think he meant, his first purchase of bitcoin. He shouldn't post it cuz it's a lot.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:59:43


I wouldn't say so
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:36:45
Because math
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:19:38
It's literally the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:33:28
But less hacky than ETH. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:56:35
$150,000 at next year's price. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:04:05
Quadrigacx claims that they'll mail you up to $5000 cash as one of their options for withdrawing fiat. Is this true?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:01:30
Dude probably got killed a long time ago. He had one million bitcoins. 
If he has a Japanese name, why visualize him as a white guy?
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:13:08
Just keep mining? 500 more days to go :) 
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:15:07
Familiar T-shirt? How?
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:44:06
3+ days, still pending :/
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:58:05
Download coinimi and put it there
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:41:56
Buy an alt now and exchange to bitcoin after it's done and over with. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:42:07
I feel like if it doesn't happen this period, it won't happen next :( 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:08:16
That's basically asking "do you consider BTC as a legit currency?" 
People can lie all they want, but truth be told, no. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:38:21
You jinxed it! 
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:46:16
Miners in China? So... Most of them?
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:45:54
Yup. Sell now and wait for the correction to buy again.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:04:40
Does Mycelium come with a private phrase too? Also, is said private stuff saved on the app or on the phone?
*And* is it open source? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:04:28
Okay, good luck.

He stole money from another exchange, didn't he?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:06:07
They probably have found some quantum algorithm that helps. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:02:12
It's just math. I dunno. I really hope the workarounds can be implemented for future btc. Bitcoin as is doesn't seem to work mathematically if you scale up. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:12:53
And nothing's gonna split cuz it has no support lol 
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:13:14
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:51:28
Bad idea bruh
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:23:27
Isn't this old news?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:31:40
When I said last year, I meant, the year of 2016. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:05:36
I think it's interesting that the global mining power is all used to analyse 4 transactions per second.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:36:28
Why is the new coin called bitcoin cash?
There are *many* coins that were made from etherium's code but they aren't called etherium ___. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:27:41
Segwit lowers fees and decreases transaction time, right?
There have been lots of forks in the last year but it's this particular one that people are freaking out over.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:01:13
I guess I'll look up how to load up and spend on each and decide which is better for me. 
I want long term storage, but I don't want the actual removal of the bitcoin to be a hassle. 
What about a ledger wallet? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:48:35
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:44:50


Fuck off back to @_date: 2017-07-17 17:13:33
I suggest you google or youtube it. 
It's important to understand at least a tiny bit of what's going on before you read up on FUD on reddit. 
What I know is Segwit is a implementation to bitcoin's code that will allow transactions to be cheaper and faster. It's been done on other currencies before and has been tested millions of times. Lots of money goes into the creation of changes like this, and it's meant to scale bitcoin up and allow it to continue to dominate in the cryptocurrency world.
Other people (like OP) who have investments in altcoins will obviously try to make Segwit look bad so people lose trust in bitcoin, which brings the price down. People have hired tons of redditors to talk shit about segwit on while others have poured money into making false articles and other crap. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:52:44
Wait for the weekend when it dips 25%. Litecoin did the same thing with segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:42:18
Cool :) Is there a way to lower the transaction fees of 0.002 BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:53:06
Why would the 2MB block size fail to activate? I don't know which side we're on. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:43:55
The thing about BCC is that it's an upgrade from 1MB blocks to 8MB blocks. It'll go from 7 transactions a second to 56... which is still 40 times less than what bitcoin needs to be for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:23:11


So is what OP talking about complete bullshit?
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:24:20
How the fuck did you know my name?
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:52:54
What happens doesn't even matter since it'll happen anyways regardless of what you do. Just hold your bitcoin and ride the wave. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:06:59
I can tell you're new to this lol
Don't wait on an hourly basis. Give it time. 3-4 days. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:20:26
As far as security goes, I feel safer with 1 kg of gold vs 40k in bitcoin.
But right now, bitcoin's a good investment. Not a good currency. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:46:38
How do you know reversing hashes is quantum-resistant?
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:54:54
Import the QR code so you can keep sending money to it, right?
What's the max amount of bitcoin you'd be comfortable with putting into a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:40:16
When the prices go up it's nice. 
It was SHIT back when bitcoin was $400-200
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:03:28
Trezor or ledger? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:00:11
Your private keys aren't saved on the software though
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:13:12
Uh oh. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:51:32
So where does the $9 go? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:23:36
Great, how do I find a team?
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:45:59
Both? Start up your own crypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:03:37
Yea, it should get it to drop 50%
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:15:06
That's what they said about litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:42:48
Well, rooted phones have limitations on what their apps can do, so it's pretty safe. Apps have their keys encrypted too. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:32:46
But those cost mooooonneyyy.
Also, can't they be virused in too? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:03:29
OP will only provide 50% for information that leads to the money coming back to him. The info alone isn't worth anything if it gets him no where.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:05:30
PM me your wallet :)  
Edit: rip inbox
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:19:48


I read somewhere that it was like that. The comment got upvotes but I can't find it now. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:00:59
Most likely not, but it's just money yo.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:33:00
They're pushing BCC too. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:39:06
It won't hit $2290 ever again.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:51:27


Why? That was always my plan. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:54:20
So why do people keep calling it a currency?
