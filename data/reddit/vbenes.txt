Some ideas:
* try to launch it with different/no wallet file (either backup &amp; delete it or use '-w' switch) - you can try that way whether the behavior is different when it creates new wallet;
* check your network connection, your firewall, setting in Electrum itself (if you can reach it) or maybe there is some command line switch to run offline;
* upgrade to latest version or try the same on different machine in your network.

No, then you ask how much bitcoins they exactly want... They can even create QR code with encoded amount that you only scan &amp; send. 
Try buying this:  (you can pay $1 or less)... They convert the price you want to pay in $ into BTC at current "average" rate. As the price of BTC is changing constantly, the BTC amount they tell you must be paid in less than 15 minutes.
If you pay to friend, you can do the calculation yourself probably - providing you agree on how &amp; when to calculate the price...

It's always good to try everything with small amounts first. Either get yourself some small amount (~$1) of bitcoin yourself &amp; try if you can receive it &amp; use it... or maybe try to convince your customer to make this initial small test payment.
There are no accounts you need to register for. You just grab the software (for mobile or PC), you create a wallet (it generates your addresses) and you are good to go. I suggest either Mycelium (mobile) or Electrum (PC). Caution with Apple wallets - there are some scam clones of breadwallet and others in the store.
Once you received the payment from the customer, you can check whether the amount is correct, here is the current BTC valuation:
...Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no central authority announcing the price - the above are either single markets (Bitstamp) or averages taken from some select high-profile markets. I am afraid you'd need to agree on what of these (or others) you want to take to calculate how much the customer needs to pay.
Once you have BTC, you can either buy something with it (Cheapair, Steam, ...). Or HODL it (hold it) - maybe it will go up in value. Or sell it on exchange - Kraken allows to sell BTC with only name+tel+address (-&gt;Tier 2) registration. The'll bank-wire money to you. You can also try to sell BTC anonymously (localbitcoins.com, mycelium local trader or other services that allow you to get $ from cashiers in some stores).
As a merchant you can also look into Bitpay service - they manage BTC receiving &amp; conversion to fiat ($, EUR, whatever) for you. If your store is brick-and-mortar, you can even list it here:  &amp; attract more Bitcoin freaks! ;)

Even if they do exactly what you say in your last paragraph you can never be sure that they have all coins they need. Always there is the possibility that they made some fuck up - e.g. they might have lost many coins of some high-profile whale (whale that doesn't want to go public about it).
Even if they have all the coins they need &amp; they prove it to you &amp; these coins are not borrowed... they might not be paying their utility bills for years for example. Then they go bankrupt, their bankruptcy administrator liquidates all their assets (including coins) &amp; pays to people only fraction of the value that they deposited (regardless of currency type of their deposit (fiat/BTC/...)).

The first one:
...coins moved 1 day after they arrived (i.e. 2015-12-31)
The second one can't be found (never received BTC probably).
...coins moved out on 2016-04-14
...so it looks like someone used those paper wallets (either you or someone else already). 


...this would support the hypothesis above - you added the private keys to your wallet correctly, when your wallet was synchronizing, it first had seen the incoming bitcoins (those $5 you talk about) (those might be from your paper wallets or also (partially) on your other addresses), but then it synchronized past the block when those were spend from your addresses, so it correctly subtracted those $5 from your balance

Look up the addresses in online block explorers (blockchain dot info, btc.blockr.io, etc.). Hopefully the funds didn't move.
Then, you can also try Electrum (PC) or Mycelium (Android) just for fun - Mycelium has really easy options for using paper wallets (you can even send only a fraction of bitcoins and the rest goes back there), Electrum is also very fast &amp; user friendly (and more robust I think than Multibit). If you sweep the funds into one of those, you can immediately sent those to your main wallet.

It is. It might be a bit counter-intuitive for you, but what counts here are the averages. Bitcoin can drop 30%/day 100x/year and still it will be the greatest store of value or investment if it rises 1000%/year on average...

It doesn't depend on the amount of BTCs transferred - rather it depends on how much ["inputs" and "outputs"]( you have. Smallest transactions (1 input, 2 outputs) are around 250 B. If you have many inputs (you received bitcoins to your wallet in many transactions in many small amounts) the size can be more than 1000 or 1500 B.
See inputs, outputs, sizes and fees of transactions e.g. here:
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:05:53
* localbitcoins
* mycelium local trader
* exchanges that do not require registration (or where you can put not exactly correct data) - possibly over Tor and/or (multiple) (anonymous) VPN hops
\+ there should be also some mixing/tumbling options ([mixers?]( or coinjoin or shapeshift into e.g. monero and back)
\+ there is also the plausible deniability ...once you move your bitcoins to your next receiving address in your wallet, nobody can tell (without access to your wallet or its master public key) whether the next address is yours or not (maybe some hacker stole all your bitcoins or maybe you paid someone on the street or maybe it really was your address, but you lost your keys so you don't have those bitcoins anymore)

It's like if you had a briefcase with multiple versions of someone's last will. You can freely choose the one you like &amp; burn the rest. 
Lawyers execute that one document you've chosen, everyone can see that it is kosher, inheritance money move based on that, nobody needs to know what was in the other versions of the last will (or that there were any other versions at all - i.e. any other rules to be used/performed)...
* briefcase with legal documents -&gt; complete script/program (might be typically unknown to others),
* one legal document that was used -&gt; one path in script logic that was revealed (executed with its conditions fulfilled),
* other unused documents -&gt; the rest of script/program remains hidden even after a transaction transfered bitcoins,
* document(s) in briefcase is/are signed by appropriate people &amp; is/are otherwise correct -&gt; parts of the script (paths through it) are captured as hashes in merkle tree,
* you fulfill the conditions to receive the inheritance money (after you picked one of the last wills that suited you best) -&gt; in your bitcoin transaction you revealed part of the script (that is kosher - see previous bullet point) and supplied additional information (e.g. signature with your private) so the script evaluated to true ...which means your transaction is valid and transfers the bitcoins.
Not 100 % analogy, but I hope it helps.

Hello! Welcome.


It's hard for people to learn new things. Bitcoin is very different than anything and very new. So new, laws are not exactly anticipating it - so there is big deal of legal uncertainty. Businesses need to implement technical solutions (POS; implementation into inner information systems; BTC flows) and establish policies (BTC pricing; BTC refunds).


What do you mean by "main"? 
Some businesses accept it - so there it is on par with other currencies and payment systems. If you ask why it is not used ubiquitously - see the previous answer. Businesses have extra work with implementation, and more importantly - people are ignorant (they do not know how evil our fin. system is and they do not know there is an alternative), they do not want to learn new thing and they do not trust new things... Still, the change is happening - more and more people get in touch with Bitcoin/cryptos_as_a_whole, the utility of Bitcoin/cryptos grows every day &amp; will continue to do so for many years to come.

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM was decided (see links in previous post) as the way to go for internet &amp; programs ...hopefully for everything. It avoids confusion, simplifies parsing and sorting, allows clear shorter forms: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -&gt; YYYY-MM-DD -&gt; YYYY-MM.

I believe the initial investments (HW, buildings, personnel) is significant - to recoup that, most miners are receiving per day more than 2 times of their daily costs - even after halving, the significant portion of HW will be left running (even if the original investment will not be received back it will still be rational to leave miners running). 


First - how it is rational to let die Bitcoin (absurd, but let's entertain that idea) if you invested so much in it? How you can sell the miners exactly at the halving?
If you are low- margin miner - why not to sell all HW before the halving &amp; short BTC before halving? (Price goes down before halving, but it will not fall that much after it, or at all...)
Second - hobbyists aren't economically rational? Really? There were no people with larger-scale operations (hundreds of GPUs) back then? People were voluntarily losing money?
I expect that at worst: hashrate will stagnate now and at halving it will go down by 25 %. On the next adjustment or the one after that it will go back where it was before halving. No doom. 
People underestimate how big the momentum of things is in the real world. Also, when thinking about rationality - it is impossible to calculate it right - we can't see all factors, we can't evaluate correctly how important particular factors are. Most often, our fears are crippling first, but laughable later.
I have no fear. All-(savings)-in Bitcoin.

Similar to pay to script hash - but it is more elaborate - there are hashes of all (?) control paths in the (yet unknown to the network) script. The spender needs just to satisfy one control path in the script (i.e. present signatures or whatever) - so the script (it's single control path) evaluates to true and the bitcoins are sent. (The sender reveals only the part of the script that he satisfied, we all know that it is ok, because hash of this control path was in the previous transaction's output.)
One example what that this could allow in a single transaction:

I love how responsive that search is. 
Suggestion - it is cumbersome to put the hand on the mouse &amp; back when I want to see next page(s) of results. Maybe you can implement one of these:
* each TAB press just switches to next results page;
* TAB or ENTER switches focus from search field to results (and back); while if results area is selected: LEFT/RIGHT arrow changes pages (and also other keys would be nice: N/P and for example H/L like in VIM);
* implement some special character in search field (comma?, colon?, dash?), on the right side of it would be the found-items-page number, e.g. this would show the 3rd page seeds results page: 
    seeds,3 
edit: or maybe this: 
* make ";" to switch to next results page and "," to switch to previous page (this is also VIM-like) directly even during writing in the search box (these two characters would not be printed into searchbox)

@_date: 2016-04-19 02:19:18
No idea.
All I know is that miners are used to large price swings and that even miners who will never reach ROI will continue mining after halving if their marginal costs (i.e. daily costs like rent &amp; electricity) are lower than their daily rewards. We have a "big" unknown here - how much are sunk costs (upfront costs like purchase of mining HW, transportation, legal work, training of personnel + eventual site construction costs) - if this is significant part of the total costs (I suspect it is), then halving will have only limited impact on hashrate.

According to my naive understanding: 
No. You need to close the channel for the final transfer (that sums the many transfers going both ways through the channel) to appear on the blockchain. I.e. you have to close the channel for the output (that you can use as input in your next transactions) to even appear in the Bitcoin network (and in blockchain).

People will be pissed off that their sell orders were cancelled and nearly everybody will start using different exchange...
What you describe would be an attempt by exchange operator to artificially increase the price (by cancelling sell orders that are at lower prices) - however, buyers will not be probably wanting to buy at higher price that what they have at other exchanges. =&gt; not only cancelled sellers but also buyers will be leaving =&gt; exchange will bleed money and eventually go bankrupt


If you start selling a large amount of BTC for some altcoin, you will start decreasing BTC price denominated in that altcoin - BTC price in $ will not move unless the person who is buying BTC from you starts selling BTC for $ (or paying marchants who convert it to $ immediately)...
I don't see a problem here - if you sell BTC, you are adding to the "supply" side. 


See my answer to 1) - if you are rigging the supply vs demand equilibrium (which pretty much reflects the equilibrium at other exchanges as arbitrage decreases differences in prices between exchanges) - it will get quickly discovered and your exchange will lose all customers (unless you lock them in by denying $ or BTC withdrawals - but that is already the way straight to hell)...

One of the feats of Bitcoin is that the total amount of the currency is hard-capped. We know there will not be more than 21 million bitcoins. So, the easiest method how to make money with Bitcoin is just to buy &amp; hold. Hopefully, in the future, more and more people will learn to use Bitcoin; with higher demand and limited supply - the price of 1 bitcoin will grow. That being said, we should not forget that Bitcoin has other unique properties - it is censorship free - it is complete alternative to current corrupted financial systems, it's global &amp; inclusive. It's freedom. I am sure people will come with new ways how to use Bitcoin in their businesses.

Ok - so the buttcoin trolls or some other scum maybe jumped to - because they want to harm Bitcoin in general (or us - "the insane lunatics" or something in their view) and they attack you so it appears is the root of all evil. Or can't your most fanatic pro-thermos-pro-corers be false-flag-attacking?!
But let me tell you this: as soon as I realized we can easily have a multireddit ( instead of just I was amazed how many "reddit-friends" I see again. Many reasonable people were outright banned - just because they were discussing alternatives, many other were just disgusted by that approach that was by many considered anti-Bitcoin. If you put all those kind, reasonable people I knew for years from into the same basket as the trolls and psychopaths who are posting death threats - it is very very sad. If you do that, non-bitcoiners can label all of us here as criminals, pedophiles and terrorists and we can't say zilch. 
The reason behind was to have a place where we can freely discuss - in the same way Bitcoin as a whole is where we can do many interesting and deeply humane things, a part of the reality where we can exercise our freedom and our quest for the frontier.

"Number of zeroes (at the beginning of the hash)" is just a (over-)simplification so beginners can easily understand. How it really works is that there is a number called "target" and the hash has to be smaller than this number (or equal). 
If target is 0999 - then it corresponds to "one zero at the beginning". If target is 0099, then it corresponds to "two zeroes at beginning"... But target can also be 0955 or 0345 or 0111 ...all these would correspond to vague "one zero at beginning" - but if you think about the actual rule (hash has to be lower than target (or equal)) - you see that target of 0955 means far lower difficulty than target of 0111.
Note: for simplicity I used 4 decimal digits above - but target is larger than that, see:

People will be creating BTC sell orders with the intention to sell BTC. If you prevent them from doing so they will not be happy. If you - as exchange operator - cancelled their orders (with the ill intention to drive the price higher) they will find that out, if there is no good explanation, they will start uproar. 
Also, the next thing what these sellers would do (remember - those are people who want to get rid of their BTC) will be selling at market price immediately (i.e. fulfilling existing buy orders that are there at the exchange) - which will drive the price down (i.e. the same as if the sell orders were not cancelled and probably even faster). 
If you prevented (would-be-) sellers to sell alltogether (or at least below some price that you choose), they will get mad as they will need to move their BTC to other exchange to sell it there. Also they might potentially lose value if price of BTC decreases globally and they were denied selling at the price they wanted to sell at.

It looks like you don't know how exchanges work. I'll try to explain it simply:
We start with empty orderbook at exchange (no orders). First person comes with $10 and says "I want to buy 4 BTC at price of $2.5 per BTC", so first order is created:
    BUY 4 @ $2.5
Then, other person comes and says "I want to sell 2 BTC, but I want to get $10 for each BTC I sell". This sell order can't be matched with the existing buy order (as seller wants to get more $ for BTC than that buyer is wanting to pay), so new sell order is created (so we already have 2 orders in orderbook):
    SELL 2 @ $10 
    BUY 4 @ $2.5
then, nextperson comes and says "I want to sell 1 BTC, I want at least $1 for it". This order can be matched with our one existing buy order immediately - so this selling person handles 1 BTC and receives $2.5 for it. Existing buy order is adjusted - 1 BTC was already traded and the buyer wants 3 more BTC:
    SELL 2 @ $10 
    BUY 3 @ $2.5
...also, from now on, the exchange will show that the price of BTC at this exchange is $2.5 - as the last trade was 1 BTC for $2.5...
Now, suddenly, demand is rising, we have two new BUY orders:
    SELL 2 @ $10
    BUY 20 @ $9.7 
    BUY 100 @ $8
    BUY 3 @ $2.5
...next person comes and says "Fuck it, I want 1 BTC, no matter the cost" - we have one sell order waiting so this buyer is matched with it. 1 BTC is exchanged for $10 and our orderbook looks like this:
    SELL 1 @ $10
    BUY 20 @ $9.7 
    BUY 100 @ $8
    BUY 3 @ $2.5
...and the exchange reports the price of BTC to be $10 (as last trade was 1 BTC for $10)...
But WTF! Suddenly a very dire news come out! China will be banning bitcoin. Many people panic and we have new person at our exchange saying "OMG, I want to sell 110 BTC, no matter the price". First, it is matched with the highest buy order. Trade is executed: 20 BTC is traded at price of $9.7. Exchange reports price of BTC to be $9.7. However, there are still 90 BTC to be sold at market price - so the next highest buy order is matched and a trade takes place: 90 BTC for $8. Exchange reports price of BTC to be $8. Order book looks like this now:
    SELL 1 @ $10
    BUY 10 @ $8
    BUY 3 @ $2.5
Person with the partially fulfilled buy order (@ $8) panics. "BUY 10 @ $8" order is cancelled, this person creates new buy order with far lower price: "BUY 80 @ $1", order book looks like this:
    SELL 1 @ $10
    BUY 3 @ $2.5
    BUY 80 @ $1
Next person comes: "I want to sell 5 BTC for at least $1.5". First, this sell is matched with existing "BUY 3 @ $2.5" order, trade is executed immediately: 3 BTC for $2.5. Exchange reports price of BTC to be $2.5 (BTC price in last trade). Price is now in freefall. Seller still has 2 BTC to be sold at price $1.5 or above - as there is no other BUY order matching this criteria, sell order is created. Order book looks like this:
    SELL 1 @ $10
    SELL 2 @ $1.5
    BUY 80 @ $1
And the exchange still reports the price of $2.5 per BTC as that was the last trade, but we see that the price will be even lower soon (either $1.5 or even $1 - depending on what of the orders is fulfilled).
So, to summarize:
* there are no elaborate price calculations performed by the exchange - price of BTC is the price of BTC from the last trade that took place; 
* it is not true that orders meet at many prices (at the same time) - sells are always matched with the highest-price buys first and buys are always matches with the lowerst-price sells first.

[number of keys in a multisig script also increased from the maximum of 3 that BIP-11 type multisig accepted to the 15 compressed keys](
[segwit]( - new types of transactions, enhanced script possibilities
[version bits]( - this will allow faster evolution (deploying more softforks at once)
segwit should allow [MAST]( - very recent proposal (it was probably brewing for longer time) - that would IMO allow unprecedented privacy &amp; scripting possibilities - as you would be allowed to have very complex redeeming logic (many branches (control paths) in script with any kind of logic) - of which the redeeming transaction would be putting into blockchain only the part that was actually used (i.e. program branch that - with presented data in the redeeming transaction - evaluated to true)
also there are great promises in lightning network (users will be exchanging signed transactions in a channel - and only after one of the sides decides to close &amp; settle - only after that the final settling transaction will appear in blockchain) - should allow unprecedented scaling and microtransactions

Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Coinbase - exchanges (you need to indentify yourself by ID, utility bills, etc., Kraken needs only address+name for Tier 3 which is ok for normal people), but you have lowest prices there,
Coinbase, Circle - resellers - also need ID, a bit more expensive, but easier
Localbitcoins - even more expensive - but you get the benefit of meeting Bitcoin enthusiasts in person ;)


Try them all! 
I like Electrum  (already in Ubuntu/Debian/TAILS repositories) and Mycelium  the most - but try also other ones so you have a comparison...


There exists something like HD wallets and what not - but I still use completely isolated wallets (different wallet on mobile, different wallet at PC, different wallet for cold storage) as it has benefits and it is easy to send BTC from PC wallet to mobile wallet.

Eventually they would have all lanes optimized. They just don't need to switch everything to segwit immediately (it would create unnecessary transactions). Instead, gradual shift is possible when old style addresses are used as before/now and segwit addresses are introduced for new incoming transfers (incoming from users as deposits or incoming from their cold storage to be then split into requested withdrawals).

Reason for price differences is usually not some wrongdoing at exchanges, price usually differs because the demand and supply varies and because perfect arbitrage is not possible for some reason.
For example, price in EU and USA exchanges might be near $16000 but in China, the price could be e.g. $20000 - this e.g. because people in China want BTC more at the moment (i.e. larger demand). Arbitrage that would drive those prices together would be working like this: people in EU or USA will be buying BTC for 16000, they will transfer this BTC to exchange in China, sell it there for $20000 and then they will send these $20000 (fiat money) from the Chinese's exchange Chinese bank to their bank in EU/USA so they can repeat the cycle and again buy next BTC in exchange in EU/USA. Buying BTC in EU/USA will drive the price up there and selling the same BTC in China will drive the price in China down - so eventually the price might be the same everywhere (say $18000)...  
However, sending fiat money might be restricted or might not work at all (i.e. China not allowing $ transfers from China to EU or USA) - then the arbitrage would not be possible and the prices will be different in China and in EU/USA. Or there are usually fiat conversion fees playing role in this - exchange in China operates not in $ but in RMB. Conversion RMB-&gt;$ might be costly and the bank transfer might be costly =&gt; so the arbitrage will not be profitable unless the BTC price difference is really big between exchanges.

Variance. Block time can be anything between few seconds and few hours. Block time follows [Exponential distribution]( with mean of 10 minutes. It's exponential because in every moment, the probability that the block will be found in next second is constant. 
From that distribution (with that mean of 10 minutes) you can calculate that e.g. every week or so there will be 1 block with block time higher than 1 hour.

Current system can very easily turn into totalitarianism. Less freedom, more fear, more nationalism/fascism/whatever. Then, those immense capabilities to spy and to change people's lives will be turned against all citizens - especially those who still dare to think on their own and who dare to voice their opinion. 
If you once say/write something that might be seen as being against the system/state, you will get watched and your life will be systematically destroyed by them if you do it again. Even peaceful alternatives would be seen as attacks.
Today the capabilities of the secret services are unfathomably larger than it was 50 years ago. With facebook where people voluntarily tag all people on photos and voluntarily create webs of all their friends and where they put everything from their life; with smart-/spy- phones that track every your move and sound; with complete surveillance of the net where they read your every mail and analyze all your clicks and keypresses - ...they can cheaply gather vast amounts of information that they can then use to destroy lives. One of the ways will be blocking money - when all people have are credit/debit cards, it is very easy for authorities to cut people/businesses completely from their money ("money"). People who - to remedy that - will be creating alternative systems of value exchange will be targeted.

Inputs are the "pieces" of bitcoin(s) that you own and that you are sending in your transaction. These pieces are the outputs of the previous receiving transactions (BTC that you received to your address/addresses).
The more inputs you have in your transaction the higher fee you would need to pay to have the same priority. When network is busy, it is highly recommended to create transactions with only one input. You should enable "Coins" tab in your Electrum and select 1 suitable input there. If you have many pieces (many rows in Coins tab), you should consolidate these when the network is the least busy, which you can see here:
\- fee for next block is 400 sat/B, but I believe this will drop below 50 sat/B in upcoming week or two... Also look here:
In Electrum, be sure to enable RBF (enables "Replaceable" checkbox when sending transaction) - this will let you increase fee of existing (unconfirmed) transaction. In combination with this, you can set the fee manually to very low value and increase it later if needed (be sure to enable manual fee setting in menu).

Volatility is going down if you don't get distracted by the oscillations... Take rolling average over 3 or 4 years. 
If you need more nuanced view: There is a cycle - big fast rally and then slower stagnation and depression. Price during rallies in 2013 was more volatile than during the rally in 2017 - so, there is a reason for optimism. Also, if you hate volatility, you can shield yourself against it by cost averaging yourself in (or out eventually)...

Bubble means that it is already overvalued - that too many people are buying just for profit and that a lot of people will be dumping as soon as the price starts going down/falling.
Speculation means that there are significant risks but that there is also some possibility for huge gain. 
"Speculation therefore it must be bubble" is wrong reasoning. E.g. look at Apple stock after the dot com bubble (i.e. after 2001) - there was speculation, but it was not bubble. In the same way, we all might be speculating with buying Bitcoin - but still it might turn out that Bitcoin is very much undervalued at this point.
I can speculate with land - I can try to buy land where I expect/hope new highway will be constructed - so I can sell or rent that land for gas station or other infrastructure. This doesn't mean that there is bubble in the price of the land.

Use Electrum with RBF enabled and set manual fee according to what we see here:
the "best fee" recommendation will get you quite reliably into one of the following blocks (unless there is spike in network usage coming) and you can also guess what is a cheaper fee with a chance to get confirmed relatively quick if miners get lucky and find 3 or 4 quick blocks (look at rightmost column - and use fee where there is 3 MB or less of waiting transactions).
If you are unlucky and fees go up suddenly (spike in network usage), you can still use RBF to bump fee if your transaction is urgent. Keep in mind the variance in block times - there can be 5 blocks in 5 minutes and also 1 block in 3 hours.  For longer time stats, this is best:
...there we see that transactions under 100sat/B were confirmed in recent hours.

If there were only 1 sat/B transactions, all you would need to do to get into block would be to set 2 sat/B fee. (Which is a tiny fee.) 
The fact that you need to pay relatively high fee (e.g. 140 sat/B) comes from the need to compete with transactions that pay similar fees - i.e. 100 - 140 sat/B. If these are present in mempool, to get confirmations, you are forced to set higher fee than these. 1 sat/B transactions play no role in this.
Space in block is limited to 1 MB and highest bidders get into it. It's like if you are a seller in city market and if you had 10 unique pieces of fruit/art/whatever that you need to sell before the end of the day. (To get the largest profit,) You will wait for people to give you offers and then, at the end of the day you will sell those 10 to 10 people offering largest prices - say ranging from $10 to $18. It's completely irrelevant if there are none or ten or thousand people who offer to buy at the price of $0.01. These will never be selected by the seller and these also do not influence how much people who really want to buy will be willing to pay...

Look [here]( - both 2013 bubbles were steeper &amp; higher percentage-wise (from $13 to $230 it was 17 times up, from $70 to $1100 it was 15 times up); for the largest bubble (from $1 to $30 - 30 times up) switch to Mt. Gox (USD) in top left corner. 
Edit: Currently we have like 13 times up if we count from $1000 - as before it felt more like return to mean. I would predict that the bubble that seems to me is just starting will pop above $20000-30000...

Miners can mine empty blocks - every new block that is found lets miner send 12.5 BTC to her/his address. This is called "block reward" and it was 50 BTC at beginning. This was a way how to introduce bitcoins among people - everybody who was running mining software was receiving BTC. 
The second part of the bounty - besides block reward - are transaction fees. Miner is allowed to send fees of all transactions included in block to her/his address too (together with block reward). Because the total amount of BTC is hardcapped at 21M, fees will be the larger part of miners income in few years.

This needs to be true for any money or currency, then. But Bitcoin is more than that - it is also a technology platform that allows new technologies to be developed and flourish. It is also a social phenomenon - it has its community and it carries very significant contrast to what we have now. Partly joking I often say that the most important thing Bitcoin does is that it opens minds of people - that it shows that there are other alternative ways that are working or can work - ways that are not encumbered with all that vampires who control things in our current 
financial&amp;political system.


It is currency - it is circulating, you can exchange it for many things. It is perfect currency for high value (and especially cross-border) value transfer. It is perfect for people oppressed in totalitarian regimes. Relatively higher fees (how much you will pay when transferring fiat to Iran or Ghana?) are just a minor temporary nuisance.

According to [this]( the distribution is exponential. See [the distribution function of exponential distribution]( 
Let's define the scale of x axis like this: x are multiples of 10 minutes (i.e. result for x=1 is what we have for 10 minutes; result for x=6 is what we have for 1 hour, etc.) - then lambda is equal to 1 (mean is 1 on x axis, i.e. 10 minutes).

It was a few months after bitcoin-24 shutdown - on the same web address there were some instructions. IIRC there was some form that you printed out and signed and scanned and mailed back - then BTCs were returned/sent to address that you specified - there - somehow - ...I don't remember much.
There was also donation page - and I even donated to that guy because my BTCs were returned so (relatively) fast.

These words are quite harsh. "pumpers", really? Two years ago, transactions without fee were mined regularly &amp; we all were sharing this fact with others. So we all were pumpers? Like pumpers-dumpers?
Also, the complete transfer of bitcoins takes a while; but the (notification of) pending transaction is nearly instant. This is quite valuable if you deal with people who do not try to fuck you over. You see immediately that your friend sent the transaction correctly &amp; all you need to do is to wait. If you say categorically that "Bitcoin is not instant" you are losing these nuances.

It is very hard for most of the people to get involved - I wrote a bit more about this [here]( This doesn't mean that Bitcoin is doomed - it is open for innovation (&amp; business), so with better wallets/exchanges/... it gets easier every year.
Bitcoin is very resilient (P2P), it is adapting (opensource), it is global, it has other unique features that you simply can't get otherwise (limited supply, immunity to shutdown, nearly instant transfers, plausible deniability, ...). 
Hype cycles come and go - these depend largely on the price upswings. We have seen many of those already. Every single time, (mainstream) media is full of the death of Bitcoin. There will be next price upswing, next bubble, next hype cycle, next media frenzy and next wave of 'Bitcoin is dead' articles.

Less insignificant than those things you mentioned. Bitcoin's influence grows every day. E.g. [30 of the largest banks in R3]( are now trying to find out how blockchain works thanks to Bitcoin. Hundreds of thousands of people - including me - went from ignorance and apathy ("Inflation is good for you!", "Banks do good job, no need for anything else!", ...) to active research and doing something about the miserable situation we are in.


Hahahaha. You believe that? Really? Uh.


Gold backed currencies were working quite fine - unless the backing was dropped so the rulers can go away with batshitcrazy inflation.
No, it doesn't restrict economic growth. 


And as such it must be deteriorating fast in our hands so we are forced to give it to the next loser, right.


There are billion+ of poor people who would be able to save small amounts every month ...this can make a difference in 10/20/30 years - providing there is no inflation enforced by bankers. 


No. Miners are not that significant. Most important is the economic majority, the full nodes, the community and developers. Limited supply of bitcoins is the most fundamental thing. If miners try to change this, there will be retaliation - even the change of the hash function which will render their ASIC farms useless.


Nonsense. You can temporarily go back to GPU mining &amp; design the hash function to either be ASIC resistant (see Ethereum) or at least discourage ASICs (hash function can changing every month for example).


You can either use Tor or you can encode bitcoin traffic into other data streams.


For me the experience is far better. Using it is nice, it is cool to know how everything works, the feeling that the system is honest is nice (nobody is robbing you of value by secret devaluating the currency).

Big opportunities I see:
* **savers** - markets are in bubble (?), fiat "money" is deprecating quickly, confications; ...once Bitcoin is more known &amp; established it will make sense for ordinary people to keep some percents of their wealth in BTC;
* **underground and people with uncomfortable opinions** (uncomfortable to our rulers - and I am not talking about 'terrorists' in classical sense), I still remember the totalitarian communist state - and it was something fucking unbeliavable (you said something in a pub and your children were denied education, you were denied to leave the country, etc.), current situation (everybody linking &amp; communicating on the internet) can turn into the worst totalitarian nightmare really quick &amp; easy;
* **unbanked** - there are billions of people who either can't get banking services at all or who at least suffer a lot thanks to inflation (poor people (not the poorest) have no time to search for investments); 
* **internet** - once you are in Bitcoin and you have some bitcoin savings it is a breeze to pay for services on the internet; earning BTC from people you "never saw" is out of this world completely;
* **remittances or donations** to some distant parts of the world - less or none intermediaries - you can easily give money to your family in 3rd world - or donate to a boy in Nepal or Sudan - once they have BTC wallet and you trust the communication channel with them/him (IM, photo with QR, ...);
* **internet of things and AI** - machines can pay to machines easily with BTC; NFC BTC payments are in the works - paying could be as easy as holding your hand close to drone terminal or driver-less taxi door.


More people using it &amp; more people doing the development of core and the surrounding infrastructures and services. To me it feels that the genie is out of the bottle already and the avalanche is already rolling.

No. Either there will be no hashing or the hashing must be known to full nodes too (if there will be any) - as full nodes need to validate the blocks - i.e. recalculate the hash for the block among other things.
Designed miners would be probably signing blocks with their special miner-keys. Maybe there will be no need for hashing at all.
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:24:07
You can get QR from your Mycelium mobile wallet or Electrum PC wallet (if you print it) or every paper wallet has 2 QR codes - one is the BTC address.
QR code usually contains only the BTC address (or the private key in case of paper wallet - but you shouldn't show this to anybody), but QR codes which also indicate how much BTC should be sent can be created, too. However, in BTC ATMs, you use the first kind - QR codes which contain the BTC address only. You either choose the $ amount on the machine's screen or it will recognize the amount by itself (it counts the banknotes &amp; you just press 'buy' then).

Yes. However you are far more likely to buy high and sell low. We are prone to get emotional - it if goes up we are having FOMO (fear of missing out) and we buy even when it is overpriced already; if it goes down, we fear it will continue down &amp; sell even lower than we bought. 
You can see [here]( (switch to 1w and zoom out) how wildly the price can behave.
This is all because there is no entity in Bitcoin which will be regulating it (its price). The price is a direct result of (the amount of) supply and demand. You can see supply (red line at bottom) and demand (green line at bottom) [here]( (this is on one of the exchanges). There are some big players who have enough fiat/bitcoin money to induce significant price swings (and buy/sell panics) so they can profit.
All this is nice and fun (if you do not invest too much), but the price is only small part of the whole. Read [FAQ]( and the other things in that wiki and in sidebar (right hand side here). Researching Bitcoin is like falling deep down through the rabbit hole - you will see many things differently, you will learn things you never imagined can become true. Many of us believe this will change the world.

Ah, this economic growth mumbo-jumbo. 
Spending as fast as possible leads to worse results than saving and then using savings when the big opportunity arises (or when the shitstorm season suddenly comes). 
Next, in an environment where money is limited (as opposed to the current system where mandarins print unlimited money out of thin air with false pretenses for their profit) if some portion of money is locked as savings, the rest rises in value - thereby increasing purchasing power of he rest of the population. If a half of the population accumulate savings aggressively for prolonged periods of time, value of (available) money rises significantly - so the second half of population that is spending can and do buy more things.
Also I hate to be supporting your "economic growth" - when this means decimating resources unnecessarily and littering our lives with throwaway thrash.
To discourage saving and to (over)stimulate investing (and also taking loans) leads to malinvestment. The harder you push for investing and growth the worse it comes back to bite you in the ass when the realization comes that things are not sustainable. 
All cocaine and no sleep is not a good way to live. Sooner or later you will drop down utterly exhausted / dead.
TL;DR: saving is good

This "should be" is misleading. It is faster than the [projections]( which are calculated for constant hashrate (i.e. for constant 6 blocks/hour) - note there is "Year (**estimate**)" in the table.
In fact, it is as fast as it should be - hashrate grew since the last retarget (i.e. difficulty adjustment), so the blocks are coming little faster than 6/hour. But this is how it should work.
The next retarget will make the (average) speed 6/hour again for a while: [the difficulty is set such that the previous 2016 blocks would have been found at the rate of one every 10 minutes]( 
After a few hours it can again get 6+/hour (on average) if hashrate continue to grow or under 6/hour if hashrate goes down.

You are still thinking only about one single nefarious miner that mines a lot of blocks. Then it could make sense to refuse to switch to her (heavier - because she had 51%+) blockchain ...but it is technically impossible. You can't recognize that case (nefarious miner) from the case when you get "normal" network split - i.e. when some parts of the Bitcoin network are isolated from other parts of the Bitcoin network (i.e. e.g. when city/country/datacenter with miners loses connectivity to internet outside).
Also, there is also problem with this:


...in a distributed environment, this is not realizable (short of making new version of Bitcoin Core with hash of latest "non-rewinding chain" block and forcing everybody to use this new hard-forking version). Who will say what chain is the correct one? 
In very exceptional cases - e.g. if new heavier blockchain appeared which unwinds like 1000+ blocks of the current main chain - developers could be able to do just the above (release new version of Core which will refuse this new blockchain - if there is evidence that it is indeed evil) - but look how much chaos is there with regard to hard-forks (recent block size debate).

Yes, when hashrate is rising, the Bitcoin network is releasing new bitcoins faster (and processing more transactions) compared to situation when the hashrate is constant.
But nowhere it is set in stone that constant hashrate is how it "should be". It is more natural that the hashrate is rising (network grows, computers are getting faster), and therefore that the blocks are little more frequent than 6/hour and that it takes little less than 4 years between halvings.

This is not about your personal internet being cut out. This is about a large area (area with many nodes and significant miners) losing connection to the rest of the internet (and therefore the rest of the Bitcoin network). Miners in this isolated large area will be mining - this will create a chain that appears to be perfectly valid - until your area reconnects to the rest of the internet. Then all nodes (&amp; miners) in your area need to switch to heavier chain - which is the correct main chain if you take global view. 
A long chain which is "ultimately not the correct one" can happen also when the network splits for other reason (than cutting lines to outside internet) - as happened in that March hard-fork - when half of the miners were creating different blockchain than the rest (due to the incompatibility between 0.8 and 0.7 ( 0.8 allowed larger blocks)). As you can see in the post mortem I linked in previous reply, the situation was solved by politely asking 0.8 miners to downgrade to 0.7, so the 0.7 chain went heavier &amp; was then picked up as the correct one by all nodes.
@_date: 2015-12-21 15:57:25
GHash.IO was near 50 % some time ago, look where are they now after community backlash. 
Miners' best interest is to help Bitcoin network - so their revenue grows. 
Community/developers has one ace up their sleeve - (the threat of) change of hash-function. That would be an ultimate 'fuck you' to all the miners if they want to harm the network. Imagine how their faces would look like if their multi-million investments turn into (sub)zero in an instant.

No, it is (very closely) the same computational effort to mine 100 KB and 10 MB block. 


Yes, number of full nodes might go down as bigger bandwidth is required for larger blocks. However - it is questionable. If the utility of Bitcoin attracts many more users, it is possible that the number off full nodes will rise. Tiny blocks leading to high fees might divert many people from using Bitcoin.


The bigger block, the larger chance to have the block orphaned - if you are not well connected to the majority of the other miners (because it takes time to propagate the block through the network to other miners). So, it is possible that bigger block will force miners to "get closer" together. There are fears that if majority of hashpower is located at one place - this place could be controlled/shutdown/forced_to_do_something_nasty/etc.
TL;DR: Main objection is that bigger blocks might decrease the level of decentralization (of both full nodes and miners).

Not only this - once you have 51 %, you can do anything (excluding spending of bitcoins of others). You can choose a block with any block number and start mining your chain from it - sooner or later you will make your chain heavier than the current main chain of the network. You can completely disable all transactions, you can OTOH include all transactions from the current chain and add some more spam transactions, you can double spend your bitcoins...

Either totally unsignificant or little too prone to shutdown by (state) violence.


Yes, until rulers forced inferior money upon us.


This is bullshit. 


Why? Because cash absolutely must be a hot potato?


Poor are fucked by inflation. They have no time/education/connections/... to search for investments and the inflation robs them of the chance to save and have better life in the future.


Money that is the real money (i.e. store of value), money that is not controlled/abused (i.e. supply is limited and predicable).


Rollback was not that significant &amp; pool operators are not owners of the hashrate. Also, if miners try to fuck us over, hash function can be changed.


Censor locally? How?




I didn't say that all of these aspects are totally original. Einstein's relativity uses work of Lorenz &amp; Riemann &amp; god knows who else - this doesn't mean that Theory of relativity wasn't a massive shift in our understanding of universe. 
Bitcoin uses things from previous works (BitTorrent, Hashcash, limited supply as in e-gold / Liberty Dollar, ...) - but the uniqueness is that Bitcoin wraps all that together into a viable system. E-gold and Liberty dollar didn't influence many people as these were little too vulnerable to shutdown by our ruling class (govsters/banksters) who was having monopoly for money. Not anymore. Bitcoin is our alternative, our freedom.

To be able to use bitcoins from addresses which didn't send bitcoins before (i.e. public key is not known - this is recommended, you should use new address for every transaction you make), you would have to break two things simultaneously - both the hash function and the private-public cryptography function. There is 0 chance of that happening. If one of those is broken, which is quite unlikely, Bitcoin can be updated to cope with that.

I don't know whether internet boomed from 0 to millions in 7 years or not - but Bitcoin is greater paradigm shift than the internet. Internet is just computers connected together. You had computer before, add to it a way to exchange information with others - like telephone or telegraph between computers... Does it sound that different from what was there before? And now think about this: 
* money that is not created and enforced by any state; 
* money that really is money and not only shitty devaluating currency - if at least the same amount of users use it, its value will go up!;
* money that is sound even when it was created by unknown entity;
* money and payment system that is global, uncensorable, 10-100 times faster than other payment systems, evolving, open to everybody, extensible...
You have more than 5 characteristics there, every single one completely out of this world. So hard to grasp for ordinary people - and worse - it's the most sensitive thing - money, wealth, the thing we torture ourselves everyday to collect so we can live till the next day... This is not just wiring computers together so they can interchange information. This a miracle, a change so big nobody thought possible just a few years ago.

There are billions of people on Earth who have no access to investments. They just make a little cash, they could be putting 1 % or 5 % of it aside ...if that had any fucking sense. With 5+ % inflation in 1st world and 15+ % in 3rd world, there is no way to improve your life by saving if you are poor (I am not talking about the poorest who are hungry all the time).

This single thing is crazy. What would he do? 
Next, there could be hundreds of kids under 25 years who will be worth $10,000,000+ ..."just" because they mined on their GPUs &amp; believed in Bitcoin for the next 10 years. How crazy the parties they are going to throw can be? How much they can change the cities around them? (...possibly creating hubs of Bitcoin culture &amp; economy...)
The price movement alone but also all the other feats of Bitcoin would bring hundred or thousand times more developers and entrepreneurs into the game. All those new apps and ways to use Bitcoin. This can radically change our lives - the way we work, the way we interact in our local communities, the way we bond in the cyberspace. 
But it isn't about the rich. It is about the poor vast majority (750+ million Bitcoin users) - mind you (and the trolls) - not the poorest who are hungry and with no money at all, but all the poor people who can spare $0.05 - $1 /day. People like that could accumulate the savings and get out of their misery.
This could be like the most radical phase change in the history of mankind. Suddenly, in just a few years, billions of people from "2nd" and 3rd world would be able to join the global commerce (and not only that).

Price going down to 10 % would be nothing new here - it could even be positive, too. Many people wanted to buy cheaper than the current price. And more importantly - Bitcoin will show that it can survive very difficult times.

Yes it will. There were more than 7 blocks in a row orphaned in [March 2013 hardfork](

Again, if your city/country/datacenter/continent/planet was isolated for a few hours from the rest of the internet, your chain will be significantly shorter. After your reconnect to the rest of the Internet, if you refuse to switch to the (legit) heavier blockchain, you cut yourself out of the ("main") Bitcoin network forever - so you and the nodes around you will be hard-forked &amp; will be using different blockchain than the rest of the world.

Bitcoin network is switching to blocks of version 4. These can include transactions with new script operator [OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]( which allows you to create transactions which send bitcoins - but these bitcoins can be used again only after certain amount of time which you specify in your transaction (you can say: I am giving you these bitcoins, but you will not be able to spend those for e.g. 2 years...).
As you can see in the link above, this is BIP-65 (this stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The logic is already in the newest Bitcoin client (Bitcoin Core) version, but it can only be used if enough participants (specifically miners) agree. They do this by mining blocks with the new version (4). You can see [here]( that 950 of the last 1000 blocks are already in ver 4. This will trigger the enforcement - blocks of version 3 will not be valid from now on.

* Shared security - individuals place web cameras (in their windows/balconies/doors/gardens) and also maintain parts of the infrastructure, everybody from the block of flats or neighborhood can pay via BTC payment channels to get webcam/sensor feeds or simply donate to people who maintain the local network of security devices.
* Sky eye - owner and operator of flying camera drones gets paid for flying to certain destinations &amp; streaming video from there or taking pictures. (Pics of culture events, remotely inspecting your property from above, tracking vehicles (?!), watching traffic/weather, ...).
* Artist workshop - marketplace for arts with a twist - you can request personalized items (ranging from just simple personalized notes from authors to complete new pieces of art based on something you provide (e.g. the same graphic art but in color palette that you provide - so it fits in your living room or new oil paintings based on photograph you provided...)) ...or just give and discuss ideas for new art pieces.
* Tele-operation - kid is "playing a simulator" on her PC, but in fact she is controlling your remotely-operated device (lawnmover, vacuum cleaner, excavator, security robot :), ...) or keeping an eye on your driverless car that is driving to your location.

Bitcoin is very hard to grasp for ordinary people. Building trust in the Bitcoin system takes months and requires substantial research &amp; technical and economical understanding. In a financial turmoil like that in Greece, people are distracted by other things so they are not able to do the "work" required. 
There were probably only a few hundreds/thousands bitcoiners in Greece before the crisis. If the situation repeats in 10 years, when e.g. hundreds of thousands or millions of people in the crisis zone already researched &amp; experimented with Bitcoin (even having a wallet already), the situation might be different.

Just buy and hold for at least 2 years. The supply is limited to 21,000,000 BTC, many users will be probably joining - so there is chance that the price will go up (significantly).
I recommend doing [cost averaging]( - you fight volatility with this, but it has also other benefits - initially you have smaller amount &amp; you have time to learn how to secure bitcoins. It also helps, because at no point in time you have too much money on the exchange (it is advisable not to leave bitcoins at exchanges). So - split your budget into 8 - 16 parts &amp; buy every (other) week for example.

I wouldn't call the first case vandalization - someone might heard some rumor and thought it to be true (also note the word "assumed"). You are very active in Bitcoin space - 6000+ posts on Bitcointalk, thousand(s) in you said that you **do** believe bitcoin is technically sound, you have deep technical understanding - I can understand people who think this implies you also own bitcoins. (BTW - do you want to deny that you acquired any non-trivial amount of BTC ever?)
The second occurrence might be considered vandalization - but a hilarious one in that. "while spending much of his time trolling the bitcointalk forums", lol. Also very recent edit - might be triggered by your satire activity in I have nothing against your person. I admire how you can keep researching a thing when you are convinced it is wrong and will not work. I would be glad to find out in the future what are your "economic-side" thoughts regarding Bitcoin - i.e. why you are convinced it can't work economically. I am sorry I called your idea retarded - but I simply can't fathom that some experiment can be **"hijacked"** to be used as money. Bitcoin is used as money, because it is money - it has the properties of money, it is useful - for example: someone paid me with bitcoins for my work, I bought games with bitcoins, I donated bitcoins (i.e. some value) to charity... Open source developers / community cannot force something that has not the right properties to be money, can they? We are not the state, people have freedom in choosing what to use (with regards to Bitcoin, fiat OTOH is enforced by state).

I have different experience &amp; different perspective than you.


Yes, but it has faster cycles which is better. We don't have huge build up and huge crash every 15 - 30 years, we have milder (relatively) effects every 2 years. By cost averaging, you can prevent these volatility risks.




You probably don't have an experience from a totalitarian country. I am not going to argue with you. See [here]( ...but this is just a tip of the possible iceberg.


First, I don't think so. Second, it is not relevant.


I was very scared to use my debit card on the internet. Chargebacks are not that common in EU I think &amp; it is just wrong to let somebody draw money from your (single - I had only one account and that was it) account - even more frightening when it is a merchant from foreign country. So, I made like total of 3 purchases on the internet with my card - all only recently, none in the first 10 years, every time I was annoyed with filling out all those info about me. 




First, Bitcoin overcomes many hurdles - there are great difficulties with sending money to some countries. Second, think bigger - once the local people have a place to spend BTC, no currency exchange takes place. Even people in remote locations of the 3rd world could be buying e.g. digital goods soon. Or it would make sense for charitable first-worlders to go there &amp; start BTC businesses.


This simply is not true at all. 


Ok, add one confirmation click to it on your watch or eye movement &amp; blink registered by your goggles. With my NFC debit card, people can steal from me already (as I said I haven't heard about chargebacks from people around me, I don't even know if it is possible here - and even if it is, it is a wrong way to go).

Download &amp; install Electrum. For significant amounts of bitcoins, you should generate your wallet on offline machine &amp; use only seedless wallet on your online machine. (So you have 2 separate wallets - cold &amp; hot. For occasional transfers from cold wallet to hot wallet you do "offline signing" - you create the transaction on the online machine, then transfer it via USB disk to offline machine, sign it there &amp; then take it back to online machine from where you broadcast it - this way your private key(s) never touches anything connected to the internet.)

It might be even worse than that - bankers might practically rule the world nowadays (they can print money and simply buy anything/anyone). 
What we think here is that banks do pretty lousy job. It feels like they formed a cartel - also thanks to state regulation that is playing for them, not against them - and ceased to innovate decades ago while they abuse their monopoly. 
There are hurdles everywhere, currency that is a hot potato instead of money as it is dissolving in your hands. They mine you for data, they charge you exorbitantly. They use your "money" (that you deposit) for their purposes - they invest it and still they will be charging you the more you saved (thanks to negative interest rate). 
On top of it all, they want to get rid of the cash so they can point at you and switch you poor faster than you can blink ...maybe just because you expressed somewhere your ideas or because you wanted to entertain your constitution-ensured freedoms. You have millions now and you will not be able to buy a single bottle of water one second later.

Bitcoin has the potential to make things far more transparent - which could help to remove inefficiencies. 
All government contracts should be made public, all money operations done by the government should be done on public ledger.

So, GT is not the right indicator here.


I subtract the effect of the last huge bubbles - and I see clear (slow, compared to the craze during bubbles) uptrend. Also, I see how people around me who were ignoring Bitcoin for months are (very) slowly warming up for it. One year ago, there were no professors obsessing about Bitcoin, now you have here at least one: I believe we are dealing here with something so rudimentary that people would need years to grasp the new concepts and to change their worldviews.

Colored coins: you use Bitcoin network to send other-than-bitcoin tokens. Tokens which are in fact small amounts of bitcoins distinguished by specially crafted addresses or tokens sent in data payload of Bitcoin transactions - all these sent/received by special wallets. These tokens can function as altcoins or e.g. as shares. Examples: Counterparty, Mastercoin, Colored coins.
Sidechains: the idea to have more blockchains. Besides the main Bitcoin blockchain there would be more other blockchains tied to the main chain in such a way that you can send bitcoins from the main chain to side chain and back (on the sidechain it will either remain a bitcoin or it can be turned into some other token/coin/whatever in given rate). It seems that there are mathematical operations that allow this - "lock" given amount of bitcoins on main chain and "unlock" (appropriate amount of) tokens on selected sidechain. One example of sidechain could be bitcoin sidechain (merge mined with the main chain) with faster block times or checkpointed sidechains without the need of keeping the whole history (usable for microtransactions/trades/...), etc. Many new possibilities!

$300/$0.05 = 6000 = 600,000.0 %
But - it was very little chance for you to be "that early there" and in the mood for buying (such infant technology) and you would probably sell with 10x to 100x profit (5000x+ is really utterly unbelievable) ...or lose all that thanks to scams / mistakes / negligence...

Try to send it without fee (if your client allows that). Worst that can happen is that your transaction will become stale and eventually will be deleted from the network (and you will be able to retry). But more likely is that the transaction will go through after some hours/days even without the fee. 
If your client forces you to include a fee (like 0.0001 BTC) - include it and the remaining 0.1999 BTC will be sent and will appear in your new wallet. The standard fee that is enforced by clients is enough for nearly all transactions you can be sending. Again, if it doesn't go through, you can retry later with a bit bigger fee.

This is not true. Bitcoin is inherently different because you can "store bitcoins" in your head only. It's different than remembering your bank password because you do not need a bank at all and it is different than memorizing some hidden place where you stashed cash/gold/... - because it is not tied to a physical location and physical items, you can access and use bitcoins from anywhere.
Current state of banking is abhorrent. It's more like they are enslaving us than that they are providing us useful service. Banks might be useful and they may be appearing in Bitcoins space too - but with Bitcoin, we need them less. Many things they are doing are solved and being done by technology. Think ubiquitous wireless mesh networks and computer implants (HW wallets).


They are abusing the power they have because they can create value from nothing by doing nothing. The whole system is rotten and Bitcoin presents an alternative. An alternative that is completely independent, an alternative that will make people think why things are as they are now and how can we think differently. That is one of the most important features of Bitcoin - it shows people that the (financial) world can be very different. People, don't be afraid of new things! ;)
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:14:17


No, supply of bitcoins is fixed, the price will rise instead. It's maybe common sense for fiat currencies where you do not have infinite divisibility - so you cannot let eg. dollar rise 10,000 times in value, because you could not pay for small items then (unless you introduce smaller units than cents).

I think this was not the (main) design goal - although it can eventually happen. Mainstream adoption will mean less volatility.


I truly believe FED and all the politicians are corrupt as fuck. I also believe current "economists" with their propaganda are just bunch of assholes and anything but scientists. They are basically just selling us the idea that it is best if they print the money. It is simple but they are trying hard to make us believe the whole thing is so complicated that nobody but them should stick a nose into it.
And it is not my ideology - it is my experience that no big state-controlled (or state-controlling :D) monopoly company can create any significant innovation - and certainly not something so groundbreaking so anti-fragile and so pure as Bitcoin is.

Yes I suppose - if you do not want to use their escrow.




Yes. Everything you need to have for future access to your bitcoins on your savings address is a private key on paper. Also interesting paper wallet is Electrum seed - with it you can restore your Electrum wallet (online or offline) with infinite BTC addresses.
I would say: just buy for $10 or $50 and play with it - try Electrum on your PC that is connected to Internet, try blockchain info online wallet, try Mycelium/Schildbach. Security concerns are relevant when you have more money in bitcoins - but for initial learning it is better just to use smaller sum and test everything available.

Nothing is free. You are paying for it in some other way (or eventually someone else is paying for it.


Just wait 1 or 2 years, you will have solutions as simple as this.


Bitcoin is more efficient than current payment networks, it is open (you can see how the program works, what transactions are made, you can contribute to development), it's "monetary policy" algorithm is not prone to nasty mismanagement we see done in case of fiat, no unlimited inflation as a way to continuously steal hard earned value from people. You might not agree, but for me these feats are truly revolutionary. The potential is so huge. And we are just at the beginning, Bitcoin is just 5 years old. People with no imagination compare it to systems which are in use for 50, 100 years which are polished and deeply rooted in peoples' minds - but it is like comparing the very first bulky smelly weak combustion engine with ubiquitous workhorses. Horses were good, but motors turned out to be far far more useful despite the initial unfavorable comparison.

Regarding BTC address naming shorthand - I quite liked blockchain.info first-bits (unfortunatelly it is broken there for weeks now). You entered first 3 - 7 characters (depending on the first occurence in blockchain) and the search box found your address - eg. "1LZypP" gave you "1LZypP1J8PUkMyXgbPP4jQ7Rxyu31GtH6y"...
I had an idea to use similar system to encode first bits as Electrum uses for seed. You could encode first bits as words. So that "1LZypP" would become "grass stone bus" (or whatever combination of 2 or 3 words)... You could even use the last 2 characters as checksum and tell your friend to send 10 BTC to "grass stone bus 6 Y".
Note the above doesn't need central registration authority - everybody with complete blockchain would be able to infer all "word firstbits" for all addresses.

TAT quit management also of other assets, not just NEOBEE - so, this might be unrelated. Or - it is a sign of something bigger happening (like coordinated pressure from banks and/or government(s) or something like that).
I think what NEOBEE was doing was too elaborated to be a scam. You simply do not build a physical location and you do not star first-class advertisement campaign in all media if you want to run with the money... I think they really believe in the thing they do - they just encountered some problems perhaps. They are in the front lines so to speak. We didn't expect that everything will go smooth.

"This is supposed to be the warm period, but we are 20 below zero! ...What will the ice age look like then?!". It might turn out that the ice age will be colder on average than the warm period, but that the usual temperature will be way higher than the lowest points during warm period. ;)

Bitcoin mining is self regulating - if there are too much miners and too low reward, some of them stop mining and the rest receives more reward. Note that Bitcoin network can work with lower hashrate just fine.


See the common myth linked from the sidebar [here]( It is not waste. Bitcoin is superior to other money &amp; money payments networks in terms of resources. Also consider we are in high monetary inflation (in [110]( weeks, bitcoin reward mining will be halved). Finally, we are in R&amp;D phase - I expect in a few months we will have electric space heaters mining bitcoins (mining bitcoins for free as the electrical heating would be used anyway).

Yes, the way how the price discovery works is the same. The exchanges ("markets") are also very similar. But it's really a general thing - a market. 
Let's say you are a painter who painted 10 nice paintings. You offer those for sale. What the price will be? The more people like your work the higher the price goes (if you are rational and want to get as much money as possible). When the global financial system crashes your paintings will be worth less as less people will have enough money for non-essential expenses - so the demand for art will be lower. (This might be an over-simplification though.)


Yes, but the primary driver is that more people want it. When more merchants accept it, then it is more useful - so more people want it and the price goes up (because supply is limited and demand is rising).


One of the miracles of Bitcoin is that it is a complete alternative to the whole current financial system. You don't need fiat money, you don't need banks, you don't need to be controlled by bankster/govster elites anymore.
Bitcoin can thrive (price rising, more people using, etc.) even if no merchants accepted it - it's just (I think) too good tool for storage &amp; transfers of wealth to be ignored.

The author has some knowledge but I think it is not deep enough as he misses all the virtues of Bitcoin... Kinda sad considering his background.


I think Bitcoin users will not be that mad if value of their coins rises (hyperinflating value means hyperdeflation here, right?)... Bitcoin killed by some price swings? Really? And WFT is "Nakamodo [sic] majority stockholders"? 


On other place in the article, the author despises the fact that Bitcoin transactions are susceptible to surveillance, here he doesn't like the fact that we can create many different cryptocurrencies. He fails to see that ability to switch to other cryptocurrency and even the ability to adjust Bitcoin to work more anonymously can make spying on cryptocurrency/Bitcoin users far more difficult. Essentially he says here that bitcoins could lose value. Yes, who knows... Meanwhile, using bitcoins is very good way to trade, do wealth transfers, etc.


Bitcoin is better than gold in some aspects and similar in others. Deliberate distraction away from gold? - nah, give me a break. It is vehicle for unobstructed trade and also the system of ideas that softly forces people to think about current system of currency controls and central banking. This should be attractive for the author - if he roots for liberty and precious metal based money.

You mean *bitcoin address* not public key. Address is derived from public key ([address is hash of public key](


When creating the transaction, you put in it your public key and the signature (that was made from your public key). Anybody can then see that public key you are presenting corresponds to your bitcoin address from which you are sending - **and** - that the signature was really made from your private key. 
There are mathematical operations that you can use to verify that the signature really came from the private key that corresponds to the public key even without knowing the private key itself. Sort of like how [seal]( works - you do not have the seal (the metal device) but you know by looking at the wax impression that it was really "signed" by the king (who is the only one who has the seal and who is not showing/giving it to anybody else).

Yes. Once you have private key to some address, you can use it to send bitcoins from that address anywhere. Encryption of wallets is done to prevent other people getting the private key. That being said, this:

Can you really separate "intristic" (by your definition) and "non-intristic" values? If you take the water from my example above - aren't you speculating about it's future value (I mean: usefulness)? Aren't you speculating that you will be able to drink it in few moments and that it will save your life indeed? 
Future value is included in the current value so to speak and everybody is a speculator - you (or "most people") speculate that Bitcoin will not be more useful and more widespread, I speculate that Bitcoin will be more useful and more widespread. You speculate that people will not be holding bitcoins, I do. We are both speculating, we are both evaluating the value as usefulness now plus value in future - we both have "intristic"+"non-intristic" together. I think you can't make a distinction between "intristic" and "non-intristic" - it is just value.

Split your budget into 10 - 30 chunks. Every week (or every 10 days or every month or whatever) convert one of those into BTC. You mitigate multiple risks: volatility; risk of exchange shutdown; risk of theft (you gradually learn, at the beginning you have just fraction of the total amount so it will not hurt you that much if you lose it).

First, you know that when you are generating bitcoin address, you are in fact generating (its) private key randomly - and that from this private key the bitcoin address is mathematically derived, right? So - when you generate private key + address offline, the point is to keep the private key offline (so it cannot leak to the Internet and so it is not abused by malicious players). On the other hand, you can give your address to anybody. You give it to your friend and he can send money to it - that's the point where blockchain learns about the address - your friend entered it in his wallet as receiving address of the transaction... When the transaction is confirmed, the record appears in the blockchain - that he is sending bitcoins from one of his addresses to your address. ...and only you know that you can control the bitcoins on that address... 
Technically, we can send bitcoins to any (well-formed (i.e. of the right length, starting with 1, ending with checksum bytes)) bitcoin address - even without knowledge who controls the private keys or whether corresponding private keys even exist. There is no online registration of addresses or accounts or anything like that. The space of addresses (and private keys) is so vast that you do not register any address/account as being yours - you just generate the address and you can be sure (if you do it offline so nobody can steal your private key from your wallet) that you are the only one who has the private keys which can control the bitcoins sent to that address. You give your address to people and they send bitcoins to that address. Simple.

If you have problems with volatility now: convert bitcoins to fiat as soon as you receive payments. If you want to hold some bitcoins, use cost averaging which effectively removes the volatility from the equation for you.
Contrary to what mainstream economists want us to think - when value of bitcoin rises, people tend to spend more (as they feel richer, happier and as the goods are relatively cheaper to their total net worth (if you need to pay all money you have for a coat, you will not buy it; if you need to pay only one hundredth of money you have for it, you will buy it)). So, I think businesses really need to convert to fiat immediately (or find other ways to hedge).

From nowhere. The lucky miner who creates new valid block adds in it the reward transaction which "sends" 25 bitcoins from nowhere to her (to her BTC address). 
You can see this "bitcoin creating" transaction in every block, see e.g. here:
...the first transaction there sends  25.0047034 BTC from nowhere (25 new +  0.0047034 transaction fees) to the miner's address 1CjPR... In other words, the transaction has no inputs - which means that 25 BTC are new bitcoins.
Before the halving, the block reward was 50 BTC, see e.g. here:

No, fundamental  unit is bitcoin. Satoshi is the smallest unit now, but it can change with the trivial change of protocol we are discussing here. Trivial change that has no effect on the total supply of bitcoins.
If you increase the precision, the new smallest unit will be different than the current satoshi. You will not be making more (current) satoshis out of thin air. You will just be splitting bitcoins (and satoshis) into more pieces.

It's cash for/on the Internet. It has big potential - you know what e-mail and instant messaging did to physical letters. This might be even more huge.
Bitcoin is a database where there is recorded how much who pays to whom. The ingenious invention of blockchain (the shared database) means that everybody has the copy of the database, there is no center or company required to run the thing. You start Bitcoin program (wallet) and you become the node of the network. There are no other nodes than that. Bitcoin transfers are nearly instant, designed to be irreversible (which is good) and only 21 million of bitcoins will ever exist. No infinite printing of money as "our" (central) banksters do.

I am not sure about that.


...is certainly not rubbish! 
If the public key is unknown, the attacker needs to break or bruteforce **RIPEMD-160, SHA-256 and** ECDSA. 
If the public key is known (i.e. e.g. when the address in question already has outgoing transaction), "only" ECDSA remains to be bruteforced/broken (which might be nearly impossible - but still it is many orders of magnitude more likely than simultaneous compromising of all three).
It's called public key because it's the term in ECDSA private-public key cryptography, not because you should be giving it to anybody in case of public keys in Bitcoin.

General computers (CPUs, GPUs) have now negligible share in the total power of the Bitcoin network. The vast majority of power is there thanks to ASICs computers - these are single-purpose devices that are performing [double SHA256]( hash function. To generate private key - address pair, you need to generate private key (randomly or just iterate from 0 to max) and then calculate the public key using the [elliptic function]( (When you hash the public key, you get BTC address.) So current mining ASICs cannot be used to find private keys to existing addresses. Even if they could be used for this, it would make no sense - searching hundreds of millions of years for one private key if you can just continue with mining and earn far more.

No. There is the cardinal difference - it is not "we don't want this" ...it is "we don't want to **hold** this **now**". But this doesn't mean that bitcoins are useless. If that was the case, there would be no "ACCEPTING BITCOINS" signs anywhere. 
For businesses there is the problem that they do not have means to hedge against volatility. When the price goes up, people tend to spend more - so the volatility plays against the merchant. (Until there are no other ways how to hedge,) It would make perfect sense to sell all bitcoins immediately and re-purchase those in regular intervals (cost averaging). Maybe many businesses are doing it like this, who knows?

You can transfer your transaction from online computer to offline transaction via usb-disk.

The ("total") inflation is a measure how much money gets worse over time - i.e. how much prices (of everything) rise - this depends on supply and demand. 
Amount of bitcoins is increasing (monetary inflation), but some fraction of bitcoins is also lost and on the other hand the demand is getting stronger now as (more) people buy/earn and hold more bitcoins. All these factors together: demand is stronger than supply-&gt; value of bitcoin rises (prices go down), bitcoin is deflationary.
The rate at which bitcoins are lost is unknown (0.1 % of current mining rewards? or 2 %?!), amount of new adopters and the rates at which people are saving more bitcoins are also quite unknown (see some indicators eg [here]( or [here]( but the monetary inflation is exactly known [wiki]( and [pics]( ...well exactly when time is given in number of blocks - 1 block comes every 10 minutes on average (in fact - a bit less (because mining network strength is [rising very fast]( and the difficulty adjustment to 10 minutes/block is done with expectation of constant mining power in future, not rising)).

A (full) node is the original (Bitcoin-Qt) running &amp; connected to other nodes. If you run it, you can decide if you want to accept new changes in Bitcoin protocol - developers do some changes in code and you have the freedom of choice to upgrade to the last version or not. (Usually everybody upgrades, but if developers do something that is not nice (eg. god forbid - remove the hard-cap of 21M bitcoins), people running full nodes can ignore the change by refusing to upgrade to new version of the client.)

No. You either need newcomers or the old users paying more as I said - otherwise your business collapses. There is a kind of scam where the originators just get money of newcomers for nothing - a Ponzi scheme. However, that is a special case where there is no useful thing at all. As I pointed out, in case of Bitcoin there is the useful thing. Bitcoin allows you to transact in unprecedented ways with unprecedented ease. 
So - Bitcoin is equal to commodities, stocks, inventions, art in this respect that the visionaries at the beginning are rewarded more. Even without newcomers the Bitcoin economy will thrive - instead of working for fiat, I will work for bitcoins and also I'll be paying everything with bitcoins... it is a bit difficult to find people like me in every profession - but it can be done. Once newcomers stop pouring it and the equilibrium state is reached, the (small) economy can work with bitcoins instead of fiat completely. 
Bitcoins are the store of value and the means of exchange - if there is closed "sociosystem" - a village where people have only bitcoins and no fiat at all - they can function perfectly all right. They will be exchanging bitcoins for goods and services and there is no doom and gloom (providing they have computer factory and a power plant on one of their fields).

When half of miners stop mining, the other half of miners get higher profit. So the system stabilizes itself at some point, all miners will never leave.


It might not be profitable if you take into account the initial cost of the HW - but it is profitable if you compare bitcoins mined to cost of electricity. Some people have cheaper electricity, some people do not care about profit that much.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:25:51
Yes, but you are taking the analogy too far. 
The serious bug in Mt. Gox case is (AFAIK) taking a volatile identifier as the key in their DB and using it for check that bitcoins were not sent (without further checks of inputs and outputs). 
Transaction hash can be changed by adding (unimportant) data into the transaction. We see from the [history]( of the relevant [wiki page]( that this feature of Bitcoin is known for more than a year already (and it is likely known to developers since 2009).

Yes. Every full node is checking the new block (checking that all inputs of transactions are spendable; that transactions are correctly signed; etc.) before it uses it and before it relays it to other nodes. Malformed block will not spread through the network.

@_date: 2014-01-06 21:41:03
0. Developers - there are core developers around Gavin Andresen. They can't make adjustments behind the scenes - as Bitcoin is open-source, everybody can see what they are doing. If it is something bad, nodes in network will not switch to new version.
0. You can see it in the code. Again, people running nodes will not switch to new Bitcoin client which has different money supply function.
0. With private key, you can easily sign any data. You can sign for example your bitcoin transaction in which you put also the public key (which is derived from your private key). Verifying that the signature comes from your private key is easy (using the public key). Going from signature and public key to private key is very close to impossible - as the mathematic function is one-way only so to speak.
0. There is no such a thing as database of wallets and their balances. Everything is stored in the blockchain. Note that when you create new wallet, addresses in it are not in the blockchain yet (until those receive their first transactions) - in that case, those addresses are in your wallet only and nowhere else...
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:52:14
Yes, we know better than them - we know that trying something new is always good. Experiment, evaluate, think out of the box. What are they doing?

No problem if their friends are printing money for them. To hell with your professional economists. To hell with the parasites of finance industry.  
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:02:58
The best summary would be: Yes, Bitcoin is still an experiment, you can lost your money - but: Bitcoin is also technical marvel, something that never existed before. It's peoples' money created by people for people with no for-profit company running the show. You just simply run the client and become part of the peer-to-peer network which - like the internet - has no central point prone to attack by malicious players, system that routes around censorship and oppression. Bitcoin is freedom. Bitcoin is complete and honest alternative to the usury and corruption of our financial systems.

No altcoins have a chance (yes I admit it is hard to fathom for non-technical people that there is something more than the visible marketing). Ethereum has a chance to explore new space, but beside this, Bitcoin is money number 1 and will be for long time. 


Yes, the principle is the same - you give your money to somebody to keep it for you. Be it a bank or Gox or whatever - and then you find out that you have nothing. The point is that with Bitcoin you do not need these third parties at all. Bitcoin is peer to peer, you do not need institutions that have the power to confiscate everything you have for any reason. It is easy to store bitcoins offline where nobody can steal them. Fiat inflation is also just plain theft - my money is mine, but they have stolen 50 % of its value from me in just 10 years.

Hi. You can buy bitcoins from an exchange (Bitstamp, Kraken) or from a reseller (Coinbase) or from people directly (bitcoin.de, localbitcoins.com). If you have special hardware, you can mine bitcoins (unfortunatelly it is not possible with ordinary computers anymore).
Easiest way to try receiving and sending bitcoins is via Electrum. Go here:
  -&gt; "Choose your wallet" -&gt; "Electrum" -&gt; "Visit website" -&gt; "Download" -&gt; &amp; download "Portable version" for Win 
when you run Electrum for the first time, it generates a seed for you (this is all you need to backup and re-create your wallet, from it, Electrum is able to generate all your BTC addresses (and their corresponding private keys). Try sending/receiving small amounts first (like 0.01 BTC).
Examine here: 
Read here: 
Creating a wallet on your Windows computer which is connected to the Internet is not considered secure for bigger amounts of bitcoins (eg. &gt; 1.0 BTC). You should use Linux computer or even more secure is to create your wallet on computer that is not (and never will be) connected to the Internet. So nobody from the outside will be able to steal your private keys from that machine. You just take your BTC addresses via USB disk to online computer &amp; you send bitcoins to those addresses. (Try also with small amounts first.)

No. It is true that some people will lose their bitcoins and thanks to that all remaining bitcoins will have higher value - but the main thing is that our productivity rises thanks to better understanding, procedures and technology.

Ok, it seems that the payment went through (It changed from payment QR code+address+button to QR code of receipt+mail receipt...). Also see:
However - the additional check after pressing the "Place Order" button caught the fact that I did not select shipping - when I select $44.99 shipping, paying more is required (and the question is what happened to the previous BTC payment). So - the form should be checked first - and only after everything is ok, payment should be allowed once in step 6.

It is risky to buy everything at once. Cost averaging is safer - short time oscillations do not play a role then.
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:12:36
I try to explain it to non-techies as a book - book where transactions are written down. 
When we (anybody) need to do a transaction, this transaction is written into the book. This book is shared among all people who participate (who run the (original) wallet software), the interesting thing is that everybody has the same (copy of the) book. 
This is ensured by a bit tricky mechanism: everybody who wants tries to write the new page of the book - write there the transactions that people "shout into the air" (i.e. want to make) - but it is really hard to write the new page. It's like a lottery - you have the chance one to one billion to create the new page. 
This is because we want this page creation to take 10 minutes on the average (for all people trying to do that - only one is lucky, every 10 mins on average). We want it to take so long because we want page creation to be far slower than cloning the book and sending it to everybody - because we want everybody to have the same book so everybody sees what transactions took place.


My experience is that ordinary people need to see it on TV - where some 'reputable' person (economist/academician) talks about it positively. Only after that they are able to start thinking rationally about Bitcoin to some extent.

Heh, swindle?! Nobody was forcing anybody to buy. Most people here say you should not put money into something you do not understand, money you need or do not have. I am telling people all the time here to do cost averaging - I started buying for my parents right after the November bubble and they are now just -10 % ...not bad considering the first buy was $950 and the buy-plan ended before the dip below $400. 
There are very few people who bought everything at ATH - maybe none. And still if they did, there is significant chance, that they will be in black soon - let's look at people who bought at previous ATH. The only problem are the trolls like you that actually convince some people to sell bitcoins with loss... 
And BTW - if you want to see some swindles - look what governments are doing with tax payer money.

This is insane! You are lucky that the inflation is only 5 % or whatever now (I do not believe in the 2 % story), it could be much worse soon.


Basically everything and everyone is over-saturated because of the previous mania phase. People are losing jobs, they cannot repay their debts because also the value of their property of their assets is decreasing (various bubbles popping), they start preparation for even worse situation that is coming.
Inflation / money printing is like cocaine - yeah you can temporarily induce a mania phase during which you can build something or you can win a war if you are lucky - but you basically can't press on it and keep increasing the dosage without driving it to spectacular crash (large depression which can't be cured by cocaine anymore)... The economy has its natural cycles - phases of growth and phases of slow or no growth. These are switching relatively fast, depressions are short and mild. If you start messing with that - if you start doing drugs - you might have one longer period that seems fine, but then all the depressions come to you all at once. When you manipulate the supply of money you are basically destroying the natural balance. You think you are helping something, but the result is directly the opposite. 
And explain me how the banksters are not profiting from those manipulations with money - at the expense of all other people.
Please, get back to your "modern theory" fiat circlejerk. For the first time in modern history we have a tool - a brilliant tool - that can help us get away from you.

Mining with GPU? Sorry, but you are something like two years too late.
@_date: 2014-09-03 23:42:30
Let's imagine for simplicity that the results you are getting during mining are from the range 1 - 999. (We are using normal decimal numbers in this example.) 
Let's say the target is 100. Then, you have 10 % chance that your result (which is a random number in 1 .. 999 range) is below it (this corresponds to one+ leading zero). 
If the target was 10, you would have 1 % chance (this would correspond to two leading zeros as valid would be results 1 - 9, i.e. 001 - 009).
However, target can be also say 79, this would mean 7.9 % chance. This is one leading zero plus also results 80-99 are not valid...
In reality, [the target]( is far longer number than the one I used in the example above - so, its adjustments can fine-tune the chance to get new block with precision better than 0.0000001 %.

They can jail/torture/kill hundreds of people. They can't jail/torture/kill millions. Current financial system is rotten inside out. 
I think Bitcoin brings entanglement of very powerful ideas (freedom is important and desirable; there can be open solution shared among people resisting corrupt authorities; nearly all economists are brainwashed and/or evil or without a clue - just doing their mumbo jumbo; people can transact without barriers globally; ...). The message and the understanding is spreading like a wild fire and I believe the world is now changed forever. They can't stop it. The more they fight it, the higher appeal and strength of those ideas.
I live in central Europe (yeah, there is no such thing, right...) - we had here underground resistance against nazis, we had here underground resistance against communists, is there a reason we can't have underground resistance against banksters and corrupt politicians? Is there reason for not fighting for what we believe? Is there a reason not to face the oppression?

You/me/everybody will not be hoarding (aka saving) BTC indefinitely because we need to buy the basic life-supporting stuff and also because we want to enjoy the life - it's better to have cheap bike now and have some fun than buying super-bike when you are eighty... This is even more true with things you can use to improve yourself (books, computers, tools, ...). There is also the risk that you can die tomorrow - so it is good for you to spend at least a portion of your gains. 
Bitcoin is risky experiment - so you are probably not going to be accumulating too significant amounts of bitcoins, too.
There is also the counter-argument: why should be anybody selling anything now - when they can get more (inflationary) fiat in a month/year?

Yes and once it is 75 % you know that you will not lose more than 25 % of your savings' value to monetary inflation. Fiat currencies give no such guarantee - quite the opposite, you are guaranteed to lose half every 20 years (or even sooner). Bitcoin is Internet of money, it's value will sky-rocket IMHO ...and even if not, it's value can at least stay the same in allBTC economy, OTOH fiat is hot potato - enslave poor by making them chasing rapidly decaying money - game.

terrible short-sighted comment - or maybe you want beginners to buy in bubbles and fuel them
You are telling this when we are quite easily at the top of the bubble. My parents wanted to get in and wanted to buy all at once - if I did it for them, they would now have everything for $950. Instead, they have 20 % for $950 and 20 % for $730 now... Also - it is better to know I could have more but I don't because I went the lesser-risk way (in case the price goes up) than be sorry that I bought the top of the bubble. Ask guys who bought 250+ in April - they were sitting with tight asses for months hoping they will go into black numbers. Many of them lost the faith and sold below. 
What you missed completely is that my advice is not only about curbing the volatility risks - it is also about mitigating other risks - like problems with security. It takes time to learn how to do secure cold storage (I am improving my approach for more than 1 year already). And it is by no means advisable to buy large amounts on one exchange in one go. You can ask me - I was on Bitcoin-24 when it was shut down right when the bubble was popping on 2013-04-11, thanks god I was catching knives all the way down because I could then easily move bitcoins soon after the exchange closed. My (small) sum in EUR is still there - 8+ months later.

The wallet file is all you need (I think) - why don't you try it? Delete (- I mean: just rename) your multibit data directory, use your wallet file from backup and see if multibit starts with your wallet...




Although I am increasing my BTC holdings - this doesn't mean that I am reluctant to use BTC. Paying with BTC is superior to all other types of payment - so I get extra BTCs (besides my savings) which I am going to spend now or soon. Little number of bitcoiners is full-bitcoin no-fiat as there are still risks attached to Bitcoin. However, buying more BTC than you are planning to save (i.e. for the sake of spending) is very easy for many... Also the way how bitcoins rise in value gives you the feeling "why not to spend a bit of the profit I just made?"...

Blockchain doesn't need to know - not until the point where you are going to spend BTC from your address. Then, still, "blockchain" needs only the public key and the signature (both can be derived offline from the private key and taken as signed transaction to the network &amp; broadcasted). I.e. you can spend bitcoins without exposing private key(s) at online machines.

You can also try this strategy: keep always the same value in fiat and in bitcoins (i.e. when value goes up, you sell, when it goes down you buy) - this is not good when the price goes significantly up (or down) and stays there - but on the other hand, you get profit from volatility. ...and you also help stabilizing the market with this. ;)

Even if the price crashes to $0.1 it is not the end of Bitcoin... If needed, code gets fixed, coins are redistributed (non-believers selling, more believers buying more), economy thrives as good as before.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:38:29
Monetary inflation is only one part of the "total" inflation. The seconds part is change in supply &amp; demand. Bitcoin is deflating like nothing else before.
And even without increasing demand (and without people losing coins), monetary inflation of Bitcoin will never devaluate my/our bitcoins more than to 55 % of the current value (11 million BTC now =&gt; 21 million total). You can absolutely not say this about fiat - fiat value can (and I believe it will) go to 10 % and then to 1 %. It already happened with many national currencies. In my country also. Fuck. Those. Banksters/govsters.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:40:32


WTF? Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. These things will change the world. Even if the prices fall to 1 % temporarily, there is no big problem - we are on the right track. We are taking the control back. We are taking back our FREEDOM.

Those two entities (central bank, bitcoin developers) are very similar - they both control the currency. However, bitcoin developers are:
* maintaining the currency that we have chosen voluntarily (in contrast - fiat is forced upon us);
* are honouring the original principles of Bitcoin - limited supply is exactly written in code and cannot be changed;
* i.e. they are not changing the amount of bitcoins in existence - i.e. not robbing us for their benefit.

The seeds are growing.
When people get crazy and start telling there is nowhere to go I go crazy and start telling that we can go from 1 million to 1 billion in 6 years; we can have closed Bitcoin economies; there could even develop something that's after the national state; computer implants; internets of things; AIs earning money &amp; paying for services...

Addressing it as "bank" introduces/maintains the misconception about Bitcoin that it is some [for profit, centrally controlled] company. Much better is IMO saying it is a network - network of peers without any central point of control, network that anybody can join in one minute just by downloading and running an application. It fuses the idea of bittorrent (sharing data among peers) with the idea of shared database (there is one and the same database with transactions (blockchain) that is synchronized between all of the participants - in this db we see what transactions took place).


I can't think of more things as horrid as central banking. Control, manipulation, mismanagement, allowing banks to take stupid risks, making competition among banks meaningless. Central bankers == pirate childporn murderers terrorists money launderers robbers kidnappers of little girls. Shoot at sight!

I think it is brilliant idea... I never cared much about private-public key authentication, but now I want to use it everywhere because a) Bitcoin (wallets) are very easy to use and can be easily extended to support this and b) I already securely store my private keys - because it is (the access to) my money. Yes, there are already good specialized solutions - but with Bitcoin, you are getting similar functionality for nearly free.
I am thinking about some analogies: 
Is the clock in my mobile phone better than a wrist watch? No. But from the moment I bough my first phone I never wore wrist watches ever again. I do not even recall how my last watches looked like.
Is my computer better at playing video or music than dedicated machines? No - but for years now I have my computer and no hi-fi or standalone VHS/DVD players or even TV for that matter...

**Why you should steal everything from unlocked cars/houses.**
There are places on Earth (certainly not Czech Republic) where people do not lock their cars and/or houses. What will happen when Mt. Gox plays out there? Regulators already see this danger. What if people who do not lock their cars/houses get robbed?! We can prevent this by robbing everybody now - so people everywhere learn to lock their cars and houses. 
Everybody is honest. But what if people cease to be honest? I would be bad! We must prepare for it! We prepare for it best by doing the worst thing so people see how bad it can be! Everybody should cease to be honest now! ...and that will be good for everybody!
I see how you twisted the logic - you have seen on people saying that current bank/cc system with chargebacks makes people lazy and prone to dangerous behavior (not caring about how they use their money) and you now try to apply the same thing for the case of 0-confirmed bitcoin transactions. However those two things are very different. You are just creating FUD.

After 14 months of mining, you can look back and say this, yes - at that time, the pre-mine will be 50 %... If you look back after 10 years of mining, 4X will be mined - so the pre-mine will be only 20 %. Etc.

Forget the fluctuations, look at averaged price:
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:01:13
Yes. 
Looks to me also that people expect the price to be constant - instead of expecting mild linear or exponential (for the moment) growth. $13, $130, and maybe $800 now - all these price levels were holding for quite long. Then suddenly, people "realize that the price should be much higher" (which may be fueled by media hype to a great extend). I think the more people recognize these cycles, the more stability we will have (more people will be buying during the phases when the price is not changing or going slowly down and less will be buying when the price is going up fast).

Inflation should not be there at the first place. Maybe we need regulation to ban governments to create money (and suck people into using it) that has inflation...


The problem (one of) is that you need to be constantly visiting your boss and begging for higher wage - just to be able to feed your children as you were able before.


If money is scarce (as it should be), doing saving (i.e. doing nothing with money) - is in fact doing something - it is making the rest of the available money even more scarce. So, people who save are in fact (until they use their money) increasing the value of money units all their fellow citizens have and enjoy using. So when I save - your money are more valuable and your investment (if you feel like it) into eg. new ventures has higher value.
Also this "doing nothing" is in fact making reserves for rainy days - if you have accumulated reserves, you can be spending even when you are not receiving so much money at the moment (temporarily with lower wage because global crisis, unemployed for some time, sick, with unexpected expenses, etc.). This is what prevent crises from getting bigger and deeper. 
The current economy is doing the exact opposite to what it should - it is forcing people to get rid of (money) reserves (either to buy partially unnecessary goods or to invest in potential housing/stock bubbles) - then, a slight problem tends to start snowballing - leading to big problems (people lose money in bubble bursts and market crashes (induced by banks and other wealthy investors selling), people can't get their money when they need them and are forced into debt). The whole thing is completely insane - people are thought to take loans and buy as much as they can. The rational thinking: "Let's not use more resources than we need.", "Let's first create something and then use/enjoy it." is discouraged. What a shame.
Sorry, maybe I should stop writing - thinking about this drives me angry. :/ The system is fucked up.

It doesn't work like this at all. The order books on exchanges are so thin that just $50 million will buy completely all bitcoins on all exchanges and trigger large scale panic buys - driving price far above $2000... It is true that many more sellers can show up - but on the other hand, when they see the price is going so fast up, maybe many of them will convince themselves that huge amount of wall street money is coming and that it can drive the price above $10,000 - so - why to sell below that?...
I think pumping $1 billion into Bitcoin will probably result into market cap around 250 billion...

Yes, Bitpay can stop processing bitcoins and start processing horse shit or stones/shells/beads/credits/fiat. 
Bitcoin is unique - it is not only money of the internet - it is internet of money. It is programmable money. It is open, everybody can create new services, everybody can improve the system, everbody can see exactly what is happening. This is something unheard of in finance. What you have now in fiat financial system is entrenched petrified structures, leeches, cartels creating blockades, they are hindering innovation, destroying peoples' freedoms, robbing people with printing more and more money without end. Financial mafia creating pacts among friends behind closed doors, corrupting politicians, it corrupts our society, our world.

The other thing supporting the coins are people who believe in the idea of the free govster-less bankster-less currency. Price oscillations are irrelevant. It is clear that when Bitcoin is overhyped, the price skyrockets too high to be sustainable - after the correction which may take some months (during which people are always predicting gloom and doom), the price consolidates and that's it. 
In the last 12 months, dollar and euro and whatever fiat currency lost value. Bitcoin gained value. This trend will continue.
Still, price discussion is secondary - the primary thing is that Bitcoin works and that it presents numerous advantages over fiat currencies.

[The issuance model will be as follows](
* Ether will be released in a fundraiser at the price of 1000-2000 ether per BTC, with earlier funders getting a better price to compensate for the increased uncertainty of participating at an earlier stage. The minimum funding amount will be 0.01 BTC. Suppose that X ether gets released in this way
* 0.225X ether will be allocated to the fiduciary members and early contributors who substantially participated in the project before the start of the fundraiser. This share will be stored in a time-lock contract; about 40% of it will be spendable after one year, 70% after two years and 100% after 3 years.
* 0.05X ether will be allocated to a fund to use to pay expenses and rewards in ether between the start of the fundraiser and the launch of the currency
* 0.225X ether will be allocated as a long-term reserve pool to pay expenses, salaries and rewards in ether after the launch of the currency

No. With Bitcoin, you know that (monetary) inflation can potentially dilute only 33 % of the current value (we have [13 M]( now and maximum is 21 M). With fiat you have no such guarantee - they can print so much that your savings will be worth 1 % of the current value or less. I believe they will do it. Bitcoin (monetary) inflation is also almost totally predictable - this doesn't hold for fiat which is manipulated at will...
I was talking about monetary inflation - which is countered by the effect of (more) people buying (more) bitcoins and also by people losing bitcoin. All in all, Bitcoin is deflationary even now - see the trend [here]( (356 day moving average).
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:57:00
Monetary inflation and inflation are two different things. Bitcoin as of now is deflationary (although it has monetary inflation) - i.e. prices go down in general. This is not the case for fiat.

...which is better than the needed 107.2% increase in the case without cost averaging (sole buy @ $1005).
Cost averaging reduces volatility risks. 
In your example you weirdly compare two different cases: buying with budget $1005 and with budget $6146.1. 
If you want to see the merit of cost averaging in dollars, you should pick one budget - say $5000 and compare the two cases: buying everything @ $1005.0 or whatever and buying in 1 months intervals over longer time period.

So far I think the best approach are first-bits - i.e. the shortest string of characters that uniquely identify address in blockchain in such a way that no other address in previous blocks has the same beginning.  
You can try first-bits search here:
...5 first characters of your used address are enough to find it, if you are lucky/old, 4 or 3 are enough.
But - think about **first-bits encoded as words**. 3 or 4 words will be enough to represent any of the existing addresses in blockchain. 5 words would be enough to represent addresses in the future.
So, send me money (e.g.) to:
*sea knife moon barrage speed 5 a*
(two last characters are the last 2 characters of the address added as checksum). 
Easy, isn't it?

Bitcoin isn't just a new way of making payments - it is the way how people who do not trust each other can agree what information is included in the shared database (according to the rules which are generally agreed upon). Prominent usage of this now really is doing/tracking payments (database of currency transfer transactions) but the possibilities go far beyond this - to name just a few obvious now: notary services (existence of documents, evidence of agreements), tracking of ownership (property, domains), encrypted messages.

You are totally pathetic. What part of "bitcoin is still just an experiment" you didn't get? Didn't you realize that in free market the price goes sometimes up and sometimes it goes down? That you shouldn't invest more than you can afford to lose? Didn't any of the many warnings said here made it into your tiny brain?
If you are scared of volatility, do cost averaging over longer period of time. If anything, bitcoin price is utterly unbelievably hyper-colapsing upwards. Go here:
switch to "2y" and see that he price went **20x** up in the last 2 years (+2287.8%). With such a momentum it overshoots sometimes.
But I understand - either you are very stupid and you can't get any of the above or you are very clever and you **actually make money from fear mongering - from making people sell with loss**.

Inflation is more like 5+%. The purpose of it is to enrich the already rich circles by robbing all people who worked hard of the value. 
I do realize that the economy works well - when people create savings. If a portion of money is held as savings the value of the other (circulating) money grows proportionally. (You probably fail to realize that.) Also - people use their savings at some point. 
Yeah maybe the insane consumerism could be reduced to some degree which is probably terrible in your books. Reality/market and other bubbles would not be that crazy (no waves of senselessly printed money) and the planet's resources wouldn't be so pointlessly exploited (more durable goods instead of use once &amp; throw away, focus on other things than owning things).

Import your private key into offline Electrum. Use offline signing mechanism of Electrum to make your BTC transaction securely (your private key will never touch device accessible from the Internet).
Note: in newer (1.9+) versions of Electrum, it might be difficult to create seedless wallet from your offline wallet (wallet which has private key from your paper wallet imported). In older versions, there was the "deseed" way, newly is master public key used to create seedless wallet - then you unfortunatelly do not have your imported address (of your imported key) in the seedless wallet - but maybe there is a way how to add an address to a seedless wallet.

Nothing like selling can mean the collapse of bitcoin. All it can cause is significant drop in price - which means nothing in the grand scheme of the Bitcoin functioning. If the fundamentals remain the same, if miners are mining next blocks - Bitcoin is wonderful at both $1000/BTC and $1/BTC...

Some kind of automatic buy. 
...I would like to setup recurrent bank transfer - when fiat reaches the exchange, it would be turned into bitcoins (either immediately or when some conditions are satisfied (like price is under 8 day MA or under certain value)). Also automatic withdrawal of bitcoins would be nice.

Yes, you can do that. What can merchant/server do is to check these things and accept 0-confirmation transaction as payment only in case it has all inputs confirmed and has high priority (i.e. fees big enough / big enough BTC amount / old coins).

We really do not know where the price is heading in the next two months - it can be $1500 as well as $250... Buying in more batches has lower highest potential result, but it improves the worst case when the price starts to go down in the very moment you do your first purchase... Also there are other risks - exchange could be hacked or closed - you should not have there all your money at once. Splitting buys over the course of a month or two/three also gives you time to learn about Bitcoin security before you spend everything you had first. I have long position in BTC in cold storage + I am doing some trading with say 2 % of my BTCs. It is impossible to guess the next trend/price, but I think this: 
is nice idea. It is selling high and buying low (kind of) which "harvests volatility" and helps stabilize the market. You simply hold the same value in bitcoins and the same in fiat - and you re-balance every day or week as price changes... Other than this - it is very hard to predict the market price and not act emotionally. Eg. this was my second bubble, I knew the correction is comming - so I sold a bit @ $400 and $500... and then re-bought @ 900 :(... I had some profit on minor dips to cover this loss, but unfortunately when the correction came I had no fiat on the exchange :/ - sell orders just above the final prices... You know it will go down, but it is going so long up that you start to believe it will continue going up for some more days every time...

Ok, I will be thinking about your perspective. 
My current understanding is that Dogecoin may be fuelled by the general awesomeness of cryptocurrency (people enjoy that they can transact freely between each other) but also and foremost by the fact that it is generating profit while mining. If you say: "Hey, join us, we are shibes, be a shibe too. Buy Doge, do not worry about falling price, it's just for fun." or "Join us. Start mining - you will lose money, but whatever - you will be able to tip others!" - I think that will not be that appealing for new people... 


Yes? Yes. The higher your rocket flies the more people will feel that Dogecoin is real money. The longer your community lives the more chance many people get sour if/when they see their money stagnating or being devaluated... If you want this to be funny money, it will make people look elsewhere to find coins to buy as investment. If you let the value go up, it will inevitably lead to losing of the funny aspect and getting more serious. Also the fun is dying when you need to have serious discussions (which needs to happen if you do not want just to be flying forever in the comfortable position behind the wind shield of Bitcoin so to speak).
Nevermind. The competition is good! Every competition to fiat should be welcome by real Bitcoin enthusiasts. I would tip you some BTC, but I run dry after the 0.01 tip to the post with Cryptopunk manifesto. :) Good luck!

Just digest the most important info about Bitcoin (there is no owner, all is open and decentralized, 3rd parties can run with deposits but you do not need to use 3rd parties at all), send it to him and that's it. You can't do much more than this - unless he comes to you with questions. It takes time before people allow thoughts significantly different from their previous/current mindset, it is also difficult to trust somebody/something with one's money. 
I was pitching Bitcoin to all my computer literate friends for months now without much success. Some time ago they were trying every single new interesting thing - but obviously not anymore. I think we grew old. So - I think it's best to hand the information and let them be...

Yes, very good marketing indeed. 
In the initial phase, when the price goes up very fast, everyone is enthusiastic, euphoria is everywhere. (Look at in Feb, Mar, April or Nov 2013.) People who make lot of money do not mind to throw some at others to spread the word then... However, when the price is stagnating or going down for half a year, then the mood changes ~~a bit~~ a lot. When the price is crashing, $0.01 tips received are not helping that much I guess.
Dc is accelerated to a large degree - this means shorter time between bubbles, bigger euphoria at the beginning, but then, everything will get worse. Do you really think dc can beat BTC in one year? Do you realize that after the initial mania phase, the stream of new people coming to dc will be significantly reduced - because the mining will not be so lucrative and also because there could easily be other similar coins (Coineye if it didn't fail, SciFi coin, etc.). 
I understand that when you are 2 months old, one year seems like eternity. But if you fail to innovate real fast - at least on par with Bitcoin - you stop dead in your tracks in the next few months.

Miners assemble Bitcoin transactions into a block, also hash of previous block is added along with some other numbers.




Look at markets here:
...all of these are markets where people come with asks (selling bitcoin for some price) and bids (buying bitcoins at some price) - this are the fundamentals of price discovery and Bitcoin trading. Then, you have some resellers (eg. Coinbase) who buy at markets and sell to people via their web interfaces.
More advanced things should be possible in the future - eg. shorting. Also people from the "old-school" financial circles start to take notice - some established Forex companies are creating Bitcoin trading tools and exchanges and there is also some activity that should enable regular investors to get exposure to bitcoins (eg. BIT trust). Boom of financial services is to be expected around Bitcoin protocol in the near future...

Everyone wants to send money somewhere - but to keep the order, we have a book with all transactions that ever happened (blockchain). It is hard to create new page in this book - but when someone manages to do it, our book is one page longer, those transactions on that page are officially confirmed. Trying to make this new page in the transaction book is called mining.
It must be hard to create the new page for these two main reasons:
* so we can trust to complete stranger that he is honest (he spend very significant amount of work - which we can easily verify - in creating the next page); 
* so everyone of us have the same book (new page (i.e. new block) must spread over the whole planet significantly faster that it takes to create next page).

Bitcoin is far more transparent than fiat banks and payment processors can ever hope to be. Competition will bring you services superior to current fiat status quo. Also the point is that you are not forced to use 3rd party services with Bitcoin.

Fundamental unit is bitcoin. You will never get more bitcoins when you increase precision - in the same way like you do not measure 100 times larger distances when you start to measure with hundred times more precise odometer. Therefore your analogy with pizza is incorrect and also IMHO very misleading for laymen. The pizza is 1 bitcoin - by slicing it into smaller pieces, you are not getting more bitcoins. It is not inflation, prices do not rise.
I am software developer and I know that you cannot have infinite precision - you always lack the detail if you zoom enough. You can increase the precision - add more bytes/bits to your representation - but that doesn't mean that those things you represent (your model) change scales. It is irrelevant to some degree what the smallest unit is - it is not the fundamental thing, it is a thing that you can change - add more bits, get better precision, but the whole thing is not changing (just the fine detail if you zoom enough).

Chinese exchanges are good for Bitcoin because they allow ppl in China to get bitcoins.


It is believed that the rally in Nov/Dec 2013 was triggered by the demand on exchanges in China. Negative news from China might contribute to the pop of the bubble on Dec 6, 2013. But - this is ok, this is free market, people act emotionally, prices are changing all the time... 


If you have completely free and unregulated environment, you have to be prepared for manipulation attempts. However, I believe every manipulation of the market has only limited time span. Either it fails immediately (and this results in loss for the manipulator as he buys above market price or sells below market price) or after some limited time - market manipulation is successful, manipulator moved the market and is able to profit from it, but sooner or later the market moves (back) into the point of equilibrium. Therefore, if you believe in the long term viability of this technology, you do not have to care too much about market manipulations. Don't panic.


Gambling with money and potential (big) profits influence your brain in similar ways as (other) drugs. Many people here are a bit crazy because their life is being changed in ways nobody was expecting just a few years ago. I think this is no much of a problem - providing everybody stays careful (not investing more than u r able to lose). Profit is the incentive for people to spread this wonderful ground-breaking technology that might help many many people. If profit-seeking (or greed) of some leads to greater common good - ...

Transaction has to spend fully all its inputs (so their previous occurrences can be forgotten in the history). Inputs of the new transaction are the bitcoins you received to your address during previous transactions. So, if you have on your address two "pieces": 2.5 BTC and 0.8 BTC and you are sending 2.9 BTC, both those "pieces" (those inputs in our new transaction) are used and must be spent fully - so 0.4 BTC is returned to one of your addresses back as *change*.

Bitcoin is very new - so a bit of technical skill is still needed to use it. But - it is a complete alternative to current money/financial/banking system(s). It works in parallel, it presents different paradigm of deflationary currency and economy.
With bitcoin, people are now far more free and efficient in exchanging value. No artificially created hurdles.
Bitcoin is transparent and open, it allows building trust directly between people who do not know each other and do not trust each other at the beginning.
Bitcoin is decentralized peer to peer system - it works without central control, it works without 
third parties, it works thanks to consensus among the participants.

I tell you this: the next crisis will be far worse - because of this great "solution" you present to us. Yes, it could have been the next Great Depression - because the root causes are the same - too much cheap credit, too much loans made out of nothing in futile attempt to boost the economy. When those loans get repaid you suddenly realize that there is too much goods and too little money and that prices are falling (which would not be a problem if it was not caused by your money printing in the first place)...


Yeah - you print much money and people start to demand gold for your IOUs ...you can easily run out of gold if you printed too much.


It is better to go through mild depression where everything corrects itself than fight it by money printing and get into far worse things.


Dude, omg - you got this completely backwards... The "modern monetary policy" is like fighting the tiredness we got into because using too much cocaine by doubling the dose and snorting it immediately without any sleep - every fucking time. This can either lead to total mania (hyper inflation, mis-allocation of everything) or total crash (omnipresent bankruptcies, no jobs + poverty, disintegration of production chains) - both things far worse than the usual business cycle...
Are you profiting from the tragedy the current system is or are you just brainwashed that much?

Good, so all you need is to find wallet.dat that contains private key to this address...
Make new directory and put there all the wallets you can find (in numbered subdirs). Then, take each one of them, put it into the directory where your client reads it and look into your wallet if it has the address you are looking for. Don't bother with rescanning/balance. Once you find it, private key you get from the client is all you need to control your bitcoins.
Look here:
...you should be able to list all addresses in your client by 'listaddressgroupings'.
Research more by googling "bitcoin qt list private keys addresses".
If you do not find the correct wallet in your backups, you can try to recover deleted files from your disk - I used [Test disk]( once with good results...

One of the best ways of making and having brainwallet is by using Electrum - you just need to memorize 12 words (the seed) it gives you when you create the wallet. Then you can use any of the receiving addresses in Electrum to deposit from other places (you send bitcoins to one of the receiving addresses from other wallets / services). 
There are also other ways how to create brainwallet - but you have to be very careful not to choose too simple brainwallet phrase. Electrum generates the phrase (seed) sufficiently strong. There are also other pros - Electrum is very easy to use and it can also be very secure (if you create and keep your wallet on computer that is not connected to the Internet).

I think there is option on localbitcoins to do the trade with escrow via bank transfer - so you do not need to meet in person. You may also try to send some friend of yours to ATMs in Vancouver or Toronto ;). Next, you may try exchanges - canadian Cavirtex or if you can do bank wire to Europe (and if you manage to get verified), then you can use Bitstamp/Kraken/Bitcoin.de... 


State institutions in USA suppressed [this business]( Currently, only physical coins without the actual bitcoins are sold (and you need to "fill" them yourself). The same also seems to be true for [bit-card]( - they were previously also selling bitcoins on their cards (which are also paper wallets), now they only sell empty cards.
Casascius coins are in fact paper wallets - you have there the *BTC address* and the corresponding *private key*. You can create paperwallets for yourself - with the advantage of having more copies of the same private key that you can store at different places...

And nobody wants to be a politician. This doesn't mean that people do not want to have control over things. Instead of "we invented a way to be a bank" you can say: "we invented a way to safely store money, a way to transact cheaply globally without restrictions - and in fact we invented new kind of money that can easily be superior to current fiat Ponzi" ...people's reaction would be "I do not believe you/it" or "I do not get it" ...but certainly not "I would hate that"...


I just want two things: that they allow me to send money (yes, they do it - but it takes long, there are fees, they do not allow me to send money to some countries/institutions) and that they keep my money safe - when I do a deposit, I want the money to be safely stored there - which is not the case as they use my money for their investments, bitches.


It is not important that most people wouldn't want to do it, it is important that it can be done. Bitcoin has potential to be far better than current banking (at least for the two things I need I described above) - it is good to tell this to people.

It should work like this: you enter first characters of bitcoin address (eg. 1BULVY) and it spits the full address (eg. 1BULVYwQY1DPwCvHTaveQraJ43A9Va19Z) - possibly with links to blockexplorer, blockchain info, etc. It returns the first address which appears in blockchain that starts with the given characters (case-insensitive).

Yes, but how is deflation awful (and inflation godsend presumably)?
My view: In economy where only one deflationary currency is used, loans make less sense. But OTOH it is easier to accumulate savings and then starting business using it (also using savings of others - crowdfunding, IPO)... Wages in economy with deflationary currency need to be decreasing. This would happen at the same pace or just a little slower than the decrease in overall prices. The pressure is here on the side of the employer - (s)he needs to be perpetually proposing lower salaries to his/her employees (with inflation now it is the opposite - we as employees need to ask for higher salary every month just to keep up with rising prices). Salaries are decreasing but the purchasing power remains the same (or rises)...
Inflation may give short term boost to the economy - as people see that their savings are getting destroyed and that they need to work even more and even harder. Good during war perhaps. Long term, inflation leads to overconsumption, overproduction of nonsensical stuff, overdraining of resources, bubbles. Deflation OTOH would curb consumption to some extend (not so much things and not so often) but it would improve quality of goods, experiences and life (less chasing for money which is disappearing in our hands, less speculating in what to invest your money (in which bubble), more knowing that you can be saving and gradually improving your life). 
Note that deflation is often depicted as super-bad - because deflation was there during the worst recessions ...but we think the problems were caused by the preceding inflation (too much money printing, too cheap lending - too cheap credit). Think about it - inflation is really good for the people who are creating the money out of thin air and their friends and also for the rich who know where &amp; when to invest and bad for the poor people who are drowning in expensive debt and who have no time and know-how and spare money to invest into something.
Good thing is that now we do not have economy with just inflationary currency or with just deflationary currency. We now have both and we have the freedom to at least make a choice.

Why do you think so? I have some Bitcoin savings but that doesn't mean that I will not be spending anything. I save some, I spend some. Yes, Bitcoin is deflationary so there is incentive to save/hoard, but Bitcoin is also risky - so you do not want to have all life savings in Bitcoin. You also want to live - so you buy things.
So, the best way is to have some savings in Bitcoin and also use Bitcoin for spending as it is really convenient to use - you just convert your USD/EUR/CNY/... to bitcoins just before you spend it. Note that if nearly all bitcoins are hoarded - it is still not a problem *per se*. This just leads to the fact that bitcoins that actually move have higher value. 
Last, the idea that nobody will be spending deflationary currency is just as ridiculous as the idea that nobody will be holding any amount of inflationary currency... If the currency was so good that everybody must hold it at all costs, all other currencies would vanish immediately as everyone would exchange their currencies for bitcoins.

They are also under risk of occasional bigger expenses (fix car / house / health) - then they fall in debt trap very easily.
If you use money, you are robbed by inflation no matter what - you need to earn first and you spend later - between that you lose (or lose more in case you spent first and are in debt before you earn &amp; repay).

You are right, you can send bitcoins to your recipient directly from Coinbase. However, installing and using Electrum is very easy and it's a breeze. Thanks to that you will learn fast how bitcoins work and maybe - if you go through the hassle of buying bitcoins - you would appreciate how it works and how easy it is to buy things when sending bitcoins from Electrum. 
Note that Coinbase is sometimes slow when you order it to send bitcoins (it may take eg. 1 or 2 hours before the bitcoins arrive at the destination bitcoin address (check that in blockchain.info by watching the destination address)).

Bullshit. They are no scammers. Exactly like Vitalik said - there are already many projects that try to hack something else into Bitcoin and it is only logical to try to design something really general that will allow us past the limitations of relatively simple Bitcoin scripts. Bitcoin is already too important now to attempt changes so big in it.
For me, Vitalik is one of the finest Bitcoin experts and I believe in him and in the whole Ethereum endeavor. I put 20 BTC into their IPO to support him and his colleagues.

It is 22.5 % of the amount of ether in the first year. 10 years from beginning, it will be only 5 % and with following years their share will be decreasing. In 20 years their share is ~ 2.5 %...


Amount of ether will be increasing forever - so they are effectively giving themselves 0.0 % of the total amount, not 22.5 %.


Ethereum is not a mere altcoin - it is different kind of beast &amp; there are many new challenges. There are big problems but also huge potential. I say Ethereum developers deserve the initial share of ether. I will certainly support them by buying at IPO.

You are overlooking the fact that if something like this happens, it will be actually good for Bitcoin - many new people will learn about the concept, many new people will be thinking about the new coin pushed by some selfish corporation and the good "old" Bitcoin. Some other digital currency that goes mainstream would also help Bitcoin tremendously - also because it would be far easier for laymen to get into Bitcoin (by exchanging your new hypothetical currency for BTC).
It's my personal opinion - but I think that people underestimate how hard is to out-compete something that is already in existence - something that has no fundamental flaws, something that can adapt, something that is honest and created with the best interest of helping people.

The number of Carls **and** the way how old Carls are converted to new Carls.
Let's have an example with dollars. Let's suppose that the "base" unit (in my conception, for the sake of the argument) is 1,000 dollars. We have total supply of say 15 of this base units (i.e. 15,000 dollars total). The smallest unit is one dollar - one Carl (let's call it one *old* Carl). 
Now, we see that dollar is too strong - i.e. we need something smaller so we can buy coffees etc. So, we introduce cents. So, a cent is our new Carl. Yes, we have more new Carls now, but the new Carl is different than the old Carl. You receive 100 new Carls for the old Carls. 
The total supply remains the same - 15,000 dollars. However, it is now consisting of 1,500,000 new Carls which have 100 times lower value of the old Carls: 1,500,000 * 0.01 is the same 15,000 dollars of the total supply - the same as we had before...
So if you had eg. 34 dollars before (old Carls) then you will have 34 dollars after the adding of the precision - it will just consist of 3,400 new Carls instead of 34 old Carls.
You have more of the smallest units - but the new smallest unit is smaller and you will receive more of them for the same dollar amount. ...more precisely - not "receive" - in the moment of the protocol change, your dollars will *turn* into more smaller base units - so the total value is not changed; 10 dollars is the same as 1000 cents!

Nobody can stop it - it is the same as BitTorrent. And - look at the bigger picture - 1, 2, 3 years.


This is because of two things. First, some people do not mind risking &amp; losing thousands of bitcoins. Second, Bitcoin is so new that people do not know how to handle it - partly because the bad false security habits they have from the current system. It is the same think like if you give a knife to the child for the first time...


So you do not have money, you have something else. ...and the money you had was losing value in the hands of some other poor guy somewhere (who probably took a loan to survive). Your bonds and savings accounts are not declining because their price is fueled by the cheap printed money. Banks do not put the money where it can help (like investing into infrastructure, R&amp;D, small companies etc.) - they buy stocks with it. Inflation that should help people is in fact fueling the stock bubble that will burn many people again.


I put 20 BTCs into NeoBee shares and I am glad that there was somebody who was bold enough to try new things, someone who was committed to educating people about current financial system and the new options we have thanks to technology. Are those bitcoins lost? I think not.

You are welcome. 
Please note that the imported address (and its private key) cannot be re-stored from the Electrum seed (as it was imported manually). ...so if the 'electrum.dat' file on your disk is gone, you will need that private key again to be able to control those bitcoins in question. 
Easy thing to do (if you want to use Electrum from now on) is to send the bitcoins to one of the addresses that was generated from the seed (basically all the other addresses in the 'Receiving' tab in your Electrum wallet). If you do this, all you need to store as your backup is the 12-word seed.

All nodes in the Bitcoin network have the same copy of the transaction database (which is called blockchain). Your hypothetical new hacked bitcoins would need to be included somehow in the blockchain - so the others can agree that those bitcoins exist (and are controlled by the hacker). However, this is not possible - **every node in Bitcoin network verifies that the new addition to blockchain (new block) is correct according to the rules**. This means specifically for this case that all bitcoins are send from addresses that had bitcoins in previous block or that given bitcoins are 25 newly mined BTCs. In blockchain you can trace all bitcoins to the block where they were mined. Your 1,000,000 new bitcoins would be rejected by all and any nodes in the Bitcoin network because they will not be traceable to previously mined coins.

If you imported the private key correctly, you should see the balance from its BTC address added to your total balance in Electrum - and you can just go "Send" and if you send all your funds you will be sending also from the imported address. 
Imported address should be visible in "Receive"-&gt;Main account-&gt;Imported...
If it is not working do it like this: create new wallet in Electrum from scratch (you need to locate your wallet file and rename it for this moment so Electrum will not find it - then it will offer you to create new wallet with seed) and import private key into it - then you should be able to send bitcoins from the imported address.

It is not - because that "losing half its value in 15 days" is taken out of context - it was in fact gaining 300+ % of value in the span over 4 months (for both April and December occurences). Let's not be fooled by short-term price oscillations (aka bubbles and "crashes").
Bitcoin has very limited and very controlled monetary inflation and it will most likely result in deflation (as demand is rising faster than supply) in the long term - compared to your fiat that will never stop inflating...
If you try to imply by your statement that when bitcoins lost 50 % in 15 days - that is very likely that the price of bitcoins can go to 1 % in 3 months or so - that's pure bullshit. You are just taking some short time phenomenon and extrapolating it absurdly.

I would like to see a proof for this. I think I've seen some evidence contrary to that claim - USD distribution is far more uneven.


No. You cannot do anything (sane) about it (eg. Satoshi can transfer his 1M BTC to 1,000,000 different addresses with 0.1 - 10 BTC each and you will not be able to tell if there is single owner of all those addresses) - and you also should not want to do anything about it. 
On one hand, bitcoin-rich people (at least all the early adopters) are different from fiat-rich people - so bitcoin imbalance actually balances the world situation by a tiny bit. On the other hand you should not be forcing communism (==*work as much as you can (read:want) and receive as much as you need*) - bitcoin rich people either bought with fiat and/or were working hard to get Bitcoin where it is now, they were believing, they took great risks while being ridiculed by all others. If you now would want the people who were ridiculing the founders and people who did nothing to have the same share of the pie - you would be encouraging this nonproductive behaviors and discouraging the people who actually are able to work hard, take risks and give us things so amazing as eg. Bitcoin. 
My personal feeling is also that many bitcoin-rich people are nice and honest guys - far better and more moral than the large portion of fiat-rich people who get their riches by exploiting others.

It might be not profitable to invest into new HW, but still it is profitable to mine ...as the cost of the new HW is far bigger than the electricity expenses. 
Some of the money that would be used to buy new HW would go into buying BTC directly. 
I think also that the thing has quite some momentum - it takes months to build &amp; bring online large mining operations. The investors/operators have their plan based on longer term projections, they are not going to cancel their long-term efforts just because there is downward spike in BTC price. 
TL;DR: I think Bitcoin mining has far bigger momentum than Bitcoin price, there is no chance of mining collapsing.

There were no requirements like this until state authorities began sticking their nose into Bitcoin business with their AML regulations.

Anybody can mine bitcoins but only people with modern specialized bitcoin-mining computers (ASICs) can do that with profit these days. Bitcoins are limited, the supply is [strictly controlled]( - with more people mining, everybody receives less. Currently, every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins are born regardless of how many people are mining. 
In the year 2016 the reward will be halved to 12.5 bitcoins per block (see the link above).
There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins (see the link above). Bitcoins have value because they are scarce and useful.

 2)
Between 1 and 3 millions.
 3) 
Miners are creating new blocks. In each block there are 25 new BTC currently. 25 is according to an algorithm which is set in the Bitcoin code (its opensource software which all of the peers in Bitcoin network run on their machines). If someone tries to make block with more than 25 BTC it will get rejected by all the other nodes in the network.


No. New block is "the solution" ...but it is no 'math equation' or 'hard mathematical problem' as it is wrongly described in media. What is going on is that you (as a miner) take a hash (i.e. digestion) of the last block in blockchain and you basically try random numbers until you find the one that fits the criteria. No hard mathematical problems, it's more like lottery - with bigger computing power you have higher chance of finding the correct number. If you have the correct number, you new block is valid and will be spread across the network by other nodes and used by all miners.

They should keep only (portion of their) savings in bitcoins, not their paycheck and their day-to-day money. If your savings lost half of value in 1 day it is not devastating for the family because savings is something you use after a year or more - oscillations are not important, only the trend counts.
If they live paycheck to paycheck they do not have time and energy to search for investments. When they try to put some fiat aside - they realize that that fiat is deteriorating in front of their eyes.

I am not saying that Bitcoin will replace current systems - but Bitcoin is certainly an alternative - a very interesting alternative. It is unbelievable what was achieved with bitcoin already and still there is promise for much more in the future, the technology is simply incredible. And there is maybe one thing that is even more important than that: it's the way Bitcoin motivates people to study the current scandalous pile of shit we call the financial system and the way it ignites discussions and searches for better solutions.

This. Bitcoin is useful, people buy &amp; sell it. When more people want it, the price rises - as there are less people who want to sell at the current price but there are some more people who are willing to sell at higher price. Take a look here: 
...those entries are people who want to buy (left column) and other who want to sell (right column) - each entry is at different price. When you are at trading at the exchange, you can either fill the existing orders in order book (i.e. buy or sell the amount you see in those rows for the price there is) or you can create your own order - e.g. "I want to" buy 50 BTC at $30/BTC or "I want to sell" 2 BTC at $2342/BTC.

and also be sure you buy from company that delivers on time (certainly not BFL - they promised 2 weeks and delivered in 14 months).

For beginners, mining is not interesting. You need quite some knowledge and also luck to do it right and not lose money. Create an account on some exchange and just buy bitcoins for $100 or so - play with it for some time, explore. You will probably see the amazing feats after some time. Then you might be interested in buying bitcoins (buy smaller amounts in regular intervals). When you get more invested, you will get the experience with the volatility - it is mind blowing to see 500 % profit in 1 month and it is soul tearing to see losing half of your money in a few days. But still - the best strategy is to buy and hold - not to mine anymore.

Hashing is just a way to "shuffle" the digits of the number we input. It is exact procedure, so when you take the input again and you do it again, you end with the same result. What is interesting that getting from input to result is very easy (mechanical) thing. However, getting from result to input (i.e. guessing/computing the original input from the result) is very hard or nearly impossible. 
This is why hashing is used in mining - miners need to find input which results in result (so called hash) that starts with many zeros. So we know what the result should look like but we do not have any easy way to find the corresponding input for the result we set (such input that when we compute the hashing function for it, we get the result we had chosen)... ...so we/miners have nothing better than trying many inputs, computing hash function for those and checking if the result, by chance, matches the requirements (enough leading zeros).
So, it is very hard to find the block (the input which after hashing gives result with enough leading zeros) because miner needs to try billions of varying inputs... ...but when the correct input is found - it is easily verifiable by anyone that it is correct. Which was the point - it needs to be hard to find the block (so there are not many blocks being created) but it needs to be easy to verify that the block is correct (so the nodes can spread the newly found block rapidly through the whole Bitcoin network)...

I propose to encode firstbits as words - now, 3 to 4 words (from 1626 vocabulary) are enough to encode all existing adresses in blockchain. Even if Bitcoin goes mainstream, you would be able to have firstbits word encoding with not more than 4 or 5 words (from say 5000 vocabulary) for all addresses in blockchain.
Using external shortening service is extra hassle - as you need to distribute other data alongside the blockchain, users need to go trough registration, etc... The encoding described above is easy to calculate from blockchain, the address codes can be displayed next to the addresses in block explorers &amp; even wallets could be enhanced to support it quite easily (I suppose). In fact, I sent this suggestion to blockr.io - the only blockchain explorer supporting firstbits now (I know of). Fingers crossed. ;)

You can export the private key (corresponding to address in your Bitcoin Core client you sent your bitcoins to) and then import this private key into Electrum. This way you will get the control over your bitcoins without the need to synchronize the whole blockchain.

Bringing in more newcomers (users / consumers / clients / people who want it) is the only way how anybody can get rich (if we are not counting stealing). That's basically the key to any business and to valuation of any scarce resource. If you call it scheme/scam in the case of Bitcoin, you must then call everything a scam/scheme - every industry, every commodity, every thing people offer for sale.
In fact, you do not need newcomers - it is enough when the late adopters (or basically everybody who is already "in" including early adopters) just buy more and more. Imagine what will happen when every one of the current ~1 million Bitcoin users buys $1000 worth of Bitcoin every month...

Gold has value for some people in some situations - in some situations it is completely useless or even detrimental. Same holds for all other things.

Offline wallet if you have more bitcoins plus either hot wallet on your PC or online wallet (i.e. wallet hosted on some server in the Internet) plus maybe also yet another wallet on your mobile device. Try all options and choose the best for you... 


There is a bot on reddit that scans all replies where you use its name ("+ / u / bitcointip") - if you use correct format, it sends bitcoin tip from your account to account of the person you are replying to (or person you mention in the command). 
When you sign up ('sign up!' link), bitcointip bot automatically creates bitcoin address for you - tips you receive are being send there (but be sure you click 'ACCEPT' when you receive message from the bot about the new tip you received). You can then withdraw by telling the bot to send bitcoins to other bitcoin address you control (eg. receiving address created in Electrum). See also

Blockchain is like a book with transactions (i.e. ledger). Everyone in the whole world needs to have the same book so we agree what transactions took place.
But how to add new entries in the book? How to agree which new version is the preferred one? 
These questions are addressed by mining - mining is like writing new page into our book (i.e. writing down some/all transaction people want to make). The trick is that it is very hard to add the new page.  You simply write new transactions but you also need to win a lottery sort of - for your page to be correct. So it takes long to make/find the new page which is correct (only 1 miner is lucky in the whole world every 10 minutes), then this new page is sent to all other nodes in the Bitcoin network (this takes less time - seconds). Then the cycle repeats - all miners received the longer book so they try to append a new page into it once again.

2048 blocks after the halving the difficulty will adjust, so the problem you are hinting at is pretty much that that one difficulty period might be longer than 14 days.

The first rule of project Mayhem is...
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:07:22
You can print out private keys for an address in Bitcoin-Qt - there is some command for it in its console (dumpprivkey maybe). So if you have one savings address in Bitcoin-Qt this can reduce the chance of loss of funds. (Also note that when you make backup of wallet.dat - there are only 100 next change addresses stored. So, if you make more than 100 transactions, each with different change address, the new change addresses' private keys will not be in the backup (so you need to do backups periodically)).
You can try Electrum - it is a thin client (no blockchain download) and it has beautiful backup option (which works as paper wallet also) - the seed. The seed is a big number encoded as 12 words - from this 12 words, Electrum is able to generate all Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private keys your wallet has and will ever have in the future (this is called deterministic wallet).

@_date: 2014-04-23 13:56:29
Look [here]( - choose Electrum there - go to Downloads and download Portable version. [Direct Link](
Electrum is easy to use, it has some very nice features (eg. for wallet backup everything you need is the seed) and is more intuitive &amp; reliable than MultiBit IMHO.
Just start the program, write the seed on paper and then use the receiving address (one of them) on your page. When you get first payment, try to send it to your other addresses in Electrum. 
When you start to receive many payments, for extra security, you will need to create one extra "cold" Electrum wallet - with the same procedure as above - but on a machine that is not connected to the Internet.

Most of my friends are "computer people" - we were playing computer games for many years together, we have been exploring capabilities of computers, programming, art on computers. We were on computer science college together, etc.. Nobody of them is interested. Well, two of them bought 2 BTC after many months of my shared enthusiasm. 
The mindset is so different and the change so big that it will take many years before people get comfortable with alternative currency...

On the Y-axis, instead of the normal spacing of values (say 1 cm means 100 dollars or 1,000 giga-hashes or whatever), the spacing is like this: each step up (e.g. 1 cm) means e.g. 2 times higher value (or 10 times or 1.1 times - this depends on the scaling of the Y axis). 
See the examples here:
...the [first chart]( is linear - you see that since 2013-07-01 the hashrate grows very rapidly. ...But what happened before 2013-07-01? 
...the [fifth chart]( is logarithmic (exponential) - you can see that the spacing of the values on Y axis is different. You can read the same things from the chart for the recent period (since 2013-07-01) as in the first chart (albait in less detail), but you also can see what happened before 2013 - e.g. that Bitcoin network mining power was rising dramatically till 2011-06-01 - but after that there was a long period of stagnation... So, logarithmic chart gives you (also) information about the growth - it directly shows you how rapid the growth was (higher slope means higher growth). E.g. when the value goes from 1 to 2 in one month and from 1000 to 2000 in other month, the slope will be the same for these both (unlike on the normal (linear) chart).

Interesting. Could you also elaborate along these lines?: 
National states are losing power and disintegrating (because of losing control over money and because blockchain and other distributed technologies allow forming of effective groups and reaching consensus without the need to maintaining institutions by force). People are more free in what they can do / where they can go. People can pay more directly for what they need (protection, infrastructure, health, ...). Colonies in space are established (orbit, Moon, asteroids).

Bitcoin is not stagnating, if you mean - new subscribers are coming fast. Also do not forget that one of the big appeals of dc is mining - with their ultra short halving time, this will not be true one year from now (also because new fashionable altcoin will very likely "hit the market")...

The speculation that Bitcoin will be better and will increase in value is what draws many people in. 
Also the network you describe would be built by state/banks, right, not by enthusiasts - I think state institution cannot build anything comparable to Bitcoin no matter how hard and expensive they try.
In your example, the central institution must be buying/selling (or: destroying/creating) your e-dollar according to situation so it keeps its value exactly at $1 - this means there is much weaker network effect - as people have lesser incentive to spread the word. 
And now it also occurred to me that what you describe is basically what Neobee will (I think) offer - account denominated in EUR but held in bitcoins - you have your say 100 EUR on your account all the time - but it is there in bitcoins (and their amount changes with time according to current exchange ratio). So you can use your money for bitcoin payment but you do not lose/gain value when price of bitcoins changes.

Sometimes, experience goes against you. 
I believe this time it is really different - Bitcoin is a beautiful piece of engineering, it's the fuse of bittorrent (i.e. unstoppable peer-to-peer sharing), open-source (nobody owns, everybody can see &amp; improve), proof of work (computation used to reach distributed consensus) and cryptography (usage of cryptographic signatures to prove you are the one who the sender sent bitcoins to), and it is really going to change the world in one way or other. We lost independent money (two, three, four?) hundred years ago; there was also never such a thing as global currency; there was never a currency which you can so easily store/hide/protect from malicious players.
If you think the above might be true - be sure you study FAQ (see sidebar) and the original Satoshi's whitepaper. You should then be able to answer all your teacher's questions. (But don't bother too much persuading him if you see he turns out to be dogmatic.)

Bitcoin is digital cash. You cannot simply put the money back once it went somewhere. It's different thing than with banking accounts that are heavily controlled. This control over money in case of banking accounts might look nice at the first sight, but the power gets easily misused/corrupted. Government can silence the voices of opposition just by forcing payment processors and banks to stop money flows to anybody they don't like (look how they were blocking Wikileaks). Too heavy regulation hinder innovation, etc.
Bitcoin is like a knife - very versatile and so very useful that it is widely used - so it is used also by nefarious people. It's hard/futile to try to improve knife so it cannot be used in wrongdoings.
Bitcoin is also very simple in a sense - so it can be used by anybody anywhere (like knifes can be made and used by anybody anywhere). You simply can't control that.
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:54:01
Some places certainly have excessive amounts of energy (albeit some just during shorter periods of time - like during night or during summer or when there is strong wind, etc.). Sometimes you have energy sources that cannot be easily regulated - and when there is low demand, you either need [this]( or you need to transfer energy far away which costs you quite a lot - as there are significant losses in wires. Sometimes the grid is failing - so you cannot use the main transfer ways, sometimes you build the power plant before the city or the industry complexes that are planned to be using the power... I think having easily transportable shipping containers which convert energy to money that you can just plug in where you need can be interesting for power grid operators...

Current fiat system (supply, channels, ...) is controlled by the banking cartel. Via this system they control us. The monetary inflation is designed to rob us, they are forcing us to take loans (which they also profit from) instead of making savings. Innovation is being hindered and it is tediously slow.

The fact that total supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million and that bitcoins are still being created now is likely the first thing people learn when they start researching and using Bitcoin.


If price of bitcoins goes up 1000-fold, your number will be 1000 times higher. What matters is the ratio. I know that my bitcoins will never lose more than 40 % of their value because of monetary inflation. (And very likely their value will grow thanks to high demand.) This I can't say at all about my fiat savings! The fiat monetary inflation is 5+ % but states sometimes rob people of much more instantly.

How much purchasing power the dollar lost over time? Despite the unbelievably fantastic gains in productivity and production efficiency (so everything else being equal, the purchasing power should be going up fast).




I do not agree with this. The more you shield people from the outside the more dumb they evolve. Then everything is even worse - they are even more ignorant and relying on you, you need to spend even more energy and it just spirals down to complete hell.
Bitcoin is a technical innovation that brings unique things. Some examples:
* companies/banks/middlemen have the ability to prove easily that they have the money they say they have; 
* trusted third parties can take part as arbiters (escrows) - using m-of-n multisig transactions - to ensure protection but without the need of centralization; 
* people can hold their own money - without the risk that their bank is going to lose it (and that the bail-out will happen from the tax-payer money); 
* people can send their money directly without 3rd parties.
   ...these things were not possible before - it holds the promise for far simpler, cleaner and more honest financial systems.
I lost quite a lot in NEOBEE - but I do not want some established regulator (corrupted by existing big patent trolling companies or whatever) to be suffocating new companies. We can learn fast and the free market will take care of things - more transparent companies and more honest persons will get the advantage ...which is completely not the case now.

Download Electrum wallet - it creates receiving addresses for you. When you have some bitcoins on your addresses, you can send from the wallet to any other bitcoin address easily. 
You can use this tip for testing:
+flip verify
(click 'sign up!', send the required message to the bot, it will create bitcoin address for you and from it you can send that (small amount) to the receiving address you will have in Electrum... - see also for more info)
Then there is the question how to get more bitcoins - you can eg. try to buy face-to-face (search for people selling [here]( or you can buy from exchanges. If you are in the US, you can try Coinbase, if you are outside, easiest is probably Kraken.

Bitcoin is not exactly gold. If nobody is mining gold, everything is fine. If nobody is mining bitcoin, network security is zero &amp; it even doesn't work at all.
Consider this positive feedback loop (which is in fact very negative in other sense):
    low price of bitcoins =&gt; hashrate goes (rapidly) down thanks to your adjustment of block reward =&gt; confidence of people in bitcoins and Bitcoin network goes down =&gt; price goes down =&gt; hashrate goes even more rapidly down
...then when the price is nearly zero and security is low, one of these happens:
* 51 % attack - this shatters the rest of the confidence -&gt; end?
* people realize: WTF? Bitcoin **is** useful, why aren't we buying and using it more -&gt; mega bubble follows...
So, you will make Bitcoin [price/system] much more unstable. You will also obfuscate the system of monetary inflation. Now it is easy to explain - each 210000 blocks, the reward halves. Bitcoin is very hard to understand for normal people as it is now. Adding some additional complex rules will make Bitcoin much less interesting for people.
I believe that pegging to fiat is very bad idea, let's keep bitcoin completely separated - so it is a real independent alternative.

Yeah, if you look at long enough timescales, they are still in uptrend. If you are interested in shorter periods, you will see it as trend reversal and downtrend. 
Whatever. All I am saying is that there are short term oscillations (volatility, bubbles) and longer term trends. It's up to you what timescales you (cherry-)pick, it's up to you what conclusions you draw. 
In the last year, bitcoins are in decline, however if we look at 2 or 3 years, bitcoin price is in enormous up-trend. For you this means Bitcoin is doomed and going to fail, for me this means that Bitcoin was never in better shape and that it is and will be unbelievably successful.

Consumers need to learn and improve their skills then... There is no way (I am aware of ATM) you can make consumer protection in decentralized manner. So, you are pushing for centralized regulation &amp; control - and we know that is prone to be corrupt and we do not like it.
Imagine a situation when people suddenly are able to go outdoor - they weren't able to do it before and now, suddenly, they are wandering and hiking outside. It's laughable to call for "hiker's protection" - to demand cushions to be maintained under each rock, under each place where people can fall down. It is absurd to demand having first-aid posts in every square km of the landscape. People just have to realize that something (i.e. walking where there is danger of falling) is often dangerous and that they should not do that - or if they want to do that - that they should be very careful.
Bitcoin is different, it's the alternative, it is something completely new. Do not try to push it into the existing cages. It's completely new and people need to learn that they need to behave differently here than they are used to.
I think we can tell which services and merchants are honest and good and which not. The community shares the information about who can be trusted. Earning trust takes long and losing it is easy - you then can use the services you know you can trust and you do not need to read hundreds of pages of law-speak every time you use different merchant/service - you just know or you find out whether they are honest and caring about their customers.
This is new world, I believe this world is better (or at least it forms the nice counter-example or mirror to current status-quo) and you either adapt or die (I mean: keep off).

1. You know that the total amount of bitcoins will never be more than 21 millions, right? ...To use bitcoins, you need to hold some amount of them for some time (between you buy them and between you spent them) - this could be anything between minutes and hours/days/weeks... The more people use bitcoins the more bitcoins are in this state bought but not spent yet - as bitcoins are limited, the price of them rises. Also - when people see how useful bitcoins are, they will keep some as reserve for further purchases instead of spending of everything immediately (this is also reinforced by the fact that bitcoins have (in current setting when people are joining) lower inflation that fiat).

Larger players are buying and selling (to move the market) to make profit.

Just do cost averaging and try to not watch the charts every 10 minutes...
You can also try to harvest the volatility - just keep the same value in fiat and in bitcoins (i.e. rebalance every day or week or whatever - i.e. either buy (if price of BTC went down) or sell (if the price went up) so you have again the same value in fiat and in bitcoins). This is suboptimal if the price goes up and up and up, but you can make money if there is large volatility without significant uptrend.

Can be that when we do nothing it could be suddenly too late, OTOH I think our understanding is still very limited. For what I know, the whole thing can act as a pendulum - now we have more CO2 and higher temperature, but the planet can start adjusting (plants, water cycles, air currents...) and when we do actions too big (which will reinforce/multiply the natural planet-cooling effects) we can arrive in ice age (worse than it could have been without us doing anything). We know there are natural cycles with ice age periods. Are we sure that we can't make the oscillation amplitude worse with our eventual rushed large scale "anti-warming" actions? 
You look like a good guy! ;) Good luck with anything you do.

This number is arbitrary. Satoshi was free to choose eg. hard cap at 2.1 bitcoins not 21 million. So now, you would have 1 BTC worth $600,000,000... 


There is nothing like intristic value. Things have intristic feats/properties. What we perceive as value are the relations between things - it's the result of our actions (stemming from our needs). You are dying in the desert, do you chose 1 barrel of water or do you choose one metric ton of gold? You see - in that situation, 1 barrel of water has higher value than a ton of gold... But wait - what if you know that the rescue is coming in minutes? ...but - what if they tell you over radio that that gold is from drug lords and that police in your state will shoot you if you take it? 
Value is not intristic, it depends on what actions are done in concrete situations.

I did not say the switch to floats is needed. I said precision can be increased by adding one extra integer number (which will represent fractions of satoshi).
I will show you an example. Let's suppose for simplicity that we have 2-bit unsigned integers (in reality, ints are 16 bits or longer). We will have two of this 2-bit integers - one representing whole "bitcoins" and one representing fractions of bitcoins:
| First integer (whole bitcoins)   | Second integer (fractions of bitcoins)  | Decimal value |
| 00  | 00 | 0.00 
| 00  |  01 | 0.25
| 00 | 10 | 0.50
| 00 | 11 | 0.75
| 01  | 00 | 1.00 
| 01  |  01 | 1.25
| 01 | 10 | 1.50
| 01 | 11 | 1.75
| 10 | 00 | 2.00
...let's stop here - and say that our total supply is 2 bitcoins (we could represent up to 3.75 bitcoins with our two integers, but let's keep it shorter). Now, the smallest unit is 0.25. Now, we realize this is too big (the price of bitcoins went too high, so we need to represent smaller fractions of bitcoins. Lets add one more integer:
| First integer (whole bitcoins)   | Second integer (fractions of bitcoins) | Third integer (even smaller fractions of bitcoins  | Decimal value |
| 00 | 00 | 00 | 0.0000
| 00 | 00 | 01 | 0.0625
| 00 | 00 | 10 | 0.1250
| 00 | 00 | 11 | 0.1875
| 00 | 01 | 00 | 0.2500
| 00 | 01 | 01 | 0.3125
| 00 | 01 | 10 | 0.3750
| 00 | 01 | 11 | 0.4375
| 00 | 10 | 00 | 0.5000
| | | | |
| 01 | 00 | 00 | 1.0000 
| 01 | 00 | 01 | 1.0625
| 01 | 00 | 10 | 1.1251
| 01 | 00 | 11 | 1.1875
| 01 | 01 | 00 | 1.2500
| 01 | 01 | 01 | 1.3125
| 01 | 01 | 10 | 1.3750
| 01 | 01 | 11 | 1.4375
| 01 | 10 | 00 | 1.5000
| 01 | 10 | 01 | 1.5625
| | | | |
| 01 | 11 | 10 | 1.8750
| 01 | 11 | 11 | 1.9375
| 10 | 00 | 00 | 2.0000
...now the smallest unit is 0.0625. We enhanced the precision by adding one extra integer (to represent fractions of the original smallest unit which was 0.25 (see above)). We enhanced precision without diluting value of our bitcoins - because the total amount of bitcoins (our base unit) will remain 2. We can now buy coffee for 0.0625 or 0.125 or 0.1875 which was not possible before we enhanced precision.

It is now 25 BTC. Miner puts its BTC address in the new block and sends to this address 25 BTC which are newly created (i.e. which have no inputs). See eg. the first transaction [here]( - look for "No Inputs (Newly Generated Coins)".


Yes, you would get 25 BTC, but the probability of finding block if you are solo-mining is very very very small. It is better to join mining pool - then you get payments quite often. However, you would need to buy special computer for mining (ASIC) for you to be worth it. Days of CPU/GPU mining are gone. Note also that it is very difficult to buy good ASIC - as the new developments are making current HW obsolete very quick, also there are many scammers (like eg. Butterfly Labs) - they take your money for pre-order and are not delivering in time (basically you receive the device when it is already useless).

I was living in a village in Czech Republic during the communist era (pre-1989). There were two landlines in the whole village (600+ people). Many others wanted to have telephone but the wait times were 15+ years (same also for wait times for cars). So, when you wanted to make a call you needed to go like 400 m by foot, bug that family with the phone - pay them to use it and then you were able to do the call (while they were partially listening).

Mining is like adding new page in the book with transactions. People tell you what transaction they want to do but these transactions must be in the book so all people can agree that they were done. 
Now, it is (on purpose) very hard to create new page in the book - this is because we want to take it approx. 10 minutes. Thousands miners on the whole planet are mining - but only one of them finds the new block (creates the new page in transaction book). It is like this because we want everybody to have the same book - so it must take far longer to create the new page than to spread it over the whole planet (so everybody has the same copy of the book (again))...
Creation of the new page takes long because you/miners need many many tries before the one matching criteria is given - so it is more like a lottery than a hard puzzle.
Once the new page exists it is trivial to verify that it is the correct one - every node of the Bitcoin network verifies that it is correct (that all transactions in it are correct and that creation of that page required large effort) when the new page is broadcasted in the network.

The difficulty adjust in such a way that if in the moment of adjustments the hashrate will stay constant - then the block will be taking exactly 10 minutes. If after the adjustment the hashrate goes up, the time block between blocks is below 10 minutes (regardless of the development before the adjustment). If after the adjustment the hashrate goes down, the time will be more than 10 minutes (again, regardless of who fast up/down the hashrate was going before the adjustment)... 
That is a popular misunderstanding that difficulty adjusts so we have 10 minutes between blocks. In reality it adjusts so we have 10 minutes between blocks **providing the hashrate is constant** from the point of the adjustment on.

Nothing like this in the protocol. Mining pool infrastructure is something outside of the Bitcoin protocol. It is simple - if pool operators do something bad that harms Bitcoin, people who are in the pool will switch to other pool. As nicely explains [here]( pool operators do not want to harm Bitcoin - as it would harm their profits in a big way.

My usage of bitcoins is to accumulate savings!
Regarding "speculation": Every price of everything (be it gold, stocks, real estate, anything) is defined by speculation - by speculation that the current value will remain (or increase eventually). The world is not so stable as you might think (changes in oppinions/styles/fashions; disasters; wars; new technologies), it changes and values of things change with it. You can hardly predict the *unknown unknowns*. So, the word *speculation* is not that powerful as you think. I mean, I speculate I will make it alive to the next halving. I speculate the fiat-infested world economy is not going to crash and burn soon. I speculate 3-rd world countries will continue to slave-work for us. And I speculate that central planning is good and that economists with power do the good things for us. Not. Fucking charlatans!

It is not the issue at all. If people decide to do no transactions for one day - your "cost of transaction" will be infinite in that day. I couldn't care less. What I do care about is that the monetary inflation of Bitcoin will stop eventually. Monetary inflation (and also inflation in general) of fiat will likely never stop. Govsters/banksters siphoning value from us all the time with some "its good for economy" bullshit propaganda.


Bitcoin has deflation (as overall the demand is higher than supply) and monetary inflation (as new bitcoins are being created until the 21 million hard cap is approached). Monetary inflation of Bitcoin has two purposes: one - create and distribute the supply of bitcoins and two - pay miners for their work on verification of transactions and blocks (i.e. maintaining and extending the p2p-shared database known as blockchain).

Unfortunatelly it is too late for mining Bitcoins with CPUs (also GPUs are not usable either for quite a long time already). Nowadays you need specialized computers for mining - so called ASICs.
The best way to get bitcoins is in exchange for something (your fiat money / your services / your merchandise or other items).

In decentralized system you do not have an authority that can say what the exact time is. So whoever creates the next block puts his/her time into the block - this time may differ from others.
However, timestamps are not that important here - what is most important is that new block includes the hash of previous block. By this a chain is being made - it is obvious that the new block follows the previous block.

Bitcoin is still small - so the richest are still ignoring it. Most bitcoin-rich guys now are:
* early developers (cypherpunks, programmers);
* early miners (the above + their friends + other anti-establishment folk; many young gamers who started mining with GPU in 2011);
* people believing in the idea of Bitcoin (i.e. that current fiat power structures can be bypassed by using cryptocurrency);
* Bitcoin entrepreneurs;
...i.e. people who believed in the idea of Bitcoin and who were taking (big) risks and/or working hard so Bitcoin can become what it is now.


It is easy to look back now and to be jealous. Remember that two years ago, Bitcoin had very little media attention, many people were ridiculing the idea, many people were sure Bitcoin is going to die soon. At that time you either sold everything or you were true believer and held on your bitcoins. Keeping is a risk now and it was far bigger risk (probably) back then. Your envy does Bitcoin no good - in fact it harms it because you are downplaying all the good work many people before have done to develop Bitcoin and get it where it is now. 
Also, controlled money supply of Bitcoin was engineered in such a way that the adoption was incentivized. Having some different scheme (which could be naively seen as better and more fair) could have had significant detrimental effect on the whole thing. Nearly all headlines were made by price going up not by revealing the far-reaching potential which is in Bitcoin. Bitcoin distribution is honest and it is fair. Bitcoin is sound &amp; hard money. Bitcoin is viable alternative to fiat - and the way it was distributed is part of all this.


This is truly a free market, there are no regulations. Anybody is free to spread FUD, anybody is free to try to move the market and cause panic sell/buys with their large orders. People who are susceptible to panic should not be entering this realm at all. OTOH people who are able to rationally evaluate the value (or non-value) of Bitcoin and the effect of their actions can do fine. The more volatility the more money you can make at the expense of panic sellers / panic buyers if you stick to your plan.
Rich people have the advantage in everything - they can buy everything they want if they need it. The good thing about Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is dissolving their corrupt foundations and that it is so different and revolutionary that certain level of intelligence is required for understanding and believing in the idea. 


No, most important part of a currency is that rich people are not able to steal it "legally" from you.

We have long number which is private key, from it we get (by doing some elliptic math stuff) public key. From public key, we can (by doing some hash math stuff) get bitcoin address.
You can send bitcoins to new bitcoin address (yours or belonging to somebody else) - for this you do not need anything but that address. However, when the owner of this new address sends bitcoins elsewhere, public key that corresponds to that address is revealed in the transaction (as corresponding private key is used to get public key and also to sign the transaction). 
So - addresses (which contain bitcoins but) from which no bitcoins were sent are relatively (!) more secure. As it is theoretically easier to go from public key to private key than to get from BTC address to private key. 
Note that both matematical operations mentioned (elliptic functions and hash functions) are very easy to compute in one direction, but going in opposite direction (getting private key from public key and also getting public key from its hash) is unimaginably hard.

The system is self-adjusting thanks to the changes in [difficulty]( (also [here]( and also thanks to the fact that when price is lower and difficulty higher, the new investments tend to go less into mining and more into (buying) bitcoins.
Also, difficulty is usually not dropping - only new investments are being cancelled/postponed, but many unprofitable miners continue to run because the costs of HW are sunk costs and even when your miner is all in all unprofitable it can return more than you spend on electricity, so you let it run.

Current financial system is fucked up. Bitcoin is people's, honest, complete, cheaper and better alternative. It's both new form of money (scarce, limited to 21 million (but very divisible)) and also the system that allows sending money. 
Everything works completely in decentralized fashion (do you know Bittorrent? (that nobody was able to shut down)). You just run the (classic) Bitcoin client, you are part of the network, transactions/data are being send from and to the peers (discovered) around you, there is no center that can be shut down, there is no company running this (its community open-source software). 
Being open-source, Bitcoin software (network) is very open to innovations. Examples: ...
More detail:
It's a shared database - everyone has a copy of the full ledger with confirmed transactions. When new record is created ("found" i.e. "mined"), it is distributed to all nodes in the network. If you shut half of the nodes in the network, the other half of the network will run just fine (this is like the internet itself).
Receiving and sending bitcoin works like this: you install an app (takes 1 minute), you give your bitcoin address to somebody (1 minute), you receive (unconfirmed) bitcoins (1 minute). Usual confirmation time is between 10 minutes and 1 hour. Sending bitcoins is just as easy: open app, copy paste address, send.
Technically, sending bitcoin works like this: you keep your private key. This private key allows you to send bitcoins from an bitcoin address (that was derived from this private key and that now has some balance (i.e. somebody sent bitcoins to this address before)). It's public key cryptography - you sign the transaction with your public key and everybody can see that the transaction is correct - they don't know your private key, but they can see from the public key, that the private key was used to sign the transaction.
If you can keep your private key(s) safe, nobody can steal your bitcoins.

Yes, but it was a bad solution (done perhaps initially in the good faith - but the results are horrible)... 
My analogy for you: people go hill-climbing outside. Some of them fall down and die. And your cure is: place cushions under every fucking hill under every rock one can potentially fall from. Create bureaucracy to manage the for-profit companies that are placing the cushions. Create hospitals at the base of every hill, identify all people who go outside and let them pay for the licence - or even force them to use only licensed guides... And at top of this all - bullshit people how this is really necessary to protect them. This completely insane scenario is what happened with banking/financial institutions and regulations of these. While the answer was very simple indeed: do not go outside - or if you go - take care! Avoid dangerous things. Know what you are doing.

Pre-orders are very risky - that is the first fact (BFL promised 2 weeks and shipped in 1 year). Then, you have big uncertainty regarding difficulty - ASIC manufacturers are flooding the market with ASICs in waves. It can easily happen that the difficulty would be much more when you finally receive your miner than you expected. Count in the risk of HW failures that can put your mining opreation on hold for weeks. And you should also count your time spend with maintenance (you need to check it every day if it is running).
Next, many videos about Bitcoin are older than 1 year, that was the time when it was profitable to mine with gaming graphics cards - so now, many newbies are still buying mining HW even if that is not profitable (at the moment maybe). In any case, there are big number of professional miners (including some datacenter-large mining farms), so it is hard for new miners to do the right thing at the right time (i.e. buy the right mining HW and get it actually delivered in time).
Last thing - you have to compare how much BTC you would mine over time and how much BTC you could buy now (or as I recommend: now + in near future)... I think this comparison was much more in favour of BTC holders than BTC miners in the last year - i.e. many ppl would have been better of just buying BTC than buying mining HW as we were and probably still are in some sort of bitcoin-mining-HW-bubble.

You are right. Send bitcoins from the imported address to one of the addresses generated from seed.


Yes. Easier and also more secure.


I think this is a non-issue. You probably did many transactions (so you now have many change addresses with non-zero balance each) - why not to do one more transaction that will consolidate your bitcoins into one address in Electrum before you import the private key of that address to other wallet. - If you must insist on doing that.

It becoming reserve currency is absurd, but it works quite well already, you know. Current user count is estimated at 2 - 5 million. Even if there are no new users at all, Bitcoin can still compete with fiat currencies - as its [monetary inflation is under 4 % since the last halving]( It is used globally, has some unique characteristics, it has a community, it is an alternative to scammy fiat currencies and scammy banking services. It ignites critical thinking - suddenly inflation-at-all-costs approaches of (central) banks is not the only way how to do things.
I genuinely believe that it's in its infancy. We overestimate new things in short timescales and underestimate those in/for the long run. Bitcoin is not used by everyone yet - and might never be - but that doesn't mean that it will not be used by tens or even hundreds millions in 10 or 20 years. 
It takes long time for people to understand new things; with Bitcoin it is yet more difficult because it is still very technically demanding (for a lot of people it looks like scam) and because it reaches significantly into very cemented areas of human understanding (what is value, what is money). 
I believe a lot of mainstream economists are just charlatans (read [Nassim Taleb's Black Swan]( who just fight to keep their insane central planning dogmas alive. A lot of powerful people are interested in keeping people ignorant about how fiat "money" works so they can keep their control.
Bitcoin is global, transparent, open to everyone (using/improving), fair, and well designed to resist the oppression. It is useful an it will be in the future.

Why can't you go to a parking lot and impostor somebody's car key remote and trick the cars to accept it?
Bitcoins coming to your Bitcoin address are also having locks, kind of - and only you, the owner of the address' private key, can "unlock" those locks and send those bitcoins where you please. The key is so complicated (i.e. number so long) that it cannot be guessed/forged by others. 
More technically - every normal transaction has outputs (bitcoins sent). With these outputs are attached so called scripts (our "locks") - that say what needs to be done so these outputs can be used as inputs in next valid transaction (i.e. send somewhere). Usually, these scripts say that the transaction needs to be signed with key that is attached to the address where the bitcoins are.

Every bitcoin address in your wallet has its private key. Anybody who controls (knows) this private key can spend bitcoins from that address. (Import that private key into other wallet and send the bitcoins somewhere.)
Now, when you generate your bitcoin addresses (create your wallet) on a machine that is connected to the Internet, it is possible that a virus gets access to those private keys - when the virus sends the information to its creator over the Internet - the bad guy can then steal your bitcoins. 
When you generate your addresses on computer that is not connected to the Internet (and ideally will not be afterwards), the risk of theft is significantly reduced. (Be also sure that your wallet software is downloaded from trusted source - ideally on clean machine.)

The problem was that someone wants to do remittance in bitcoin (i.e. send bitcoins from abroad to Zimbabwe) but can't because there is no use of bitcoins for the receiver in Zimbabwe. So I think one of that uses can be selling those bitcoins to tourists.
If tourists (or "tourists") come there and buy those coins with cash they bring with them, they can enable remittances and also help themselves to somewhat cheaper coins (also leaving the country with bitcoins is more convenient than leaving with local cash)...

Bitcoin is digital cash on the Internet, run by people like you or me - no economists or financiers are needed.

Bitcoin is *open source* - you can see the whole program, every single command there, you can even improve it. There is no company behind this, just volunteer programmers. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible - this is boon for merchants (escrow services can be run on top of Bitcoin so also buyers can have protection). Bitcoin transactions are instant 24/7/365, fees are minimal. As Bitcoin is open source - there is great potential for services and improvements - everybody can add value (list of interesting sites follows)...

No, it's 40B per every (fake) output address you put into the transaction. You can have thousands of them there, so you can create single transaction with kilobytes of data.
If your transaction is p2sh, you can also encode your data into the (fake) script hash - see first script in 'Output Scripts' [here]( I guess this can make additional 40B per every (P2SH) (fake) output address in your transaction.

Also the quality is favored - when inclined to spending less, you look for goods that last longer and are repairable. What's also good is that savings enable people to exploit opportunities. It also leads people into good habits - people are thinking about their needs and they try to reduce the number of things they need - increasing the number of resources they can spare either for others or for themselves when they really need those in the future.


When you save sound money, value of the rest of it that is in circulation goes up. So, the savers in fact increase the purchasing power of the others who are spending - which means saving is not harming the economy.
Inflation - done by some central planning charlatans - robs ordinary people of value. This value is invisibly transferred to banks - THEY do nothing &amp; "make money".

Keeping your bitcoins in online wallet is considered high-risk.
To be more secure: 
Generate [Electrum]( wallet on offline computer (not connected to the Internet), write the seed to paper (this is now your paper wallet, you can recreate your offline Electrum wallet with it).
You can then either:
* Delete offline wallet and keep the seed on paper as your paper wallet only. 
* Start using your offline wallet as your savings account which is "shielded" form the attacks coming from the Internet (as it is able to send your funds, but is not connected to the Internet at any point during receiving/[sending](

With the exception of like 2 months in 2011 and two times 2 months in 2013 - when the biggest bubbles were starting - the price always was (and is) going down after the gains. Nearly always it was/is a bad idea to do what your immediate emotions dictate ...you then buy high and sell low if you know what I mean. The less you expect it, the more likely it is to happen.
At the beginning, don't look for immediate profit. It's better to try as many different options as possible. Bitcoin price is volatile - few percents is nothing. Even the difference of 10 or 20 percents will look negligible some months from now.
If your gut feeling is that it absolutely must go up significantly from now on - that we are on the brink of the next big bubble -  ask your friend to buy some for you. He most likely has ways to buy cheaper and more rapidly than you can manage now.
&amp; Do not panic!
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:34:26
No idea, really. You can try to buy in small amounts - then you will see if something happens again (there is non-zero chance that your comp is clean &amp; that the problem was elsewhere).
If you buy on exchange with 2FA &amp; send to cold wallet I guess there will be no problems. 
Regarding antivirus protection against Bitcoin related malware - I've seen no assesments here. Bitcoin malware might be so insignificant in the grand scheme of things (yet?), that it flies under radar of anti-virus companies. Again, I am clueless. The general advice is to switch to Linux.

Maybe some of them are doing it already - which is bad. Nonsensical transaction shouldn't be stored in blockchain forever just to please some loud people.
Blocks not full is a non-issue. There is only small fraction of non-full blocks if mempools have transactions with adequate fees, so it doesn't matter. If it is controversy it is because of people who don't understand the technical side of Bitcoin and/or those who need to stir the shit at all costs (there is a group that want to take control over Bitcoin). 
Miners have financial incentive to mine transactions (this is stronger if fees are higher). If there are more efficient miners (mine blocks with more fees in transactions) - these will eventually drive out the less efficient miners. 
Also note that the majority of non-full blocks are the fast blocks - that are coming just seconds after the previous block. When block is mined by somebody, all miners have to filter all transactions that are in the new block from their mempools (to avoid mining invalid block that contains transaction that is already in the previous one) - this takes some time during which is reasonable to try to mine empty block.

This is not feasible - you can't have memory storage and conditions and loops in "script 2" unless you add fees for step/memory - which would force you to rethink the whole architecture. You can't (pretty much) do big changes to system "so big" and so important.
I was also thinking like you before - we just do everything in Bitcoin, everything in blockchain. But now it seems to me that Bitcoin is going to be wonderful it it "just" works as (mainstream) money+payment system and as the source of imagination for other projects (BitMessage, Twister, and now Ethereum). I believe Vitalik is one of 10 topmost Bitcoin experts - he knows Bitcoin, he loves it, he is by no means creating Ethereum to get rich or to put Bitcoin down. The two infrastructure will be coexisting, cooperating and enriching each other mutually.

Bitcoin is truly extraordinary, it has many unique characteristics:
* alternative to state maintained/enforced fiat currencies;
* deflationary unlike all other currencies;
* digital, digital cash;
* without center, without (centralized) authority, peer to peer;
* global, open, transparent, open source.
It's very hard to understand that such thing is at all possible if you just got in touch with it... *Unless significant effort is spent, one can come with many simple (&amp; wrong) reasons why it will not or can not work...
But it is worse:
* it is too good to be true seemingly and its supporters are too enthusiastic - so it resembles ponzis/scams to many people;
* still a lot of technical knowledge is required - even people who work routinely with computers are not confident enough to keep any value on their computers;
* people are conditioned to trust in authorities - bankers (and politicians and mainstream economists they bought) are busy with making people more trusting, ignorant and non-critical - the better they implant their *"we know everything; we are here to do best for you; there are absolutely no sensible alternatives anyway; best you can do is not to bother"* dogmas into people the easier they can profit &amp; rule - outrageously continually robbing people without anybody noticing. The more time and energy people invested in the current system/worldview the harder for them to realize&amp;believe it all can be lies so nasty and practices so throughly rotten.
Forgot about evangelizing. Help people who ask for it, but do not push it into people who are ignorant. Sooner or later a lot of them will realize how can Bitcoin work and what makes it unique. From utterly obscure Bitcoin very slowly turns into normal &amp; ubiquitous. Give it time.

When the price goes up, many people are buying not because the price is good, but because the price keeps getting up (so they hope they can sell after short time to get profit). Then, finally, the price is higher than it "should" be. This is because at given price, more ppl are inclined to sell than to buy - so the price goes down. Then again, some people sell everything, because they think they can make profit when they re-buy the same bitcoins cheaper. So - you have the same thing in the opposite direction... However, all these price swings are just oscillations - the overall trend is up.
Look here:  switch to 1w, locate the April and December bubbles, then switch to 3d or 1d and examine how similar the price developments are...

How it works: it works like bittorrent (it's network of peers, anybody can join and become the node of the network) - all people are sharing the same database called *blockchain*. Then, to have bitcoins and to send them, you need bitcoin wallet (e.g. Electrum) - this wallet will generate (and handle for you) bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private keys that you use to send bitcoins. This works in the same way like public key cryptography (you bitcoin address is (hashed) public key, everybody can send to you, but only you can send "from" you - using your private key). And last but not least - Bitcoin is not run by any company - it is open source software. In the source code, there are rules how exactly it should work (how koscher transaction looks like; how the shared database is extended; how much bitcoins exist; etc.) - every node in the network uses these rules to maintain correct functionality of the whole. 
How can you start: 
* read FAQ which is in sidebar on right hand side -----------&gt;
* download Electrum &amp; try receiving and sending
* examine  (blocks, transactions, newly created bitcoins, ...)
...and then report back with a bit more specific questions.

Bitcoin is peer to peer system. If you run Bitcoin-Qt, it searches "around" for other running Bitcoin-Qt clients on the Internet. It connects to those. Then, all these nodes are sending Bitcoin transactions (and also blocks) among each other - so everybody in the network knows about the new transactions. The interesting part is that there is no center - kill random half of the nodes and the rest will work as good as before... 
Every full node also does verification - it tests every incoming transaction for correctness. If it is formed according to rules, it is broadcasted to other nodes. If it fails to pass, it is discarded. The same goes for blocks. So, if your full node receives new block where the miner mined 10,000 BTC, your node will discard this block as it is not according to rules (now, only 25 new bitcoins can be created in new block).

This is purely local thing - Bitcoin addresses when generated are not registered anywhere or anything. (That's why you can also generate those offline.) The space of all possible BTC addresses is so vast that you can be 100 % sure that when you generate new randomly you have unique address (and it's private key!) that nobody generated ever before.


What do you mean by "blockchain"? You mean blockchain.info? Have you tried other online blockchain explorers?
Online blockchain explorers - and also (other) bitcoin nodes - have no idea that BTC address exists until the first transfer to it is made.

True. Most people will be fine with Bitcoin - it will be well established, working, easy, etc. Just some people will need something more powerful - to be able to do identity registration, financial instruments, etc. 
I think Electrum will bring yet other new people to Bitcoin - you need to understand Bitcoin first, you also need to have bitcoins before you can buy ether (I suppose). For large number of computer programmers and scientists, Bitcoin might seem now as nonsense/fad, but hearing about a programming language which runs in some interesting way on distributed network - that could draw their attention.
I think Bitcoin will be better in doing its more specialized job, Ethereum will be very useful for all kinds of advanced stuff - but it will interface with Bitcoin. I can easily imagine Bitcoin usage in every shop and pub in my city in a few years, I do not see this future for Ethereum.

It is silly to take Satoshi as a base unit when there is the possible need for enhanced precision - a need that can be easily addressed by a simple change in a protocol. The cap would remain at 21 million BTC, just the smallest unit wouldn't be 0.00000001 but 0.00000000001 or whatever.


 


Taking the smallest raw units (current Satoshi) as fundamental would be the same thing as taking 0.0000001 or 2^-8 or 2^-16 or whatever as the base units of time or distance instead of seconds or meters - when dealing with machines that represent time/distance in that way. Unit and its representation (and representation of its fractions) are two different things. The second one is machine/application specific.

Let's assume that usual bitcoin buyers do multiple buys over some months and not just single buys. Now, for simplicity, imagine that average buyer has $3000 total budget. 
Scenario A - price is constant (say $1000/BTC). Our average buyers buy a total of 3 BTC.
Scenario B - price varies - it is lower at beginning (say $200) and then it goes up (to $1000). Our average buyer gets more than 5 BTC ...let's say there are 3 buys with $1000 @ $200, $500, $1000. The total no. of BTCs is now: 8 BTC. 
Scenario B leads to higher price of BTC later - because bitcoins are now more scarce (buyers bought more bitcoins with their budgets).
Unrelated, but also in effect: when price goes down, people buy more than they originally wanted - i.e. they even increase their total budgets - because: "If I was buying @ $600 - I need also buy some @ $200, right?! (even though it is over my original total budget) "

Each miner can decide which transaction should go in the new block that is being made. Miners are incentivized by the fee to include the transactions - however there are cases where there are no available transaction at the moment to be put into new block (like just after the block was found and the miner needs to filter the transactions in memory first not to include transactions used in recent block).
Miners can also always mine 1 transaction blocks just to fuck with the network - but this would mean they are going to lose money (when Bitcoin is not useful, price of bitcoins gets down &amp; this means miners get less value by mining).

Bitcoin - as financial instrument/infrastructure - is completely unique thanks to its openness. You can see exactly how it works (code/blockchain) and you are free to take the initiative and improve either Bitcoin itself or build the layers above it. This never happened in finance on this scale - and we can IMHO compare Bitcoin to the (personal) computer itself. It took some years, but suddenly there was the digital revolution... ...and we are just at the very very very beginning yet.

With that you can have relatively long chains that will potentially turn out to be invalid - so, I think e.g. 6 confirmations with mining on headers only would be weaker than 6 confirmations with mining on fully validated blocks.

BTC-e is an exchange - which means it has an orderbook where people offer to buy &amp; sell BTC (various amounts at various prices). You just need to register, fund your account by sending bank wire transfer and then click 'buy' - you don't need to talk to people.
If you just click "buy", you will be automatically matched with first sell order (first meaning "cheapest price offered") &amp; you will automatically buy these bitcoins. If the amount of bitcoins is bigger than is offered in the cheapest sell order, you will be additionally matched with the next cheapest sell order &amp; buy bitcoins also from this order. 
Buying described above is so called "market order" or buying "at market value" (the price will be near the value that you see as bitcoin price at that exchange (and in bitcoin price tickers)). You have also other option if you think the price will go down - creating "buy order" - i.e. you can create an order that says for example "I want to buy 0.2 BTC at price $950/BTC" ...then, if the price goes as low as $950 - which means: there are many people selling - so there is more sellers than buyers and the price goes down (which means all buy orders at $1000 and then $995 and then $990 ... are fulfilled) - your order will be automatically fulfilled - i.e. person who clicks "sell" will be matched with your order (because at that moment your order will be offering highest price per bitcoin) and bitcoins of that person will be exchanged for your fiat money (dollars or whatever).
Once you buy bitcoins - either by just clicking "buy" or by creating buy order that gets fulfilled eventually - you click "withdraw" - there you will put receiving address that you see in your wallet.

more selling than buying ...at all and any price above ~$200.

This is because poorly connected nodes are discouraged. Even 1000 nodes would be enough for smooth operation of the network.

1. download [bitcoin wallet client]( (eg. Electrum for PC)
2. run it - it creates a wallet for you
3. send bitcoins from Coinbase there (to one or more of your 'Receiving' addresses)
4. when you buy something, you have there clickable "bitcoin:" link which opens Electrum with prefilled fields - or you go to Send tab in Electrum and put the BTC address you want to pay to there. If you have wallet on your mobile device you can just scan the QR code - it also fills the fields "pay to" and "amount", etc...
Note: you can send bitcoins directly from coinbase to merchant, but it is not recommended as coinbase is notorious for trasaction sending delays.

Better for people is different from better for bankers. In current system, bankers are able to print money for themselves out of thin air and they also have good profit from giving loans. Savings are diluted - so everyone is incentivized/forced to spend more than they have and take loans. And to add insult to injury, people's savings are used by banks for their purposes - "I deposit" means "I give you this money, do whatever you want with it (tax payers will bail you out eventually)".

Not that very easy as you think. There are risks: volatility (local currencies are not that good in 3rd world countries); institutional theft (inflation, confiscation); theft (somebody just robs them); house fire, etc. 


Regarding monetary deflation - either there will never be monetary deflation (if we do not count lost coins) or there can pretty much be monetary deflation even now (if we count lost coins) - you can't now how much coins is being lost.
I was however referring to deflation in regard to prices. If you look at longer timescales (savings are built over more years) you see that prices denominated in bitcoins go (drastically) down.

Smarter? Perhaps... Unnecessarily complex &amp; allowing them to grab more power over Bitcoin? Possible. 
Someone smarter &amp; more informed than me has to decide...


I fail to see why simple solution that has the potential to be the best at present time should be called dumb.


Hardfork can be announced month(s) in advanced &amp; when "activated" it will be very fast. Softfork, OTOH, can lead to prolonged state where many full nodes think they verify transactions, but in fact, they will not be. 
If there is no other way than soft-fork-forward, hacks can pile upon hacks. Hacked hacks of hacks. Simple hardfork now to increase block size would look like the easiest thing on Earth compared to cleaning that clusterfuck several years later on.


Only harm forever are trolls who say "never" and "forever".


Really? They may lead us into situation when the solution (i.e. Bitcoin client) is very complex &amp; hacked together. Complex solutions =&gt; maintainer (&amp; developer) nightmares.


There are multiple orders of magnitude between 3tps and major credit card company transaction frequency. But - if the capacity is not increased now, in a few months the Bitcoin network "service" will change [significally]( It's possible that Core developers (Blockstream guys) want to use this situation to push solutions that will be helping them and not Bitcoin users...


Because some of the Blockstream guys seem insane.


Nothing failed, alternatives are being developed. Increasing blocklimit &amp; hardforking would not be technically difficult if enough people agree to switch.
Also, preparing an alternative (e.g. Bitcoin Classics) is quite straightforward and easy - if you target just one problem with a simple solution. You can (successfully) hardfork with that one needed simple change &amp; then still merge important sane things from Core (or the other alternatives) later on. 
Imagine all cars currently drive each with 1000 kg deadweight (for some bullshit historical "consensus" reason). What would happen? New firm(s) will emerge who will exactly mirror the cars - just with the deadweight excluded. Technically that would be orders of magnitude more simple than creating new better cars from scratch. So - far less experienced team can fork Bitcoin (if the low blocksize limit is really this deadweight bullshit).


Scaremongering much? If an alternative is presented which is changing one of the fundamentals of Bitcoin, I suppose very few people would be inclined to switch to it.


It can be in fact a clever attack on Bitcoin itself. Is decentralized governance over single thing (Bitcoin network rules) even possible? Isn't this the biggest hurdle? (With increasing importance, larger and larger players/groups could be trying to fight it or steer it in their direction...)
Corers (Blockstreamers) might be the best benevolent dictators who are giving us the brightest future - future we hardly deserve. They can OTOH also be egoistical maniacs who slowly turned batshit crazy over time. In any case - developing alternatives &amp; letting people choose what they want to use seems quite inline with the Bitcoin spirit.

I guess transactions in 6+ month old blocks are so buried that these basically can't be undone. Or do you think we should really be open to appearance of new blockchain (branch) which is worth 6+ months of hashing and strikes from nowhere? 
I don't see how baking checkpoints (checkpoint being a capture of a state of the current blockchain from 6 months ago) into new clients implies any additional trust. We already trust the developers that new client version is kosher. 6 months are so much already that we all see that there is no problem with it and its checkpoint (because we all already agree that the current blockchain is the right one and we do not expect/allow the appearance of heavier blockchain with 6+ months of hashing in it from nowhere)...

Where can you get 0-interest loan with Bitcoin?


Maybe because higher productivity thanks to technology &amp; higher quality of work? Prices should go down even more/faster if there was no inflation robbing us of purchasing power...
Or maybe its because companies took 0-interest loans &amp; so they can produce goods with artificially low prices? (Mal-investments in unnecessarily large factories; bulldozing unnecessary products into people at all costs; dumping prices subsidized with loan money?)
Or maybe the prices are falling because people can't afford or are scared to buy anything non-essential, so there is oversupply?
Or maybe we just abuse 3rd world more efficiently?
Or maybe the cheap credit bubbles finally start popping?
There can be many explanations of falling prices - yet nothing can justify the theft by monetary inflation - the theft by printing money out of thin air.

You can't openly say that the law is bad? Like really?


Hardly. 
This is not a priori about Bitcoin. This group "Ztohoven" is known for stunts that pointed against the state (taking the flag from Prague castle's roof &amp; splitting it among the citizens; machinations with ID's when they gave morphed photos to authorities so ID's were issued without clear clear photo matches to individual persons - then they interchanged these ID's among themselves and lived 6 months with someone else's identity (even committed official acts like weddings under these "fake names" - names of their friends), at the end they made an exhibition out of all that where police immediately picked them up ...ultimately the court verdict was that no crime was committed). They would be doing it even if Polis wasn't Bitcoin-only (or Bitcoin-accepting) place.


Or the opposite. Currently, people are fed from media about Bitcoin connection with terrorists and ransomware. If this gets enough publicity, a lot of people may realize that Bitcoin is used for "normal" things like buying cakes &amp; coffee.
EET (system for central electronic evidence of sales - enforced now for cafés and pubs/restaurants but planned for all kinds of small businesses) is not universally hailed. There are hundreds of cases of small/tiny businesses closing shop because of it. Many people are upset about the additional bureaucracy and spying.
Yeah, it might allow collecting more taxes, but at the same time it brings us yet closer to terrible totalitarian big-brother state that knows everything about all its citizens &amp; punishes even slight deviations from official dogmas and even slight manifestations of free thought.
70-30 years ago, here in CZE, if you spoke your mind - even in pub - about freedom and politics, you ran into danger of being recorded &amp; tracked &amp; even jailed. There were many people who lost their jobs because of that - and even their children were denied education.
We should be very wary about any additional power grabs done by national state (and banks for that matter) as the technology changed our world completely in the last 30 years. It's now far easier for the "ruling class" to monitor and control the people. I would highly recommend watching this: [Eben Moglen - re:publica 2012 - Freedom of Thought Requires Free Media]( to get the feeling.

Huge demand would be there. But it is more convenient for the bankers if they can deny this option to people - who wouldn't want to use other people's money? It's misappropriation (or theft outright) - but legal.


Yes it is. If there is no other way. 
It's like if all service shops brainwashed people that it is ok that their managers/employees can take customers' cars for free rides. You would left your car in a service shop for a week &amp; then you would realize that they were using it all day long every single day at their leisure (doing business, impressing ladies). Yeah, they would be returning your car intact in most cases (they are repair shop after all) - if they do not crash it or if their managers or their friends didn't lose their cars (*"we are bankrupt, your money is gone"*)... Or maybe they will just delay the return of your car - "please come back in a week, we do not have enough cars here ATM", or "here are 2 of your wheels, come back later, we will assemble it back with the rest (we still use the other parts for our purposes)".
TL;DR: banking cartel(s) purposefully deny the deposit option (as opposed to loan-to-bank) to their customers, because they profit if they can abuse customer's money

Satoshi is one hundreth of a microBitcoin which is itself a millionth of a Bitcoin. If you have satoshis and you want Bitcoins: divide by 100 (you have micro bitcoins (or uBTC)) and then divide with 1,000,000 (or twice with 1,000).
e.g. 50 sat/B is 0.50 uBTC/B which is 0.000'000'50 BTC/B
kB is 1000 B
50 sat/B is 0.000'000'50 BTC/B which is 0.000'50 BTC/kB

Bitcoin (Bitcoin network) is set to have the maximum of 21 million BTC - which will happen around 2130 (see [here]( - this is one of the reasons for the price going up - there is less and less bitcoins being created (due to halvings of block reward) - so if there is the same (or higher) demand, the price must rise.

"trade points" == "money", or? You either have it decentralized or gov shuts you down. Are you proposing local but decentralized solution?
Regarding barter / local communities - what I am thinking about is VAT imposed on services: You are expert programmer (and say I am beginner coder), say I am master shoemaker or whatever. 
If you make an app for me, I buy it, I need to pay VAT with money already diminished with income tax and other deductions. I make shoes for you, you buy, you have the same problem. 
... Now, what if we join, do some coding together and some shoemaking together, we build two apps - one for you, one for me (your contribution would be far bigger than mine probably - but this can't be quantified, right), we made two pairs of shoes - one for you, one for me (those would be nearly completely done by me with your small support perhaps). 
We bartered, but this fact is hidden in our collaboration on both tasks - our contributions can hardly be quantified/measured. By this we circumvent not only banks &amp; other money dealers but also the state. Right?

What would be interesting for me is exploration of possibilities of remote presence and remote control. Expert surgeons, pilots, machinery operators, and even interior designers can now possibly use teleoperated manipulators/droids/robots while being paid for their work in Bitcoin. I feel there is whole new world of possibilities... 
One of our friends (PhD in geology) was once in Nicaragua to perform there basic terrain exploration to identify places prone to dangerous mud flows. Maybe I am too naive (I was not discussing this with her) but I can imagine that if she had access to some flying drones (bird-views), 3d maps of terrain and if she could tell local people there which soil/rock samples should be taken &amp; sent for examinations - she could potentially do the work remotely... (Or maybe, at least, the team could be split - eg. half of the members working *in situ* and half of the members doing the work remotely.) Am I crazy enough? :)

More frequent yes, more severe **not**. The crashes are so big now because fiat-controlling institutions are not competent - they are pumping cheap credit into the economy instead of letting it go through the mild depression phase that is very healthy because the economy has the chance to learn about the current situation and it has the chance to adjust. It's kind of like if you try to combat your weariness by drinking more coffee and if you are more tired you drink more coffee and you need to double the doses every time and still the things are not improving. Well, I think cocaine is more suitable as an analogy to inflation - you can go away with it for some days or weeks (read: some years during wars) but it is by no means suitable for the everyday usage (read: decades of inflation means big trouble is coming). 
Look who profits from inflation - banksters, their friends, rich people; middle class is becoming poor, poor people struggle to find some investment to throw the hot potato of fiat to somebody else.
What a tragedy.

When any of the miners finds new block, it has to be propagated through the network (to all nodes and) to other miners. The propagation takes some time - as the size of the block is typically over 0.5 MB. 
This new Gavin's code (proposal) splits block propagation into two parts: header propagation and propagation of the rest. Header is small (I guess under 100 bytes), but it contains a lot of important information about the whole block. 
So, once new block is found, its header is broadcasted fast through the network - all miners then know there is new block and they can start to mine immediately on top of it (instead of on top of the previous block which could lead to creation of orphaned block if they are successful). 
Analogy for the whole thing would be like receiving an email from your colleague: 
"I already finished task 44, please stop your work on task 44 and begin with task 45. (The critical result of task 44 that you need to start task 45 is: XYZZZYYYXXX.)". 
This message can save a lot of time - because you can get it &amp; read it typically faster than getting and evaluating all of the work of your colleague (he e.g. didn't put all the pieces together, yet - so you can't see everything that was done for task 44 in your corporate network, yet). 
So, typically this message speeds things up and saves some work that would be otherwise wasted - but you still have to check later that your colleague did the task 44 right (otherwise his final "critical" result would be wrong and your new work on 45 would be wasted completely).
Back to blocks - first, the header is received - that's the message "block 645,434 was finished; start mining 645,435 (hash of 645,434 is F234EA23FF34)". Later, the full block 645,434 is received and it can be validated - i.e. it can be checked that everything in that block confirms to rules (transactions are not sending fake bitcoins, etc.) and that hash ("digest") of the block is really F234EA23FF34.
Note that hash (hash function) has a property that if any number in its source (any bit - i.e. any of the tiniest parts) is changed, the hash will be completely different. Source can be of arbitrary size, its hash is fixed size (and small). 
Gavin's change should make bigger blocks less problematic for miners. As of now, e.g. changing from 1MB to 16MB blocks will make it far worse for miners, because they will be waiting longer for new blocks which will make their orphaning changes bigger. With the headfirst change, the orphaning chances will not be rising (or only very little) when propagating larger blocks - as the header propagates always fast (small, fixed size) and they can start mining on next block just upon receiving it.

Queuing theory is nice, I had it as subject too. Discussing buildups of backlogs might be interesting, but "what if all people want to panic sell all their savings at once" is not. First: do not panicsell/panic buy, second: if you absolutely need the transaction to be confirmed, use fee that guarantees you it will be confirmed (yeah, the fee will be huge, but still a small fraction of your savings) ...and still be prepared for the fact that your exchange might be offline for hours/days in case of exceptionally high volume.

As I said, sometimes there is high traffic &amp; you would need to pay high fee if you want to send your bitcoins, sometimes there is low traffic so the fees are far smaller for the same priority.
If you have a lots of inputs it means that your transaction using those will be large (in bytes) and therefore it will require high fees to get confirmed - so it makes sense to wait for the moment when the network is not busy - so the fees required for confirmation will be as small as possible. This can be seen here:
...once you consolidate (join all your small inputs by sending those to your other address), you will have only one input in your next transaction - so your next transaction - that will probably happen when the network is quite busy - will require far lower fees compared to the situation when you would attempt to send all your bitcoins without consolidation.

Raced with my phone in hand above water to shore, dissassembled the phone, made it dry, then I had in in hot air in a car vent. But all the emotions turned me stupid: I switched it on too soon, it gave me the last words (like 10-20 seconds of normal operation) and then it died for good. At least it was before Bitcoin was born.

Because they have a cartel, they can buy anybody, they can destroy you in an instant. Also, regulation is probably too burdensome for small players. And - if you are the only one who is honest and who does the right thing, you can hardly beat all others (with their resources they can fight against you on many different fronts - including brainwashing of people). 


I don't think so. It might happen rarely, but state can do good things too (even if that was only fixing of its former wrongdoings). 
Also, smoking comes to mind. We just need a law to ban smoking in all restaurants (besides the ban of smoking in all public spaces), the free market is just not working here (or not fast enough) for some reason. I absolutely hate searching for that handful of restaurants where I'm not going to inhale the fumes &amp; get my rags stinky as shit for days ...when I know that 66+ % of people here hate smoking in restaurants too... I don't know what is the reason exactly - but sometimes the free market just doesn't not work (fast enough?) when clashing with the stupidity of humans.

You still don't understand. If BU hardforks with 90 % or whatever - that is not the attack. 
The attack is if (portion of) that hashrate tries to kill the original chain by dishonest things - like rewriting the original blockchain to do doublespends or like mining empty blocks or blocks with bogus transactions that block regular users (...of the original chain - chain that is not using the rules that caused the hardfork). ...in that case, users of that original chain have the right not be called absurd &amp; reckless by Erik if they want to continue using their old chain. Changing the POW would be the only way how to prevent the dishonest miners from attacking (as Todd &amp; Dash were pointing out).

New 0.14 Bitcoin Core (former: Bitcoin Qt) wallet should be synchronizing significantly faster than the previous versions (maybe even 4 times faster or something). 
So maybe it would be less work to wait for the synchronization &amp; then sending everything in one transaction to the other wallet. 
Otherwise, as you said, you would need to do 10 dumpprivkey maneuvers. And - after you import the key it is still very advisable to create new transaction in the other wallet - that is sending to its 'receiving address' (all receiving addresses are generated from the seed, OTOH none imported key+address are generated from seed).
With regards to sending - I recommend to watch [this]( a couple times for a few days to get feeling how much fee to pay (and when to send the transaction in the first place) so the fees are minimized. If you wait for few days, you can typically get it confirmed with fee under 0.60 uBTC/B (which is 60 sat/B which is 0.00060 BTC/KB).

If there is majority hashrate (from the point of view of original chain) controlled by unscrupulous greedy miners - that is pretty much fucking the (original) network completely - as the miners doing 51 % attack would be able to come back again many times - doing double spends, doing rewriting of arbitrarily long portions of the chain, preventing users from using the chain entirely if they want (so they can trigger panic after they short), etc. etc. 
You are naive if you think we can survive with original chain if there is bigger evil hashrate attacking repeatedly, many times as I said.

Blockchain space is limited. Currently, there can only be 1 MB of transactions in one block (i.e. every 9-10 minutes on average). Fees are the way to tell what transactions are important. The more people want to do the transaction - the more they pay in fees - the more chance they have to be in the next block.
Some time ago, the selection was different - coins that didn't move for long(er) had higher priority and also bigger BTC amounts had higher priority - but that system was (or is being) abandoned. Selection based on fees paid (per byte of transaction size) is probably more fair.

One side of conversation was what to do if BU hardforks with majority of hashpower - but then some of the miners come back attacking and otherwise-irreparably destroying our (the original Bitcoin) blockchain/network. Then, POW change may be warranted as last resort solution. Not probable, but it could be worth it to be prepared for such a dire chain of events.
Other side of conversation is theoretical ways how to change POW - so the ill effects of miner centralization (on of which might be that miners are not informed enough and prone to propaganda/harassing and succumbing to solutions that are inferior for Bitcoin in the long run) - so that these ill effects of miner centralization are mitigated to at least some extent. This is different from POW change forced by attack - so it can be for example phased in over longer periods of time (so miners don't lose their investments) - and/or also it could be just a partial change of POW - i.e. adding other half of POW - current miners will be able to mine, but other kind of mining power would be required to counter the problems with centralized pools (at least this is how I understood POWA).

You didn't say in your original post that you want to sell all bitcoins for dollars...
If you are sending many tiny inputs, the transaction is going to be big (measured in bytes) - so it will require large fee to get confirmed nowadays ...for most of the time. However, you can wait for some moments when the traffic in bitcoin network is low - then your large transaction will require far less fees (to have the same priority). You can either send to exchange (to turn bitcoins into dollars) or to your other address (your next transaction will have only one input - so it will be far smaller and require far less fees).

It is not dead. AFAIK, Shapeshift still uses 0-conf - and so are doing Bitpay, Coinbase &amp; others. While it might be relatively easy for skilled programmer to double spend, it is not so easy for normal users. Also, it might be relatively easy to craft a transaction that will never confirm - but it is significantly harder to create transaction that will never confirm *and* the receiver can't recognize this. You as receiver can check the transaction &amp; accept for 0-conf only transactions that seem really very close to the standard and/or in situations where doing so is relatively safe (e.g. you have seen the payer in person)...
It's not that black/white as RBF proponents want us to think. It is relatively easy for a (skilled hitman-)guy to kill by stabbing somebody in the back. Should all of us become terribly afraid that it will happen to us? Should we wear armor? Should we not go out? Should we all stab everybody we see in the back - so we draw attention to the fact that this can be done (that people wasn't designed to be immune to that)?! I don't think so. Don't panic. Think.

No. The inputs are the outputs of the previous incoming transactions. If you had 30 incoming transactions, you will have (at least) 30 inputs in the new transaction that attempts to send all the bitcoins from that address elsewhere.
Look e.g. here:
...that transaction uses two inputs from the same address. 
Addresses are not like bank accounts where the newly incoming is seamlessly added. 
Addresses are like cabinets where you have incoming bitcoins recorded on papers - every new incoming transaction is written on new separate card. Total amount held is not tracked - what is recorded is what "chunks" of bitcoins came in what transactions you can go back in time (back in blockchain) and find out where exactly all those are coming from.
To see how much bitcoins your address "holds", you need to go through the whole blockchain &amp; you need to subtract sent amounts from received amounts (identify what chunks came in but were never sent out).
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:00:46
There is hysteria and false sense of urgency purposefully fueled/engineered by the other side. They say that blocksize limit is severely limiting the amount of new users who are joining - which is not true. There will not be 10 times more users in half a year if we make the blocksize limit 10 times bigger.
Making the blocksize limit bigger is dangerous (I would say: very dangerous), because it requires hardfork - which in current circumstances is not something we should want as the likely split will put additional burden on users, services and the whole ecosystem (and potential new users too). Next, it would be just kicking the can down the road - magnifying the problem (loss of decentralization, burdening full nodes) and avoiding real solutions.
What we need now is test the system as it is - see how the fee based selection of transaction works. (I suppose there are still a lot of inefficiencies mainly in the way how bigger 3rd parties like exchanges work - e.g. they do unnecessary sweeping transactions.) Also, we need to optimize - there is quadratic sighash problem, malleability and UTXO growth problem - all which [segwit is solving]( These are needed first before we allow bigger transaction throughput. 
Segwit is a scaling solution also because it enables/improves further optimizations and enhancements leading to bigger transaction throughput (LN, Schnorr, ...) or to more "able" transactions - i.e. transactions that do more complex things without increasing the need for space in blockchain (MAST, new scripts...).
BU is just inferior copy (of older version of) the bitcoin (core) client. They are not thinking about the bigger picture, they just try to grab the power (some of them) or just wreak the havoc. Their conspiracy theories ("Blockstream is controlling Bitcoin totally and is there to destroy Bitcoin.") are laughable and their hysteria inducing lies (also about censorship here) are insincere attempts to grab the power and/or harm Bitcoin (you wouldn't believe how many altcoin pumpers were there in the other sub - all bashing Bitcoin as much as they could during the bear market of the last 3 years). Fuck those immoral people. (But we new it will not be easy as Bitcoin is too important and challenges too many too powerful people.)
Yeah, there are also reasonable and sincere people in the other camp (like Gavin hopefully and some other old timers), but overall it's disgusting what those people do as a group. They had full mouths of censorship here - but if you go to them &amp; state basic facts they downvote you immediately to oblivion (soon forcing you to wait 10 minutes before any reply ...and you sometimes want to reply when you see outrageous lies or personal attacks) - while claiming their place is the only one that has free speech and no censorship. Bullshit. I hate them and I hate Ver - that slimy piece of political shit. Whatever, Bitcoin needs to be able to survive everything. Maybe we should let them fork &amp; let them decimate the ecosystem with their incompetence and no technical and other foresight. The core, the real bitcoin will be surviving and coming back now and every time in the future.

What I would like to see would be **"create market buy order with any fiat that comes in"** option (or maybe if message to payee contains "INSTANT_BUY"?). I.e. all EUR/$/whatever when received by the exchange would be immediately turned into bitcoins. And one more option **"withdraw bitcoin automatically when account has more than X bitcoins"**. 
This combo would allow me to just establish a standing order (recurrent bank wire transfer) in my bank - and the I would be just watching my bitcoin wallet. ...saving me all the hassle with logging to bank account, sending fiat in single payments, logging to exchange account, creating orders, withdrawing bitcoins, confirming withdrawals in emails and waiting for confirmations...

Yes, that is possible. Save unconfirmed transaction to file on "C" device &amp; then clone that file on "O" device by any means (manual rewrite of hex file, QR scan, copy through USB flashdisk).


Offline Electrum wallet can't possibly know about all your bitcoins - as it has no access to the latest state of blockchain. So it needs the seedless (watchonly) version of itself (that has information about the latest transfers) to create the transaction - i.e. to say which outputs of previous transactions (incoming to your addresses) have to be taken as inputs in your new transaction).

You mean 'bitcoin addresses' (pubkey is something slightly different). 
Yes, every address has its corresponding private key (from which it was generated and which you use to control bitcoins that are sent to that address). Usually, you don't need to care about this - as your wallet is managing all those private keys for you. Quite often this is done in very convenient way - all private keys in the wallet are generated from one seed (which is large number encoded as 12 or 14 or 16 ... words ).

I guess the second transaction (the one with the higher fee) will be confirmed in a day or two. You are sending to your other wallet so there is not a problem if it takes long or if it gets dropped altogether, right.

21 000 000 total is rather arbitrary - important things are that total is a limited number and that the amount of bitcoins currently in existence is not rising too fast (we have [15 300 000]( already, the monetary inflation will be under 5 % this year and will decrease all the way to 0 in the future, see [here]( and [here]( - note the drop will be in middle of 2016, not at the end as the chart indicates)


Satoshi had a problem with his/her/their new currency: how to distribute bitcoins to people? Rewarding miners who make new block solved this in an elegant fashion - you distribute bitcoins &amp; moreover - you distribute bitcoins to people who support the network operation.

This depends on what chain your Electrum server will be using. But - when you send the transaction on chain that you (or your Electrum server) are using, somebody can take the transaction and "replay" it on the other chain - so, you run into the danger when you are paying someone that you will in fact send coins on both chains...
The way how to split the coins is like you say - have wallet 1 that uses blockchain 1 and have wallet 2 that uses blockchain 2 and then send coins in blockchain 1 to different address than coins in blockchain 2 (which can still not be trivial as somebody can be replaying your "1" transaction in blockchain "2" - even though they will not be able to profit from it in any way - as we assume you are done this splitting by sending from your addresses to other addresses that you control).
So, it's best to let the exchange do the split for you - you send coins to them (it's irrelevant if on "1" or "2"), they replay the transaction also on the other chain - so, their address will now have both your "1" and "2" coins, then they split the coins for themselves (in the way I described above), but that is not your problem anymore. Because after you send them X of pre-fork coins they credit you X "1"-coins and X "2"-coins (you will have two different accounts with balance because those will be two different coins)... Then you will be able to sell either of these and/or withdraw them to your address. 


Yes, but you can just wait - and see how it plays out. (If you keep the coins and do no transactions with them, the "split on exchange" should be available even in distant future - providing both of those chains live.)


Any exchange that will be listing both after-fork coins should be able to split the coins for you - it would be better to have this confirmed by other users though. For example, after ETH hardforked to ETH and the original ETH was rebranded to ETC, Kraken exchange was splitting the coins for users. You sent there pre-fork ETH &amp; they credited you that amount in both ETH and ETC.

You say "you have the same amount / purchasing power, therefore nobody stole anything from you". I wanted to show with the analogy that even though your amount is the same or slowly rising, still somebody can be stealing a lot from you.

You would need the same blockchain you have in Bitcoin and more - you would need some kind of authority/institution that would be trying to keep the real world aligned with the blockchain - somehow enforcing the rights of individuals to own&amp;control what they should own according to blockchain. 
Proof of work is required because there is no central authority in Bitcoin. No central element that says what happened exactly, what is the true. It must somehow emerge. The problem is the following: You can send one transaction (sending your bitcoins to B) to one part of the network and you can send other version of that transaction (but sending the same bitcoins to C) to the other part of the network. And then, somehow, all nodes in the network have to agree finally, whether you sent your bitcoins to B or to C. This is done/solved by mining - every miner tries to "write the next page in the ledger book" - to select one option from the two and create the new truth. Finding the block is very very very computationally expensive, but - interestingly - it is cheap enough to verify that given block is correct (that it complies to all rules) and that it required that large amount of computing to find. This allows the block ("the new page in the ledger book") spread around the world. Everybody in the bitcoin network then agrees that what is in the block indeed happened (i.e. e.g. that you sent your bitcoins to C and not to B)...

There is something called mempool - there are say 10,000 unconfirmed transactions (received from other nodes) that want to be confimed (put into new block).
Miner is free to pick any of those or none of them. 
The size of unconfirmed transactions can be bigger than the maximal size of the new block.
When miners know that there is new block, but they had not the chance to validate that block fully, they start mining the new block empty (i.e. without any transactions in it). ...This is because before full examination of the received block, they do not know what transactions are there -&gt; so they don't know what transactions they should filter out of their mempool so they prevent the forbidden situation from occurring when the same transaction is in two different blocks in the blockchain.

First rule of Bitcoin: Do not give control over your bitcoins to 3rd parties.

Current miners are centralized which is not ideal. It would be possible to extend the POW (proof of work) function that Bitcoin full nodes require to see to allow the new block as valid. This without doing hardfork - i.e. without the danger of splitting the network. The new extended POW would somehow change how the miner operations would look like - maybe more decentralized than now (if part of the POW would require GPUs instead of ASICs).
This would probably require many hours to explain to 5 year old... :/

In case of HF: do nothing. Either one of the chain dies quickly or - after some time - the exchanges will make it convenient for you to sell/buy both. 
^((This was the case with ETH forking to ETH/ETC - after some time the exchanges were able to conveniently split your pre-fork ETH into ETH + ETC without any of your additional actions. But it took some time - e.g. Coinbase was refusing to accept ETC first &amp; they were effectively stealing (or letting their other users steal)^) ^(value of it from users.)^)

Either the transaction was dropped (this happens when the fee is not enough so it can't get confirmation - but normally this should take 72 hours) or it was not broadcasted at all (some internal problem of localbitcoins?)...
I would recommend to withdraw first to local Electrum wallet. And then send from Electrum to that pharmacy (better using "replaceable" ^((in Electrum settings &amp; then send dialog)^) so you can bump fee if needed). And - ideally - to do both these transfers when the network is least busy. For that watch this:
multiple times a day for a few days to get the feeling about the fee dynamics. For example - just now it's the right moment to do transactions - even transaction with fee as low as  0.00030 BTC/KB has good chance to be confirmed at the moment. As you can see here:
where you have things averaged over longer periods, 0.00030 KB/B is really small, as the general recommended fee is now 0.00220 KB/B.
Ninja edit: you already need 0.00140 KB/B to manage to be in next block (see the last column on right side - only 1 MB of transactions can get into the next block). Also there is variance - sometimes 3 blocks come in 5 or even 3 minutes, sometimes 1 block takes 30-90 minutes...

This is questionable - after some transition period I would be expecting the security to be reestablished with new mining algo. Bitcoin has the most experienced dev team and the largest network effect. 
E.g. 50+% people in western world know what Bitcoin is or at least they heard the name; compare to that, all alts together would be under 1 %... ...the same also for businesses - with the exception of exchanges of course - nearly all businesses work with Bitcoin and no other crypto. 
If you are a crypto enthusiast who is positive about cryptos in general, you can easily overlook this ("yeah, whatever, we jump to other coin") - but for people who are just learning their first steps in Bitcoin there is a world of difference (nearly everything - nearly all the information they are getting is about Bitcoin - all wikis, videos, news, etc. - is about Bitcoin, all knowledge they accumulated from friends etc. is about Bitcoin, and so on).

The winning side takes all bitcoins that were bet by the losing side (sans small fee for the server). So, if you bet 1.0 BTC or 10 BTC or 100 BTC and you are the only one on the winning side, you take all the bitcoins from the losing side (be it 0.1 or 0.002 or whatever) - the amount you bet is irrelevant if you are the only one winning. 
If there are more winners, they split the pot proportionally to their bets - e.g. if you bet 1.0 BTC and I bet 1.0 BTC and we are the only two at the winning side, each of us takes 50 % of the bitcoins that there are on the losing side. 
The winning ratio that is listed there depends also on the size of your bet. If there is not much in the bank &amp; you bet a lot you will move it from something that seemed favorable originally to something that is not appealing at all (e.g. you can move it from 6.253:1.120 to something like e.g. 1.3:3.3 if you put a lot on the first option). So, you should not bet more than you see there in the bank.

Looks like devs of Core deliberately use "consensus" in new meaning in order to confuse people. See "Not To Be Confused With" (!) [here]( 
Consensus among nodes is essential for the function of Bitcoin network. The "(social) consensus" among (Core) developers - what they mean by it anyway? - is something completely different. It's probably not essential at all. Heck, on the contrary, maybe it would be beneficial to have many competing dev teams/implementations/roadmaps - so people, the community, can choose what they want to support &amp; use.


If this is the case, then the current (Core) Bitcoin is 100% centralized in the hands of one person - Wladimir.


That was like: "You can't use brakes in car - because then you can't keep it moving! Purpose of car is to be moving. So, the entire point of brakes is moot.".
There are various degrees - whole spectrum - between decentralized and centralized. You can increase the block limit to 1.05 MB - this will scale it up (a bit) without making it (significantly more) centralized.

Horizontal bars (consisting of bars of various color indicating age of transactions) show you how much transactions are waiting - every horizontal bar is showing different fee bracket. You want to wait e.g. till the bar for "&lt; 0.00040 BTC/KB" disappears entirely (and everything above it is clear) - and then you have chance that your 0.4uBTC/B transaction will be confirmed (as there will be no transactions with fees higher than that waiting - or at least not that many of these)...
The above will happen most likely when mempool size shrinks (which means: miners are confirming more transactions than the users are creating at the moment) - you can see it by disappearance of horizontal bars there, but also in the chart at bottom - ideal for you would be mempool size under 15MB or even 10MB...
Also, the rightmost column of numbers is interesting. "Size Count" - this shows you how much transactions (in B, i.e. bytes) are waiting in and above the current fee bracket. Go from the top &amp; search for the last row that has the size under 1 MB - all these rows (from top to that row that is near 1 MB) will be confirmed in the next block (hopefully - if the block is full). If there are like 20MB above your fee bracket it is quite hopeless (it would need 3+ hours to get confirmed *if* no other transactions are added by users - but as new transactions are always made, those 3+ hours would mean forever - i.e. more than 72 hours which means drop i.e. not getting confirmed - ...unless we just entered the period of less traffic).
So, watch that several times a day for a few days and you will get the feeling how small fee will have a chance to be in block &amp; you will be able to identify the periods of low trafic when your input consolidation will be cheapest for you.

Attack would be if they try to prevent the original chain (chain they hardforked from) from functioning normally. (I.e. if portion of that hashrate goes back to the original chain for a while to do nasty things.)

You can try  to buy bitcoins in person in your local area.
There are [B-ATMs]( - up to 5 - 15 % in fees, but it's quite convenient to get small amounts (&amp; experience).
There is a lot of [exchanges]( - Bitstamp, Kraken, BTC-e, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Gemini are among the best, but others should also work well (just don't keep there too much money - send there, convert to BTC &amp; withdraw immediately to wallet that only you control) - just try to find exchange to which you can send money from your country using bank wire (i.e. normal sending from bank account). All the largest exchanges (with exception of BTC-e) will force you to register with your state ID, utility bills and whatnot. 
My advice is always to get small amount ASAP - get your feet wet, learn how it works, try everything. Then, when more comfortable, start buying using [cost averaging]( strategy.

If 95 % hashrate goes to BU ^((I don't believe it can - but for the sake of the argument)^) - then only 5.3 % of those BU miners will be able to do 51 % attack on the original chain. Under these conditions, BU would be valuable, old chain&amp;coin not that much. I can't see how 51 % of miners are working against their own economic interest - i.e. I fail to see how SHA256 mining HW becomes worthless in this scenario (as mining BU would be profitable and not that much different from the current situation with regards to miner revenue).

Yes. Total supply. But the "supply" - i.e. BTC available on markets - is constant (or rising at the same pace as demand) ...that's why we have constant price now ($400+-100). 
In other words - every 10 minutes, those new 25 BTCs are bought and sent out of the market. If this wasn't the case, number of BTCs in *asks* would be rising all the time. 
Or let me try like this: there is 1 million apples on Earth, but in your town market, only 1000 apples are brought every day by sellers and all (all for simplicity) those are bought at the end of the day by buyers ...at the price of $1/apple. Now imagine what happens when there are for some reason only 500 apples on the market in the morning - price will go up, because sellers will see that the demand is the same but the current supply (on the market) is lower - so, people will be willing to pay more. Price will go to e.g. $1.5/apple (or $3/apple). The question is what will do the "holders" of the remaining apples which were not on market, yet - will there be more "supply" apples on the market the next day because the price is now $1.5? I.e. will the price go down again or not?
If nearly all people are like me (not buying unless below $100, not selling unless above $3000) - small changes in supply or demand can lead to dramatic price movements.


Supply (on markets) might be very slightly lower (and even this is questionable as QE money are retained in banks probably). 
I said that new BTCs are just small part of the whole exchange volume - i.e. new BTCs are the smaller part of (available) supply.

Creating a huge buy wall near market price might in fact be the opposite than what it seems at first sight.
0. you create huge buy wall near market price;
1. some people who wanted to sell wouldn't do it (now) - as they expect the price to rise;
2. some people who had buy orders below price of your wall will cancel their orders and just buy (pushing the price a bit up and simultaneously making the orderbook a bit thinner on the buy side near market price) - as they would think it impossible for such a huge wall to be eaten any time soon;
3. optionally: when price is rising, move your wall up;
4. when you feel you can reverse the price movement from up to down - i.e. if you see that there are more and more sell orders and less and less people buying at market price - and - when you have enough bitcoins in reserve, you go to next step:
5. cancel your wall (cancel your huge buy order) &amp; sell a lot of bitcoins at market fast - this might make price go down because there are a lot of people who want to sell (see 2. and 5. above) and there are not much people who want to buy (see 3. above);
6. if you indeed managed to push the price down, you can re-buy at lower price making profit;
TL;DR: using huge buy wall you can trick people into thinking there is big demand - people cancel buy orders &amp; buy directly while people who wanted to sell directly will wait; then you can cancel your wall and start selling bitcoins you had in reserve ...with a chance to move the price down &amp; make profit

Guessing 24 word seed is impossible. 
Seed encodes master private key from which a sequence of private keys P1, P2, P3, P4, ... is generated. Your wallet generates P1 &amp; it's corresponding BTC address A1 and looks into blockchain (from the first block up to now) for all transactions involving A1 - it subtracts outputs from inputs &amp; receives the balance "in"/"of" A1. Then it tries P2 and it's address A2, etc. 
Then there is some constant defined in the wallet that allows to stop the above process - this constant says how much addresses without any inputs to try before stopping. So e.g. the constant can be 5 - so if the wallet finds a sequence of addresses A20, A21, A22, A23, A24 where none of these has inputs (and therefore balance) recorded in the blockchain, it makes the guess that A19 was the last address that you used &amp; stops searching past A24 (P24).

@_date: 2017-03-20 18:05:39
No. Markets are very unpredictable - not only because large players want to do what the others do not expect to get profit but also because there are many factors that are influencing the price. 
Effects of the last halving might not still be here in full force; price is influenced by the number of new users (depends on media coverage - sometimes even supposedly bad things lead to considerable publicity - like e.g. busting of Silk road) and the number of people who already have accounts on exchanges; price somehow depends on the sentiment - trends continue for some time (see the 2014-2015 bear trend and 2016-2017 bull trend) and emotions (occasional buy/sell panics); etc.

Yes, however, by this relatively large bet you change the ratio considerably - which makes it much more interesting for other people to bet against you. If they do that, your potential win goes up. 
E.g. if Bulls have 66 % chance to win and Nets have 33 % chance to win, it is likely that equilibrium will be reached when 2 times more is bet on Bulls than Nets, leading to ratio 1.5:3 ... if you think about 3 repetitions of this game with the same odds, you, if you bet all the time on Bulls - you then win two times (66 %) and lose 1 time - so you pocket 1.5+1.5+0 which is 3 (i.e. 1 per each game on average)... ...the same for the other side - person choosing Nets all the time has 33 % chance to win 3 - 0+0+3 (i.e. 1 per each game on average) - so that's the equilibrium. 
Now, let's say that the bank is 3 BTC bet on Bulls and 1.5 BTC on Nets to have it simple - so the winning ration is 1.5:3. If you come now &amp; bet 15.5 BTC on Bulls - if I'm counting right, you will change the winning ratio to 1.08:13.33 ...this will encourage many people to bet on Nets - as they will see that they have 33 % chance (let's suppose they know the odds either by gut feeling or by looking at ratios on regular betting sites) to win more than 10 times their bet. ...so, there will be probably another approx 7 BTC added on Nets side - that will again reestablish the equilibrium (coming from the expectancy of 66 % vs 33 % chances - i.e. there will be 18.5 bet on Bulls and 9.25 on Nets) ...so again, the ration will be 1.5:3 and you will have good chance to win back what you are betting :) ...i.e. to have 66 % chance to win 1.5 times what you bet. 
However if there is not enough time (or if you - with your bet - make people think that the odds are not 66 % : 33 % but more like 90 % : 10 % or something) you will be losing - as you will be betting 15.5 BTC on the side that has 66 % chance of winning and there will be not enough on the Nets side to recoup your loses (as you have 33 % chance to lose your big bet). So - as you say - it is bad to bet a lot when there is not much in the bank (as there will be not much for you to win and your chance to lose will be making it unprofitable for you).
OTOH - the winning strategy is to bet where the ratio is higher than the chance to lose. I.e. in our example with 33 % chance of Nets winning, if you see the ratio there to be 1.2:5.5 ...you know you should bet on Nets, because you will get back (66%\*0+33%\*5.5) on average which is more than 1 (i.e. you profit). However as we said above, you must not bet too much - otherwise you will drive the ratio back to 1.5:3 or even worse to like 2:2 which would mean you are losing (33%\*2 which is less than 1).
Of course we don't know that the chance is 66 % vs 33 % (even though the ratios on regular betting servers can give us some idea) - and also we are influenced by the people who bet after us (if too much of them bet on the same side as we did it has the same effect as if we bet too much ourselves - the fraction we get when we win times the chance of win will be on average less than what we will be losing when our side loses - i.e. loss in total for us).

If miners are evil, countermeasures must be taken. Caution: evil doesn't mean that they start mining hardforked chain. Evil means: they try to kill a chain (be it the chain they hardforked from or whatever) or that they try prevent users from using the original client (which is using the original chain) or if they steal by rewriting the chain &amp; making doublespends.

Prior usages are irrelevant. In Bitcoin world, "consensus" is a technical term with regard to Bitcoin nodes &amp; people should avoid confusion by not using it in other meanings.
The same thing is "bit" in computer world. Bit was a word long before computers, but now, in the world of computers, "bit" has [exact technical meaning]( &amp; people should not be using it in other meanings (like Bitcoin bits, *sigh*).
Computer was also used before computers. Now, computer is a machine, not a person anymore. 
Again, in Bitcoin world, "consensus" is a technical term. It denotes something in the working of Bitcoin nodes that is necessary for Bitcoin network to function. Core developers want to hijack this sense of necessity; by using that word, they want to implicitly make us think that their governing practices are absolutely necessary &amp; the only way forward.

Miners are just saying "we want bigger blocks - we want people to transact onchain" (so we make more money), they are not saying "we will fork to BU (that is pathetically developed/maintained &amp; pushed by non-technical people - populists, politics)...


I don't know. Maybe it will maybe not. If it will, it will be back where it was in one or two months. I'll not be trying to sell and rebuy lower even in the event of fork. Maybe new users will pour in with new publicity, maybe the effects of the last halving will kick in and maybe the current drama scared all weak hands off already...


Because we believe in Bitcoin. Because we don't need to get more bitcoins that we have - above all we don't want to lose BTC we already have. I was speculating once, sold 8 BTC and few hours later I re-bought: 5 BTC. That was terrible. Far worse that missing the sell opportunity above $1100 in Dec 2014.


The more sure you are that something will happen in the market, the lower chance of it happening - at least quite often. I'm not going to risk my existing BTC for potential profit. Look at what happened when Silk Road was busted - a lot of people sold &amp; lost many bitcoins (as the price did the opposite what people were expecting - it was going up fast).

Yeah, being able to choose what to run (and even to spin off or hard fork)  is crucial liberty. 


I think the sense of urgency is false to some extent - it was purposefully induced by hysterical speeches &amp; lies. What is more important than immediate allowing bigger blocks is what [segwit]( is doing beside that -  fixing quadratic sighas problem, incentivizing less resource hungry behaviors (UTXO growth) and enabling further optimizations. 


This seems to be cardinal problem in BU - it could allow big miner(s) to push everyone else out of the game. I heard there are also other obvious problems - like if miners select what is the max block size they accept, even small fraction of hashrate can induce chain splits. 


Core is forcing nobody to do anything. Everybody is free to choose what client to run. They just present available options. If segwit doesn't activate - so be it. Maybe some softfork/hardfork doing same things will get bigger support in the future. One of the top priorities of Core is also to keep things backward compatible - so people can run old clients.

Electrum just tries to make you use fresh address for every transaction - but all the addresses (you have in the wallet since you generated it) work too. 
Hit 'CTRL+A' and then expand 'Used' - you will see all the addresses you used in this wallet there. If any of those receives bitcoins again, you will see them normally in your balance &amp; you will be able to send normally.

How do you know that the latest ASIC designs aren't made by AI(s)? How do you know that miner operations aren't controlled by AI(s) already? 
I firmly believe that the time is near when AIs will match and outmatch any human skills - including management of large scale operations, development of HW &amp; SW, research, mimicking human actions, etc. (And it is not a bad thing.) 
With regards to mining algorithm itself - there were some attempts to have some useful byproducts from it (like primes in primecoin) - but the more it is random (i.e. the more useless otherwise) - the better it is for security. This is because mining is if fact not "solving mathematical" puzzles - it's really lottery. One of the miners wins - random one. The chance is bigger if more computing power was invested but that's the only way how to increase the chance. It's essentially the same as throwing a dice &amp; waiting for thousand ones in a row. Whoever has this luck can say what the next page in the ledger book will be. It's really random, there is no shortcut to "solving" the next block - nothing that can be exploited by an individual to get control of the whole network.

The seed (re-)creates in your Trezor infinitely many private keys and (therefore) BTC addresses for you.

One of greatest benefits coming from Bitcoin is that many people will realize how fucked up our current system is.


This doesn't mean that it won't improve the situation somewhat...Richest guys in BTC were probably not the guys from those 1 %, they can have interesting worldviews/attitudes &amp; can even work against that 1 % (What will Satoshi do next?..). 
 
Also, Bitcoin gives some better chance to the billions of poor/oppressed people (attention trolls: I do not mean the poorest here that can't save anything) - as BTC can't be so easily stolen by banks/govs (if secured properly - which gets easier everyday) as fiat or other possessions.

Because centralized miners could have too much power over the network for example. In their shortsighted move they would hardfork because of greed or because they would smell more power. However if the hardfork happens and centralized miners have too much power it can lead quickly to a catastrophe - e.g. authorities in China could confiscate miner warehouses &amp; attack the network with 80+% of hashrate forever.
Decentralization is vital Bitcoin principle. If it is significantly endangered in the hard-forked part of the network, majority of users will not follow &amp; they will keep using their old Bitcoin (Bitcoin client). Then, businesses will not follow also - as they would be able to see the dangerous fragility of hard-forked solution and also that they will loss their reputation among the majority of users.

Yes, you will have the same amount on both first and second chain. Yes.


On the second chain (that forked from the original chain).


It will be fine for you. You will have "the same" coins on both chains. However, before you attempt to use any of those it would be wise to "split" those coins - i.e. ensure that the transfer done on the first chain can't be done ("replayed") on the second chain - this is done by sending coins on the first chain to some address and by sending the "same" coins on the second chain to different address. This is done most easily by sending coins (on either chain) to exchange, they will replay it on the other chain - receiving coins on both chains like that &amp; then they credit you coins on 2 different accounts - 1 account for the first chain and 1 account for the second chain.

This only happens when you are creating new wallet. It shows you the seed (this is a big number encoded as 12 words from which all your addresses and their corresponding private keys can be re-generated at any point in the future) and then it asks for it in the next step to ensure you really wrote it down as it was asking you to do (because the seed is so important for restoring of your wallet if the wallet file gets deleted from your disk).

If you want it fast, you have to pay appropriate fee. You can try to use RBF in your next transactions if you care about confirmation speed. You can enable it by checking 'replaceable' in Electrum. RBF (replace by fee) allows you to replace your old transaction that has low confirmation chance with new transaction with higher fee easily.

I was digging my money back from Intersango &amp; Bitcoin-24 for months. Just by accident I missed the ongoing Gox party. Your post sounded like "send your BTCs to exchange now" - or else it will be worthless. I don't like that style/message.
If you (or anybody else) are prone to panic: 
1. consolidate your outputs now (the less and the bigger inputs the higher chance your transaction goes through)
2. when you panic, use large fee ($10 USD) so your transaction is guaranteed to confirm (it is 99.9999 % sure that there will not be 200000 transactions that day with higher fee)
3. do not panic - if panic selling starts, exchanges will be very laggy or offline - so its better for health to avoid that completely 
4. do not take advice from people on the Internet, e.g.: "The risk to you of leaving them on exchange might be much less than the risk of keeping them in a Bitcoin wallet." - might allow or amplify your panic behavior (panicsell/panicbuy); either sell now or put it somewhere where you can't easily access it

@_date: 2017-03-15 21:10:36
Pretty much every normal use of Bitcoin (buying on regular exchanges, buying things with bitcoin, etc.) can be traced. You have plausible deniability - it would be almost impossible to prove that the next address where bitcoins went is yours (unless they have your whole wallet) or that you control those bitcoins (you might have been but it's always possible that you lose control because you lose seed/keys due to negligence/theft). 
Aside from this, they can quite easily track the transfers of bitcoins that are related to you (and yours with some high probability) - when you buy at exchange you give there your IDs, when you withdraw it it is highly likely it's your address. When you buy something somewhere they may log your IP (and even have your real name) - from that they can go back through the chain of transactions and flag many of the addresses as highly likely yours. Also, there are patterns - change is quite recognizable from the amount that is really transferred to someone else; when bitcoins from multiple address join in one transaction it is likely that they are from the same wallet; or even only if there are more distinct transactions, but made in the same day (and with inputs that are coming from one input somewhere in the past); if you use light wallet - the server can log your IP; etc...
If you want real anonymity you would need to do every single step very carefully - really thinking always what is leaking about you. ...and it's probably overkill for normal (or even a bit shady) usage...

Whats next? how do i realistically cash USD out, how long will it take? what are the chances that that mafia boss is informed of their gold movement via some tracking software? How do i launder the gold in the 100% full/foolproof way that i am confident to cash out via any gold exchange straight to my bank account? whats the most economic way to do it?

Besides distribution of coins, mining is the way how we all can agree which transaction happened. Miners create the blockchain - the ledger with transactions made of consecutive blocks. We all use the same copy, we all can see, that the transactions/blocks in it are kosher (they follow our rules) and that somebody spend immense amount of computing power while making it (so we can be reasonably sure that there is no other (longer) blockchain - i.e. we can be sure that the transfers of bitcoins happened as we see and not in some other way).

Watch this for some time:
...there are windows when the network is not busy that much &amp; when even 0.2uBTC/B (20sat/B or 0.00020 BTC/KB) transactions get confirmed - so try to wait for that &amp; create your transaction with fee barely enough to get confirmed at that time. If it fails to confirm it gets dropped (in 72 hours) and you will be free to retry. 
Your goal is to consolidate your inputs first by the above process. When you manage that, you will be able to use your bitcoins as you see fit - you will have one input (consolidated from your many inputs you have now) so your next transaction after consolidation will be relatively small (190 - 260 B) so you will be able to afford higher relative fees (e.g. 1.0uBTC/B) to get at least medium priority.

Not the whole thing (if you mean whole balance), but one input (which is output of previous "incoming" transaction) or a combination of more inputs if one input was not enough. See also here: 
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:50:51


There is nothing like that in Bitcoin. Once the transaction is in blockchain it is confirmed (it "happened", the transfer is done). Only requirements for getting into blockchain are these: 
* enough fee
* confirms to rules (well formed, sends bitcoins that can be sent, receiving address has correct format, ...)
* is propagated through network (so miners can see it)
...the process of getting into blockchain is completely independent of the receiving side.

Buy some every month...
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:44:10


All the time (especially when you are depressed from the declining price) ...but **slowly**!
Study the price here:
and here:
 (switch to '1w' &amp; zoom out).
It's always different, you can't even remotely guess how high the peak will reach - but observe the general behavior. There are days and weeks where more than 30 % of value was lost. There were years of bear markets when the price was going down and down and down. There were manias when price went up 10 fold in just few weeks. Think how you would feel when the price drops to 50 %, think what you would do if you see the price tripled in two weeks... Make a plan, stick to it. (It's nearly impossible, but well...) Because it really goes against the nature - it's best to buy when your emotions scream at you: SELL, it's best to sell when you are in moon euphoria... That's why people buy high and sell low.
I say: every month, buy (two/three/five) hundred dollar worth. (&amp; HODL! :D)
Good luck.


It's always like this: it goes up unbelievably right till you can't stand it anymore &amp; you buy in. Then it immediately goes down violently. :) Many people will confirm this here. ;)
Edit: As I said - do [DCA]( You average out the price oscillations, your profit will be a little less if the price goes up in general, but it's really better for the emotions... Far less stressful. ;)

Your link is (to) address, not (to) single transaction.  It's confusing how much inputs are there in the last transaction there:
and also the outputs 64 BTC and 0.01000005 BTC are unlikely to be yours (or did you send 0.01000005 BTC to the pharmacy?) ...so I suppose these are internal transactions of localbitcoins...
Link to transaction in online explorer is enough proof: 
* providing it's the correct transaction - i.e. it's your BTC and it's being sent to address that your receiver instructed you to use, and
* transaction is confirmed (1 or 3 confirmations are required usually), and
* the same transaction like that is also in other online blockchain explorer (one of the explorers might be showing inaccurate data - if you try 2 or more and see the same info it is very likely correct).

If the transaction wasn't confirmed (you can/should check in (multiple) online blockchain explorers) you still have your coins (in the original address you were attempting to send "from").
First try to rescan blockchain in multibit - the chance is that the transaction will disappear from your wallet (as it is highly likely it was dropped by network already) - then you would be able to send the transaction again with appropriate fee. 
Also, if it works, you can send the rest of your bitcoins to your wallet elsewhere if you want to (less work and probably more secure than manually getting &amp; using private keys)...

there are people who panic and go with the mob / short term trend
there are people who finally make their first buy when the price goes up for some time
there is media coverage during upswings that makes more people research &amp; buy
all in all - it's supply versus demand... there are only 15M BTCs!

It's '1.'. You will have 10 coins on one chain and 10 coins on the other chain. Your wallet will surely be showing only 10 coins because it will be only using one of the chains, but you would be able to install alternative wallet that will be watching the other chain where you will see the other 10 coins. However - easiest way is this: first, do nothing, then, when exchanges implement automatic splitting, then you will just send your coins using your wallet to the exchange, they will replay the transaction on the other chain and they will credit you 10 BTC and 10 BTU to your separate BTC and BTU accounts.

You have seedless version of the wallet - this doesn't contain the private keys and can be online without any risk. In it, you create the transaction, then you transfer it via USB flashdisk to your cold wallet (where you have the private keys), you sign the transaction there. Then the signed transaction can be broadcasted probably in more different ways - simplest is to bring it back to your online seedless wallet &amp; use broadcast button there after you loaded the transaction from the file from the USB flashdisk.

Miners - because of their large investments - have big incentive to keep the system running as smooth as possible. Also, developers keep miners in check (change to hash function would ruin their operations).
Large banks rule because they can keep abusing the regulations (if you have money printing machines - why wouldn't you buy politicians and write your laws?) and extinguishing alternatives. Bitcoin itself can't be regulated like fiat fin. systems. With Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies, people always have and will have alternatives - which makes the whole system more resilient and less prone to cartelization/monopolization/capture.

Weird. You must have a way how to send bitcoins to the ATM. I would try this:
* find instructions for this particular type of ATM - isn't there other way how you should send bitcoins? (There were some types of B-ATMs that worked like this: you sent bitcoins to the QR code you got on the website of the operator; you received redeem code from the website; you redeemed fiat at B-ATM.)
* go back to that B-ATM &amp; try to click on everything again - maybe your registration wasn't complete yet or you were perhaps stuck in some submenu;
* contact the operator for instructions.
I was buying bitcoins once, I put fiat in &amp; BATM went back to the main screen &amp; nothing happened. :D I asked the bartender there... "Yeah, just click 'Buy' again, it will give you bitcoins...". I did that &amp; really received my bitcoins, lol.

It's not that much about the "new" supply - it's about the supply (how much people want to sell right now) versus the demand (how much other people want to buy at current price.

It is also easy to use it for cold storage - you just need to generate your new Electrum wallet on computer that will not touch the internet again (you send from your cold wallet by transferring transaction to your offline computer via USB flashdisk) or from TAILS CD with disconnected internet...

I am not sure - see this:
"a single private key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats (compressed and uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the private key is identical for both bitcoin addresses. (...) *[Export both ways in different format.]* This allows the importing wallet to distinguish between private keys originating from older or newer wallets and search the blockchain for transactions with bitcoin addresses corresponding to the uncompressed, or the compressed, public keys, respectively.

You have the private key written there on your paper wallet also in the form of long (hexadecimal) number, you can use that - Mycelium should let you import it (but maybe you need to copy it to clipboard first), see: 


webwallet usage is discouraged - you don't control the private keys, you do not own the Bitcoins (all you have s IOUs); also BCI has a bit of bad reputation here - they were not fixing their bugs &amp; I also personally hate them because they are hijacking a common Bitcoin term "blockchain" in order to make (new) people believe that they are something more than they are (they are just a 3rd party, a company like hundreds of others with no closer tie to Bitcoin network - they just provide a wallet, explorer &amp; charts)

Satoshi must have been aware that just from how the statistics works - even if all nodes mine - there will be some that will never find a block even if all have equal hashrate (which is never the case and it's clear that some nodes will have very weak computing capabilities and they will have far lower chance than others).
So, again - when he says that all nodes mine, he says it just for simplicity. Verification/validation is the step that must be done before mining and is independent of mining.

From some point on the two blockchains will diverge, before that point (block) the transactions will be the same in the history of both. If you had incoming transactions before/in that block, you will have it in both forks.

The more people join, the more will our BTC be worth... :)


You can see some exchanges [here]( and [here]( (Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, etc.). These are exchanges - servers where you need to register and then they maintain your fiat &amp; BTC accounts. You send there fiat or BTC and trade it for the other and back (and forth). 
Other interesting option is [localbitcoins]( - there you can arrange trades in person - bitcoin for cash and vice versa without the need to register (you need to create account, but you don't need to register your name/address/ID) and without the need for bank transfers.
Also, there are some options how to pay directly with bitcoins (dell, newegg, overstock, expedia, microsoft, steam, etc.).
In general - establishment and banksters do their best to make bitcoin less convertible: exchanges are required to collect KYC data, some exchanges close people's accounts if they suspect people use bitcoins for something against humanity like gambling and some banks were reported to close accounts. 
Bitcoin is more or less complete alternative to our banking system - everything is visible (just not who controls what addresses), everybody can see what is going on, everybody can inspect the open-source code to know how Bitcoin works and everybody is welcome to join and develop services and anything with and around Bitcoin itself... 
Hard-capped amount of coins is an anti-thesis to mainstream dogma that there must be inflation at all costs. Bitcoin openness and freedom is an anti-thesis to current more and more restricted and more and more enforced (cash is being fought against) bank accounts/transfers. Bitcoin privacy (no-one can tell who owns what address) is an anti-thesis to all the sniffing that establishment does around our money. 
They will have hard times fighting us - Bitcoin is (like) bittorrent (and more) - there is no center, all is community, all is individuals that they would need to attack - all in their living rooms - if they want to shut it down. 
We believe Bitcoin will change the world. Lot of us is crazy from the gains and unbelievable price movements... but think about it. It's the first time in history - when there is a money that is universally usable globally, that cannot be censored, confiscated, shut down and manipulated (like printed out of thin air, etc.)...

**TL;DR**: mining is a process of confirming transactions (adding new blocks with transactions to shared database called blockchain) - a way how decentralized network can agree what happened; it's also way how to create new bitcoins (miner gets 12.5 BTC per block currently)
Mining is a mechanism that adds blocks (filled with transactions) to blockchain. Blockchain is something like digital ledger book shared among all nodes in Bitcoin network (it's peer-to-peer similar to bittorrent which gives Bitcoin incredible resilience against shutdown/censorship). 
Bitcoin network has no center, so there has to be something that enables all Bitcoin peers around the world trust that the new block is and will be the universally accepted one. So, mining is a process of finding of new **valid** block. This block must follow the rules (all nodes in Bitcoin network check if it's correct - i.e. there is no transaction that is sending BTC that was already spent) AND that the miner put appropriate amount of work into creating/finding of this new block.
How we know the miner did appropriate amount of work to find the block? It's somewhat clever mathematical thing - but essentially it's a lottery. Miners have to do many attempts (many billions per second), but only after great many attempts they win and form a correct new block. The mathematical cleverness is in this: it takes very long to create new block (on average, only one miner on the planet finds 1 block every 10 minutes), but it's easy to verify that the block - every node in Bitcoin network can verify that the block is kosher in under 1 or 2 seconds ...so - once the new block is found, it can be spread around the planet in just few seconds. Nodes in bitcoin network then agree that transactions in that block happened (and not other transactions that people might be trying to post - transactions which are spending the same bitcoins - ...this is called "double spend problem" - you can make two transactions - each of which is spending the same bitcoins, but only one of those can be valid - and the whole bitcoin network has to agree which one of those is valid/accepted and which one should be discarded as invalid)...
Why is this needed? It's because there is no center, no central place where you can store the whole database &amp; maintain the state that would be accepted by all. 
Mining also addresses the problem of how to spread new currency among people - at the beginning, there were no bitcoins, but they were continuously created at constant pace 50 BTC per new block. This block reward is halved every 4 years, so the amount of BTC is hard capped at 21 million.

Enable RBF ("Replaceable" transaction checkbox then appears when sending transaction). Enable manual fee and set it very low. If needed, use "Increase fee" (right mouse button menu in history) on the unconfirmed transaction. Watch here:
to get an idea how big the fee should be (per (kilo-)byte) and watch it also to get an idea when the network is less busy (over nights and weekends). For mid/high priority transactions use exactly one input in your transaction, consolidate your inputs with ultra-low priority transactions using RBF+manual fee over the weekends.
Edit: Pro-tip: if you don't need to send exact amounts (e.g. when selling BTC to friend or when sending between your addresses), you can use 1 input 1 output transaction that are the smallest possible ordinary transactions. You can even use RBF here - original transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs but when you replace it with higher fee it becomes 1 input 1 output (new version of Electrum correctly recognizes that the second output is 0.00000000 and correctly omits it).

With script versioning, segwit opens a whole new world of possibilities - see e.g. MAST among other benefits [here](
Also, witness is a proof that bitcoins were send by the "righful" owner. This needs to be checked first before transaction gets into blockchain, but storing that for eternity is not needed - even now the full nodes are not checking signatures for transactions that are buried deep in the blockchain. 
Pieter explaining Segwit:


Yes. With more required resources the decentralization is weaker (or non-existent). Many people - even from 1st world - don't want to run full nodes because the resources needed already are high.

Have some amount of BTC in Trezor without password and the bigger part in Trezor with password. 
You can control the length of the password - so you can make it long enough so it is not practical/possible for the attacker to crack it (before you find out about the theft of backup) but at the same time it can be short enough so it is possible for you to crack it in case you completely lost it. I would say the sweet spot is password that can be cracked by hi-end GPU in 6 - 12 months.

Sweeping is a normal transaction. Fee depends on size (i.e. e.g. on number of inputs - i.e. on the number of transactions that came to your paper wallet address). Currently it would be something in range $0.1 - $1.0. It's hard to guess what it will be in the future - but this is the thing I fear the least (that getting bitcoins out of savings address will be too expensive).

Yes, that's the very private key - the QR code is just this code encoded into an machine-readable image. 


Copay? Yes, you import it (or sweep it) into new wallet generated by your wallet &amp; then you can send it again to your cold storage.


Install 'Electrum' in Ubuntu &amp; try to use it (sending/receiving). If you get familiar with Electrum (it's a great wallet), you can generate your cold storage wallet using Electrum - if you generate the wallet on an offline machine (Electrum seed written on paper will be your paper wallet - cold storage).

Size of [block]( in [blockchain]( is now governed by [MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE]( constant - number of [node]( can't influence this (every full nude has it's own copy of the whole blockchain). Segwit will increase the total blocksize by some amount - but more importantly it has other more significant [benefits]( (fixing malleability, enabling script versioning, etc.).
Confirmation times depend on global hashrate &amp; difficulty. Speed of propagation plays some role too (but rather insignificant in this case).

If the price is not falling constantly, all the newly created bitcoins must be bought with fiat (miners retaining their bitcoins can be seen as if they sold those new bitcoins on the market to themselves for fiat). 
So, currently, at $420, 25 BTC is bought every 10 minutes (note this is just a small part of the whole exchange volume). When this suddenly drops to 12.5 BTC, there will be lower supply, but (likely) the same demand =&gt; price will rise.

People don't. Banksters do. They just write a number into their computer and viola - they have more money ("money"). Gold standard is long gone &amp; now with fractional reserve banking, banks print as much money as they want. They profit, you lose.


Mining is not that much different from buying bitcoins. This is because the difficulty is adjusting - so if there are more and more miners, all of them will be receiving less and less. Up to a point where most of them barely make any profit. This holds now and was the same several years ago, too. I was mining for nearly a year - all this noise in our small family flat. And guess what - I could have made 3 times more without any hassle if I just bought when I started &amp; forgot about mining.*
Also, the trick was to mine/buy and then hold for years - this got rewarded now for many, but it was highly risky in the first place... 4 years ago we were ridiculed left and right and no sane people expected what really happened - 50 fold increase in price in just one year...
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:41:00
Yes, far before 2140 (or 2130 if BTC is mined faster) fees will become bigger than the raward. Heck, it can happen 3 years from now already (currently fees are up to 5 BTC per block, block reward after next halving will be 6.25 BTC per block).

Mining will not stop - miners will be getting transaction fees only when block reward dries out. However it will be gradual process - every 4 years there is halving that halves block reward. See [here]( and [here]( Regarding value/price: it's unpredictable. So far Bitcoin is useful and (very very) scarce. It will get scarcer in the future (lost BTC, more ppl wanting BTC probably).

Try re-installing electrum  - or installing different version (slightly older maybe). Save your wallet files (electrum.dat or similar in wallets dir), but you should be able to restore your wallet always from seed (providing you are not trying some very old electrum versions).
If you know how to use command line in your OS, you might try this before reinstalling: launch electrum with "electrum -w XYZ" where XYZ is a file name (file path) of your new wallet - you can basically try to create different wallet file by restoring your seed.

As others say - walls can be fake (will disappear without the trades being executed). 
Sometimes - counter-intuitively - the large sell wall is there with the aim to push price up in the future - as the other sellers need to go under it if they want their orders to be executed. Then, when the wall is pulled without any orders from it being executed there is far less sell orders on the way up (and buyers also have more funds remaining as the other sellers were forced by the wall to sell slightly lower than they originally intended)...
When price move, new orders can be swiftly created - so we don't see everything that will come in play if the price starts moving. There are also something called dark pools - there are some orders waiting to be executed - but these orders are not visible in order books.
My advice: do not (day)trade - in this space, everybody tries to trick you and take advantage of you and your emotions. Every time I trade I lose... :D ;)

It's not in separate block. It is in separate space in the same block. 
Everybody sees it (unless the node asks for the stripped version of block that doesn't have witness info (however this is probably not implemented, yet)).


Potentially yes (and more importantly: bandwith). New nodes that are synchronizing might not (in the future when it is implemented) request witness data for blocks that are buried deep in blockchain (because we can reasonably expect that we don't need to check (the signatures of) these transactions because they were checked already many times by many nodes).


With segwit comes new logic that use used when the transaction is segwit transaction - i.e. there are new rules that give new options and also fix/improve things (e.g. malleability was a problem that is now fixed for segwit transactions).

Going from experienced dev team of 100+ people who are doing the work voluntarily to a team of one or two ((far) less experienced) paid developers is "absolutely no difference over who controls bitcoin", riiiiight. The same for users running nodes - now a lot of them run core because core team/client proved to be orders of magnitude more reliable than the concurrence and because the vision for the (very) long run is there. Changing this to users (who run nodes) being easily controlled by populism (or worse: no users running nodes - nodes being run just by miners) - is also "absolutely no difference over who controls Bitcoin" in your eyes?

Probability distribution of blocks is exponential - because there is the same probability that the next blocks comes in the next minute when we just had a block and also when we had last block 30 or 60 or 90 minutes ago.
See the table here:
Probability of block taking 75+ minutes should be exp(-75/10), i.e. 0.000553 i.e. about 0.06 %, i.e. if you have 2000 block sequence there is likely 75+ min gap in it somewhere.

Chain will not die. Some miners will go away, the rest will have more profit so they will stay.
If people feel that Bitcoin is less useful, they will try to dump it - i.e. they will be sending transactions with (very) high fee. (If you want to dump 100 BTC quickly and you expect the price will be falling it makes sense to pay 1 BTC in fee...) =&gt; Fees will make some miners come back.
Bitcoin is very resilient (we saw it hundreds of times already - it will die because of X, it  will die because Y, ...), two months of slow transactions will not kill it that's certain. Last resort solution is emergency hardfork - that would solve the problem, too if needed ...but I am sure such drastical solution will not be needed in case we have drop in hashrate.

Your fee was only 0.65 uBTC/B (or 0.00065 BTC/KB - see  
For urgent transaction use higher fee! With regards to this: it is wise to consolidate your inputs first (do a low fee low priority transaction that will join your inputs into one) and then do the high priority transaction after that. This supposes you know you will be doing high valued high transaction in advance and this supposes you have more inputs (and you know this). ...But when all this is true, you can achieve both lower total fees paid and faster confirmation of your high priority transaction (although you initial low fee low priority transaction may take hours/days to confirm).

It's a lot about emotions - price goes down &amp; everybody panics and sells, trolls pop out of their holes and spell doom &amp; gloom &amp; all ppl fall into depression; then after shorter or longer time, price goes finally up, more people buy which drives price higher and higher and suddenly everybody panic buys... 
Bigger players have incentive to fuel these changes in "sentiment" - they might try to drive &amp; keep price low (by recurrent big sells) and then suddenly trigger a rally (by buying back fast) - then they can sell higher &amp; repeat the cycle - sucking money out of weak hands (of panicking peons).
There is a lot of uncertainty - is the higher volume "genuine" or is it caused by small amount of BTC that is traded back and forth thousands of times? How many people with significant amounts of BTCs will be selling if price goes up 500 %? How much BTC is lost? How many new users/buyers is there? Etc.
Is this return to mean or are we already far above the level where we "should be"? Are we going into another bubble with +300 % or +1000 % in few weeks ahead of us? Nobody knows. Do some people profit from large swings in price? Certainly.

Can you "destroy" gold by buying all world's gold? You would be able to buy some part - but the rest would be used as it is now. And - it would have higher price because the supply would be lower. You would need infinite amount of money to be able to buy all gold (and also willingness of all gold holders to sell gold to you would be required). 
Buying large portion of all money is somewhat a problem with fiat (i.e. current national currencies) - if the supply of currency is low, the price of banknotes/coins might go up and there might be shortage of smaller/all denominations. However, this is not problem with bitcoin - as it is nearly infinitely divisible.
The thing you are describing might lead to somewhat unpleasant situation - if that large holder use his/her BTC to "destabilize" market - i.e. if he/she sells a lot of bitcoin fast (this will create sell panic) and then buys a lot fast (triggering buy panic) &amp; repeats. But this is already happening &amp; it is not fatal problem for bitcoin - people just need to keep calm and make a plan (instead of relaying on immediate emotions).

No. For given block size, it might be better for miners to aim for 80 % full block than for 100 % full block because trying to calculate 100 % full block that gives maximal profit with given available transactions is (very) hard problem (if all available transactions can't fit into the block).
Miners want bigger blocks because they think they would get more fees (or they think they can fork to other version of Bitcoin where they have more influence over its function and development).

If the transaction is unconfirmed it never left your wallet.


What error? How are you doing it?
You can try to upgrade Electrum, too. Be sure that you have paper backup of the seed (even though the wallet should survive the upgrade without problems).
You can also start Electrum with '-w PATH_TO_NEW_WALLET_FILE' - this will create new wallet file and let you restore from seed. Or use '-D SOME_DIR' or '-P' ...these parameters will force Electrum to (resynchronize and) store metadata into SOME_DIR or the dir where the executable is located respectively. This can help if there is some problem in the wallet itself.
Use "Replaceable" ("Replace-by-fee" in options) next time - this allows you to 'increase fee' of existing unconfirmed transaction.

Bitcoin is new technology with unique features - it is immutable ledger that holds amounts and stores transfers of these. It is immune to censorship and other attacks. It is also immune to confiscation by authorities (either direct or indirect via inflation). At the beginning (year 2009) bitcoins had no value, but the properties listed above became interesting for people so those people who weren't mining wanted some and offered first trades for fiat (dollars). So, first value was established like that. Then, this was reinforced - more people saw that bitcoins can be sold - and that the unique feats of Bitcoin are applicable to storing/transferring/keeping value.

Get more familiar with the system, try more wallets, try to buy something, donate a little bit, etc. Research (FAQ &amp; Myths in sidebar are good start). 
Personally - I believe that cryptocurrencies are one of the greatest inventions of the last since the internet. Bitcoin is leading by far. So I believe it is good to buy and hold some - to get involved. Do cost averaging. Put 20 % of your savings into Bitcoin. If you lose it you will not be terribly depressed, but if the potential of this thing gets fulfilled, you will be part of something amazing! ;)

As Pieter says in the video, full nodes ask for signatures of transactions in old blocks - and then they don't use them for anything (they expect they are valid as these tx-es are deep in blockchain). New version of the client might not ask for witness in that case which would save bandwith.

Yes, block is a collection of transactions with some added data - that complies to the rules (there must be not more than 12.5 BTC newly created in a block, all transactions must be kosher (outputs less or equal to inputs, correctly signed, etc.), previous block hash must be included, block hash must be lower than target, etc.
Yes, difficulty is 1/target.

People are usually sucked into Bitcoin during huge rallies (most likely near top of those). E.g. now if ppl bought everything  they would be worse off than if they started to do DCA - they would have done just the first of more buys above $1000 and then, the next might well be under $1000 (eg. today or in a few days). This is not only about beginners - also more experienced people here are prone to panic buy when the craziness takes hold.
Other benefits of DCA is that you are playing it safe(r). It is falling down, but you are ok with that - "hey, I can do the next buy at lower price!". And also that you are not keeping bigger amounts of fiat/BTC at exchanges - you have time to buy and move BTC out of exchange before the next buy. Also when DCA is done over many months as I recommend, you have time to learn &amp; think about &amp; establish secure storage methods. 
GTFO with your "DCA is absurd"

Blockchain is a ledger that stores transactions - their inputs (which are outputs of previous transactions) and their outputs. If you received your one bitcoin in 4 transactions you would have it "in 4 pieces", in 4 distinct outputs (of previous transactions) that are in 4 different places in blockchain. Then, when you send this bitcoin, your transaction will have 4 inputs - 4 pointers to those transactions that sent you those parts of your one bitcoin.

Are you sure that big increases in Bitcoin adoption lead to "fast" increase of unconf-tx-no (as compared to a state one or two days ago)? Because that's what you operate with in your reply (which sounds like trolling BTW)... 
Also - why do you say "ALWAYS" when he is not using quantification that strong? Like - spam attacks are (presumably) quite common and big immediate spikes in adoption are quite unlikely (what would convert tens/hundreds of people in just a few hours &amp; make them send a transaction?)... So - unconf-tx-no going up fast is probably pretty good indicator of spam attack (with some possible exceptions when it could mean there is spike in legitimate transactions)...

There is never a dull day in Bitcoin world. 
The simple motive to bash Bitcoin is always there - profit: 0. short BTC; 1. bash BTC; 2. close position when price is lower; 3. profit. Alternatively - the same but instead of shorting Bitcoin you close your long BTC and open long alt position (the bonus here is that you can pump your alt explicitly in the process of bashing Bitcoin).  
Then, there might be various attacks coming from various people (some of them considerably powerful) - attempts to destroy Bitcoin or at least take control over it...
I am optimistic. The cat is most certainly out of the bag. There is no way in hell that someone/something can kill all cryptocurrencies. Limit their use, discredit users ...maybe, but cryptos are not going away. So, in the unlikely event that our honey badger enters limbo from some serious radioactive poisoning, there still be many other continuators. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is the alfa-male, far stronger than the rest of the offsprings/clones.
Let's push through. We are here for the freedom. For the original ideal of money that is not controllable by some populist politicians/businessmen and all other kinds of self-entitled scum. We are a community - fragmented, diversified, but functioning and global. Stronger than ever.
Barbarians? Yeah, maybe. But more tech savvy, more open for ideas and everything, simply better than the old entrenched fools controlling the sheep and their systems. We don't even need to attack them, just stay strong, believe in our cause &amp; their houses of cards will fall down just by themselves.

cost averaging
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:01:09
Most trading is done on exchanges. There, sellers make sell orders: A is selling 1.5 BTC at price $550/1BTC, B is selling 1 BTC at price $600/1BTC, C is selling 3 BTC at price $900/1BTC and so on. (Also buyers make buy orders - X is buying 4 BTC @ $480/1BTC, ... - but let's forget about this for now.)
Now, you login to exchange &amp; you want to buy 1 BTC - so you give $550 to person A (indirectly, through the exchange mechanisms) &amp; you receive 1 BTC - so you swap $ for BTC. The blockchain is not involved in this in any way - it would work for apples in the same way. After you, person P comes &amp; wants to buy 4 BTC, the sell orders are now:
A is selling 0.5 BTC @ $550/1BTC
B is selling 1.0 BTC @ $600/1BTC
C is selling 3.0 BTC @ $900/1BTC
orders are filled from the lower price to the higher price. P buys 0.5 from A, 1 from B and 2.5 from C (for total price of 275+600+2250). After that, only one sell order will remain:
C is selling 0.5 BTC @ $900/1BTC
...now D sees that people are hungry for bitcoins &amp; offers 2 BTC for sale @ 1500 each:
C is selling 0.5 BTC @ $900/1BTC
D is selling 2.0 BTC @ $1500/1BTC
...someone buys 0.51... and the price jumped to $1500, only remaining sell order:
D is selling 1.99 BTC @ $1500/1BTC
To conclude - if there are many buyers and nearly no sellers, price will go significantly up (and vice versa).

For this amount you should have separate cold and hot wallets. You can use Electrum on offline machine for cold wallet and different Electrum on online machine for hot wallet. It is ok to restore the cold wallet from seed every time. Also it is fine to restore your hot wallet from seed every time if you want to. If you have cold Electrum wallet, you can grab its master *public* key and create a seedless wallet with it - so you can see (on your online machine) how much you have in your cold storage - also you can create transactions for cold signing with this seedless wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:15:23
Yes, safe and comfortable. 
However, for extra safety, you can create multisig wallet with more separate (cold / from different machines) Electrum wallets required to send the funds. However this would make sense for like 50+ BTC. For such amounts, also HW wallets are recommendable.

Bitcoin network is made of full nodes (some of them mining) - rules in these define how Bitcoin works and what it is.
Bitcoin Core (full node) is the most secure and most private solution - however it needs some resources and it's maybe a little less convenient. I would recommend playing with Electrum first - convenient, fast, secure, with some advanced options (RBF). When you are familiar with it all you can proceed to running &amp; using full node.


Definitely. Search for wallet files (usually "wallet" in name - old Bitcoin client had "wallet.dat" wallet files) and backup these. However you don't need to rush to open those - BTC price will go up probably in the following years and also it is better to understand what to do (it's recommended to run the wallet offline so the wallet and its private keys are not exposed to internet)...


No. For fast transactions you need to pay high(er) fee. (I recommend using Electrum and setting transactions as "Replaceable" - then you can increase the fee of unconfirmed transactions if needed...).

What I find very promising with Bitcoin (and with HW wallets like Trezor in particular) is that it will make people use their private keys. People will learn how to store private keys securely and how to use those conveniently - even on the go.
You use private keys to send bitcoins, but you can use the same (or very similar) keys also for many other things (logins to all web services or computers; encryption of mails and other communication; signing of documents (incl. instant messages, blogs, news), and all other kinds of identification - like e.g. access to buildings or family medical records).

I believe he was crashing - or at least suppressing - the price on all exchanges for months. Moreover - he might have done that not out of stupidity but it might have been planned (either to profit from altcoin investments or to take control over Bitcoin infrastructure and development).
Crashing price temporarily wouldn't do much - some people will get cheap coins, some people who panic-sold will lose, and then it will go back to normal. Heck, even Satoshi selling his 1 million BTC wouldn't be end of the world. Price will be lower for a year or something but in the grand scheme of things this is nothing. Bitcoins will be held, bitcoins will be sold and will change hands. What matters is that Bitcoin keeps it properties - decentralized peer-to-peer value transfer, not censored and controlled by authorities, not diluted by reckless printing.

Use Replace-by-fee ("Replaceable" checkbox when sending transaction) and set the fee low (10 sat/B). 
Then you can increase the fee if it doesn't go through. Watch [this]( to get feeling about fee dynamics (watch the rightmost column - 999,999 bytes will go to next block). The fee recommended there should work (it is updated in real time to reflect the current situation for next block) but if blocks come faster in sequence (block times are random with exponential distribution) you can have the transaction even cheaper than the recommended best fee there.

All you need is the seed. The password just unlocks the 'default_wallet.dat' wallet file on one particular machine (wallet file that you created there from seed).
You don't need to stay logged on. If you are receiving payments, all that matters is if you are the (only) owner of the private key to that bitcoin address and if that transaction makes it into a block - i.e. whether it gets recorded in the blockchain. If you have the private key to the address (which was generated from your seed if you are using Electrum and which is hidden in your wallet (file)), you can come back years later, restore your wallet from seed somewhere &amp; use the bitcoins. Your wallet and all nodes in the Bitcoin network will know (after you make an transaction) that you are the owner, because only you have the private key to that address.

We are speaking about average block time (over the last retarget period which is 2016 blocks) - this (average) blocktime most definitely was under 10 minutes because difficulty went up. 
Of course some blocks take 45+ minutes to find - blocktimes have [exponential probability distribution]( - as in any point in time, the probability that the block will be found in the next second is constant (providing difficulty didn't change which happens every approx. 14 days).

It's just rather uninteresting corner case when the mining full node has so small mining power that it never finds a block.
*5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.*
*6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.*
...while 6) speaks about mining - 5) doesn't... For simplicity it mentions only this rule, but there are a lot more (blockhash must be lower than target, block must contain hash of previous block, etc.)...
While Satoshi says that every node works on finding block he doesn't say that this is required. So, concept of non-mining full node is there in the whitepaper.

Size of transaction is not in bitcoins, but in **bytes** - i.e. how big is the record - i.e. the data of the transaction - i.e. how much information needs to be transferred and stored in blockchain. 
Transaction moving two million bitcoins can easily be smaller than transaction transferring one milibitcoin... Typically if it has smaller number of inputs and outputs (but also scripts can be longer for multisig, etc.)...
Regarding your transaction:


these are it's parameters we see in that link:
    fee: 0.000335 [BTC]
    size: 666 [B]
...which means:
    fee per B: 0.00000050 BTC
... if you multiply that by 1000*1000 ...you get the fee in microBTC per B:
    fee: 0.50 uBTC/B   
...or 50 satoshi per byte or 0.00050 BTC/KB ...this you see [here]( ...note that there are really transactions with fee 0.50 uBTC/B that are waiting 12+ hours...
The fee would need to be at least 0.70 uBTC/B to get fast confirmations.
The problem in your transaction is also that it has 4 inputs - if you had only one, the size would be something like 260 B and not 666 B that you have - i.e. you would need to pay lower fee to get the same priority. (Or the same absolute fee 0.000335 [BTC] would give you far higher priority (i.e. "next block").)
So: for urgent transactions, select one input only. If you have many small inputs and you expect you will need to do urgent transaction with all those in the future - consolidate those with low fee low priority transaction (once in a week like even the transactions with fee under 0.30 uBTC/B get confirmed...).
Edit: on closer look:
Do you see that red "U" there in your inputs? That means that your transaction needs to have this transaction confirmed first (or at the same time):
...it's fee is 0.60 uBTC/B ...also below the current 0.7 - 0.8 uBTC/B required for relatively fast confirmation...

Some things never happened until they happened for the first time.
That algorithm for fee estimation can't guarantee you anything - it can't possibly know how fast the blocks will be coming and how much new competing transactions will emerge in seconds/minutes after you broadcast your transaction... BTW - was it even broadcasted? (Did you check with at least two online blockchain explorers?)
First thing to do is as I said - calculate your fee per B &amp; watch the dynamics in  - how many times there are all transactions with 0.50 uBTC/B confirmed? How often there are older transaction with higher fees? (E.g. sometimes even 0.80+ uBTC/B transactions are waiting for hours.) Etc. When you get the feeling you can compare with what Electrum suggests you with it's dynamic fee algo. You can manually set higher fee if you need priority (also consolidation of inputs with low fee transactions is advisable.) 
And BTW - if your unconfirmed transactions are urgent, you can try CPFP (child pays for parent). You need to identify the change &amp; use it in new transaction with high fee. Miners will see this new transaction &amp; they will see that they need to confirm also the previous one to get the fee...
Edit: ...And finally - if the fee looks right, there might be other problems - like the fail to broadcast I mentioned or spending parents that can't get confirmed for some reason (double spends, other rule violations, zero fees, etc.).
@_date: 2016-12-08 07:56:44

Blocks are created like this:
Miner software selects transactions that are to be included in a block. Then, hash (digest) of previous block is taken which must be included in new block (this ensures we have a chain of blocks). And then it's like a lottery - miner tries different nonces (a number that can pretty much be random) and tries to "find a block" - i.e. she tries to create a block that meets the difficulty criteria (its hash is smaller number than target). This is trivial but very hard time/resource-wise ...intentionally - as we need blocks not to come faster than 1 every 10 minutes (on average). This is because we want the whole network to stay synchronized -  new blocks must not come too quick - so all nodes have time to get new blocks from the network (from their peers).
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:15:40
Every 2016 blocks, difficulty is adjusted so the next block will take (variance aside) 10 minutes (providing the average hashrate will not change from that point on). 
So, the formula is simple and gives 10 minute blocks on average providing hashrate is not rising/dropping. In case when hashrate is constantly rising (which is not far from reality), blocks will be always a bit faster than 1 per 10 minutes as difficulty adjusts so the average hashrate from last 2016 blocks will make 10 minute blocks - however when hashrate is rising, the new hasrate is bigger than the average hashrate from the last 2016 blocks =&gt; blocks will be slightly faster than 6 per hour - 7.2 per hour for example when hashrate is rising relatively fast...

Wrong. Despite it's name, public key should not be shared in Bitcoin. When it is revealed (when sending from address), corresponding address should not remain in use (it should have no BTC after the first send and it should not be reused). The reason is that Bitcoin uses public-private key cryptography but additional layer(s) of security are added - public key is not used directly, but it is hashed by SHA256 then RIPEMD160 then SHA256 and SHA256 once more. 
The above makes it impossible to go from BTC address to the public key. So, in the very unlikely event of private-public crypto of Bitcoin (ECDSA) being broken, nobody can take bitcoins from addresses that didn't reveal their public key (i.e. that didn't send bitcoins)...

Fiat system:
* leads/forces you into fragile behavior (overspending, making loans instead of saving);
* shifts value from poor/middle to rich (rich print their "money" which dilutes the value of the existing "money" people have in their pockets; also it forces people to invest into overpriced assets);
* strips people of their privacy and freedoms - please research e.g. [Operation Chokepoint]( - I am too afraid to think what totalitarian govsters can do with people when there is no cash - only cards provided by 3 companies (controlled by govsters/banksters). We had totalitarian gov (Czech Rep) - you spoke your mind in a pub - you were shifted to the shittiest of jobs and your children were denied education. If they can control all your money (or "money" in case of fiat) they can ruin you and your life in an instant. BTW - For very entertaining view of the old times I highly recommed this movie:  They were watching the important people (elites, intelligentsia, philosophers, people with connections to abroad, freedom fighters) very closely (e.g. 24/7 monitoring of their homes). With all the sniffing devices (phones and televisions listening and recognizing your faces...) today and all the info people are giving away in social platforms and e-communication all of this can get far worse (and with globalization: very quickly, too).

Relatively small hashrate (10 % of current average or 1 % of current average or even 0.1 % of current average) can make 95 % of blocks if it gets very (very (very (very (very)))) extremely lucky. If you flip coin for long enough, you will find sequence(s) of 10 heads in a row, 1000 heads in a row, million etc.
There was an article somewhere [here](organofcorti.blogspot.com) with exact math - it was published IIRC with regards to Bitcoin-XT's (or was it BU?) relatively low trigger (was it 60 %? or 75 %?). 
I think it's not mathematical question - rather it's psychological/economical question: 
* e.g.: I am miner with 41 % hashrate - should I risk it and try to make the longest chain by orphaning all blocks of others - when odds are against me &amp; when it could probably trigger large backlash in community and even some retaliation from devs (change in POW?)? ...How much can I win? How much can I lose?
* e.g.: Nearly all of us (92.5 %) are pro-segwit, we know it is a good thing, community knows it is a good thing, devs know it is a good thing... ^(*just Roger has moral issues*) ...should we try to orphan some percent of anti-segwit blocks to reach 95 %? (It will work for sure and it can be done quite in a furtive way).

Pay appropriate fees, get the feeling here:
and here:


You can't use your unconfirmed change? (As we have CPFP (child pays for parent), if you use fee high enough for both transactions, it should push both your transaction into blockchain.)
Also, prepare your inputs - do not have one large piece (all your bitcoins in one output from previous transaction) - have more differently sized potential inputs ready. On the other hand you should not have lots of tiny pieces - then you need to pay higher fees as size of transaction (in bytes) is bigger. It's good to consolidate tiny inputs (in low fee low prio transaction).
And yes - it's not average-joe-friendly - for that you have to wait some years.
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:02:03
You can watch your (bitgo) receiving address in some online blockchain explorer [1]( [2]( [3]( If the transaction is not listed there they didn't make it, yet (it can take up to several hours for some services to send BTC as they usually try to do more payments in one transaction). If it's there it might be unconfirmed for some hours (possibly because low fee - relatively to current network conditions). If it's there and confirmed - there is problem with your bitgo wallet (more likely just cosmetic than critical).

Yes. In fact it never left your wallet. Unconfirmed transactions mean nothing.


Few days or week or two. Default time to drop is now 2 weeks, but anybody can rebroadcast your transaction.


You can do CPFP (child pays for parent) - you create new transaction that uses outputs of your unconfimed transaction - which pays fee for both. However, your transaction is low priority (as you send it from yourself to yourself) - so I would advise just to wait (and eventually resend if it gets dropped). 
RBF (replace by fee) is nice - you can use it easily in Electrum wallet - then you have the option to "increase fee" for unconfirmed transactions. I don't know whether there are options for RBF in core client...

Both are confirmed now, first one has 0.45 uBTC/B fee (45 satoshi/byte) which is like medium-priority (can take several hours if network is busy, see waiting transactions in real time [here](
Second transaction was maybe using the outputs of the first transaction so it couldn't be confirmed before the first one - OTOH it maybe helped to push also the first transaction into the blockchain (thanks to 'child pays for parent' mechanism).

Benefit is that instead of possibly many (possibly very) small inputs you will have just one input in your next transaction(s). So, the transaction(s) will be (relatively/a_bit) smaller so you will need smaller (absolute) fee to get the same priority.

Bigger players "manipulate" the price.
(If you are a big player and) If you manage to keep the price lower "than it should be" by selling bitcoins constantly - countering buy pressure, you can then create buy panic by your large buy (there is already the buy pressure you were suppressing + your buy makes even more pressure). Then you can sell with profit when the price goes higher. 
Also, you can do the opposite - make the price higher than "it should be (without you)" by constant buys. Then, you can do a large sell that will trigger panic and will allow you to re-buy lower with profit.
Of course it is more complex - as there are more large players, but the general idea is important. There are emotions at play. Did you observe it already on your own actions - that you do the opposite of what you should have been doing? ...i.e. that you are buying when it is at top and selling when it is going (and is) down. 
There are some objective reasons for the price to be rising (e.g. halving or more adoption), but all these are masked to a large extent by the above - so it's futile to ask what is the reason for every slight change in price. Just the overall trend is interesting.

This is one of the examples of low-priority transactions (providing the keys are not suspected to be compromised in the first wallet). User sending between cold storages can wait days or even weeks for the transaction to be done. So, you need to look at lowest transaction fees in last weeks, not highest. You can do transactions like that for 0.1 to 0.15 uBTC/B (10 - 15 satoshi / byte).

How massive, exactly?
To make blocks bigger without hard fork you would need to do (something very similar to) segwit - i.e. putting part of the block data outside the current block (into other part that is not counted for max block size constant). So - I think you would do the same as is done in segwit (without all it's benefits).

It's the same for sending $1 and $100000 - what matters is the size of transaction in bytes not the amount of BTC sent.
What follows from this is that the more inputs in your transaction you have the bigger transaction (=&gt; the bigger fee required for the same priority). If you received your bitcoins in many small pieces it is better to consolidate those in one low-priority transaction that goes to other address in the same wallet of yours.

It's not about how much BTC you are sending, it is about how big the transaction is in bytes (i.e. how big are the data in the transaction). The more inputs/outputs the bigger transaction (=&gt; the bigger fees required).
 has 3 inputs and 2 outputs =&gt; 519 B
When you have only one input, the size is approx 230 B. If you want to pay lower fees it makes sense to join inputs in low fee low priority transactions and then use only single output every time you are doing high prio transaction.

Makes no sense. Mining will continue. Also long before there is 0 block reward, block reward will be the smaller part of the miner's income (they will have far more in fees than in block reward although now it is the other way around (12.5 BTC/block in reward and 0.5-1.0 BTC/block in fees)).


This is caused by obstructions on the side of fiat system. It's one of the things Bitcoin is fighting against (regulations, loss of freedom, loss of privacy, ...).

Yeah. Why to have sound money if we can have diluting and heavily controlled centrally planned fun "money" that govs&amp;banks force upon us?
Bitcoin is the alternative that allows people to dodge that abuse. Bitcoin brings the freedom back to the people. Modern technologies allow much more control to be usurped by govs, banks and (other) elites. Without things that enable privacy (TOR, VPNs, encryption) and things that allow us to transfer value without the approval of the rulers we are in great danger of heading straight into the worst totality people ever experienced on this planet. We were living in totalitarian state (Europe, behind iron curtain) - if you were criticizing government, you became watched, even interrogated by secret police and jailed, you were denied normal job, your children were denied education.

Coinbase is fine. Every time is good time (do not pay too much attention to the drama all around - Bitcoin has many enemies). 
I recommend doing cost averaging (buying every month with fixed fiat amount) - if Bitcoin goes up all the way, your profit will be smaller than going all in immediately, but cost averaging is great for many reasons (e.g. it shields you from volatility so you don't need to sweat about price rises/declines; it gives you time to research security before you buy significant amounts; it makes you not store big amounts of fiat/BTC at exchanges)...

Buywall means that someone created buy order to buy significant amount of coins (at given price). 
That one on the picture means that someone wants to buy 10000 coins @ price of 0.1.
At first sight it looks like there is high demand for that coin - but buy walls can be fake too - as people who wanted to buy below the price where the wall is are forced to buy above it. And then, when the wall is pulled (i.e. that huge buy order uis cancelled), price starts dropping as there are no buyers left near and below the price where the wall was right before it was cancelled.

Nowadays, mining is more like professional venture (you need special HW, cheap power and considerable starting investment).
I would advise just buying BTC - spending half of your new savings every month for at least some years. If there is blood in the streets, you can try to throw some additional fiat in. (Although this is very hard to do - price gets down for months, hysteria, depression and trolling everywhere ...and you should buy (?)...)

You can also have people who will fake that they aren't XT when in fact they will be (because they will e.g. be scared by your article that BIP 101 could be activated with less than 50 % of true voters). Or the same effect will have the people who are not pro-BIP101, but who will switch immediately to BIP101 version after trigger (because they will e.g. guess that when it is triggered it will be the more viable option thanks to the fact (or good chance) that it has 50+% of hashpower)...

You can never know whether these companies seize even larger portions of the market (Apple making self driving cars?) and how computers/robots/people will evolve in upcoming years... Also how much fiat will be printed? These companies can go 10 times up or 10 times down and anything between it in few short years. Bitcoin can start stagnating and be around $10000 or lower for many years or it can go 10 times 100 times up if billion of people joins and/or when the really rich start the buy madness. Bitcoin is more unpredictable and potentially more rewarding, but I don't see it fundamentally different from stocks/commodities/anything.

Do [cost averaging]( - it is good for many reasons. One of them is that you don't miss the opportunity when the price goes only up from now (e.g. in 2013 it crossed $40 for the first time and it never went below that ever again). 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:48:06
First, transaction is created (as unsigned) - i.e. outputs are set and inputs are chosed from available ouputs of previous transactions and fee is set - and then this unsigned transaction is signed right away (typically after the wallet is unlocked with password/PIN). 
So, normally transaction is created and immediately signed, but if you want to send BTC from your cold wallet you create unsigned tx in your hot wallet (@ online PC) and then transfer this unsigned tx to your cold wallet (@ offline PC) where you sign it. See [here]( 
Note that unsigned tx must be created in hot wallet because the cold wallet is not aware of the exact outputs of the previous incoming transactions - some of which need to be used as inputs in new tx.

POS is not as secure+decentralized.
Miners pay for the electricity - so where is the problem? Moreover, BTC mining moves to location where power is cheap and often would be otherwise wasted (new hydrodams in China, geotermal in Iceland, etc.). And also, output heat of BTC miners can be used - so BTC mining can make things more ECO friendly as places that used electricity heating can get the same heat and also do some work.
With every outcry about BTC mining energy consumption we should also point to all the electricity and resources wasted in banks and other fin institutions. I do believe that Bitcoin is more efficient than those.

Multisig means that (outgoing) transaction must have two or more signatures. There are more types: 2-of-2 (for 1 multisig address, 2 private keys exist and both must sign), 2-of-3 (for 1 multisig address, 3 private keys exist and two of these must sign), etc.
You can try multisig in Electrum - if you want 2-of-2, it generates you 2 different seeds (one generates addresses A0, A1, A2, ...; second generates addresses B0, B1, B2, ...; and many multisig addresses (M0, M1, M2, ...). 
Say M2 received bitcoins (it is quite irrelevant how that was done). As it is multisig address (starts with digit 3), Electrum knows that after the unsigned transaction sending funds from it is created, this transaction must be signed by holder of the first seed (more precisely: by private key that generated address A2) and by the holder of the second seed (i.e. by key that generated address B2). When the transaction is signed by A2 (by the person controlling the first seed), Electrum offers to send the partially signed transaction to the person that controls the second seed (so it can be signed by private key of B2).

gov spamming blockchain is an absurd idea for two reasons:
1) they would admit by this that their "money" is inferior, that they fear the competition - this would trigger humongous Streisand effect
2) they would show that they are harming the well-being of their people
I can imagine banks trying to do that (but can't they use Bitcoin to their advantage instead?) - but I feel it's not the way to kill Bitcoin (&amp; technologies on top of it). Fees might be driven insanely high ($30+ per transaction) - but still that will not rob Bitcoin of its merits: it will remain store of value, settlement currency, something that cannot be confiscated and something that cannot be eradicated and something that is so versatile and open that it can be very well adapted and built upon (and also cloned). 
Using a service - and paying for it! - doesn't seem to be a viable way to kill it ("Let's kill this shop by buying out all the stuff in it!"). Instead, it will adapt and enhance itself.

I do not think we need to "justify" something. States are enforcing their monopoly currencies so they can debase those fiat non-monies (which means effectively stealing value from all citizens). This started in old Rome if not before. Bitcoin is an free alternative - we believe it is a true store of value - a true example of "money" (unlike fiat currencies). 
It is worth the look to see how much fiat is debased around the world - UAH: 50%/year? Ouch. I live in Czech Republic - since I can remember (30 years: 1985-2015), our currency Czech crown was debased to 5 % of its original value. We remember a beer for 1 CZK, now it is 20 CZK... Savers are pretty much fucked in the ass with cactus. You are forced to spend, to "invest" - even if you do not want to; you incentivized to live above your means (take loans instead of make savings so banks can profit). 
Bitcoin is highly volatile, but I believe that (in average / in the long run), it will outperform everything else (at least all fiat currencies) - even if no other users will be joining. Also let's not forgot about the other unique aspects of bitcoin (global nature, immune to blocades (Operation choke point), etc.).

Nothing or everything, black/white, you can't imagine anything else, right? 
Bitcoin is an alternative (one of many) that can coexist with other systems. It's an alternative that cannot be stopped by a govster/bankster raid (as happened many times before to less resilient alternative money attempts). Best system wins most users - but at any point, there will be (many) other alternatives used by some people.

Price doesn't directly depend on how much fiat was used in trading. Price depends on the willingness of sellers to sell at given price. If, suddenly, all BTC holders are enlightened and they realize that Bitcoin is much more robust and scarce and useful than they thought before, the price can jump to $20K or whatever without much trading in-between (existing standing sell orders could be cancelled and recreated far higher).

So you argue that miners keep mined coins? But this is no different from the situation when all miners sell all the coins and then some of them buy some of these coins back. 
For simplicity, you can think about this like that:  all mined coins are sold on market immediately + (as the price is not going down) people buy all these coins at the current price. Some of those people I mentioned might be the original miners - which is not that important. The important thing is that there is demand for all that 3600 BTC mined every day at current price.

1. You generate it on offline computer.
2. Normally - you send to one of its addresses (to its receiving address).
3. Wallet itself does not need to be registered. BTC transfer is done in blockchain. It is irrelevant whether the private key of the receiving address is in online wallet or in offline wallet or whether it exists at all. (Private key is needed only when sending, not for receiving.)
4. It is not registered. The point of offline wallets is to make private keys impossible to steal (from the internet).
5. Attackers from internet have no way how to steal the private keys from the offline wallet (as this wallet is never connected to the internet).

Sorry, but this is dumb. Bitcoin would bring more good (in total, as a whole) when more people use it. Eg. store of value that is not losing 30+% in 3 years would be very beneficial for many people. Ability to be paid without having any bank account could be beneficial for many people (in 3rd world, etc.). Also the ability to shield your value from (institutionalized) theft... Transaction processing might slow down, but that doesn't take away the utility in these cases. You can explain that to new users instead of "this thing is broken, GTFO".

We are still in the transitional period - there are still more and more new Bitcoin users ("investors") and also a lot of the old ones are willing to put more fiat in. I think that gradually it will come to an equilibrium point where new users are nearly exactly replacing dying users and everybody involved (in general) will have just enough value in BTC for their taste.
Fiat is designed to lose value (to transfer the value to people who create fiat from savers) so BTC price in $ (or other fiats) will likely go up. Also total global wealth is getting bigger (larger productivity, technology, produced things are accumulating) - so the hard-capped amount of BTC - when capturing some given fraction of this wealth - will be theoretically rising in value...
So, I expect that the "returns" will be getting smaller with time (compare 2013 where it went $10 -&gt; $1000 with 2016-2017 where it went just $400 -&gt; $8000) but also that we are still at the beginning as of now.


Purpose of govs should be to serve people - not vice versa. Bitcoin brings freedom and allows many unique things (e.g. store of wealth for the unbanked or oppressed). If govs chose to fight against Bitcoin, we will fight back (in the underground if needs be) ...and we know we will not lose.

Nice example.
Another interesting thing: 2 of 3 where:
* 1 private key has the online service (signs your transactions with this key of yours on your request), 
* 1 private key you use regularly on your "hot" machine,  and 
* 1 private key you hold as "backup" in safe (used only in case of trouble). 
This increases security - online attacker needs to hack two places (online service + your machine) simultaneously instead of just one (your machine). 
What is also interesting is that the online service cannot steal your funds (as they have only 1 key (unless they decide to hack you)) and also if they crash and burn, you don't lose your funds (you use your hot key + your "backup" key to sign 2 of 3)...

I am forced to use fiat - if for nothing else than for paying my taxes.

I am happy you are happy. I am not that happy with banks (slow or non-existent innovation, usury, fiat, corruption). I am happy we have an alternative.

Once the target date is reached, Bitcoin clients at full nodes will start enforcing the stricter rules - so all these nodes will stop relying blocks that do not comply with these stricter rules.

0-confirmation transactions can always be double-spent (especially if they are flagged as RBF).
For high value transactions, the recipient should always wait for 1 or more confirmations. For low value transactions, merchants kind of expect/hope the customers will not defraud them... It's like when they give you the dish in the restaurant and then the drink ...and they expect/hope that you will not run without paying at the end. 
(Edit: There are also algorithms that guess the chance of the transaction making it into the blockchain - depending on it's fee, that it has no unconfirmed parents, that it's doublespends were not seen yet, etc...)

70 sat/B - i.e. 0.00070 BTC/KB - is just slightly under the fee level that was being confirmed recently (I think in last 24 hours, only transactions with 0.80 uBTC/B were confirmed)... Watch this several times a day to get a feeling about the current dynamics:


You have to enable "Replace-by-fee" in Electrum menu: Tools-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Fees. And then check "replaceable" when sending transaction. This creates RBF transaction labelled "Replaceable" in history - right mouse button on it then allows you to "bump fee"...

Funny thing is that assassination market is in fact life insurance market, too. 
When I see there that there is an entry "vb will be killed on 2017-04-11" with significant bets on "yes" - I know I am in danger - so I do two things: first I bet against and second: I go into my bunker or fly to Switzerland and go into bunker there or just arm myself &amp; inform police... So - I was warned in advance and I also win the money that was bet on my death afterwards (so I can fund my security measures from the money that people bet on my death).
Interestingly enough, I don't need to follow the market at all. I believe that "protectors" will naturally emerge (if assassination market gets any traction) - people who will be protecting targets with high bets &amp; pocketing wins if those people are not killed.

Not a lie, merely an oversimplification.


It works exactly as Satoshi wanted. Difficulty is adjusting in such a way that *if* the hashrate after the adjusting remains constant, blocktime will be 10 min. This is how he wanted it, this is how it works. It is simple, it is technically sound, beautiful in a way. 
The rule is simple and that is great. Yes, when hashrate is rising, blocktimes are a bit shorter, if the hashrate is dropping, blocktimes are a bit over 10 minutes. But this is how it should work - I fail to see why so many people must be pedantically demanding 10 minute averages. It is now 9 minutes when hashrate is rising. Deal with it.
Satoshi could have implemented more elaborate rules (e.g. linear/polynomial [extrapolation]( but very often in programming, simple things are superior to more complex solutions.

"complex math problems" is a bit of a misconception. What miners do is rather trivial - they just try to find a number that will give the "ok" result (after using it as parameter in a simple function). It's like lottery - or throwing dice to get one thousand of '6'es in a row - or like generating a random number from interval 0 - 100000000000000000 and waiting till that number will be exactly 77777777777... 
The reason for the above is to have something that will happen only once in 10 minutes globally - only one miner in the whole world "finds" a block each 10 minutes on average. In this block, there are transactions which are said to be "confirmed" by appearing in this block. It takes long to find a block and/but it is quick to spread the block around the world. This is the way how all the nodes in the Bitcoin network (which has no center) can agree what happened. There can be many different transaction spending the same bitcoins - but only one of those can make it into a valid block &amp; the rest will be rejected by all nodes since that.


Miners are allowed to create 12.5 BTC (currently until the next halving) out of nothing &amp; "send" those to their own address. This is one of the rules in Bitcoin client (which is run by nodes) - and it's the only way how bitcoins can come into existence.


In wallets, there are only the keys that allow sending of bitcoins. Bitcoins are not in wallets - bitcoins are in blockchain. Blockchain is a database with transactions (who sends how much to who), all nodes have the same copy of blockchain (all blocks are spread to all nodes).
So, when you create new transaction with your wallet,  you are telling the network: "I want to use these bitcoins we see in blockchain (either received in transaction or mined) and I want these to go to this address... This transaction is signed by your wallet with your private keys that the wallet manages.
Then, this transaction is broadcasted to all nodes around you (providing you run full node) or to nodes around the server your light client connects to. Every node then does the verification: "Can those bitcoins really be spent?" Which means: are those bitcoins really in the blockchain AND weren't those spent by other transaction already? ...and also: "Is the signature correct?" Which means: is this transaction sending bitcoins by their rightful owner so to speak?
If the transaction complies to the rules and if it has enough fee in it, it is broadcasted around the globe - which means it also hits miners who then put it into new block (if the transaction has enough fee - and if they are incredibly lucky as we said above).
In other words - mining is a way how to prevent "double spend" - i.e. how to prevent people paying twice+ with the same bitcoins. Everything in computers is digital &amp; can be infinitely many times copied - but not bitcoins. Bitcoins are in blockchain &amp; blocks and transactions in those must comply to strict rules. The very low probability of creation of new block - this mining "lottery" where more computing power gets you higher chance - together with fast spreading of the block (it reaches all nodes globally in under 10 seconds) - ensures that all nodes have the same blockchain. So, all can see where those bitcoins were spent and that it happened only once.

Then, what was the sample in that survey? How many bitcoiners from South America, Africa or Asia? Don't you think people in GER/EU are better off with HW than the rest of the world? What was the methodology of that research? If it was not rigorous - why do you present it as if it is speaking about all users accurately? We don't even know about a lot of bitcoin users - who they are and what they want because they keep low profile intentionally.
And finally - I would argue that if those users do favor large blocks - they are not informed enough about decentralization &amp; the main purpose of Bitcoin.

BTW - we had communism here for 40 years. From world leader in many fields (we are rather small country) we turned into a shithole without any values.
If you accept that some people will have more than others, if Bitcoin makes it big, then I say that it is great that Bitcoin holders will be wealthy and potentially in power - these people are anti-establishment, anti-authority, they tried to change the world for the better, these are the people who wanted to advance the technology - as opposed to the banksters and people who just use their power to keep the status quo at all costs. 
Bitcoin will probably never achieve world dominance - but every bit of value that transfers from the banksters to Satoshi &amp; all the other BTC (or alt) holders - every bit of this value will make the world more balanced as it steals a little bit of power from the unscrupulous vampires we all are ruled by.

You have 30 sat/B it should confirm in a few days (I expect 2 to 4). Watch [this]( from time to time - the recommended fee there is the smallest fee that will get into block if it is found at the moment (see also rightmost column - all rows that have below 1 MB will get into block. Notice that sometimes the fee jumps a lot there if 1 MB of (unnecessary-)high-fee transactions arrives in the network.
You can try to bump fee more (mobile Electrum should allow bump to bigger fee than you have there in your tx (two times bigger IIRC)). If bumping is not an option, you can still try CPFP - child pays for parent - and create new transaction with exactly the output that comes back to you as change output in a transaction that pays enough fee also for this unconfirmed tx. Wait - you don't have change output :) - so CPFP will not work (unless the recipient is willing to do that).
Default time to drop from mempool is 14 days now (was increased from 2 days) - but this is local default for nodes - some might have longer time or anybody can even rebroadcast the transaction again after those 14 days. So, it is possible that it never arrives (then it means nothing happened and bitcoins are still yours) but it seems unlikely with 30 sat/B.

BTCs are in blockchain - nowhere else.
Your seed generates private keys for you - with these private keys you control bitcoins that were sent to your addresses (addresses derived from that private keys; every private key controls one bitcoin address).
Electrum is light client - it contacts Electrum server &amp; says - hey, I have these addresses, show me the parts of blockchain where these received/sent bitcoins. Electrum server is also bitcoin full node - so it has the full blockchain - i.e. complete information about what happened with all bitcoins since they were mined - so it can find the information that you (your Electrum client) need &amp; send it to you...
You see you have some balance, so you decide to send bitcoins somewhere - which means, you create transaction: *send* 0.1 BTC *from* MINE_BTC_ADDRESS *to* SOME_OTHER_ADDRESS. Your Electrum wallet signs it with the corresponding private key (of MINE_BTC_ADDRESS) so it becomes valid bitcoin transaction &amp; gives it to Electrum server. Electrum server then tells the bitcoin node it is running: hey, we have this new bitcoin transaction, broadcast it to peers, so it can be mined eventually. 
Transaction is peer-to-peer broadcasted around the whole globe - and it eventually reaches miners. If it has enough fee it is mined - i.e. the transaction is included in the new block which is the new tip of the blockchain. ...and by that, MINE_BTC_ADDRESS has 0.1 less and SOME_OTHER_ADDRESS has 0.1 more BTC. Bitcoins moved. 
That's the only way how bitcoins move: transaction included in a block makes it known to everybody that bitcoins moved from A to B. Which means: control over that particular amount switched from that private key of A to the private key of B.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:04:17
Private key signature is not like the signature you write by hand. It's not always the same, it is more like the same unique transformation ...of the input data that are being signed (which produces always different result if the input data is different). This unique transformation can only be done using the private key (controlled by single entity) - but it can be verified by everyone using the corresponding public key. 
So, anyone who has the public key (which is made public in the spending transaction) - so basically anyone can verify that the transaction was signed by the appropriate private key (corresponding to the revealed public key which in turn is known to be corresponding to the bitcoin address). However, the signature cannot be reused by a malicious actor - as it is only valid only for the original input data it was created for (i.e. the exact transaction that was made (well, not exact because of malleability - but nearly exact - as the outputs and their amounts must stay the same in all cases))...
So, the only way how the signature that is in the transaction can be reused is by reusing the whole transaction - which is not possible because of blockchain (once the transaction is there, it cannot be there for the second time - that would be against the rules)... - well, if you have two blockchains (like ETH and ETC after the hardfork), you can reuse the transaction that was done in one blockchain also in the other - that's called a "replay".
What was true for transactions is also true for messages - if you sign a message with your private key, all holders of the corresponding public key can verify that you signed that message with your private key. However, that signature can't be reused for anything else - as it is in fact a transformation - an unknown transformation - of the input message. With any other input message it would be found invalid. 
A bit off-topic, but also interesting fact about private-public key cryptography: using your private key, you can encrypt text, that only people who have your public key can decrypt... ...and vice versa!: (all) people who have your public key can encrypt a text that only you can decrypt (with your private key).

Try all options (with small amounts first).


Try more options, do smaller transactions. Once you get familiar with it, research safe solutions. I recommend Trezor if you plan to have more than 5 BTCs; (offline) Electrum is good; also multisig web solutions should be good (they hold 1 key, you hold the remaining 2 keys one of which is backup).


You can send money by bank wire to exchanges. No problems were reported with this. I use Kraken and Bitstamp.


ATM can either print new paper wallet for you (there is private key QR code that you can scan with Mycelium) or you can show your BTC address QR code to that ATM so it can send BTC to an address you generated (in your wallet) beforehand.

How many symbols?
You should be able to calculate for yourself how many bits of entropy are there - formulas are not that tricky, really. Give it an hour or two... ...Then you can compare to entropy bits of current solutions in wallets and in Bitcoin itself. (For example - Electrum uses 12 words (or more eventually) from a dictionary of 2048 words. Bitcoin itself - it's ECDSA private-public cryptography used for signing trasactions (i.e. sending bitcoins), if public key is known for the address - i.e. if the address send bitcoins before already - has [128 bits of entropy](
BUT - Be sure to try Electrum &amp; become familiar with it first - it's designed to be both secure &amp; as easy as possible (12 words are all you need to keep as (backup of) your wallet))...

It has value, because many people perceive it as valuable - because many people are prepared to work for it. 
The above has more reasons - one of it is that it is (scarce and) useful. It's useful ledger technology that is immune to censorship &amp; confiscation &amp; control by authorities. Also with potential to create and connect new technologies &amp; create new industries (tracking of ownership of things; value exchange for machines; proofs of existence).
It can be quite random process of something being chosen by people as money. Things without apparent value were used as money. Shells were used as money - originally maybe because of their (scarcity and) beauty. Large round stones were used as money - maybe because they were just hard to create (and counterfeit).

It's called mempool. Every full node has mempool - potentially of different size (there is command line parameter to set the size and also [minimal tx relay fee influences what transactions are in mempool]( and potentially with different transactions.

Your "definitely" is only defensible where he speaks about mining. It certainly cannot be said as general rule as you put it. E.g. here he uses "node" / "full network node" in the exact meaning we are using it:


a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network   nodes   until   he's   convinced   he   has   the   longest   chain,   (...) 
I am against "changing of his labels for concepts"... He was explaining that all nodes are mining (also) to keep the text simple - and also because it is not changing much if some of "full network nodes" are not mining. There is nothing that needs changing... ...adding some detail perhaps.

[Electrum]( is both secure &amp; convenient. 
Typical way to buy bitcoins is at [exchange]( - you send bank wire there &amp; either create order or buy/sell buy fulfilling existing sell/buy order. However, (we at) exchanges are victims to AML/KYC laws - so registration is required (national IDs, proofs of residence like utility bills and crap like that - see e.g. [here]( [btc-e.com]( might require less or no info, it is quite long standing &amp; reputable, but based in East Europe or Russia). 
There are other ways to buy Bitcoins - [localbitcoins.com]( or [bitsquare.io]( will not require excessive registration details but it might be little less convenient. [Bitcoin ATMs]( might be also interesting (in some countries no personal details are required to buy smaller amounts).

SW is onchain.

Lie. He proposed this change - which is far from "firmly believes XYZ is unsustainable".


Increase of the size of blocks in SW was done as a compromise with "big blockers" - Bitcoin Classic supporters at that time.


These people are greedy power hungry politicians, propagandists and businessmen blind to technical issues. They are pushing for a reckless hardfork which already resulted in community split and would result in chain split if they really attempt HF. 
HF is unnecessary at this point. SW extends block size; offchain scaling solutions are coming; ...and the sense of urgency is false anyway - created largely by people who don't care about Bitcoin. 


You - supporter of the reckless "solution" to an imaginary problem - calling something "Satoshi's version" is blatant effrontery.

You could have used '-w FILE' command line parameter to choose different wallet file.
There is no better way to combine the wallets into one that sending all the funds from the one you don't want to the one you want to keep (but still keep the seed of the old wallet forever - just in case...). 
So, take the wallet file ('electrum.dat') from the old wallet, copy it to 'electrum-old.dat', copy that to your wallet directory in electrum dir &amp; then start electrum with '-w electrum-old.dat' - from there, send all the bitcoins you have there to address (or addresses - you can use "send to many") that you have in the new wallet. 
Note that you can open also your new wallet to see the addresses (just run electrum without '-w' parameter together with the electructrum that uses '-w'...).
Edit: easier than getting the old wallet wallet file will probably be just restoring it from seed. So - start electrum with '-w electrum-old2.dat' - as that file doesn't exist, Electrum will ask you what you want to do - say there 'Restore from seed' &amp; use the seed of your old wallet to get access to those bitcoins by recreating your old wallet from the seed.

Czech Republic.


Looks like it works in families. I'm not sure if it scales to any bigger groups. Some of the worst problems here:
* activity and initiative was discouraged in people (to put it mildly);
* ruling party was corrupt, they were having access to western countries &amp; western goods and they had higher standard of living than all the rest;
* there was no freedom of speech - speaking against the regime led to losing job (and receiving some shitty job as everybody must "work" in communism!) + education denied to children + even lifelong wiretapping/following/interrogations and even prison;
* the environment led to society-wide immorality; snitching, stealing, hypocrisy;
* and perhaps the worst: central planners who "knew" everything - including how much toilet paper people will need, etc.; this led to economic tragedy - quality of life was low, only one type of fruit in stores in winter (or no at all), endless queues for everything (waiting 2+h for fruit or for meat or 10+ years for phone landlines or cars, most of spare parts for everything was unavailable for years...; I am in perpetual shock that we still let central planners mess with the arguably the most important thing: economy/finance. First they caused terrible crises, then they scared the hell out of people &amp; grabbed yet more power and they rule &amp; suck blood&amp;life out of us ever since.


There are shitty people among bitcoiners, too - but banksters/govsters are far more evil for sure.


I don't believe this in the slightest. It's also interesting that you mention this enslaving of the rest of the world by a handful of western states as something positive...




Maybe the greatest benefit of Bitcoin is that it is going to tear the current system down. I mean: that it will wake a lot of people from nothing-can-do-apathy and from blind trust in the system &amp; the charlatan vampire mandarins that are ruling over us thanks to our ignorance.

They are notorious for being unreliable - for their wallet they even generated private keys that were hacked thanks to weak/buggy random number generated ...and the block/tx info they present on their site is often wrong.
Just tell your users to use (also) different online blockchain explorer. And other wallet if they use BCI's wallet (it's unclear in your OP).
If you do transfer to your user, if you show them 3+ different blockchain explorers all showing exactly that the transfer happened as they requested - it should not be that much of a problem that BCI shows something else - as I said, BCI is unreliable.
Disclaimer: I hate them, because they pretend they are "blockchain". They have stolen one of the most important technical terms in Bitcoin &amp; used it for their company name and marketing.

I have experience with face-to-face buying:
1. you find seller
1. you accept the offer
1. bitcoins gets locked on his account (sort of between him and you)
1. you meet in some public place - cafe or something
1. in the moment you put money on the table, he presses "release bitcoins" - which will do 2 things: it will transfer bitcoins from his localbitcoin account to yours and it will show him the code that only you know (it was given to you when you were accepting the trade) ....so you don't need to log to localbitcoins at all to check that you received bitcoins - the code - if it is correct - is the proof that the seller released bitcoins
1. optionally you chat about your Bitcoin experiences.... :) ;)

So, you can't imagine a scenario when there are many newcomers (or new use cases like machine-to-machine transfers) &amp; demand for transaction "space" rises e.g. two-, three-, four-, five-fold? 
When we deal with scarce resource (be it bitcoins or transaction space in blocks) - even the two-fold increase in demand can push the price up ten-fold or more if the supply is forced to be constant.

Yes - with new Bitcoin Core version 0.12, transaction can be flagged as RBF. Then, if it is not yet confirmed, it can be completely replaced with other transaction (which sends bitcoins to different places even).


There is no way of knowing what the ideal fee should be (because block space is limited &amp; transactions are competing for it &amp; we can never know which new transactions will be coming in and what their fees will be)... - it is probably set quite low so users are not overpaying generally.


Yes, but the other one was also probably smaller (see 'Size' in block explorer) besides being luckier. In peer-to-peer system, nothing can be guaranteed (Will my transaction reach miners? or Will it be dropped by nodes because they have mempool already filled with transactions with higher fee? Or because they just do not like my coins? Will the next block come in next seconds or will it take more than an hour? Will there be any transaction in the new block? Will the next block be orphaned or not?)...

Wallets typically manage many addresses for you and new receiving address is generated when the previous is used - however the older receiving address should still be managed by the wallet and visible there. Can you check that? I.e. that you have *1GuRjB13aLSrW78eWVVVohtJc3SXqdQGyo* in your wallet. (List of addresses there or something like that.)
If you control that address you sent to (it is listed in your wallet) and you know that it received funds (looking at at least 2 blockchain explorers) - it is probably only your wallet that is confused... You can try some "rescan" options if there are some like that or you can try to switch it on &amp; off and maybe you can just wait (if Bither works like Mycelium that connects to server - maybe only the server you are connected to is lagging for some reason)...
You can also try to re-create your wallet (possibly on another device) from your seed... In worst case you should be able to get the private key for that address you sent to (providing it really is in your wallet) - and import it in other wallet (e.g. like Electrum) and send from it there.

That site says that with 0.10-0.20 uBTC/B you can wait up to 17 blocks. OP might be unlucky (or the inputs are too new - there were additional rules prioritizing bitcoins that weren't used for long time, but I don't know if it is still there)...

You can show us transaction IDs if you don't mind losing (a bit of) privacy - we might be able to see there something.

Don't sell unless you have a plan how the money will help you to improve your situation. If you have no such a plan &amp; you would be just delaying the fall it makes no sense to use those BTC - just try to forgot about them &amp; try to survive. 
Try to think outside the box - try to see other solution or try to change the place/environment - maybe there are some opportunities waiting somewhere else.
I expect that BTC will be 10 times more valuable in 10 years - but I might be (very) wrong... I would just try to keep myself exposed to that positive development - i.e. not selling BTC unless there is absolute need for that.

Lowest possible fee results in confirmation time of 24 to 72 hours. If the transaction is older than 72 hours &amp; unconfirmed, it is dropped from the network (it transaction is not in blockchain (==not confirmed) it means it didn't happen at all, BTC stay "in" the original address).
You can watch which transactions are waiting here (with their fees):

[CPU]( does calculations (which are required to verify all the transactions (their signatures) that happened in blockchain), [SSD]( is a storage device - it stores data &amp; makes them available (to CPU or other parts of the computer) when needed - general function is the same as of the old spinning hard drive disks however it is bases on memory chips, so it can retrieve some data faster - especially small &amp; fragmented pieces which usually helps a lot for the general run of the computer.
However - verification of bitcoin blockchain does not need heavy data write/read operations; it requires a lot of computation and not that much data available at any time. 
If you are new, it is good to try light wallet first. It's less privacy, but it's very convenient (synchronizes in seconds). Try Electrum or Mycelium (or both).

Bitcoin has largest security - orders of magnitude higher than the other coins. Some of those feats they have only because they are small - and will get them in problems if their coin grows. Also - no coin has all that you mentioned together. What matters too is stability - fast rising fast dying fads (hi primecoin, hi dogecoin, hi quark, ...) make no sense.

I don't buy this at all. The only way how can Bitcoin fail is if all the people get crazy &amp; start to believe that there is great urgency to rush any "solution" that emerges. It's a false sense of urgency - and you are adding to it, you are putting it into bigger risk (very slightly) that it would have been in otherwise. Let's not add to the FUD that is spread by the enemies.
I believe that Bitcoin is light years ahead of any other cryptos. It has great momentum, it has the best design - also the design of the design/change/update process. It is stable, it is adapting, it is visionary. It has great momentum behind it - very few outside our nerd community heard about other cryptos - and it has the brightest and most experienced people behind it because all of that.

Even if it is perfect, you lose the ability to find solutions - as you do not know how the word/phrase sounds like in the EN version of the program (which is most likely the original and most discussed version globally).

Bitcoin LN, sidechains and other Bitcoin scaling solutions (which are on "drawing boards" or in the works right now I would expect) will render LTC unnecessary. Even if those solutions are only castles in the sky, I am sure LTC is not ideal to be the "silver" people hallucinate about. If it ever happens that there is this dual solution: BTC + something, this something will hardly be nearly exact clone of BTC - "lower" level doesn't need all the records to be stored forever in the blockchain - or it doesn't need that much security (so POS coins will be better for that for example).

Pruned node is full node that just can't serve old blocks to neighbors. Otherwise it's full node - it had seen all blocks &amp; all transactions, it verified them all and therefore it can also fully verify new transactions and blocks that it is receiving and eventually rebroadcasting to peers.

I am in central Europe (200 km from Germany). "Our" currency (fiat backed by the violence of our national state against its own citizens) **lost 97 % of value over the last 30 years**. I clearly remember the prices before 1990... So - don't tell me about stability...

Supply and demand. If there are more people who want to buy than people who want to sell (at current price), price will go up - because people will be eating out sell orders near the current price and new sellers will see that they can ask higher price.
What is interesting is that there is no universal price - there are different prices at different places/conditions. 
For example - exchanges: Bitfinex stopped fiat withdrawals so there is higher demand for BTC as people use BTC to get their value out of Bitfinex =&gt; demand is slightly higher there =&gt; higher price than elsewhere. Many people have probably problem to get fiat to Btc-e =&gt; there is not enough fiat - which means demand is lower there =&gt; price is lower than on other exchanges. 
I am sure you would be seeing this pattern also at physical locations. Look at cash trades at localbitcoins - in some cities, I expect, the price is higher on average (maybe because their fiat is shit and spiraling to death and/or because Bitcoin is more useful and/or forbidden there).
Bitcoins can flow globally without any hurdles, however this is not true for fiat. If some areas are fiat-flow-wise severed from other parts of the world - it means that it is harder to even out the difference that area has in supply/demand ratio as compared to the rest of the world. ... If people in North Korea went suddenly very thirsty for bitcoins - the price will go up significantly there. This is because the supply from local sellers will not be much &amp; no sellers from outside will be able/wanting to join the market there because they will have no way to get fiat (or anything other valuable thing) out of that area. (And also people in North Korea have no way to get their fiat out to exchanges.)
Water bottle in desert is very different from the same bottle in ~~ocean~~ a lake. Value is always subjective and always location dependent. So price is too - because that relativity is there both for things that we buy and for things that we are buying them with.
Edit: ocean -&gt; lake

How do you know that? Maybe all users switch to Segwit soon (and miners will follow).


So, you are absolutely sure, that USAF will not have 51+% of mining power when it activates? Because that would be a bit naive. 
And reorg of few months?! If non-BIP148 has mining majority for weeks, people will likely switch back to Core (without BIP148).
I expect that if 90+% of users &amp; exchanges switch to BIP148 nodes, all else including miners will follow. Staying on a bit longer chain that has far less valuable tokens (and is not "in the spirit of Bitcoin" or "is not going with the most experienced team that is Core") is not that wise.

Here  you see how many transaction are waiting (in each fee bracket). Very good solution is to use Electrum dynamic fee ...but still compare with what you see on that page. You might realize that the dynamic fee set by Electrum is a bit high, so you can lower it a bit or the opposite - sometimes Electrum might not select enough fee for high priority transaction (if you need it high prio).
Even better allow "replaceable" in Electrum's menu and then check "replaceable" when you are sending the transaction - then you are free to bump the fee anytime you want (RMB on transaction in history and "bump fee").

You never know. 9 times out of 10 - or maybe 29 times out of 30, after such rise comes the fall. In the last single case, the rise is accelerating and continuing on for some more weeks - doubling, tripling, quadrupling the price, or even making it 8+ times higher.

It gets even more interesting if (non-human) agents can pay for this service by themselves.

As pb1x says it is good to enable RBF in Electrum - and then select "replaceable" when you are sending transaction. Then you can bump fee if needed.
If you are transferring to your own wallet &amp; you are not hurry it is fine to use small fee &amp; wait what happens. Either it goes through or it gets dropped in 72 hours &amp; you can retry then again...

Install Electrum (PC) or Mycelium/Breadwallet (mobile) - this will create your "account". More precisely: those wallets will generate your receiving address(es) and will also let you send bitcoins afterwards. CAUTION: make sure you write down the seed (that seed is your backup of the whole wallet on a paper).
Then, you can either buy something with bitcoins (e.g. games for you or friends on Steam or flights with Cheapair or hotels with Expedia or hardware with Overstock etc.) or you can sell bitcoins locally ( or you can use some exchange (see exchanges e.g. here:  - however this last option involves quite annoying of "registration" thanks to KYC-AML laws.

True for recent transactions (blocks) but not true for old transactions. See the presentation below - Pieter asserts that (currently) new full nodes that are being synchronized are not verifying signatures for transactions that are buried under sufficient amount of POW. He says that if someone is able to rewrite a year of blockchain, then it's all doomed anyway.
[Pieter Wuille: Segregated witness and its impact on scalability](
What is bad currently is that even if the full nodes do not need the old signatures for anything they still need to download those. SW SF enables nodes to ask for blocks without witness - this can save significant amount of bandwidth &amp; also make the spam problem you are talking about a non-issue.

Second, never ever is loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time. Maybe Bitcoin nearly dies now, has its last 5 4 3 2 users, but gets exhumed by software archeologists hundreds years from now &amp; becomes new fashion (and € is still around by some utter miracle). 
Third. Fiat currencies are goat shit. You are guaranteed to lose value. Unless there are some shenanigans with erasing zeroes, I am certain that 200 years from now, you will not be able to buy a single bread for 1300€...

New nodes can be faked easily. You can't easily "fake an old-node". Take the historical records from this page for example:
...and watch for the nodes that are there for months. If all those IPs switch to UASF you can quite safely assume that majority of non-faked full nodes switched.
And BTW, I wouldn't be supporting any other UASF - but Segwit UASF just feels like the right thing to do.

SW adjusts fees for different kinds of data so it reflects better how these data burden full nodes. Witness is cheaper because it will not burden full nodes as much as the rest of transaction data. (Witness part of old transactions is not required when new full node synchronizes - as we can be sure that witness was correct if those transactions are sufficiently buried in blockchain.)

They are refusing to do the change that is considered by many as the simplest and cleanest (and not particularly risky) solution now. Instead of that, they choose to keep the problem. 
They are adding new complicated logic that significantly changes how Bitcoin works. Maybe their solution is the best now - but there certainly is the danger that the company will be influencing the development so it can best sell its products/services (e.g. can't part of segwit's purpose be to enable sidechains they want to be selling?).

1. using xpub-s of those 5 people, generate 2 of 5; 3 of 5; 4 of 5 and 5 of 5 addresses. 
1. send the money to that 5 of 5. 
1. create a transaction that isn't usable for a period of time (using [locktime]( that sends from that 5 of 5 to that 4 of 5 (all five must sign). And another timelocked transaction that sends its output to that 3 of 5 address (4 must sign), ...
1. distribute transactions created in previous step to all those 5 people - so anybody of them can broadcast those transactions in right time so they can be included in blockchain doing the 5of5 -&gt; 4of5 or 4of5 -&gt; 3of5, ... shifts
Then, you have it as you want. Funds are in 5of5 and all must agree to use the funds. If the period of time passed &amp; there are 4 people agreeing, they first use the pre-prepared transaction to transfer funds from 5of5 to 4of5 and then they use the funds. If suddenly, 3 of 5 died just after setup, the remaining 2 must wait 1 period, use the transaction that transfers to 4of5, wait another period (or whatever was set in locktime there in this tx) to send the funds to that 3of5 address, another wait &amp; use the pre-prepared tx to transfer to 2of5 ...and then they can use the funds...
What would be interesting is if 1 died and there remain two groups of 2 fighting against each other. :D That would result in some kind of fee race (right in the moment when 3of5 -&gt; 2of5 transaction was or is being confirmed).
Edit: corrected [CLTV]( -&gt; locktime (*CLTV* transaction can be confirmed, but those bitcoins can't be used for some time; using *locktime* will prevent putting the transaction into blockchain before due time ...which is what we want)
Edit 2: maybe the whole thing above can be condensed into a single transaction - with output with custom script with several conditions: (5 must sign) OR (4 must sign AND [CLTV]( 1T) OR (3 must sign AND CLTV 2T) OR (2 must sign AND CLTV 3T)

They didn't. As you can see in that blockchain explorer, the 'double spend' was confirmed. I.e. they sent the bitcoins (which they made you believe will be yours) somewhere else. This might be malicious or unintentional. 




Please contact them, tell them that you didn't receive the payment and that you want them to do the payment (for real this time). Consider incoming bitcoins yours if the transaction sending to your address has 2+ confirmations (this usually takes 15 to 100 minutes - providing appropriate fee is used and the transaction isn't spending unconfirmed outputs of previous transactions).

Most of exchanges are also wallets (you have bitcoin and fiat account, trade is just atomic swap of both fiat and bitcoin between buyer's and seller's accounts).
One exception is bitcoin.de - if you buy bitcoins, you send fiat directly to seller's bank account. Seller then sends bitcoins through bitcoin.de - but the only purpose of this is that they subtract the service fee from it &amp; they patch it immediately directly to buyer.


Yes (e.g.:  Yes - do not store any significant amounts there. You have to be in control of the private keys to own the bitcoins, if 3rd party has your private keys, then you don't own those bitcoins - all you have is IOUs (I Owe You) - i.e. premises that they give you the bitcoins later.

There are many contributors to Core I am sure - many of which could contribute to other alternatives if these win. What matters is who decides and who influences the decision. There are very few people with commit rights, there is single person who decides at the end. I believe Blockstream influences the decisions a lot. Maxwell, Back - why they sound so arrogant? Why it feels they own Bitcoin? 
Also - the current model of governance is good for two things: vetoing any changes Blockstream doesn't want &amp; putting changes into contentious softforks which add unnecessary complexity and lead to strengthening of the position of Blockstream - shifting the system so they will be able to profit from it. Chamberlain's model is good - why would you be replacing it with Churchill? Nazis will eat continental Europe - but maybe the will be friends with us, right, so that's good for Bitcoin. No contentious war - I mean fork.


Segwit might be good, I wasn't researching it - what I know is that it will be a major change in structure of blocks (and also source of other problems - see here:  Change that will be pushed onto us with the abuse of the momentum that is building from reaching of the network capacity. Can't you just exclude the signature from the tx id calculation to fix malleability without the need of the other things that segwit is coming with? I would like to see segwit as cleaner code coming with a hardfork, not softfork - after we get hard fork to 2MB blocks which I understand is more simple to do.

The ability to resist the confiscation attempts (and there might be many in many different ways), the ability to hold an immense treasure - just in your memory. Bah, who needs that. Complete alternative to the entrenched vampire cartel. I agree, 0 value, who would mind that blood sucking. Everything is fine, they know what they do - they do what is best for us!


Fiat has final demand, right. Taxes will be always there. The violence will always be there - they will always be able to force you to use their worthless pieces of paper. Because they have the guns - you paid for.
Or maybe. Just maybe, people will become fed up with all the shit around. Operation chokepoints, wars on cash, diminishing freedoms, printing money, enslaving via debt.

Electrum is excellent wallet. Easy to use with also secure options ([offline storage]( [multisig]( even generation of seed with dice:
    electrum make_seed --entropy=&lt;RANDOM_SEQUENCE_OBTAINED_BY_DICE_ROLLS&gt;
). 
It generates infinitely many private keys from a seed phrase (13 words). So, the seed is the only thing you need to backup (on paper, in a safe location). The way it works is that it communicates with Electrum server which is running full bitcoin node &amp; sends relevant parts of Bitcoin traffic (transactions, blocks) to Electrum wallets that ask for it. 
Edit: dice

Bitcoin. You can see the same info in other [online blockchain explorers]( Bitcoin is a software that creates a network of nodes that send transactions and blocks between each other (transactions in blocks are confirmed - blockchain is in fact a shared ledger). 


Legit yes, a bit buggy though. 
Bitcoin is open - open source (you can see the code - i.e. exactly what it does when - [here]( and it is also open for participation - anybody can run the Bitcoin client to be the new node of the network. There is no center, everything works in this open decentralized/distributed way, everybody can join &amp; immediately see how it works ...and that it actually works. - Unlike OneCoin - they are just using the same jargon they saw in Bitcoin/cryptocurrency community, but are complete anti-thesis of Bitcoin - everything is closed, nothing works.


I wouldn't be describing all those as legitimate - anyone can create new coin by cloning existing clients/networks (as most of those are open-source in the same way as Bitcoin). But there are lots of coins that are not bringing anything to the table - a lot is probably motivated just with profit.
I always recommend to start the study here:
[Common Myths](
...it's better than watching dumbed-down videos. There are also many other interesting things in that wiki - e.g. [controlled supply]( or [blockchain]( or [transaction technical details]( etc.
OneCoin is just classic [Ponzi]( - they promise returns, but they aren't doing anything, they have no product, nothing - all just empty marketing &amp; scam.
You can read also [here]( (just click 'ch01.asciidoc', 'ch02.asciidoc', ...). Andreas is a prominent proponent of Bitcoin/cryptos, also his videos are worth watching.
Good luck with avoiding scams (there are many also in Bitcoin world itself). Be careful, have fun.

No. Deflation is natural while inflation is unnatural, drug-like short-time kick that is also immoral as it steals value from (poor) people and puts it into hands of banksters.


This is a quite significant and quite usual misconception - instead of "no one spends because it is growing in value" (you are never buying mobile phones or computers because they go down in value and will be cheaper later, right), it is: "no one is taking all their crypto money to the grave" - or at least not all. 
Also it's: "once you met your target in value of your BTC savings, you get spending BTC more" - when the new car would be only 1 % of your savings, instead of 80 %, you go and buy it - regardless of the fact that it might end being only 0.5 % of the savings or less some years ahead. You just invest in things once they cost significantly small fraction of your savings. 
Also, even if BTC grows in value for extended periods of time, there would still remain the danger that it will go down - this amount of risk is being also factored in. I am nearly sure that BTC will grow in value, but I also know that there is some risk that if will not - so I will spend some fraction of BTC - just to not regret not doing it when I knew about the risk...

My knowledge is very limited, but basically it's (proposed) network running "on top of Bitcoin" or "alongside Bitcoin" - network that will allow instant payments by using a special Bitcoin technology called payment channels. 
Participants open the channel, then they do instant transactions in it and after potentially many transactions, one of the sides decides to settle the combined result of many lightning transfers on/to Bitcoin blockchain. Also A can send to D if there are channels from A to B and from B to C and C to D.
The purpose is to enable usage of Bitcoin while overcoming some of its limitations. Relatively small amount of transactions can be stored in blockchain itself (so we can keep decentralization &amp; censorship resistance) - so to enable Bitcoin use for tens of millions of people or more, we need these additional layers.

I think the explanation of mining should contain the purpose of it (besides creation of new coins) - it's a way how the whole network which is center-less/open-for-anyone/with-no-governing-authority can agree what happened. I.e. it's a way to solve the double spend problem in which you "can" pay the same bitcoins to two different people/nodes. The lucky miner creates the new page in the universally shared and accepted ledger book. A page which is immensely hard to create, but very easy for all who receive it to verify - so it can be quickly shared over the whole planet.

Deflation is naturally happening when money is scarce. And I believe money should be scarce - it should be honest and fair, it should have limited amount. It should not be centrally planned by some crooks to "keep our prices at same level" or to "stimulate the economy". 
Central planning is bad (I being from former Easter bloc - ask me how our shops looked like thanks to central planning during communist era here (they knew what we needed you know...) - how we had to beg sellers in shops to hide some sort of "rare" goods under the counter for us; how there was no toilet paper at times, how we had bananas or oranges or melons once a year...; how it looked like when shops had literally tens of different goods - not tens of thousands like now, not thousands, not hundreds ...all the regals filled with just one kind of one good) , enforcing usage of single currency and stomping down on all alternatives is bad, period. 
Inflation is like cocaine or crack - it boosts the economy in short time (yeah, which might be a few decades), but it leads later or sooner to a big disaster. Cheap credit leads to overheating and malinvestments and it is destined to crash. 
Mind you, economy without money manipulation crashes too - and often - but not nearly as hard as when the interest rates and the amount of currency are manipulated by some mandarins (manipulated also for their own profit).
They force us at gunpoint to use their rigged "money" - well, not money, it's just rigged currency. I refuse to obey.

51 % of hashrate could agree on these two:
* segwit must be activated,
* (therefore, as pro-segwit hasrate is not over 95 %) all non-segwit blocks must be made orphaned...
If majority of hashrate refuses to build upon non-segwit blocks, you will have blockchain with only pro-segwit blocks (i.e. not 95 %, but 100 % of blocks will be pro-segwit if 51+ % of hashrate does the above).

You can imagine Bitcoin addresses as transparent lockers - everybody can see what is inside (and also people can also throw things in), but only one unknown person has the key - only that person can unlock the locker and use what is inside.
Bitcoin blockchain is in fact a ledger - there is a record of all transactions that happened - in a form address A sends to address B some amount of bitcoins. Everybody can see that, but only one person has the private key that allows transferring from address B elsewhere.
Electrum seed is very large number (encoded as 12 or 13 words) - from it, unlimited amount of your private keys is generated (each private key is also a very large number). So - from one seed, you (re-)generate your wallet with many addresses (each address has its own private key).

hashing is not encryption, it's creating a "digest" (which represents the original data and has some interesting properties - like that it looks random and that you can't reconstruct the original data from it ...which is the difference from encryption)


No. Transactions are not "hashed into" block. Block is created by collection transactions, appending headers and what not. What is being hashed during mining is the whole block - i.e. miner tries to find a block hash (by altering some numbers inside the block or adding/removing transactions, etc.) that meets the target (difficulty) criteria. 
Hash function is used here because it gives us good "lottery" properties - you can't start with hash (that meets criteria) and build a block that has this hash somehow "from" it. You must take block candidate, perform (double SHA-256) hashing and then look at the resulting hash and determine if it meets the target criteria (imprecisely "if it has enough zeroes at the beginning"). Most likely it doesn't - so you slightly change the block, do calculate the result of the double hash function and check again. And this again and again, billion times per second.


GPUs are not used in Bitcoin mining - for 4 good years already. (Special purpose computers called ASICs are designed and built for the job.)

Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context.

Don't panic &amp; buy fixed fiat amount worth of BTC in fixed periods (AKA cost averaging) - e.g. buy $100 worth of BTC every 14 days. This should be your main plan - it shields you from volatility (good for nerves as you don't need to follow and react to price changes) and it allows you also to get into good security practices before you accumulate a big sum.
If you have some extra fiat (besides the plan above), you can direct it into BTC, too - but be sure you don't spend anything that you can't afford to lose. BTC can go to $200 overnight, your backups can be destroyed in fire or your computer could be hacked and your BTCs could be stolen.

Changing very small portion of the input data (even a single bit) results in completely different hash.

    $ echo "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" | md5sum

If you have linux, you can try for yourself - try changing characters in that string so you reach "00" or "000" at the beginning of the hash... It's just random guessing, right.

What BTC actually is and how the comics misrepresented it?
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:46:21
For each address that you want to send "from", you have to be in control of the private key (that was also originally used to generate that address). If you have the private key for the address, you can send bitcoins that are "in" that address.
Usually, private keys are managed by your wallet program so you don't need to do anything besides clicking send button. 
Nowadays, wallets generate many private keys (and addresses for each) from a single 12+ word phrase called **seed**. So, your wallet software allows you to (re-)create your wallet (and all private keys in it) and to send bitcoins "from" your addresses - just by entering the seed. (I.e. knowing the seed is all you need to get access to your BTC.)
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:45:42
You will find out some years from now... You can rebuy slightly more than 2 BTC now - but will you do it?.. It might go down still or it may flip fast and you will not get chance to buy lower than you sold.

Private key is **not** posted in the transaction. However, public key is posted in the transaction and also the transaction is signed with the private key. Then, full nodes verify these things:
* signature was created using (hidden) private key that corresponds to the public key (that was revealed in the transaction) - see [here](
* BTC address that we send BTC "from" was derived from the public key (that was originally derived from the private key) - see [here]( - for extra security, Bitcoin doesn't use public keys for reception of bitcoins, instead, public key is hashed twice with SHA-256 and then once with RIPEMD and once again with SHA-256 - this makes it impossible for would-be-attackers to get to public keys
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:24:25
Ok, I'll bite although my understanding is a bit vague here.


Yes, of course. Segwit was a softfork, so everything made by new clients must look valid to older nodes - (otherwise these nodes would split from the rest of the network).


Yes, if you created invalid segwit transaction, old nodes would not be able to recognize that there is something wrong with it &amp; so they will be happily broadcasting it most likely. 


No. Consensus is about the rules that work - or that are used for validation - in the network. Older nodes use less strict rules, but since new nodes and all miners use the new (more strict) rules, all is fine. Just old nodes are not able to see all invalid things - but as in case of segwit - old nodes are not receiving transfers with segwit transactions it doesn't matter that much. One problem could be when old node is sending invalid transaction to new node - but new nodes probably understand that old nodes are not able to fully validate, so they will most likely not ban them for what they couldn't possibly be able to known.
Also, most important here is that all miners must be using the new rules - if one miner would be creating blocks that are not valid in new rules (but are valid in old, less strict rules), blocks of this miner would be orphaned and node of this miner would be banned by peers for transmitting invalid blocks.


How could you know that some node didn't send you some certain transactions? You can't possibly recognize that and you can't therefore use it as basis for your banning actions.
Important thing is whether some nodes are sending blocks invalid in new rules. If yes, nodes with new rules (some of these will be mining nodes) would be rejecting these blocks - so these old rule blocks would be orphaned. This because miners mining with new rules have majority of hashpower. 
If that was not true and miners with old rules had majority of hashpower, new-rule transactions and new-rule blocks would still be valid for old nodes and miners, but new-rule nodes would be cutting themselves off from the old nodes and miners - which would result in a chainsplit which is kind of similar like with hard fork. However, there is the difference: after introducing softfork (which is by definition backward compatible), there is nothing that would cause old-rule nodes to cut themselves off from the network. So, softforks might be problematic for the group that is introducing the fork (new rule node, new rule miners to some extent) but it is not problematic for the old rule nodes.
Hardforks however are far more dangerous as ALL old full nodes must upgrade or they will have problems. As soon as the new rule nodes start enforcing the new rules and the new rule miners mine the new rule blocks, old nodes will be banning all the new rule nodes - effectively cutting themselves off off the network.

How do you mean "stolen"? When you send BTC to address A, the worst that can happen is that also 2X tokens will go to A - which is not stealing, it's you sending both coins basically. Either the recipient (and the sender) will count with this or sender can take some pain and split BTC and 2X coins to different addresses first. This will be possible to do and I suspect it will not be that hard. Probably exchanges will do that for you.

One of the reasons is that you have time to test how it all works and you have time to research the best solution for you security- and usage-wise.

Use Electrum, manually set fee to like $0.2 and enable "Replaceable" (RBF). Increase the fee then in case your transaction is not confirmed in your needed timeframe (if you can wait some days which you can if you do transfers between your wallets, especially consilidating inputs, you can save **significantly** on fees as there are windows during nights and weekends when the network is far less busy).

Yes. The split happened on 1^st of August if I recall correctly. At that point, all BTC balances (in Bitcoin blockchain) were mirrored into BCH balances "in" the same addresses (in BCH blockchain)... BCH basically started with BTC blockchain at that point.
You need to import your keys into some BCH wallet. It is recommended to move your BTC to different addresses first (so BCH software cannot steal it if it is malicious).

Use Electrum wallet. Depending on your OS and your practices with remote access software and with installing non-reputable software, your hot wallet on online PC could be ok with up to $300-worth of BTC. 
When you have more, you can spend a day to study and use this: [Electrum cold storage]( (besides your hot wallet on online PC, you generate and use your main savings wallet on computer that has no access to/from internet) - that would be quite safe - I would trust this setup with up to $10,000-worth of BTC.

First, if you mean offline, then there is no such thing as "internet would be used for" offline means no network at all. 
Second, you don't need SSD, any disk (or even only flash USB) will do. 
When using Electrum as cold wallet, you generate your cold wallet on the offline machine and then put seedless version of it on your online machine. In seedless online wallet you create transaction, then you bring it to offline machine somehow (USB disk, scanning with camera or whatever that is not network), there you sign it in your cold wallet and then you bring the signed transaction back to online machine and broadcast it from it.

* cash is not (trivially) traceable, they can't know how much you have, they can't know when and who you pay to (and for what)
* you and only you are in control of it - you have it in your pocket, no bank employee can block/take it, no authorities can block/take it without direct physical confrontation
* cash is immediately available (if you decide to have it in your (hot) wallet)

@_date: 2017-09-04 13:45:45
First - fees don't depend on amount sent, fees depend on the size of the transaction (measured in bytes).
Upgrade to latest Electrum. Enable RBF (so you have "Replaceable" checkbox when creating transaction (after clicking 'Send')) and enable manual fee setting in options.
Then, you can click Send and you can manually make the fee smaller (you can set it very low as RBF gives you the option to increase the fee of unconfirmed transaction later).
If you watch [this]( few times a day you will see that even transactions with fee under 20 sat/byte are being confirmed - so set the fee accordingly - and increase it later if needed.
Note that in case you have many inputs, the transaction is bigger (measured in bytes) and the fee would need to be higher. (It is best to consolidate inputs during low traffic periods with ultra-low-fee tx.)

Using OP_RETURN is just one way how to put arbitrary data into blockchain. Other way to do it is to encode the information into addresses - you can create valid BTC address (without private key) from your data encoded into base 58, starting with 1 and with checksum appended. Not sure how or whether this was used for important data, though.
The question is whether you really need to have smaller blockchain. Will it really save significant portions of bandwidth for nodes that are doing the initial syncing? (Note you can bootstrap blockchain in new node manually from DVD or other media for example.) If it is not about bandwidth but only about space used on disk, you already have pruning implemented in Bitcoin (Core) that can keep the blockchain under 1 GB...
So, it is probably (far) more simple (and still acceptable) to leave blockchain as is and just to improve the ways how it is synchronized (especially for pruning nodes) and stored.

Yes, if the problem is only the firewall (and not persecution on local level through ISPs or other means), then it is enough when one node inside gets the new block - then all the others can synchronize from it (or from nodes that synchronized from it) - which is the normal operation of Bitcoin network - new blocks are broadcasted to all connected nodes.
For sending transactions - either the connection to local miners would be required (who are required to be connected to other parts of Bitcoin network) or at least one node would need to be able to send transaction through/around the firewall (new transactions would be broadcasted to all nodes inside the area that is cut off from the rest of the network and then at least one node must be able to push the transaction to the rest of the network where it will get mined eventually).

If you use private key on online machine you might compromise it (somebody from internet can hack the online machine or the web service and steal the private key and the BTCs that are in its corresponding address). That's the reason why paper wallets exist in the first place - so their private key is not exposed to internet bad guys.
Just use the bitcoin address (starts with "1" or "3") if you want to deposit more to that paper wallet. If you want to spend from the paper wallet (usually all bitcoins are used and eventually sent after that to new paper wallet), scan private key QR code ("import private key" or "sweep") with mobile wallet like Mycelium or Breadwallet ...that's the easiest way.

You shouldn't (for privacy reasons mainly) use 1 receiving address more than once. If you do it like this, it means that for each addresses of yours there will be only one "piece" of bitcoin in each of them. 
This "piece" is called *output* of previous (incoming) transaction - and it will become *input* of the (spending, outcoming) transaction if you spend that bitcoins (i.e. send those to any adress - either yours or not). 
When you spend, the amount that you were sending is going to the address you designated and the rest (the rest of that "piece") is going (in that sending transaction) into your new *change* address. This change address is quite similar to *receiving* address - but your wallet (generates it and) uses it automatically.

So, basically you want to do DCA ($4000 worth of BTC over 40 days), but you want to do it more clever by buying more on dips and less on highs, right?
The problem with this is that you could miss your $4000 / 40 d target - imagine that the price goes up and up and up - classical DCA will buy say $1000 worth every 10 days regardless of price. Your system will say "hey, price is too high" (because the price went up), "I buy only $750 in that 10 days. But the rally continues and in next days your system buys again only $750 / 10 days and again and again (if the rally is long) - and you will find out that you bought only $3000 instead of $4000 ...and therefore you missed some cheap coins and your profit is smaller that it could have been with simple DCA. (Buying the last $1000 worth at the end helps nothing as you would be buying the most expensive coins as of yet.)

It's nearly impossible that you mistype address and have other valid address. (There is 4 byte checksum in addresses - so that means that typos (it would need to be more, single typo will not be enough) will lead to correct address only in 1 case in 4 billions). So, if you mistype, your wallet will immediately throw error &amp; won't let you send BTC.
What can happen however is that you copy &amp; paste wrong address. After pasting you should triple-check that the address is really yours and not some other address that you copied in the mean time. (Also some malwares might be trying to alternate BTC-address-like strings in clipboard/browser.)

It's very hard to tell something about adoption in pseudonymous money. Businesses and politicians (and large investors) should not be making rules. It's too easy for them to spam all fora and media with their (e.g. "all users now use 2X", "2X is Bitcoin", etc.) propaganda.
Also, in case core team yields it sets very dangerous precedent - the following year they will come again that they want 4X and the year after that they will want to make KYC/AML mandatory (because authorities will be threatening them to restrict/close their business WRT Bitcoin) or some other utter shit like that. 
Those are people who weren't at the beginning, they weren't pushing for Bitcoin adoption and improvements when it was laughable to all. They came when  they were able to profit. They do not have Bitcoin in their hearts, it's not about freedom for them - it is about money. If they suck Bitcoin dry and leave it dead on the side of the road they wouldn't blink twice - they would just switch to other alt or they will even create their currency so they can profit more.
I say f*ck off to businesses/politicians who push for contentious HF (and unnecesary HF in these circumstances)!

They will chicken out, don't worry. Miners follow money. Current Bitcoin will have more in fees than 2X.
Also, some portion of that hashrate might be miners who fake the support - who just wanted to activate segwit and now will withdraw their support (or will not have to if whole 2X folds).

Math. Those spaces are so humongous that the probability of one number coming twice when randomly generated is veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery close to impossible (seed is just a very long number encoded as words). 
If it wasn't like that it would be trivial to add one two or three more words at the beginning of the design of wallets - add one word and you make it 2048 times less probable, add two and it becomes 4194304 times less probable:
	2048^1
	2048
	2048^2
	4194304
	2048^3
	8589934592
	2048^4
	17592186044416
...so it would be trivial to make it harder to get collision by random generation.
...however, it is not needed, as I said, 
	2048^12
	5444517870735015415413993718908291383296
is already more than enough. (You are free to use longer seed if you are scared though.)
The same is for length of BTC addresses - it would be easy to make them longer in original design (i.e. make the number space where these are from far far bigger), but it is simply was and is not needed. It was calculated so the probability of two people getting the same is really zero.

If the transaction is not yet confirmed you should be able to create and broadcast your transaction that is spending the same bitcoins (AKA doublespend). Your wallet will probably not allow you to send it, but you can import the private key into other wallet (say Electrum) - and then it either will be able to broadcast the transaction or you should be able to save the transaction as file &amp; post it to some tx-broadcast page (like [this](

No. That would be design document and specification. Whitepaper just presents the core idea. Many shitcoins use exactly what is in the whitepaper - they should be taken as Bitcoin any time some CEOs meet behind closed doors?
Also, there is no trace of limiting number of the coins. If you want to pass the whitepaper as the only specification (and all the following code and the spirit that Satoshi gave it as irrelevant) you would be able to change number of coins and what not. Guess what - Bitcoin is designed exactly to resist this - to be able to resist (crazy) will of some mandarins - some politicians and CEOs of yours.

The theory is I heard that you don't want to increase blocks (required bandwidth especially for nodes in developing parts of the world).
Then, with blocksize halved and blocktime halved, you have more orphans, slightly less space (more headers) and the security is not improved (2x more confirmations would be needed to have same security for given tx).

When mining gets unprofitable for all miners, some miners drop off, difficulty adjusts and then the remaining miner's operations become profitable again.
@_date: 2016-09-27 07:53:00
1) Yes.
2) - 6) You speak about miners, not nodes per-se. (Full nodes aren't miners, usually.) Full nodes are receiving transactions and blocks from peers, they verify that that transaction/block confirms to rules and if it does it is broadcasted to (other) peers.


"spent transaction" is weird wording - we speak about spent transaction *outputs*. No transaction in block can spend *outputs* that are already spent otherwise the block is not correct and will not be accepted by (nodes in) the network. (Note: we speak about *outputs* of previous transactions which are called *inputs* in our transaction.)


No. It's the same as lottery - some people buy thousands of tickets, but people who bought just one also win sometimes. The bigger hashing power the bigger chance to get a block, but you can still be extremely lucky and find a block with very weak HW (like normal CPU).

If you are familiar with Electrum, this is one of easier options for you (&amp; very secure):
Either boot your computer into Linux without networking or find old unused computer that will not connect to internet again &amp; create your Electrum wallet there. The point is to keep the private keys (which are in wallet generated from the seed) and the seed somewhere where it is not possible for it to be stolen from the internet. Then you just need to test with smaller amount first &amp; then keep your seed secure (3,2,1: 3 backups, 2 different media, 1 offsite).
Alternatively, wallets on phones that are not rooted are secure too. Use Mycelium or Breadwallet, ideally on older smartphone that is not used for anything else. Also test with smaller amounts first and keep your seeds written on paper &amp; safe.

Technical reason is that bigger blocks lead to centralization dangers. Blocks are already quite big (special network for miners is required) and will be larger when Segwit fully kicks in.

I don't regard the ability to buy tiny things with cash as one of its important features.
Defining features of cash are these (for me):

*    cash is not (trivially) traceable, they can't know how much you have, they can't know when and who you pay to (and for what)
*   you and only you are in control of it - you have it in your pocket, no bank employee can block/take it, no authorities can block/take it without direct physical confrontation
*    cash is immediately available (if you decide to have it in your (hot) wallet)

Current Bitcoin (current Bitcoin chain) will never die - even if it gets 20 times slower than it is now. There will always be people who believe that Bitcoin (core) team is better than dev teams (or dev individuals) of all the other would-be-Bitcoins (XT, Classic, Unlimited, BTC1/2X,...). 
Among these are many of the early adopters who will be dumping 2X coins and who will be buying more BTC. Also the normal users will lose confidence in 2X as soon as the bugs start to emerge (and there were many in Unlimited). =&gt; 2X will be losing value and BTC will get significant portion of the hashrate back (also because of the fees).


2X will never get 90% support of users (who run full nodes). And as explained above - 90 % of hashrate doesn't matter much (unless it wants to do suicidal 51% attack). Users are not following miners. Miners are following money.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:59:33
No. 
It is impossible to tell where the bottom is. You might get lucky once or twice, but if you try to sell always before it goes down you will realize that you are losing. Big players are trying to induce panic (they sell so the price falls down, they create fake news &amp; they pay trolls)  and make people sell.
If you believe in Bitcoin, do (dollar) cost averaging: buy every month with fixed fiat amount &amp; forget about the price. It really is good for the nerves &amp; long term it will get you more value than when you try to time the market.

Why not to put gun to peoples heads and order them to spend everything they have immediately? Inflation does that in a way.


Loans are stupid. Companies can get capital by IPOs - i.e. with their savings, people can buy shares in companies.


Only to some extend. However, this effect is stronger if a lot of cheap credit was loaned already. It's like cocaine hungover. Yeah, cocaine might be interesting to get more productive in short bursts - but you absolutely should not overdo it. If you pump trainloads of newly printed "money" into the economy every second, what you get is overextension - artificially pumped (mal)investments, something that can't stay for long (without pumping even more "money" and making it worse in the long run) and will inevitably burst - sooner or later.

Segwit is new format of transaction that was activated in Bitcoin network. 2X is an attempt to create new version of Bitcoin that would be incompatible with the current Bitcoin - so, a separate network that would attempt to steal the name Bitcoin for itself; network that will be more controlled by big companies, more vulnerable to coercion and lot more buggy (1 dev for 2X, 100 current Bitcoin devs (that also strongly oppose 2X)).
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:08:50
Single value that has deep implications. Full nodes are already too resource hungry - even people in 1st world are not running those. Also, this "single value" change means that every single node in Bitcoin network would be required to upgrade (or else it would be cut off completely) - this is very problematic and should not be forced unless there are very very good reasons to do so.
Original Segwit is already a compromise as it effectively rises the blocksize.
Letting corporations to force bullshit changes like this is like if passengers in a plane forced the pilot to fly at 500 m instead of 12000 m. Because why not - they want to have close view of the mountains!

Not that clean, but ways how to split coins safely will be found &amp; described for normal users.
From technical network standpoint, once 2X nodes produce block with (base) size over 1 MB they will fork themselves off of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin nodes will ban those and the two networks will become independent.

Watch this: 
to get a general feeling how busy is the network. Some miners were mining BCH for some hours so BTC blocks were coming slower. It will be better soon - BCH shitcoin changed difficulty again in their idiotic diff oscillation plus BTC network is generally less busy over EU+US nights and over weekends.
* fee depends on the size of transaction - consolidate your inputs when network is not busy (you have 3 inputs so your transaction is bigger than it needed to be - so it has lower priority with the absolute fee that you picked); 
* use wallet that lets you pick what inputs you want to send (e.g. Electrum);
* use wallet that lets you set manual fee to low value and then increase the fee if needed (e.g. Electrum with RBF enabled);
* you can do CPFP if your transaction is really urgent (which probably isn't with $0.5 fee) and if you didn't use RBF.

It has nothing to do with Segwit. The only thing that matters there is when the chainsplit happened (i.e. when the hard fork happened due to BCH miners creating block that was incompatible with/for BTC nodes).
If the 2X chainsplit really happens (I doubt they will pull it off) and if you will have BTC before that split, you will have both BTC and 2X coins.

Use Electrum, set fee very low manually &amp; enable replace by fee. If the tx is not confirming fast enough, increase the fee. Note that a lot of transactions does not need priority - if you transfer from your wallet into your other wallet you can wait a day or two for it to confirm, etc.

There is no such thing as "Segwit chain" - you talk about Bitcoin blockchain. In Bitcoin blockchain, there are old-style transactions and new-style segwit transactions. 
You ask whether you should create segwit wallet (with segwit addresses) and whether you should send there your BTC so your transactions are cheaper in the future... 
\- the answer is: probably not (unless you have your bitcoins in many pieces (i.e. if you received those in many incoming transactions and didn't move them since)).

Bitcoin is an entry in a ledger (distributed ledger called Blockchain). There, bitcoins are represented as *outputs* of previous transactions. Transactions usually send existing bitcoins (they have inputs that are outputs of previous transactions), however miners are allowed to add one extra transaction (called *coinbase* transaction) to the block - where they create new bitcoins (block reward) - i.e. they create a transaction that doesn't have inputs, but that does have outputs.


Transactions send bitcoins in arbitrarily sized pieces (e.g. 3.253 BTC, 0.001254 BTC, 1000 BTC, etc.) - each transaction output has BTC value. Bitcoin (or fraction of bitcoin or bitcoins) is that value.

You can rebalance at random times - that will work too, or you pick the interval between rebalances. It might be an hour, a day or a week or a month or even a year. You choice completely - but as I said, longer intervals will miss short term oscillations (however big they are) but you get more if there are slow swings up/down; on the other hand, short times between rebalancing allows you to get advantage of short oscillations but you will get less from the slow changes in price (if it goes 10 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 30 -&gt; 40 -&gt; 50 -&gt; 60 -&gt; 100 in course of a week but you are rebalancing every day, you will rebalance at 20 (that will leave you with less BTC) at 30 (that will leave you with less BTC) etc. which is worse than single rebalancing at 100 only if you do only 1 rebalancing per week  .... but on the other hand, if it goes 10 -&gt; 80 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 120 -&gt; 30 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 20 you would be better off if you were rebalancing every day as you will catch all these up/down).

You can't have secure decentralized currency that confirms in seconds. Bitcoin was not designed for hop in, pay, hop out purchases in physical stores.

Not necessarily, but it starts to be clear when they act like you do (pushing for unsafe unneeded solutions in the most disruptive way for the whole thing/movement). Divide and conquer, I get you. Bitcoin will survive, you will not.


Of course there is a possibility that I am wrong. I was wrong when I was a big blocker. I do understand well enough that BTC1 or ABC or what is it is the next one in long row of attempts to disrupt Bitcoin.


It is not. It is limiting (some less important usage modes in that), but not "choking" (not choking usage at all - go back to the whitepaper and think what Bitcoin is here for). Choking is a loaded word and you try to pass it into the debate as fact.
Also it's not 1 MB anymore BTW. Scaling will come when needed - and not from you and your ilk.

I downvote as this sounds like concern trolling. 
Few days ago, fees were under 40 sat/b. It will come to that soon again. 
Usually fees are higher thanks to spam attacks (which are getting less and less frequent and more expensive) and currently also because significant portion of hashrate was [mining]( the BCH shitcoin (so blocks were slower temporarily - which is not completely bad - less BTC is mined so the price is pressured a bit to go up).

You are not dumb - if you are able to form a question...
Replay protection means that transaction that was made for one chain (e.g. BTC chain) can't be used as-is to send tokens in some other chain (e.g. BCH chain).
After BTC-BCH chainsplit, private keys that people have and addresses remained the same for both, however, BCH client (software that runs full nodes) refuses ordinary BTC transactions - you have to use BCH client (or e.g. Electron cash light client that was cloned from Electrum) to send BCH. And also, when you send BCH, this transaction is not sending BTC - as this transaction is invalid for Bitcoin nodes.
If 2X happens (and I doubt that those donkeys will pull it off) and if it will not have replay protection, it will mean that when you send your BTC from address A0 to address A1, anybody will be able to send this transaction to 2X node and after it gets mined in 2X chain it will mean that your transaction also moved 2X tokens from A0 to address A1 (both in 2X chain).
However, there still are ways how to "split the coins". This means that you send A0 -&gt; A1 in first chain, and A0 -&gt; A2 in second chain using some technical tricks. I am sure some exchanges will be doing this for their users as already happened with ETH-ETC split (you send pre-fork BTC and you receive after-fork BTC and the other tokens in separate accounts in your account on the exchange).

Sure - as soon as 2X miner creates a block that is incompatible with Bitcoin rules, 2X nodes transmitting that block will be banned. 
If users keep running any version of Bitcoin (Bitcoin core v0.14 or even older), 2X will be just a distraction outside of the Bitcoin network, no senseless blocksize increase will happen in Bitcoin.
Advantage of running 0.15 is that you don't waste your bandwidth helping syncing 2X nodes that strive to fork off - nodes that you know will sooner or later do something that you (your Bitcoin client) will find unacceptable, something that is against the rules and against the whole Bitcoin philosophy that significant (back incompatible) changes needs to be done with consensus - with broad agreement in the community.

@_date: 2017-10-18 18:52:56
Pro-tip: you can "harvest" volatility - sell when it goes up and buy when it goes down. This can be e.g. done by rebalancing to keep the same ratio (1:1 or 1:8 or whatever you choose) between worth of your fiat and fiat-worth of your BTC. 
E.g. if you have $5300 in fiat now and 1 BTC ($5301 worth now), then price of BTC goes down to $1000, you rebalance so your current sum of value ($5300+$1000) is evenly distributed - so you buy 2.15 BTC and will have then $3150 in fiat and 3.15 BTC ($3150) ...so you have your 1:1 ratio again. Then, BTC goes miraculously back to $5301 ...then you will have $19848!(3.15*5301+3150)
You can do the rebalancing any time - if you do it more frequently you can take advantages of shorter spikes but you will harvest less from bigger changes that are slower and vice versa. 
If there will really be a lot of volatility (price swings up and down), the above will both give you profit and help stabilize the price (a tiny bit).

You are doing it wrong then. Use Electrum, hand-pick inputs if you do high-priority transaction - you want 1 input and 1 input only. You should consolidate your inputs in low fee low priority transaction (under 20sat/b). Set fees in Electrum manually to very low value, enable "Replaceable" (RBF), increase fee when needed.

Personally, I don't see two discrete and opposing things here. I think speculation is always present also in "serious investing" to some degree... ...always the judgment of the investor can be misled; wrong assumptions can be used; etc. I think that even expecting that things will be the same tomorrow if they were the same yesterday is a speculation in itself. When you say "serious investing" - maybe you mean investing where the risk is calculated and seemingly low ...(?)... but still, black swan(s) might come and show that what we thought was low risk was in fact quite different.
Also, I don't believe there is such a thing as "intristic" value. Value is always subjective and always it depends on the circumstances. Value of bottle of water would be different for a guy who is dying of thirst in the middle of the desert and different for drunk Russian - when he finds that same water bottle floating in Baykal (largest reservoir of drinkable water on Earth)... And what if it was heavy water? It might be 100x more valuable than diamonds of the same weight ...for people who can appreciate having pure heavy water (i.e. termo-nuclear fusion engineers)...


I admire your ability to write it like this. Not many people are willing to admit that their views changed because they realized something.


This is often overlooked, but I find this to be one of the greatest things about Bitcoin - that it forces people to think about the current system. ...What is money? ...Why is somebody controlling it? ...How is somebody controlling it? ...Why are they doing what they are doing and why and how are they explaining it to as as they do? ...Can there be any alternatives? ...What can I do as a small person in all this? Etc., etc. Before BTC I was like: "meh, financial system is shit (pardon the language - I am not native speaker obviously), but nothing can be done" ... now I am like: "wow, we have alternative, we have options, we have a power to innovate and to change the world!".


Sale yes, I am not sure about "short sale" - that would mean you would need to **borrow** fiat currency first and then convert it to BTC, right. But maybe it was not meant literally (just expression of the fact that people buying BTC expect fiat to go down (relatively to BTC)), right.


Or far higher... Market cap is not what was paid in total, market cap is what would be the price of all the available units at given time - which comes from the willingness of sellers to sell at given price. A bit hypothetically - if all BTC users suddenly realize that Bitcoin is far more useful than they thought (maybe some global conspiracy of banks will be revealed or news will break that American officials are stockpiling Bitcoin, because they know a global financial meltdown is imminent), the price can jump 10 times up without any trades in-between. 


This is because governments immediately attack any (serious) attempts. See Liberty Reserve, Liberty Dollar, e-gold. Bitcoin is immune to such attacks thanks to peer-to-peer technology (based on BitTorrent that is unstoppable also).

If you have replay protection you are - with your new chain - separated from the original chain. This is clean. 2X don't want to be separated, they want to suppress the old chain/client/network and take it over. This is messy and an attack on Bitcoin and users outright (as there is no consensus - they don't have (nearly) unanimous consent/support of users for the hard-fork change).

How many inputs? (What size of the transaction in bytes?) Did you manually select just one input for your transaction?
Also these estimates might be incorrect. I'm not using that estimation in Electrum, but e.g. [21]( is notoriously recommending higher fee than is really needed. Better is to use [this]( (but it might give you too optimistic advice in case the network is getting more busy)... And as I said - set fee in Electrum to (very) low, enable "Replaceable" and increase the fee if needed.
For priority transactions, you should be using maximally 1 input and ideally 1 output (or maximally 2). And also using segwit transaction would help. Anything else you should do with lower priority (i.e. set low fees &amp; be able to wait even few days).

Yes, if that is the not-contentiously-forked original Bitcoin with strong userbase and value. 
However - don't kid yourself - 2X will not get 95 % of hashrate. Current signaling is irrelevant and outright meaningless. Many miners will stay on Bitcoin (original legacy Bitcoin) as there is the strongest (&amp; veteran) user base and development orders of magnitude better than what all the rest (XT, Classic, Unlimited, BTC1, BCH... is demonstrating). Also, wallets will not be discontinuing support for (current) Bitcoin.

It was 72h, but it was changed in 0.14 to 14 days. However - it is just a default; any node is free to set any time to drop transactions from mempool. Also, anybody can rebroadcast the transaction that was already dropped (by some or all nodes).
That being said, "refund" makes no sense - as bitcoins didn't left your wallet if the transaction is still unconfirmed (you can create double-spending that sends those bitcoins elsewhere which might get confirmed instead of your original unconfirmed transaction). 
Tip: use RBF (Replace By Fee, "Replaceable") in Electrum - you are then able to increase fee of unconfirmed transaction.
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:11:14
It could be difficult to convert from base-6 to base-2. You can use this alternative method of obtaining binary number:
mapping: dice side -&gt; two binary digits
    6 -&gt; 00
    1 -&gt; 01
    2 -&gt; 10
    3 -&gt; 11
    4 -&gt; discard, throw again
    5 -&gt; discard, throw again 
...to get 11 digit binary number, you will need 6 throws in ideal case (in reality it will be more like 9).
Example: 53613563 gives you: nothing, 11, 00, 01, 11, nothing, 00, 11 ... i.e.: the binary number is: 110001110011, you take 11 digits only: 10001110011. 10001110011 is 1139 (use Calculator in Windows - switched to "programmer").

It's political because a bunch of politics is forcing something upon users. They want to replace current veteran &amp; expert 100 dev team with one mediocre morally questionable developer. Those businessmen plan to use their power over users that registered with them - not giving them a choice, just ramming them an altcoin into their throats with "this is Bitcoin". The other businessmen - pool operators - want to grab power too, they think that hashrate can dictate rules which is just a failure of understanding of what Bitcoin is. Longest (heaviest) **valid** chain. Valid. Valid according to rules. Of full nodes.
If Bitcoin gets under control of corporations it's fucked up from that point on - corporations can and will be coerced and Bitcoin will cease to be what it is (well, the real decentralized honey badger Bitcoin would emerge again from its community roots even then).
They want to change Bitcoin from the position of power - but that is not how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin is voluntary peer to peer network where every single user (full node operator) chooses what Bitcoin is, what are the rules. The change of the system is aided by developers, but ultimately it is up to every single user - to choose if and how to participate and what the rules will be. Bitcoin is consensus of the users, not dictate of corporations.
With forcing change in the way they are attempting, they are setting very dangerous precedent - one that we absolutely can't let pass. I say fuck all 2X people, fuck corporations that want to hijack/subdue Bitcoin for their measly profit.

If you are afraid that the value of bitcoins will go up, you can either hedge against that (buy call options) or you can borrow something else than bitcoins and then convert that to bitcoins (so your debt will not be measured in bitcoins but in e.g. gold/dollars/eggs or whatever).

I don't regard the ability to buy tiny things with cash as one of its important features.
Defining features of cash are these (for me):
* cash can be exchanged among peers without any 3rd parties
* cash is not (trivially) traceable, they can't know how much you have, they can't know when and who you pay to (and for what)
* you and only you are in control of it - you have it in your pocket, no bank employee can block/take it, no authorities can block/take it without direct physical confrontation
* cash is immediately available (if you decide to have it in your (hot) wallet)

Yes. 
From seed, very many private keys are derived. Every private key has its corresponding public key (which counter-intuitively should be kept secret in Bitcoin) and from this public key, bitcoin address is created by multiple hashing and adding checksum bytes. So, one bitcoin address corresponds to one private key.

With current POW algo there is no way going back to GPUs (and no chance in hell going back to CPUs as GPUs are many orders of magnitude faster in mining) - there will always be at least some miners that will run their ASICs to mine Bitcoin. If current miners leave, other miners will start mining with ASICs. 
Difficulty adjustment can take months in worst case. However - the more fees people pay, the more lucrative it is for miners - so if enough people are interested in using (current) Bitcoin, it will not die I am sure. As worst case, emergency hardfork can be done to lower the immediate difficulty.

If it is not sustainable, miners will not be getting profit, some will leave a and the rest will have proportionally higher reward. The equilibrium will be re-established once again.
There are also other factors:
* mining tends to move (globally) to places where the electricity is cheap;
* new specialized HW is being developed continuously - the same hash power will cost less in the future;
* people are also optimizing the cost in such a way that they are using the output heat (heating houses, etc.) - then you simply have electric heating with a boon.

I heard cash is not even 10 % of fiat. Many people have cash for only 3-7 days. If electricity stops you would need to redistribute cash - possibly in such a way that the rich remain rich - i.e. issuing cash for the fiat they had in their accounts. In this very unlikely scenario, it would work exactly the same for bitcoin - we will come with some (solar-powered) computer devices that will be able to tell how much bitcoins each of us had - then we would convert bitcoins to some sort of physical tokens - just like in the fiat scenario above.

At any point of time you can know exactly how many bitcoins there are - if you have full node you have the blockchain - you can go through it and count it  for yourself.
Also - unless there is some bug that was not uncovered (such as [this]( that was fixed), it is evident from the code that 21 million will be the final number (as the original block reward of 50 BTC is halved every 210000 blocks). 
    CAmount GetBlockSubsidy(int nHeight, const Consensus::Params&amp; consensusParams)
    {
        int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;
        // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.
        if (halvings &gt;= 64)
            return 0;
    
        CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
        return nSubsidy;

How to do it:
 1. Take Electrum's wordlist (which should be [this]( for 2.0+ (also [here](
 2. Pick word from worlist using dice: 
 2.1 From six-sided dice you are receiving digits in base-6 system (digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5). Perform 5 throws (as 6 to the power of 5 is bigger than 2048). You will get 5-digit base-6 number (i.e. 05510 or 45015).
 2.2 Convert your base-6 number to base-2 number (i.e. binary). 
 2.3 Take 11 binary digits - i.e. bits - from right hand side of your binary number. 
 2.4 Convert 11 binary digits to decimal (which will be in range 0-2047) - this number (+1) is index into your wordlist (see above). Write word to paper.
 3. Repeat 2. until you get enough words (should be 13 for Electrum 2.0+).

Anybody can do this (unrelated to mining and mining hashrate majority) - so, node counts are (somewhat) not reliable indicator of anything. However, with some degree of certainty you can say which are the fake nodes (spin up only for effect) and which are the long running nodes (ran by old-time users from the community).


If you run Bitcoin (i.e. Bitcoin Core), they can never force you to do anything. What they do is that they hardfork themselves off of the Bitcoin network - as their nodes will start producing blocks that are not valid for Bitcoin nodes. They will have their separate network, we will have our network.

...I think this is bullshit reason for not using "from". Bitcoins are clearly coming **from** an address - if signed by private key of that address. Luke-jr is being weird once again in that wiki. 
We are receiving mails **from** "noreply and we know it's pointless to reply there. We came **from** past and we know it's pointless to try to return there. We are inheriting something from somebody and we know we can't return it to "sender". It's not that hard to understand one way transfers.

Fiat inflation policy forces overspending and destroying of the environment. 
All the work in mining which is "useful" in your sense in fact makes mining less secure - i.e. what you think is waste is in fact security, what you think is good is in fact unnecessary (can &amp; should be done "outside of the coin").

See wiki [here]( Bit is used in many things regarding computers (we have gigabit ethernet, megabit internet, 64bit CPUs, we have 128 bits of entropy, etc.) and I suspect this base unit of information will be used much more in the future - even in normal language - as the penetration of computers into our lives accellerates. Those weird useless computing machines from 30 years ago are now miniaturized and present in every single piece of electronics, machinery and home appliances. And this is only the beginning. Using "bit" as unit of currency when it is already a base unit of information is plain idiocy IMHO. It will lead to countless confusions in the future.

If you do this:
it should be very secure. It requires having either dedicated permanently offline machine or creating and re-creating the wallet in secure Linux that is booted without networking (Live CD/USB).
There is a tradeoff - while it is very convenient (you can spend from your cold wallet multiple times; it's familiar if you already use Electrum normally as hot wallet) it is also not absolutely private - Electrum leaks your information to Electrum server.

Some miners who will be mining at loss will leave, difficulty will go down and then it will be more profitable to mine =&gt; mining will continue with (slightly) less hashrate.


Regular computers can do it, but difficulty would need to go many orders of magnitude down. But that is nearly impossible scenario (unless POW algo is changed) - there will always be ASIC miners mining.


It's not meaningless - the opposite: these "equations" are a crucial part of design of Bitcoin. Without mining, Bitcoin will not work. 


Yes, as noted above - some of those miners will stop mining and after difficulty change, mining will be more profitable for all.
You can see changes in difficulty here:
To find out what difficulty is or how it changes, search for this @ google:

Inflation hurts most painfully those who are poor, who have no time to search for investments - i.e. people who would like to accumulate some savings by adding tiny amounts day by day over years. Those people are robbed by bankers who print money for themselves - which steals the value from savers.
Volatility is irrelevant over longer time scales (you are e.g. accumulating savings over 5+ years).

The problem with fiat is that it is printed without limits, into bankers' pockets, out of thin air - and more: money printing is in fact creation of debt. 
All fiat money is in fact debt that needs to be serviced - i.e. you need to pay interest. All together there is not enough fiat to pay all the existing debt. This can't go on forever - and it is guaranteed to end nastily. 
Meanwhile - volatility of Bitcoin is not that terrible for me when the overall direction is not down. With fiat you are [guaranteed to be losing purchase power]( every year by ~5 %.
Least but not last - I think there is good chance that cash will be (nearly) banned soon which will on one hand close doors for many people who cannot get according bank/investment accounts (i.e. e.g. those Greeks) and on the other hand it will enable ruler/banker classes to do very nasty things to us (control over our money, confiscations, control over us) - with us having no recourse.

If those central planners are so wise that they can control the value of our money and the way how people use money - maybe they are wise enough to tell us what we should think/believe/do. If they are so wise - why do we discuss anything at all? We could just get their truths inprinted in us.
I grew up in a country where central planners controlled the production. Usually some kinds of basic goods were missing in stores, the quality of life was poor and ultimately the whole economy was disastrously misdirected (far too much focus on heavy industry, no services). We were not far from 1984 - the one ruling party was not only telling us what we need, we were also told what to believe and what to think. If you diverged, your job was taken from you and your children were denied education, eventually people who were thinking differently were watched and jailed.

You can't say exactly how much and when price rose thanks to previous halvings - it's known long in advance - so already months before there could be buy pressure increased; and also there can be some effect long after the halving - when "market realizes" that there really is shortage in supply at some point.

Well, big things have small beginnings.
My first computer had 0.000064 GB of RAM. Would you believe that? Soon, we will have million times that in our pockets. Bitcoin has technical limitations, but it is open and evolving. Contrary to what people think - it doesn't need to replace fiat completely. If it holds (&amp; I believe it will) as a viable alternative - as a more honest kind of money that brings you the freedom to store, protect and move your wealth without interference - it would be great. 
You don't need that many users to make an impact in the society. 100 hundred people around me don't know anything about Bitcoin, but are already influenced by me. I went from total ignorance ("Yes, it's shit, but you can't do shit about it - so why should I care?") to activity - research &amp; involvement in discussions regarding economics and that debt &amp; money printing mess.

It is not just a number - it must be (double) SHA256 hash of the block. You can't obtain valid hash by just substraction. You really have to be trying one slightly different block after another (changing mainly the nonce but also other things in it if you need) - billions and billions of them to find a block of which the hash meets the target criteria.
[A one-way hash can be generated from any piece of data, but the data cannot be generated from the hash]( - it is easy to verify that the hash value is really hash of that block, however it is impossible to go in opposite direction - you can't pick hash value that you would like and then somehow find out how the data (block) should look like for the hash value to be valid hash value of that data.

After all, miners are free to include transactions they want - or none at all.

You can try to mine Ethereum. Radeons are generally better for mining as they have more cores than nvidias. I ceased to mine BTC 2.5 years ago. At that time, Radeon was 2x or 2.5x faster than nvidia with the same price tag (if I remember correctly), see [here](

Get familiar with Electrum wallet (creating wallets, sending small amounts back and forth). Note that you can use '-w' cmd line parameter to generate/use other wallet file. 
When you get familiar with this, generate your savings Electrum wallet on offline machine (best to boot TAILS, but using Electrum on offline linux machine should be fine, too) - you write down the seed (13 words) and you can re-create that wallet on any machine using that seed. 
When you want to send BTC from your offline wallet you would re-create the wallet on offline machine from seed and use [this procedure]( to create the transaction on online machine ("hot wallet"), sign it on offline machine and then bring it back to online machine &amp; broadcast it.
This solution should be very secure while still easy to establish &amp; use. If you store more than 10 BTC you can do the same, but with multisig addresses (you generate more wallets offline - i.e. you have more seeds; then you have to use all of those or a fraction of those - e.g. 2 of 2; 2 of 3; 3 of 5; etc. - to sign transaction that goes from your savings wallet).
For buying, try localbitcoins, too.

Easiest should be to use RBF - but your transaction is probably not RBF enabled and probably you also don't have RBF-able wallet.
You can try to create double spend. I.e. use the same inputs in different transaction. Then only one of the two will get confirmed (or none). However your wallet or bitcoin nodes around you might refuse to create/relay that transaction.
Also there is a recent development: CPFP (Child pays for parent) - if you use outputs (of your low-fee stuck transaction) in new transaction that pays like double the recommended fee there is a chance that some of the miners will see that they need to include both those transaction to pocket the high fee of the second transaction - so you can make the first transaction more likely to get mined like that ...but this is quite recent improvement, it is not known if it works well already.

Mining block with 1 transaction is almost exactly the same effort like mining block with 3000 transactions. The preparation takes some more milliseconds, but what takes minutes, hours and days is to find the correct block (to find the nonce that leads to hash that meets the difficulty criteria). Aside from the preparation (taking transactions and verifying those), all the mining boils down to something like drawing random numbers from hat (cat contains billions of billions of numbers) and waiting till the draw results in given number - e.g. zero (or more precisely - number from an interval that meets the difficulty criteria). 
So - mining is basically a lottery, the more calculations you do (the more hashes you compute), the higher chance you have to find the block (to find input number that after hashing leads to the number that meets the difficulty criteria). Amount of computation needed to find a block is almost entirely given by the difficulty, it is independent of block size, number of transaction, etc.

No. It will make a difference - less urgent transactions will be confirmed in times when the load is lower (America goes to sleep, Europe not yet fully awake) more urgent transactions paying higher fee will get confirmed faster that those less urgent transactions. Prioritization will make sense always.


This is already happening - much more transactions with 0 fee are coming in than can ever be confirmed. Blockchain is a limited resource it has its price, there is no free lunch.

* BTC is global and open (anyone can examine/join/improve/extend), not controlled by corrupt institutions like fiat. Secure, nearly anonymous. Freedom! Complete alternative to fiat system which is infested with corrupt institutions and vampire banking cartels abusing regulations. 
* Current bank/fin system - instead of encouraging saving (making reserves for rainy days) - drags people into debt. Debt might have some short-time advantages but overall it leads to much more fragile situation. E.g. imagine what would happen when there is hike in interest rates (it was 5+% just a few years ago!) - many people would suddenly become poor as they would not be able to pay even the interest on the loan. Or - it takes just some personal unlucky event (car broken, house fire, injury, etc.) to get into very bad situation where you need to take more loans - you barely keep afloat &amp; the banks profit.

New wallet has no balance? Either it's not connected/synchronized or the transaction wasn't confirmed.
If the old wallet says 'unconfirmed', the transaction is either really unconfirmed (and still existing in the network) or the old wallet is not connected/synchronized.
First, check the transaction in online blockchain explorers (Electrum offers you several - try at least two - e.g.   - there you see if the transaction was confirmed or whether it is still pending eventually (or it can be completely removed from the network - in that case it will not show in some online blockchain explorers at all)...
If it was confirmed, it should show in your new wallet as + balance &amp; it should show as confirmed in old wallet. If it is not confirmed but still pending, it should show as unconfirmed in both wallets. In case the transaction was removed from the network, it might still be shown as unconfirmed in either wallet.
In any case: what you see in online block explorers? Is the transaction confirmed already? Or unconfirmed + still pending? Then, you might try to:
* restart your wallets
* pick other Electrum servers to connect to
* restart your machine
* fiddle with your firewall
* eventually recreate old/new wallet from seed - on your and eventually on other machine in different network even
Fear not - your BTCs are either "in" the old wallet or "in" the new wallet - there is no other option in your situation (unless your seeds/private_keys got exposed to hackers - but that would show as new transaction).

If there is say 10 % of "die-hard segwit miners" who want Segwit to happen - who are able to burn some money, they can (try to) orphan any block that is not signalling segwit. This would succeed in 5 - 10 % I guess (majority of miners don't care, they use heaviest chain) ...so this way "die-hard segwit miners" can bleed money from anti-segwit miners.

Miners are free to pick any nonce - but usually it starts at 0 and increments linearly by adding 1 for every try. The fact that more miners are starting to search for new block with nonce 0 doesn't mean they calculate the same hash for exactly the same block. 
Every miner tries to find different block - at least the coinbase transaction (reward for miner) is different for each miner (but there are more differences - e.g. every miner has slightly different timestamp and different list of transactions that are selected for the next block).
See [block header]( there is merkle root that is calculated from all transactions in the block =&gt; different coinbase transaction =&gt; every miner has different block header.

People are incentivized to live together because of greater opportunities - yet we do not observe the existence of a single megacity on the planet. It's probably not that simple.


Once you start producing blocks that are too large you are preventing the network from being useful. This is not "I am not useful, but the other miners producing smaller blocks will be". If you harm the network, you can expect some serious backlash. I have seen this in the "GHash.io near 50 %" situation (now they have 2 %).

Bitcoin is open-source - everybody can see (if skilled enough) all that it does. Besides that some people are also afraid of Satoshi moving/using his bitcoins (he probably still controls 1 million BTC). If used recklessly, price can be driven temporarily to 0 and to double/single digits for months. I am not afraid. First, Satoshi was wise and polite - he had/has the best intentions with Bitcoin. Second, after some period of cheap coins, the price would most likely go up again (coins would just be redistributed).




There is no general consensus. It's just everyone's guess. If nothing bad happens it will go up - maybe a lot. But we can't guess how that "bad" is probable or what is it at all (Will alts replace Bitcoin? Will govs fight Bitcoin ruthlessly? Will some technical weakness appear?)
All I can say is I believe it is reasonable to keep 20 % of savings in Bitcoin. If you invest 
$1000 the most you can lose is $1000 - the most you can gain is maybe millions or more.

It's good practice to look at recommended fee (my link in previous reply or also [here]( before sending. And also one should not do urgent transfers from places where the fee cannot be influenced. It's best to have Electrum on PC &amp; also choose small number of inputs in urgent cases so the transaction is smaller. (Yes, Bitcoin is not completely user-friendly, yet.) 
Also, RBF (replace by fee) is being introduced that will allow to replace a small-fee transaction with reasonable-fee transaction.

That's because anti-BIP101 guys are not shy of paying for large DDOS attacks against pro-BIP101 pools.

See "zapwallettxes" here  ...it clean your wallet of transactions that aren't in the network. Nodes are usually setting minrelay fee now, so chance is that your transaction wasn't even broadcasted. So you can just resent with fee. Even if transaction was broadcasted (see your txid in other online blockchain explorers), it will be probably dropped in few days.

Wallets contain many addresses - you can use any of those to receive bitcoins. Typically the wallet offers you one address that is explicitly marked as "Receiving" (after you use it to receive bitcoins new receiving address will be generated for you - as it's recommended to use fresh receiving address for every incoming transaction).
If you want to send to another user: ask for her (receiving) address first, then go to your wallet &amp; click 'Send' - and paste the address you were given into "Send to" ("Pay to") field.

What is the transaction fee (per B)? See [here]( - transactions with fee under 120 sat/B will not be confirmed for hours/days. If your fee is under that, you can click RMB in history row in Electrum &amp; select "increase fee".
Other reason might be that your transaction is spending unconfirmed outputs. If that is the case, you can increase the fee even more to pay also additional fee for the previous transaction (this is called "Child Pays For Parent").
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:45:28
[Input]( is what you see in online block explorers on left side. Or in Electrum - when you click 'details' on transaction (row in history), Inputs are above Outputs for this transaction.
Inputs are increasing the size of transaction (in bytes) significantly - as they also have the signature with them (where the sender proves that she has the private keys that correspond to that input (to address where that input was sent "to")). So, for priority transactions, it is ideal to use just one input - because then the transaction will be smaller - so the absolute fee paid will not be that high - to reach the same relative fee (fee in BTC or satoshis per byte). 
If there are many (small) inputs in your addresses (from mining or faucets), it is best to do low priority consolidation transaction - send all those inputs to your next receiving address and to pay relatively small fee (20 - 30 sat/B) and hope that it will go through. :) ...When the network is not busy (which happens during weekends usually) it has some chance to succeed. If the transaction doesn't confirm for 72 hours, it gets dropped (bitcoins never moved) so you can then retry in another suitable moment and/or with slightly higher fee.
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:51:18
Likely not - but not to be sorry if it goes up and up and up: do [cost averaging]( (buy every week for $50 or something).

Bitcoin is scarce and useful. So, if new people join or if old people want to buy more (at least so much so it evens [newly created bitcoins]( (miner subsidy)), the price goes up.
Quite often alts go up together with BTC (in $ value) as (nearly?) all of them are traded/priced against/with BTC. However, in recent weeks a lot of alts had rocket rallys (many had days with +20%, see also [Combined Altcoin Market Capitalization]( so we are in "alt bubble" perhaps - so it's possible that money will flow back from alts to BTC in coming weeks.

Now. With respect: you can't imagine what the situation will be in 10 - 20 years. All windows in a building could have integrated computers with internet connection &amp; solar panels for example. All parts of your wardrobe could have computers and ways of generating power. Mining circuits by itself could be very cheap if being added on a mass scale to existing integrated computers. Buying bitcoins could be more of a hassle than mining them - especially if only a tiny amount is required (for a few small transactions).
Also - the mining is just one aspect of the thing. Pack bitcoin stack into one simple somewhat standardized device - one integrated circuit that can be merged into any device which already has a computer. ...that is interesting.

I find it very hard to believe that it would encrypt the wallet by itself without user actions.
I think it's likely that either:
* your friend typed some password there (maybe it's just one character or something really simple that he immediately forgot),
* wallet file got corrupted instead of encrypted (he hasn't previous backups of the file, right?)...
Edit: 
In any case, it won't hurt to make 2 backups of that wallet file and to try to open it with different Armory wallets - try the same version on more machines or newer version.

DON'T PANIC. Do cost averaging if you want to invest long term. If you trade - be aware that emotions usually make you do wrong trades (buys at top, sells at bottom). Do not keep money at exchanges.

Yes, people buying - a lot of people in Japan started to buy, lot of people globally got familiar with Bitcoin for the first time because it appears in news and because they have friends who bought recently and made profits, a lot of people who sold in $500-$1500 are buying back in hopes it will go still up for some time.

Not true. Or are you writing from rented HW because you never buy computers or phones? Because - the more you wait the cheaper they will be (even in fiat remarkably)..?
When your wealth is multiplying, you allow yourself to spend some portion of it. You will not buy a new Tesla if it would be 80 % of your available money - but you will do it if it is 5 %. You don't care that it would be 2.5 % in 5 years - because in 5 years you can be dead as well.

You are able to set the transaction like that - with OP_CLTV. See "Escrow" here:
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:13:57
Yeah, pretty much.
Those "12 words" are called *seed*. Using this seed, your wallet generates as much private keys as you need. Every private key then has/generates its corresponding bitcoin address which it controls.
For wallets that have seed the best backup is just writing that seed on paper (multiple papers on multiple physical locations). That seed can re-create the whole wallet (all private keys in it) anywhere anytime. But you are also free to backup the wallet file (that contains the seed). 


Yes, for wallets that use seed. 
But Bitcoin Core wallet for example doesn't use seed - so it's wallet has to be archived multiple times - every time after certain number of receiving transactions.

Bitcoin is limited and let's say that the user base or the economy or both grow. This means that by just holding bitcoins you gain value - i.e. your purchasing power rises because the prices (denominated in BTC) go down. This is big difference from fiat. Fiat makes/forces you to spend &amp; take loans, bitcoin makes you spend less and save more and discourages taking loans.
Your idea would make the above-described characteristic of bitcoins even more pronounced. It would be similar to fiat with very high interest rates. People who have the money in hand &amp; pay with it will be losing value fast, and OTOH people with savings will be gaining value (fast). 
Let's imagine the interest is very high - say 100 % /day. Everybody has locked bitcoins, nearly nobody is using it. Utility is down - far less merchants, far less transactions, etc. Volatility goes up - there are not many bitcoins that can be bought at any point in time (unless we approach the top of the bubble, bitcoins become unlocked and sold en-masse).
So, I think, it is interesting to explore this, but it is probably too complex (if we wanted to integrate it into Bitcoin) and unneeded - as bitcoins are already (hopefully) deflationary and very "pro-saving" (compared to other alternatives).

Thanks, but keep those BTCs...


Sweeping private key is two operations in one: 
1. importing private key
2. sending all bitcoins that can be sent using this key to new address (that user enters)
it's done like this so people do not lose bitcoins when they send from paper wallets.
So, when you sweep, transaction is created that sends all those bitcoins. If some transaction already exists (and was not dropped already - network drops unconfirmed in 72 hours) this sweep will probably tell you that it imported your private key but that it failed to send bitcoins from it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:42:02


It's completely irrelevant if it is $0.035, $35 or $35000000 - all that matters now is the size of the transaction in bytes. The more inputs (and outputs) the bigger transaction. Smallest usual transaction (1 input and 2 outputs) is around 230 bytes. 
If you have many tiny outputs from previous transactions in your wallet you should do low priority low fee consolidation transaction first (when network is least busy). You can see how much outputs you have for example in Electrum (v2.8+) - in tab 'Coins'. You can also select which exactly you want to send.

It's not segway, it's completely different than segway...
If it goes down, it will go up some time after the event. If you hold BTC &amp; there is a chain split, you will have BTC on both chains. So, no risk with that. 
It's possible that many people will try to sell &amp; that some people will even try to induce sell panic - but I don't think it would be that much bad so it doesn't recover in a few days/weeks. 
Look how people were panicking when the Silk Road got busted (doom and gloom, $125 -&gt; $85) ...and then, immediately, a major rally started: we had 8 green week candles - shooting up to $1100+...

This is not true. As of now, miners are too centralized (moreover in a totalitarian country where their operations can be easily confiscated) and are stalling progress - Segwit is solving a lot of issues, it is a compromise as it also rises block capacity &amp; is supported by majority of people in the community. Why are they doing it? We suspect that they do not care about Bitcoin too much - just for their immediate gains (asicboost, higher fees...). If they give them more control they will use it to oust smaller miners &amp; grab more power.

You probably have many tiny inputs (outputs of the incoming transactions). The fee depends on the size of the data of the transaction - i.e. on the size of the transaction [in bytes]. If you have many tiny inputs you need to pay large fee to get the same priority as if you have 1 input &amp; pay relatively small fee.
So, if you have many small inputs, you should try to consolidate those in a transaction that pays low/moderate fee (which means it will have low chance to confirm as it is quite large because of many inputs) - wait for the moment when the network is not busy.
Watch this few times a day:
...you will get a feeling... Network is less busy  on weekends. Yesterday, transactions with fee under 150 sat/B were confirmed. It might drop even below 100 in next weeks.
Bitcoin network confirms 1 MB of transactions every 10 minutes on average. See right column ("Size Count") in that link above to see what transactions will get confirmed in the next block...

Chance that that block is not orphaned right after its creation would be miniscule (vast majority of miners will be enforcing segwit rules once/if it gets activated).
Also old nodes will not recognize the (short lived theft) but they will not be target of the theft as they will have no segwit addresses. Segwit aware nodes (that could be target of your hypothetical theft) will recognize the problem immediately.

In the world, there is not enough fiat to repay the total debt (with interest) ...unless more money is created - which means: more loans ...which makes the situation only worse.
You can exponentially print more and more money out of thin air (read: create new loans) and at some point say: 1,000,000 **old** dollars is now 1 (new) dollar - but this would only work if people are so ignorant that they let themselves be exploited indefinitely.

Few days ago, transactions with as low fee as 0.15uBTC/B (15 sat/B) were confirmed. Create consolidation transaction that will join your small inputs, give it 0.20 uBTC/B and try it again and again until you are lucky (note that network is less busy on weekends).
You can create the transaction in Electrum, save it into file &amp; use command line command to send it (even launched from cron) to avoid manual "work".

Questionable. (Also what is "huge"? And are those "huge" blocks guaranteed when BIP101 is activated?)
I can say that big blocks will lead to higher utility for much more people which will lead to mainstream acceptance (or at least 100 times what we have now) which will drive the price up.

It's a way how to put witness (which is the script that is a proof that transaction was sent correctly) outside of the transaction into newly created blockspace that is in the block but not fully counted into blocksize as it is not important for the really old blocks which are already buried under enough of POW which means their witness must have been correct.

Do "Child Pays For Parent" - send the change output again in new high-fee transaction. 
It must exactly be that output - that change output in your unconfirmed transaction - it's either that 0.0001288 BTC in 1ALBTCbD4BVuzcyAT1EbKSxDQLh2QrX42e or that 1.5 BTC in 1LdxR3S3w5A1udrqeTx6ChwQtBtZa2WNqn. Send this new transaction with enough fee (250 sat/B or more) - "Send to:" is one of your receiving addresses (or you can send anywhere, that doesn't matter).
When miners see this second high value transaction they will be interested because of the higher fee &amp; they will be also forced to mine your currently unconfirmed transactions (as the second transaction would not be valid if it appears in a block without the previous transaction going into the same block (or one of the previous)).
Edit: You can calculate the fee that those two transactions pay exactly: sum absolute fees and divide by sum of sizes (in bytes). As you can see [here]( if your total fee is higher than 170 sat/B both those transactions should go into the next block...
Edit 2:
As points out, also this transaction:
is unconfirmed - so when you do CPFP you will need to add its fee and size into those sums I speak about above. The best way is to do CPFP as RBF ("replaceable") - so you can increase its fee when needed...

Halving might be driving this surge, too - people are realizing that Bitcoin is a bit scarcer that they thought. 
It's a lot about sentiment &amp; about what big players do. When they see that people are buying more, they can start selling &amp; keep the price at the same level. Then, when they run out of BTC (and when it looks promising) they can do large quick buys - so they trigger buy panic and big changes in price with it.

Last time I was sending money to Steam I used RBF ("replaceable") in Electrum - no confirmations after 30 minutes, so I increased fee to fee recommended [here]( Then it confirmed within 3 blocks. Bitpay wasn't confused by that RBF transaction, everything went well.
Do not buy game directly - send money to your steam wallet -  enough for multiple games so you can send single (less urgent) BTC transaction instead of many.


Multiple inputs. For any transaction that is not low priority you should use single input only - so you don't pay unnecessarily high fees.

Some cryptocurrencies are more anonymous than others. Bitcoin is anonymous only if you take precoutions - which is good - we don't want to stir the shit too much now. (Many ways towards higher anonymity are possible.)
Cost efective? It can't compete with free services provided by banksters who print their own "money" out of thin air - but that's not the goal - as their services are tightly controlled by nefarious authorities.

There are always coins for sale - because if there aren't, the price goes up and (up enough so) some of the holders decide to sell some fractions.
For fiat currencies it might be a problem if the value goes 100 times up for example - but bitcoins are much more divisible than that - so even if the price of BTC goes to $100000 there is still enough decimal places to transact normally. In other words - only tiny fraction of the total supply will be enough to facilitate all transactions if the price is high enough.

 &gt; It would be easiest if there were one store of value
You can't dictate that. You can't enforce one store of value for all (especially not when underground peer-to-peer based alternatives like Bitcoin arose).
Different ppl are valuing different things differently. Currency that is great for you because it is good store of value might not be good for me, because perhaps it allows nefarious people to spy upon me. 
Some people might be happy that the currency keeps its value no matter what (1 beer is always 10 coins), some people might rather have currency that is fluctuating in value but which is not controlled by some central planner mandarins (who think currency must not fluctuate in value) - so it reflects the situation in the world better probably.
Bitcoin is an antithesis to the current fiat national state-violence enforced currencies in many respects. Alt crypto currencies are and/or will be further differentiating against fiat AND Bitcoin - so they come with other unique propositions that might be appealing to some groups of people. 
Some alts are faster than Bitcoin but less decentralized (censorship resistant) and those might work well as long as there is the really decentralized crypto variant that is an option and that tells the national states that their attack against any cryptos would be futile. Some alts are even more private than Bitcoin - as many people might value their privacy above all other things (think about fighters against the worse totalitarian governments that must remain hidden)...
I gave the example of cars because cars are very useful, but at the same time they are quite evolved &amp; petrified in a lot of respects. It must be so, because very many people use them and are used to the standard look &amp; behavior, also cars are at the edge of engine efficiency and/or edge of production cost, so there is no big development, etc. But then, different demands arise - some people want to travel faster/further than possible by cars, some people want to travel on water and some people want something that will allow them to use their own muscles instead of burning of something. There is no universal means of travel and in the same way there is no universal &amp; best currency/money. Many different vehicles facilitate transport and many different things/system/schemes might facilitate value transfer between people.

What you mean I guess is something different - that we can't change how blocks look like (in new version of client) - because these would be then rejected by nodes that run older version of client. 
This would be called a hard fork (HF) - then all running nodes would be required to upgrade to the new version of client (to avoid splitting into two blockchains). 
However, devs found a way how to change how the block looks like, also adding there more functionality, without making it incompatible with the older nodes. So, nodes with old clients might not be able to fully see what is in the new blocks, but they will not reject them. 
So, in Segwit the block looks somehow different. Transactions that are of new "segwit" type are divided into two parts - segwit part where is the proof that sender had the private key (or basically any proof that the sender fulfilled the demands that the previous sender imposed on those bitcoins she sent) and the rest of the transaction. 
Then, witness part is in the block, but in different part than the normal transactions (and normal parts of segwit transactions) - so it does not need to be counted into the blocksize (or fully counted - there is 75 % discount) ...because the rules for counting blocksize (in old clients) is applied only for the normal part of the block as they know nothing about the segwit (witness) part of the block.
Why is there the discount for witness? Because it doesn't need to be stored by (all) full nodes for the old blocks. Nodes don't need to verify again and again that that transaction 3 years ago was sent correctly by the "rightful owner" of those bitcoins (by person who can satisfy the conditions in bitcoins that she sends in transaction) - because everyone knows it was correct if it is buried deep in blockchain already. 
Discount means that the total size of blocks could be over 1 MB even if the blocksize limit is 1 MB.

When ether split into ETH and ETC there was a lot of people who were manually fiddling with raw transactions with the aim to split the coins (send to one address on one chain and to other address on the second chain), then shapeshift started to offer that service for like 1 % fee - and then finally a few days later, Kraken allowed splitting naturally and for free - you just sent coins to them (on either chain), they replayed it on the other and then split the coins for you so you had the equal amount of ETH and ETC in your ETH and ETC accounts (providing pre-split coins were sent). Very easy, no problem at all. They do this splitting even months after the fork happened I am sure &amp; will continue to do so as long as both ETH&amp;ETC have value. If you send them pre-fork ETH, they will credit you both ETH and ETC.
The same will happen with two bitcoins when/if the split happens. No problem if you do not react &amp; keep pre-split coins in storage and very simple way how to have coins on both chains split into 2 accounts if you chose to use those coins after the split.

You never know if it will go up or down. Usually the market does the exact opposite than what you expect. A lot of us think it will go up in the long run - but you never know. Cost averaging I suggested is a way how to get exposed that evens out the volatility (and also makes other risks smaller - like losing funds at failing exchange or spending the whole budget before security is adequately researched) - it's the way how not to care about short-/mid- term oscillations in price.

If so it would be probably better for both of you if you hand-pick larger inputs for your transactions (tab "Addresses" (RMB to "Send From") and or also tab "Coins" (there you can also select which inputs you want)). Create the transaction so only one or at most two inputs are used - it will be far cheaper.

4 or 5 attempts is not spamming. If it doesn't confirm, higher fee with higher success chance can be tried. It's good to join tiny inputs to reduce UTXO set.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:17:20
"50% full blocks" means that the fees are near zero - as there is still free space in blocks so no fee or tiny fee needs to be paid to be included in block. Near zero fees mean that filling the block completely is very easy and nearly or virtually free.


Yes, if blocks are full, you can create transactions that will never get confirmed and at the same time these transactions will increase the needed fee for others. This is not nice, certainly, but it doesn't in any way refute the hypothesis that blocks will always be full.

Current mining landscape is not healthy. A lot of centralization (mining pools in China and 1 large HW manufacturer)  and usage of patented ASICBOOST that gives order of magnitude larger profits and blocks further improvements at the same time. We need segwit now - even though it decreases the efficiency of some ASICs.
Miners are no longer also normal users. Incentives of miners are less aligned with users and also with people who run full nodes.
Segwit is a tremendous step forward &amp; I would be also advocating (partial) change of POW. (Search for POWA if you want to know more about change to mining algo that would make Bitcoin more decentralized - i.e. resistant.)
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:07:34


Not ok, it's the necessary evil at this point. We need Segwit &amp; offchain transactions. If we burden full nodes too much (with HF to larger blocksize) we can end up losing the unique property of Bitcoin which is trustlessness &amp; censorship resistance.

Your original transaction ([here]( with fee 39.75 sat/B) wasn't flagged as RBF ("replaceable"), right? If it is not, the transaction that is double spending might not be propagated properly (even if it has far bigger fee). And perhaps also the fact that the destination address changed makes the new transaction less "interesting" for nodes/miners.

You make it sound that a number is nothing - while it is everything. Number is information. Information makes difference between this around and stone age.


When I do something really nice to you - like sharing my food or giving you a professional massage, ...will you immediately forget about it? Or will you remember it and eventually do something reciprocally? I.e. would you "pay it back" somehow? Money just generalizes this reciprocity to more people who do not know each other.
The arbitrary token just carries the information that the guy helped somebody in the past - so you can "pay back" that to him ...and then, most likely, somebody will help you in the future.

Your offline-generated paper wallet has private key and BTC address. You send bitcoins to that address - which means that in blockchain there will be that transaction recorded that some bitcoins moved. The transaction explicitly says: control of those bitcoins is transferred to that private key that generated that BTC address. 
It is irrelevant whether that address - and it's private key first - were generated online or offline.
Note that you can even send bitcoins to addresses that have no private key (that were not generated from a private key) so those bitcoins are lost, e.g.:

The motivation behind spinning up those nodes was probably to show that node counts can be easily changed. "Oh - you have 1000 nodes signalling UASF? Bah - meaningless! Let me show you how easily can I spin up another 2000 in minutes!.." ...this done with the intention to show that the original 1000 nodes signalling UASF mean nothing... 
However, there is a flaw in that thinking IMO - you can create thousands of new nodes easily, but you can't easily fake old-running well-known nodes (for prolonged periods of time). We have lists of long running nodes (with their IPs) - if those nodes switch to signal UASF it is substantial (and different from UASF signalling nodes that appeared out of nowhere in the last days)...
So - yes, you can "fake" node counts - but no - it doesn't invalidate the significance of long running nodes switching to signal/enforce UASF.

As gary_sadman says - that chart is miner support. Around 30 % of miners (hashrate) support Segwit. Node support is far higher - 80+ %. 
If node support was say 98+ % (but counting this is problematic because of Sybil attacks - but we can try to track old running nodes for example) it would mean that all users want Segwit. Then those users can force a softfork if they update their clients to version that refuses non-segwit blocks. (UASF - user activated soft fork)

If there are hundred nodes or so in total, it would be too easy for authorities (or any bad actors) to attack operators of those. Also, we also need to enable people from not-so-hi-tech parts of the world to use Bitcoin privately. (INB4 "They can't use it because of fees!" - Nah, they can use it. If only as store of value - i.e. shield against shitty fiat. Even 4 transactions per year can be enough for that use case. Also, they can wait for moments when network is less busy.

Also, they don't need to connect cold wallet to internet (making it hot), they just can create the transaction online (in watch-only wallet) and sign it offline in their cold wallet. Also, they can prove how much they have in cold wallet by signing a message with their private key(s) - keys that are controlling their cold storage addresses. This signing can also be done offline.
However, usually no company/"company" bothers with proving how much bitcoins they have. And - even if they prove how much BTC they have in this moment, you can never tell whether they have fiat debt or not. (They could take a loan, buy bitcoins, prove to you that they have them - which makes no proof that they are/will be solvent.)

Because there is significant support for it (users, wallet developers, service providers, ...) - so there is good chance that UASF will be done - so either the whole network will convert to it or there will be a chain split - from which the exchanges can profit (people selling their coins from the chain they don't believe in to get more coins on the chain they like). 
The reason why it is not in official client is because it is not meeting the high standard for activation that core client was using up to now - i.e. it is (somewhat) riskier. Even if the activation mechanism is riskier than usual (and can lead to chain split), the thing that is being activated is created by core devs &amp; 100 % trusted by them. Also, luke-jr - who is prominent core dev - is supporting UASF in his Bitcoin Knots mutation of official client &amp; he is also signing his builds of Bitcoin Core that has UASF code included - so, that should ensure that there is no hidden maliciousness in the released binaries.
And simply: because it is the best way forward now.

Those algorithms are for different altcoins - each of those alts needs different amount of computation to complete one hash, therefore those hashrates wildly differ. Your reward in btc/day also depends on the actual price of that altcoin (in BTC).

Instead of "anonymous" we say "pseudo-nymous". Addresses you generate are not trivially recognizable as yours. Well - unless you request bitcoins from someone - but then this sender can't be sure where are you sending your's bitcoins next (what is being sent and what is change; if you are sending to yourself or not).
In opposite way too - if you sent BTC to someone, she can see that that sending address is yours &amp; she can track those coins back in blockchain, but she can't be sure if those addresses are yours (were you sending BTC multiple times between your wallets?) or whether the previous transaction was you receiving BTC from someone else.
For privacy it's good to:
* use fresh receiving address for every transaction;
* run full node (light client gives out your IP &amp; leaks address info to the server) or light client over anon VPN or Tor.


You can sell your fiat or goods/services for BTC locally or on inet when possible (localbitcoins, bitscqare.io, openbazaar).

b) it's "Trezor" not "Tre**v**zor"; their SW is opensource - so there will always be a way how to import that seed (those private keys it generated for you into other wallet)
c) miners try to maximize the profit - so they want to keep their blocks full, they will not set the bar artificially high, because they would be losing fees for transactions that would be just below it that they would be able to fit in if they didn't impose the artificial restriction (other miners will not be refusing those transactions &amp; will be making more profit)

If your node (or your local network) is isolated from the main Bitcoin network for a while &amp; your local miner (or an attacker) feeds you a block which is not compatible with the main blockchain of the main Bitcoin network - you need to be able to reverse everything in that "local" block &amp; take the main blockchain as the only truth. The solution you are proposing can't work, because once you have a single block that is incompatible with the main blockchain, you would never be able to switch to main blockchain again...
On second thought - you don't need to be isolated at all - all that would be needed to break your node forever would be receiving orphaned block with a double spend transaction (i.e. with transaction that spends the same inputs differently in orphaned block and in main blockchain).

Before that transaction happens, nobody knows that that address existed. Bitcoin is different than all other services where you need first to register and then you can do something. In Bitcoin you just generate the address (from the private key) and use it to receive without any registration or anything else.
Space of Bitcoin private keys and addresses is so huge that we can be sure that we have unique even without some centrally controlled registration process. 


Network knows nothing about the private key (as I said above there are even addresses receiving bitcoins that have no private key) unless the private key is used for spending (for sending "from" your address) - then that private keys is used to sign the transaction which proves that bitcoins are moved by the "rightful owner".

First, you are theorizing about things that will happen 100+ years from now.
Second, mining is self adjusting system - if mining is not profitable, some miners leave and the rest is (barely) profitable again &amp; vice versa. Currently, miners get already like 20 % of their revenue from fees and 80 % from block reward. Even if block rewards went to 0 this year Bitcoin will be doing well. I consider current level of security (hashrate) to be unnecessarily big - if it goes to 20 %, the security will still be good enough. So - I believe Bitcoin will be working even now without block rewards.

In ideal case they will split your coins and they will maintain 2 accounts - 1 for each chain. 1 pre-split coin will be split to 1 coin on chain A and 1 coin on chain B.
However it is better to have your coins in wallet that you and only you control (e.g. Electrum). After chainsplit you can send those coins to an exchange that will be known to support both chains &amp; that will do the split conveniently for you.
For example Coinbase was refusing to support ETC for days/weeks after ETH-&gt;ETH+ETC split which led to loss of value for some users (other users revealed hat they can deposit post-split-ETH and immediately withdraw pre-split ETH from Coinbase (i.e. withdraw ETH+ETC which meant they got ETC for free - ETC of users who were unfortunate to deposit pre-ETH in Coinbase))*.

Correct. 
If you have Electrum, run this in command line:

...you will see all those pieces you received (all with transaction ID of transaction that created them &amp; index number telling us which of the outputs in that transaction it is/was). Every of these pieces (outputs of incoming transactions) - when being sent - has to be signed with the corresponding private key. This is true even when all these inputs sit "in" the same address. 
So, spending tiny inputs from single address is the same as spending tiny inputs from many addresses - in terms of transaction size (in bytes) and also in terms of user effort (sending small inputs from many addresses needs only few clicks more as I said in my previous reply).

If we suppose buyers are so crazy that really all would want their 1 BTC at all costs, there will be spike to $20000 - $100000 /BTC, then crash back to $1000 and then it will settle between $2000 and $5000.

Certainly not true. And even if it was - some miners are "stealing electricity" which forces some other miners out of business and some others are mining at loss. What has this to do with fees vs block rewards? 
Mining is profitable or barely profitable now. Hashrate is 10 or more times higher than it was 2 years ago - and even then it was perceived by many as unnecessarily high. If the revenue is cut to 20 % it would be no big problem for Bitcoin.

Onchain transfer is 1 - 120 minutes (with 10 on average) if you pay enough fee.
However, when using localbitcoins it is not onchain - the transfer is internal in localbitcoins i.e. offchain. Both seller &amp; buyer have BTC accounts there. Once buyer puts money on the table, seller clicks 'release bitcoins' - so the swap is quite atomic. Note also that buyer does not need to have digital inet device at all - right after seller clicks 'release BTC' he gets a code that the buyer knows beforehand - so it's a proof that seller really released bitcoins.

Electrum is the best wallet (far more convenient and with less quirks than other wallets). 
That transaction should disappear by itself - if it does not, try this:
1. reconnect - click green button at bottom-right &amp; ok
2. connect to other Electrum server - click green button at bottom-right &amp; select other server
3. recreate your wallet from seed - either you move your existing wallet file elsewhere or use '-w PATH_TO_NEW_WALLET_FILE' when you launch electrum - this will tell the wallet to use other file as wallet file - it will not find it on the first launch, so it will let you enter seed &amp; it will recreate your wallet
These steps should be enough in most cases to get rid of the transaction that was dropped by bitcoin network. If it is still there - try Electrum installed at other machine. If it is ok there (transaction not present) and your main machine still has it after all this, maybe you need to reinstall Electrum (&amp; delete its app data).
BTW - are you really sure that the transaction was already dropped by bitcoin network?
Tip: use "replaceable" next time (in menu enable "Replace-by-fee" and then when you are sending transaction, check "replaceable" - this will give you new option in RMB menu - "bump fee").

If the transfer is not critical I would just wait. It is possible that the network will be less busy sometime in following weeks/months.
For critical transactions it is best to minimize their size reduce number of inputs and outputs as much as possible. If you have multiple inputs you can consolidate those in low priority low fee transaction when the network is least busy.
For all your transactions use "Replaceable" option so you can increase the feeif needed. You probably didn't do that for the transaction you are asking about, so you have these options:
* wait it out;
* try to use viabtc accelerator (try exactly right after every full hour) - they pay the fee for you for the chance to indoctrinate you with their bullshit propaganda on their page;
* try CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) - you create new transaction that spends one of the outputs of your unconfirmed transaction (so miner must mine both to get the fee of the second) - and you set high fee in this second transaction so it pays partially for the first (miner calculates fee for those two as sum of fees divided by sum of sizes in bytes of those two transactions).
On closer inspection - you are consolidating your small inputs - but you pay more in fees than all those small inputs together... Just wait for the transaction to be dropped from mempools &amp; then use only the biggest input you have there in your eventual next transaction. Try to consolidate those tiny inputs together when/if the network is not busy (i.e. when recommended fee [here]( is under 100sat/B).

During the first months, everybody (with very few exceptions) thought mining digital would-be-currency is utterly ridiculous. I admire people who were so forward- and out-of-the-box- thinking to do it at that time. 
I dismissed Bitcoin few times in 2011 because I was not able to have even doubts. I was sure it is some bullshit made by some company to steal money from people. It took me whole year to get the understanding &amp; start mining. Also 2011 and 2012 was already something completely different - a lot of infrastructure/information was available already - than the "first months" (i.e. 2009) you speak about...
What I think is nice about the distribution is that the first pioneers/proponents/inventors/believers/hodlers are rewarded. Not the lazy/dumb people who ridiculed the idea. Distribution of bitcoins is not even - but it is nice that people with most bitcoins are not the fiat-richest people.

See here:
...fee for fast confirmation is currently 0.00320 BTC/KB (320 sat/B). 
With absolute fee of 0.0006 BTC your transaction had 76.825 sat/B ([here]( with 0.001 BTC absolute fee, it has 0.00128 kB/B ([here]( - no idea why BCI is not showing this replacing transaction) which is still quite low. 


Your transaction has 5 inputs which is a lot (size of this transaction is big so you need to pay high fee to get it confirmed in foreseeable future) - so you should just wait - either it gets confirmed or you get your bitcoins back (they never left technically unless the transaction is confirmed).
When you need high-priority transaction (that confirms under 1 hour) you should use 1 input only so your transaction is not big (in bytes) and so you don't need to pay so much in fee to have priority.
Otherwise it is good to do a consolidation transaction that pays relatively low fee (like you have there now or lower), wait for moments when network is less busy and get the transaction confirmed that joins the many small inputs together so your next transaction can be cheaper...
That said - if this is high-priority transaction for you (unfortunately), increase fee so it is at least 0.0025 BTC or more. Otherwise wait &amp; think about how to join those inputs as cheap as possible.

If hashrate is growing there should be more than 1.0 blocks in 10 minutes, if hashrate is dropping, there should be less than 1.0 blocks in 10 minutes, if hashrate changes but then stops changing, there should be 1.0 blocks in 10 minutes after the difficulty change. 
It's written nowhere that block time should be 10 minutes all the time. It's written in the code (which matches the original intent I guess) that difficulty changes in such a way that the block time is 10 minutes ***if*** the hashrate is not changing from the moment of the difficulty change on.

Bitcoin was designed to be sound money - if a group of people of constant size use it for everyday stuff as you say, it should/will not be losing its value (oscillations ignored). 
But this in turn means that its value will go up - if more people join or if we "create more value" by being more productive. There is no way how to avoid this (unless you want Bitcoin to behave like fiat with central bank) and it would even make no sense IMHO.
I believe that Bitcoin is useful - and so there will always be at least as much users as there are now. So, value will not go down and it is ok to recommend it as savings/"investment" vehicle (if you draw the attention also to the risks). It can happen that there will be much more users, so it is possible that the value will be much higher - I too have no problem with revealing this to outsiders. The risks might be high, the potential reward of savers might be high. We need to deal with this.

No. Aside from higher fee or longer confirmation time now (network is quite busy).
Not sure if you are aware: you can have the same wallet on both computers (just restore from seed). You can have more different wallets on one computer too (use '-w' command line argument followed by path to (new) wallet file).


Yes. 


Yes. You can even send bitcoins to wallet (address) that was generated on computer that was never connected to internet.

Ahh, it didn't notice this... That's bad - also a lot of inputs and small fee - so the chance it will get confirmed is quite small &amp; increasing the fee would make the transaction very expensive.
So, what I said before - this time for your friend: wait till network is the least busy (weekends) and try to get that transaction confirmed with low fee. Low meaning 50 - 100 sat/B.


(S)He probably didn't have enough bitcoins left in the wallet.


As I said, requiring transaction with many inputs to go through ASAP can be very expensive so I would not recommend it (first consolidate inputs in low fee low priority transaction (that can take weeks to confirm and you would even need to rebroadcast/redo it multiple times even)). 
Other than that - you are doing it right. Just "Increase fee" when needed (but then that creates new transaction, so the transactions that used the outputs of the previous low-fee transaction will become invalid). 
I would also recommend upgrading Electrum - things were changing quickly &amp; there were many things implemented in the recent months - so it's best to have Electrum at least in version 2.8.2.

Fees went up recently because of heavier traffic.
See here:
160 sat/B has good chance to be confirmed today. You should always use only 1 input for priority transactions. If you have many tiny inputs, consolidate those with low fee low priority transaction when network is least busy. Use Electrum - there you can select exactly which inputs you want to use (Coins tab).


All wallets need fees.


Do one large payment to top up your steam wallet (before sales begin) &amp; then buy multiple games using your steam wallet. This way you need only one BTC transaction for many games and this transaction can even be medium or low priority.

Segwit: separation of the "witness" part (signature) of the transaction from the rest. This is because it fixes malleability and also it allows forgetting about witness part when it is no longer needed (saving storage and bandwith). Also the "Segwit upgrade" brings other improvements - fixing quadratic hashing and allowing script versioning which can lead to immense improvements later (like MAST). 
UASF - usually we go with MASF (Miner Activated Soft Fork) - when enough miners signal for the change, the change will happen then. However, miners are not signalling Segwit in enough numbers. This might be because (some of them) are using unfair advantage (ASICBOOST) or because they are afraid that they will lose part of fees because Segwit allows for simpler offchain solutions (lightning network, and others). So - miners don't want to trigger the change, but if enough users want the change, the change can happen - users can chose how the network should look like (or what network they want to participate in) by choosing their client (Bitcoin client program they run). So, if enough users (and businesses) run new version of software that forces the change, the change will happen.

our side: ok here is solution that optimizes things &amp; has 2 MB blocks &amp; doesn't do a problematic HF
their side: we want HF, we want 2 MB blocks as we wanted before (without optimizations) - or the above optimizations and 4 MB block size (2MB effective via Segwit + 2MB blocksize =&gt; leading to 4MB effective)
HF is unnecessary now &amp; dangerous. If we want SF and they want HF then there is no compromise to be found. Let them hardfork to create their own coin.

Just send new transaction. (Ideally using the same coins as the old transaction can be rebroadcasted any time if you do not do that and there would be risk that your payment will be done twice (your new transaction and that old transaction that now disappeared but which can be rebroadcasted by anybody anytime).)


You mean RBF feature. 
You have to enable "Replace-by-fee" in Preferences in older ver (2.7) or set "Propose Replace-By-Fee" to "Always" in v2.8+. Then you should have "Replaceable" checkbox when sending.
CPFP is used when you want to kick existing unconfirmed transaction into blockchain by issuing one new transaction that uses one of its outputs &amp; pays fees for both. You don't need this when you are sending new transaction with RBF - you can just increase fee if RBF ("Replaceable") was enabled (right mouse button in history - and "Increase fee").

Default time to drop was changed from 3 days to 14 days in new version of Bitcoin client. So - one of the new clients probably sent the transaction again to the block explorer you are using (and to your wallet server (if you use light/web wallet)).
Even after those 14 days, anybody can rebroadcast your transaction (or the miners can have longer time to drop set - so they can mine also older transactions).
The solution is to use RBF.

No, nothing like that is possible. Bitcoins are in blockchain - any wallet that has the private key (corresponding to given address) can control those bitcoins.


Most likely the transaction had low fee (and/or unconfirmed parent transaction) and was dropped - so the bitcoins should be visible in the original address as if nothing happened.

No, seed is just a single huge number from which you can generate all private keys by some mathematical operation. You can do this offline, nothing needs to be retrieved from the internet.
To give oversimplified example: 
seed is a number, say: 203509200
and that mathematical operation is addition of two, 
then the sequence of private keys would be: 203509200, 203509202, 203509204, ...
and other person would be having 13798231 as seed and then the private keys: 13798231, 13798233, 13798235, 13798237, ...
In real life, seeds are far bigger numbers than I used above and that mathematical operation is a bit more clever - so it is virtually impossible to find a seed or private key by brute forcing (trying all possible or trying random guesses).
See also 


Yes, the seed itself is randomly generated - but from it, thousands and thousands of private keys can be generated in a predictable way. And each private key then generates one bitcoin address in a predicable way. So - seed restores the whole wallet.


Signing with private key is how you control bitcoins that are "in" corresponding address. You can mess with those directly (e.g. export single private key of single address from your wallet and import it into other wallet - or even create raw transactions by yourself) or you can let your wallet shield you from these difficulties - Electrum with its seed does it pretty well.

Electrum is the best wallet, really - especially for beginners.


You have to enable "Replace-by-fee" in Electrum menu: Tools-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Fees. And then check "replaceable" when sending transaction. This creates RBF transaction labelled "Replaceable" in history - right mouse button on it then allows you to "bump fee"...

I don't know why you are referring to "suckers" in context of Bitcoin - I think that suckers are people who are coerced by authorities to use their currency that they can - and is - debased &amp; confiscated at whim.
So, you moved goalpost from "Bitcoin is useless" to "Bitcoin is useless to a hungry guy in Iran (unless he finds a "sucker")." So, you would call [this guy]( a sucker, right?

Bitcoin is designed to have limited supply (21 million bitcoins). The problem of the initial distribution is addressed by giving bitcoins to people who help the network (miners). The schedule is decreasing - we want to give more bitcoins at the beginning for various reasons - and halvings every 210000* blocks was a simpler solution - more simple to program and understand than e.g. linearly decrease. I also like that it sends some ripples - something that is not changing is boring.

You should use Electrum wallet and enable there "Replace-by-fee" in preferences so you can mark transaction as "Replaceable" - then you can send the transaction with moderate fee &amp; increase it if needed. 
Miner fees depend on the size of the transaction in bytes (on the size of the data that represents the transaction), not on the size of the transaction in BTC. The more inputs you have in your transaction the higher fee you have to pay (every incoming transfer created one additional output in your address - this output you then use as input in your sending transaction). 
So, when you use 1 input in your transaction, your transaction should be under 260 bytes and the fee is at most $2 currently for fast confirmation. If you have many inputs - e.g. 10 - you might be required to pay e.g. $10 fee. 
$1000 fee is absurd even if you had tens of thousands of minuscule inputs in your transaction - so it is most likely a "malfunction" of your wallet (wrong fee calculation). As I said above - it is best to use "Replaceable" (RBF) - you can start with small fee &amp; gradually increase it if the transaction is not confirming...

Or you can use light client that is quite secure, but not totally private. I recommend Electrum @ desktop and Mycelium/Breadwallet @ mobile. Be sure you backup your seed on paper(s)!
Last option is using web wallets - but this is not recommended (they can steal your bitcoins &amp; you don't have sufficient control over transactions that you are sending (Electrum allows you to pick exactly which inputs you want to send &amp; it also allows you sending transaction as "replaceable" so you can increase its fee when needed.)

Toxic! Toxic! Toxic! Vitriolic! ...can we make it more toxic by repeating this 'toxic' 'toxic' word? It's a bit [tinny]( Tit! Tit! ... 
Goon! ...that's a woody sounding word!
Joking aside, the community is not toxic as a whole - there are just some (few?) individuals that want to do as much harm here as possible. I believe most of these are socks of [those butthurt buttcoiners](


What criticism is not allowed?


I am very enthusiastic about Bitcoin, I think it is similar to the computer itself (or internet) - very open, very versatile, anti-fragile, with extreme potential. I think it is better to push forward at nearly all costs (so we can unlock the full potential of this thing) than to waste the energy by being emphatic with utterly all naysayers all around - of which some are really pathetic. 
I think all the great things we take for granted now (electricity, combustion engines, flight, automation, etc.) were met with opposition from people who were not able to think out of the box when the first crude/smelly/dangerous prototypes began to appear. The inventors and proponents were seen as lunatics - thank god they kept pushing forward despite all the negative people around. Like if wrestling with our own stupidity/nescience was not hard enough.

You should move significant portion out of the gambling site (it can be closed any time, your account there can be hacked, etc.).
Try more things - Mycelium on mobile, Electrum on PC, even some webwallets (keep not more than 5-10 BTC there). Think a bit about security (e.g. it is better to generate your wallet on offline computer) and try everything with small amounts first. 
Good luck, have fun.
Edit: regarding keeping/selling - I recommend turning one half into fiat/goods ("security" and immediate fun) and keeping the other half in BTC (a bit of a gamble - but it's hell of a ride &amp; you are part of the revolution!).

It was 3 days but recently (0.14) it was changed to 14 days. Also, anybody can rebroadcast the transaction &amp; add another 14 days.

If they do that bruteforcing for billions of years - then maybe. The difficulty of this is easily calculable - if 12 words wasn't secure we would be using 14 words which would make it 4 million times harder or 15 words (8 billion times harder), etc. - and you even can if you are so paranoid - you can call the seed generating function in Electrum and say it you want to generate seed with more entropy. ....but there is no need for that - we know that 12 words is secure.
The same is for addresses - people are asking if bitcoin addresses (and their corresponding private keys) are long enough so the can't be brute forced. Yes they are - if they weren't we would be using longer numbers. It's simple math.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:08:33
They control your wallet (i.e. your private keys that are in the wallet which enable them to send your bitcoins) &amp; promise you to do what you want. But - if they go bankrupt or robbed or if they just run away (exit scam), you have bitcoins no more. 
So, it's better to have bitcoins in wallet that is controlled by you.

You harvest apples from your garden. You go to town market. ...what determines the price of (your) apples?
For simplicity - let's assume all apples on the market are alike. 
Who/how decides the price? Sellers decide for how much they want to sell - if it is too much, they will not sell anything, if they set it too low they will get all apples sold quickly (&amp; other sellers will be selling for more). This all depends on buyers - if there are many (at current price) - sellers can decide to rise the price. If there are not enough buyers at current price (not many buyers at all or many buyers but all want to buy at lower price), sellers have to offer lower price if they want to sell something...
This exact thing happens in bitcoin markets - sellers offer bitcoins for price they decide &amp; (each of the) buyers decide if they buy at this price or not. See "asks" - [blue bars in bottom chart here]( or also [red line in bottom chart here]( Also buyers are making orders ("bids") (see red bars / green line there) - you as a buyer can declare: "I want to buy 1.5 BTC at price $200/BTC" ...then this order of yours sits on the exchange until some seller decides to sell to you at this price. (If your price is too low you might wait long/indefinitely - as all the sellers are selling to buyers who offer to buy at higher prices...)

I think there certainly is/are bot(s) like this - however not easily available. If you spend some time learning (&amp; live with the risk of messing up and losing your BTC) you can write the bot by yourself.
Start here:
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:30:28


It should be already dropped by now. (Default time to drop is 72 hours.) 
Try to check this: is it still visible in online blockchain explorers? (btc.blockr.io, blockchain.info, insight.bitpay.com, live.blockcypher.com) If yes, it's possible that it was reabroadcasted - but this is unlikely.
If it doesn't exist in the network, your client might be somehow confused - I would try to restart it, reconnect (click green button &amp; ok), change different Electrum server.
If the above doesn't help, you can try to recreate your wallet from seed on other machine or simulate it on your machine - either move your wallet file somewhere else or use this:
    ./electrum -w PATH_TO_NEW_WALLET_FILE
...to make electrum use different wallet file (it will not find it &amp; it will prompt you for seed). Or you can use this:
    ./electrum -P
    ./electrum -D SOME_DIRECTORY
....this should make electrum use different directory - so it might resync all the data it needs.
If your transaction is not urgent I would advise to wait 1 or 2 more days so it is dropped &amp; you can resend (with RBF preferably). 
If you need it to be done ASAP you can do CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) - if you use your change output of the unconfirmed tx in a new tx that has large enough fee (to pay for both those transactions), miner that mines the second one must also mine to previous one.

I wouldn't take HW wallet to abroad. 
Just phone and like 3 to 6 seeds on paper - in a book, diary or whatever - either directly written or somehow indicated (backup those seeds at home too). Each of these seeds with 0.5 to 2 BTC...
Also friend would be a complementary option - if you have trusted friend you can give him control over up to 5 or 10 BTCs, give her address(es) generated by one of the seeds you take with you (see above) - so when you call (or give another signal you agreed upon - like some exact formulation in your twitter message) she will send you those bitcoins there.
Or maybe you can give the seed directly to your friend so she can read it to you over phone when you need it. You can put there some additional words (that only you know) so she (or anybody else listening) will not be able to use the seed.

It's not, trust me. I watch it for years already - and it is doing exactly the opposite than what I expect. Every single time. Every time I was trying to day-/week- trade I got burned.

Costs will be also decreasing. If you insist on your 1 BTC per day wage even when BTC goes from $250 to $1000 to $5000 - I can assure you there will be many people willing to work for 0.5 BTC/day and then for 0.1 BTC/day etc...
You - as an employer - can IMO also quite easily explain this to your employees. The value of bitcoins goes up so amount of bitcoins earned will be decreasing by some factor that you agree upon with your employees. Both sides will be happy - purchasing power of employees will be growing - but not as fast as the growth of the value of the currency unit.

They will be probably taking less risks - but I don't think this must translate into limited innovation. Are F1 pilots who risk more learning faster? Are they better drivers? Are all the races in general better when there is more risking?
Will you reach your goals faster when you are forced to immediately spend your money? Or could it be better if you have time to think &amp; to wait for the right opportunities? 
"companies will not be forced to take risks therefore there will be less innovation" is too simplictic IMHO. This is the same as the naive: "if value of currency goes up, people are/will not be spending it" ...in fact the opposite is true - the higher the value of bitcoins is, the more people spend them. One reason is that if the price is high it is likely we are in bubble phase and that it will go down in the future. Second reason is that people buy things as soon as their price is below some threshold. I'll not buy new car if it costs 100 % of my current savings - but I'll buy it if/when it costs 25 % of my current savings or less.

What do you mean by "country has Bitcoin price"? 
Considering exchanges - it depends which exchanges can be used from given country (fiat bank wire transfer available to exchange) and what are the fees for transfer and for eventual fiat conversion (when local fiat is not traded for BTC @ exchange). So, whole EU can have the same price (Bitstamp or Btc-e should be reachable via SEPA).
Considering local trades - it would be interesting to see localbitcoins price summaries/charts (for cities and whole countries), but I'm not aware of any site showing this besides [localbitcoins]( itself (where it's not summarized and converted to 1 currency for easy comparison). ...but it could be interesting to analyze such data.

Trezor is HW wallet. Private keys cannot leave it - it just uses it internally to sign outcoming transactions. So, it can't be hacked even when used on infected machine.
Electrum manages private keys in your computer, so if your computer is infected you might lose your private keys (i.e. bitcoins). However, if you don't have secure OS like Linux and/or if you have larger amounts - there is mechanism for [cold storage with Electrum]( that let's you use private keys in Electrum only on machine that can't be infected (because it's offline) - your online Electrum wallet is only "watch-only" or "seedless" - used for checking balances and preparing transactions that will then be transferred to offline machine and signed there (and transferred back &amp; broadcasted from the online machine). There were no problems reported with cold storage Electrum so I assume it's reasonably secure...


First, they can't know what is your wallet - unless they have your seed. They might suppose that some addresses are yours (e.g. because they have logs of your withdrawals from exchanges), but they can only guess if the connected addresses are yours (usually change goes back to wallet, but it is not like that in all cases). 
Second, they can never prove that you can still control your bitcoins (unless they find your seed / private keys in your hand or computer or in your apartment). You might have lost your seed/keys in a boating accident or there might have been a theft in your apartment or your SO maybe threw that paper out with trash...
Third, if some hacker steals your bitcoins and transfers them, it will look exactly like if you move those bitcoins.
So, even if they declare it illegal, they can't do much with regards to you. You will be able to sit it out &amp; wait for change in stance of the ruling class - or if shit really hits the fan you will be able to use your bitcoins abroad (either send them to foreign friends or go there and use your bitcoins in person). That being said, I think the chance any 1st world gov banning Bitcoin is quite small (3rd world though...).

If I send bitcoins to your address I know it's your address - but when you send those bitcoins to yet other address I can't be sure about the owner of that address. It might be you or it might be completely different person in the other part of the world.
When you received bitcoins from me, you can believe that the sending address was mine (even this might not be true in all cases) - you can see which transaction sent bitcoins to that address of mine, but you can't know whether it was my address too or if it was sent by someone else.
There are ways how to guess which addresses are belonging to certain user (server logging IP address when light client is used; second/smaller output is usually change - it's likely address of the same user; there can be some repeating patterns; etc.). 
First step towards "better" privacy is using fresh receiving address for every incoming transaction. Full node is preferable over light clients. Clients can be communicating with server/peers over Tor. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:34:53
I don't believe there were substantial minimum fees used by miners as you say. 
However it could potentially be a solution to the problem of big blocks being filled to the maximum by unimportant transactions or spam. Too bad it can't be enacted - you can hardly make it consensus rule (a lot of people will be opposing that) and if you make it only local constant, at least some miners will be setting it lower than the competition &amp; these miners will then have competitive advantage because they will be collecting more fees. Again - miners have the incentive to fill the block completely - which then unfortunately burdens all full nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:15:51

How do you know receiving pubkeys? Do you mean receiving BTC addresses?
Can you annotate some of the most frequent addresses? (Like e.g. satoshi dice receiving addresses or exchange hot-wallets.)
There is weird mirror symmetry along the diagonal - are you sure you are not adding something that sould not be there (e.g. when I send from EE to AX, aren't you adding also AX to EE)?

How big is that transaction (what was the suggested fee per byte)? What wallet? Isn't it set to do priority transactions?
When there is less traffic in the network you can do your transaction with fee as low as 21 sat/B (0.2[μ](
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:36:57
See [here]( for current lowest fee for next block (300sat/B). You can also see there that 36 MB of transactions wait with fees above 140 sat/B - so your transaction will not be confirmed unless all these are confirmed first (and all other that will be coming with 140+sat/B in the future). I guess either it will takes 5+ days (or never as your transaction will be dropped first - which can take up to 14 days).

One thing is that the liquidity is orders of magnitude bigger, also the channels are established - with high throughput and low latency. There are more financial instruments and the main fiat currencies are ubiquitous with established infrastructure.
However, these bank-to-bank solutions are centralized and "cartelized". A bit like if you are wondering why prices of food are so different around the world when McDonald's prices are the same on many places in your country. If you were looking at e.g. USD to EUR rates in banks - it will be quite different from the rates you will have in streets of Berlin/Prag/Talin...
I believe that the differences in BTC prices are also caused by the fact that fiat is illiquid - if we go outside of that bank-to-bank-first-world-channels. You can move bitcoin freely around the globe, but it is very difficult to get fiat to/from exchanges or people in other part of the world. We are also dealing with cash - person to person - this has benefits (privacy, building of local communities) but also drawbacks - it is harder for buyers/sellers to complete the transaction (&amp; the price then reflects this).

Usually we do our shopping in the same store every week - payment channels / lightning network might excel for this kind of use.
Other important use case that gives Bitcoin value:  
Many people use Bitcoin as store of value.
What I also like is that you can transact globally across borders. Bypassing the walls &amp; the gatekeepers. You can endow/pay people from Iran, Bangladesh, Venezuela, North Korea without any fat toads telling how you can or cannot send your money.
Why I value Bitcoin is also because it is a case in point - it proves that alternatives are available and viable - alternatives to the monopoly national state enforced violence backed fiat currency and financial system: "*Hey guys with your economic "nobel" prices: Bitcoin didn't die, Bitcoin survived your attacks, bitcoin works, deflation is viable - stop controlling people's lives with your pseudoscience, come out of your ivory towers and start learning about how the world works."* :)

No. Just buy &amp; put it into cold storage, you don't need to worry. 
If chain split happens due to SF or HF, you will have coins on both chains - you don't need to do anything if you want to keep to hold. After some time there will be simple options how to split the coins - probably the simplest will be sending to an exchange that will credit you the same amount of coins for both chains that you will be able to send/sell independently then.


No, Bitcoins are fungible and there is no taint there from who sold it to you and what political stance she/he/they had. All bitcoins are equal &amp; their "origin" is irrelevant. Bitcoins are bitcoins and unless the split happens all are equal. If the split happens, you will have the same amount of coins on both chains. 
The only problem with split for you is this: you will choose to use either the first or the second chain - one of them - you will do the transaction to someone thinking you are sending only the coins on that chain you have chosen - but - that transaction can be "replayed" on the second chain too (so the recipient will also get your coins from the other chain). So, in case of the chain split, it is safest either to do nothing (keep your pre-split coins that you have on both chains) or send the coins that you want to use to an exchange first where they split those coins for you so you can use those independently without the fear of replay on the other chain.

1 share ([$415 currently]( represents 0.093 BTC - so the price is like $4400 / BTC. Current BTC price is like $2500 - so there is 75 % premium on GBTC. 
This is caused by demand (people are buying it, because they can buy it with their IRA accounts which can't buy "normal" BTCs) and somewhat constrained supply (BTCs can't be directly &amp; immediately converted into GBTC shares, there is some long procedure how to get GBTC shares that are tradeable - so arbitrage can't be done).

The same added benefit is in my version too - your savings make someone else's capital worth more (or should we say bigger?). By keeping your money out of circulation, you make the rest of money worth more.


High inflation supports/induces "spend-before-earn" behavior. It encourages overspending, draining of resources, wasteful style. Easy credit makes companies risk too much. The winners are banking cartels - they profit from giving loans. They also profit because they can print money out of thin air. Would you believe it? We are forced to work like madmen to earn few coins - and they just hit 'Enter' and create another $1M. $1M we borrow &amp; repay with considerable interest.
I also believe that the manipulation with money supply (interest rates, etc.) excercised by central banks makes things worse. They try to "stabilize" things (or at least want us to believe that) - but what is really happening is that they smooth local oscillations a bit - but this at the expense of throwing the thing off balance in the larger picture. Instead of smaller osciallations and mild recessions every few years we get far worse turmoils every decade or two.

You are the first one here saying this in 4 years. Electrum code is open source, I am sure it's key generating/handling code is secure &amp; not malicious.
Your loss happened most likely because your computer (or your hard drive) was compromised. 
Also - why were you saving anything on hard drive? - all you need is to write the seed on paper. 


You didn't. *Cold storage* means that your wallet was generated (&amp; used only) offline (se e.g. [here]( how to do it with Electrum) - so there is no way how the private keys can leak to internet. 
If you ran your Electrum wallet on an online connected machine, then there is no way how you can make those keys "be in cold storage" - once these were in machine that was connected to inet there will always be potential that the keys were already compromised.

Yes. 


Yes. 
However you can make the current unconfirmed transaction get confirmed by using CPFP - child pays for parent: 
If you create new transaction (RBF recommended also) that spends output (e.g. change output) of your previous transaction AND has high fee (so together with the fee of your unconfirmed transaction it pays enough fee for both), you can make miners mine both. (They can't mine only the second, because it would be spending nonexistent outputs if the first wasn't confirmed first or together in the same block.)

Try other online blockchain explorers (insight.bitpay.com, blockr.io, ...). If the transaction is nowhere to be seen it was really dropped &amp; only your wallet needs to realize this:
Try to connect to other server in Electrum. If it doesn't help, you can try to run Electrum with different wallet file (either move existing elsewhere or use '-w' command line parameter). Or try also to tell Electrum to use different dir ('-D' or '-P' command line parameters). All these will let/force you to re-generate your wallet from your seed.

1. Identify the change output of your unconfirmed transaction.
2. Use that unconfirmed output as input in new transaction that pays enough fee for both transactions (fee per byte (sum absolute fees and divide by sum of sizes) should be over 160sat/B to have chance in hours or over 260 to have chance in next 30 minutes - see [here](
Wallets usually create new address for every new change, so you simply send bitcoins from that address in your second transaction.
I would also advise to use RBF (in Electrum you enable it in Preferences and then check "Replaceable" when sending the transaction) in your second transaction that does CPFP - so you can increase it's fee if needed. If you used "Replaceable" in your first transaction you wouldn't have needed CPFP in the first place (simple "Increase fee" operation is also cheaper than CPFP as you put 1 transaction in blockchain not 2).

Yes, but if you choose to accumulate some savings - it is still better to have it in bank where you get some small interest which can alleviate the pain of inflation for a tiny bit.


So nearly all people are fools then. We are discussing that accumulating savings is highly discouraged by current system of inflation - so that means that few people accumulate &amp; invest savings; much more people take loans so they can invest in e.g. their new business.


Interest (&amp; fees) they charge you is higher than the value of inflation - so lending money is profitable for them. 


Maybe - but that doesn't mean that it doesn't create bigger overall consumption.

Current support is irrelevant. It looks like miners signal what leads to slowest progress &amp; highest fees. The situation might/will change when UASF BIP148 is activated - if at least half the people support it (if new bitcoin is as valuable as the old bitcoin), it will be more profitable for miners to switch to mine BIP148 chain (because it initially has smaller hashrate so miners who mine it get more coins) - so miners who are now undecided and even miners who don't signal Segwit or who "signal" BU will start mining BIP 148 chain ...so the ratio of hashrates (non148 vs 148) will reflect the price of non148 coins vs 148 coins. 
I believe majority of users, devs and service providers will be valuing 148 coins more that non-148 coins because Segwit is (IMHO) the right technical solution. Miners will come.

Just wait a few days &amp; the transaction will disappear eventually.

As long as the following transaction is unconfirmed the transaction you ask about can't be confirmed (because it uses output created by this following transaction).
...see there that it is large (Size 	2404 (bytes)) and has small fee (Fee per byte 	34.056 sat/B).

If you have many incoming small outputs ("small" meaning smaller than what you expect will be your sending transactions in the future) it is best to consolidate those - e.g. in Electrum you can pick what inputs exactly you want to send (see below). 
So, you will send all these small pieces to your receiving address: you create 1 output of all these - so your next transaction using this as input will be cheaper. It also helps the network a little bit (UTXO count goes down).
The trick is to send this consolidating transaction when the network is least busy - i.e. usually on weekends (watch [this]( to get a feeling). Usual fee is 1.2 - 2.2 [μ]( (120-220 sat/B), but when you are lucky to pick the right moment when network is not busy, your transaction can be confirmed with fee as low as 0.20 [μ]( (20 sat/B). ...this is important because your consolidating transaction will be big (measured in bytes) as it will have many inputs. 
If you are unlucky (fee too low and/or network was busier than expected) your consolidating transaction will get dropped - bitcoins will be still there in those small pieces like before so you will be able to retry the same thing (if you expect it, you can even save the transaction into file &amp; let Electrum rebroadcast it on next occasion).

For price to stay at your value (any value you want to set), you need two things: buyers willing to buy at that price and no sellers that want to sell at lower price. 
You can imagine that when the new price is set to $100K, not many people will be buying - "Why should I buy at $100K when the price was $100 just a week ago?!" Very few bitcoins will be traded. But - some people want to get rid of bitcoins and they do not want to wait - so these people - sellers - will start to offer lower prices than $100K... 
The price will be getting lower and lower - and finally it would reach the price you see now on your ticker. It's the equilibrium between buyers and sellers. You can't force people to buy higher when there are people who want to sell at this price. In the same way - you can't force people to sell lower if there are buyers who want to buy at current price (that would be: "What can't we agree that price of bitcoin is $1? (So we all can buy more.)"...).

I think there is enormous potential in Bitcoin - and even if it ever gets overshadowed by other cryptocurrency or similar system, it still might be well worth to invest now (also the experience is priceless)...
My advice is to do cost averaging (e.g. buying $100-worth of BTC every month) for long enough (e.g. 2 years). If you do this, oscillations in price are irrelevant.

I think not - if feels like senseless for-profit gambit only - but who knows. It's a reckless push for significant change in Bitcoin and its development.
Segwit2x is maliciously marketed as compromise - but it is unacceptable to many (majority? of) people because it is a hard fork - which means that absolutely all nodes will need to be upgraded to to new code - this is both unnecessary bordering reckless. 
UASF BIP148 is user-triggered soft fork. Soft fork means that if some nodes run this new Bitcoin client (which has tighter rules than the previous version), new rules will be in effect, but there is no big pressure to upgrade older nodes as the change is backward compatible - so the infrastructure can run as it is now if the new functionality is not required.


No. Segwit2x should activate Segwit (which BIP148 does,too, in other way), but it is not (or doesn't "contain") UASF (user activated soft fork).
Also, as all the current developers refuse to include this hardfork code into the (official) Bitcoin Core client, so people pushing for the hardfork needed to establish new code repository. This means Segwit2x is maintained and updated by completely different people - like **two** people. J. Garzik is quite experienced, but if Bitcoin continues to live in that repository with only 2 developers and none from the current Bitcoin team - it would be tragic loss of talent and experience (Bitcoin Core is maintained and updated by 10+ veterans and other 50-100 more or less experienced developers). It would be absurd in my eyes and I can guess that the bigger part of the community thinks so too.

Your bitcoins never left. Only when the transaction is confirmed, then those bitcoins are considered transferred. 
14 days is the default time to drop from mempool, but every node can adjust this according to momentary needs. Also anybody (senders wallet or any node in the network) can rebroadcast transaction that was dropped from mempools (of some nodes).


Best thing is to use RBF (Replace by fee) next time. It's available in Electrum wallet. WIth it you can increase fee of transaction that was already broadcasted (but is still unconfirmed).


Don't worry, you have no problem if your transaction is low priority. You cannot lose BTC like this. As you can see in following links, network is not that busy in the last couple of weeks - even transactions with fee under 0.1uBTC/B (1sat/B) were confirmed. Best chance is at night over the weekend. Just wait &amp; don't worry. ;)

It's likely that Satoshi mined most of the first blocks (and it is almost sure that he forged the genesis block) - so it is likely that he had possession of the private keys (which public keys and their addresses are derived from) from these early blocks. 
If somebody proves (by signing something or by moving bitcoins) that (s)he has control of private keys from these first blocks, it would make it clear that that person is either Satoshi (or part of it) or that he somehow acquired those keys from Satoshi (by stealing, inheritance, or any other means - heck, Satoshi could even be giving keys to strangers to create confusion)...

Mark transaction "Replaceable" when you are sending. (You need to enable "Replace-by-fee" in Preferences.) Then you can increase fee at will (also many times) if transaction confirmation takes too long.

We can't fit all possible transactions into blocks. It was just the exception of the early years that the blocks were not full (with low or zero fees). 
From now on, blocks will always be full (not only because we have much more users and use cases, but also because there are nefarious actors who want to drag Bitcoin down by spamming it (and possibly profit from alts)). 
Bitcoin became too important - so as soon as it gets bigger blocks (be it 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB, 128 MB or whatever), these blocks will get filled with transactions. The bigger blocks, the smaller fees, the easier to fill the whole block with unimportant transactions or outright spam. So, network will always be "at max capacity" as you wrote - and it is bullshit that it is avoidable.
It is good that blocksize was not increased. Wallets are forced to face the reality sooner (the reality that transactions are not free and that there might be other users that want to pay more to have their transactions confirmed) and there is incentive for developing off-chain solutions sooner than later.
There will not be enough room in blockchain for every possible transaction - for all the coffees for all the billions of people and for all the sub-dollar-worth payments people would be glad to be making. Don't pretend the opposite.
The unique proposition of Bitcoin is it's censorship resistance that comes from it's decentralization. If you keep increasing blocksize too fast we are going to lose it.

When you are sending pre-split coins on chain A, you should be aware about the fact that your transaction might be replayed on the chain B, too. So, the recipient of your transaction might receive coins not only on chain A, but also on chain B. 
The solution is not to use pre-split coins in payments. Either split them manually: send the same coins to your address X on chain A and to your address Y on chain B ...split may fail if your transaction is immediately replayed - but you lose nothing - you would just have your coins in e.g. address X on both chains &amp; you can try to do the split manually again. Or you can do the split more conveniently (and less privately) by sending those coins to exchange that is known to support both chains and which will split your coins for you (you send there pre-split coins and they will credit you the same amount of (post-split) coins in two separate accounts - one for chain A and one for chain B).

Let's argue for the opposite: people will buy (or at least not sell now) because having coins now means having coins on all potential chains after the potential splits. Coming (non?-)events will give Bitcoin publicity and new people will be drawn into it. Finally, regardless of chainsplit happening or not - regardless of what chain is used more - people will start to be optimistic again about the future. 
So - you say price goes down from now, I say price stagnates and goes up... Not because I believe it wholeheartedly - more because I want to show that nothing is sure and that arguments can be done for both versions. E.g. a lot of people were spelling doom &amp; gloom when Silk Road was being busted - instead of bear market it started a huge rally.

Yes. However the default time to drop was increased recently from 3 days to 14 (and anybody can rebroadcast the transaction then to add another 14 days).
Best way is to enable RBF in Preferences and use "Replaceable" in each transaction that is being sent. Then, "Increase fee" is available.
Currently it's reasonable to send the transaction with fee of 150 sat/B and then increase it after some hours/days if needed (to be slightly above the momentary recomendation which is stated [here](

Your transaction is big as it has many inputs - wait for some moment when network is not busy. 40 sat/B (or even 25 sat/B) has a chance to be confirmed when there is low traffic. Watch fees required for next block here (rightmost column tells you what will get into next block):
When you consolidate your inputs, your next transaction will be cheaper as it will be smaller - 250 B instead of 2149 B of your current transaction.

There is also yet other possibility - creating "double send" transaction that is using the same bitcoins.

I don't understand it - let's ban it! Oh, well.
If you ban that, user will just generate new address for each of those outputs instead of using single address. You will not be able to ban that. It makes also no sense to maintain code that will be forcing users to do that meaningless change in behavior.
One purpose can be this: this is address of a father who will be giving allowance to his son - exactly 0.002 BTC every month (sans fee). When are outputs prepared like that (when fee is low now), he can save on fees later - as the allowance transactions can then be of minimal size: 1 input 1 output (i.e. no change required).

You have to do this as people tend to spend bitcoins more when the price is high (when price drop is likely). However, this doesn't mean you can't store money in bitcoin - you just use cost averaging to shield yourself from volatility. So,

I don't care for 3 reasons:
one - users are paying the electricity;
two - mining is often done in places where they have excess of electricity that would be otherwise wasted to a large degree anyway; also the output heat can be used for heating;
three - current (central) banks and payment system use a lot of electricity too (but no one cares).
four - Bitcoin will not be mainstream any time soon, a lot can happen 10-20 years from now (even POW change is not out of question - but energy consumption would be the least important reason for change IMO).

Read through links in sidebar - Getting Started, FAQ, Common Myths.
Install Electrum  and Mycelium/Breadwallet  get first small amount of BTC - forget about faucets, it's not worth it; either try to do some [job for bitcoins](or buy from local people (localbitcoins.com) or from B-ATM (coinatmradar.com) or from exchanges - if you can register &amp; send bank wire (bitcoincharts.com/markets). When you have your first BTC, play with it - send it back and forth between your wallets/addresses (wait for weekend when fees required are usually lower). You will get familiar fairly quickly.
Then think how to get more BTC (if you decide it's worth it for you).
Once you have more BTCs than 0.1 on your local machine (or sooner if you don't have Linux) look into more secure storage options - i.e. "cold storage". Electrum has [cold storage]( option - you need to have machine that is not connected to inet (either dedicated machine or machine booted with live Linux CD with disabled network) and create your new offline wallet in it - you can then create "watch-only" (i.e. "seedless") version of it on your online machine. Other cold storage options are paper wallets (that has just one private key - address pair) or hardware wallets.

Deflation stemming from ultra-cheap credit (excessive money printing): BAD
Deflation stemming from increases in productivity &amp; savings: GOOD
Monetary inflation - i.e.  money printing - is like cocaine. Short term boost might be interesting - but if you try to keep it going for weeks/years you are going to have very very bad time. You need to increase the dosage to sustain the same effect - and even that begins to fail after some time. Soon you drop to the ground completely worn out, everything just far worse than not using it at all in the first place. 
Central banks are not curing the business cycle - they are making it far worse. Instead of mild recessions every few years we get (less frequent) complete meltdowns.

Hashing power and the number of transactions per second are quite unrelated. The difference between network hash power of 1 PC and of 100,000 supercomputers is not in speed - but in security.

Are you sure they aren't going to beat those bitcoins out of you instead of selling you the goods?
Alternative A0: Friend on internet
0. Have a friend on the Internet, agree with him on the signal (telephone  call, etc.).
1. Make your seller prepare his/her BTC address in advance - i.e. now.
2. Prepare a transaction that sends the required amount to the seller, give this (raw) transaction to your friend.
3. Go to hostile location, check the goods and if everything is ok, proceed with step 5.
4. Give signal to your friend to release the transaction to the Bitcoin network.
Note: to ensure the process will work I would suggest trying the exact steps 2. and 4. with small BTC amount (i.e. you will prepare the raw transaction, give it to your friend, go home, give him the signal &amp; watch how the payment goes through).
Alternative A1: You are alone
0. Install new Electrum / buy Trezor, create new seed, send bitcoins to this wallet of yours.
1. Tell the seller to prepare a machine with this exact Electrum or Trezor.
2. Memorize / write down the seed (split into more redundant pieces).
3. Go to hostile location, check the goods and if everything is ok, proceed with step 5.
4. Tell the seed to the seller - he/she should be able to immediately use your bitcoins.

One of the Bitcoin design goals was to be an anti-thesis to the current system of money printing where inflation of currencies is sought &amp; enforced which leads - among other bad things - to transferring power from people (savers) to money printers (banks) and money lenders (banks). So, instead of inflating indefinitely, Bitcoin is designed to be scarce - there will never be more than 21 million BTC.
More detail: the amount (see *BTC Added* and *End BTC* [here]( of BTC produced in 4 year intervals is a sum of a [geometric sequence]( with ratio 0.5. This ensures that the amount never goes above 21M and also it was/is favoring earlier adopters. (One of the problems of creation of new currency is how to bootstrap it - how to spread it among people. Hopefully among people who will be using it in the future. In Bitcoin this is done by block reward - bitcoins that are newly created are awarded to miners who secure the network.)

It's a way how the whole Bitcoin network - that has no center, no central node - can agree what happened (i.e. what transactions - i.e. bitcoin transfers - took place). 
It's also kind of lottery - all miners around the world with their specialized HW try to create the next block (from the unconfirmed transactions their received from peers) - but only one in 10 minutes on average is lucky &amp; finds the correct block (block is a piece of data containing Bitcoin transactions which also contains digest of the previous block - so we can be sure that this block follows the previous one (so we have a chain)). 
Then, the block is spread rapidly to all neighbors in the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. All (full) nodes validate the block (which takes seconds only) and re-broadcast it to all neighbors again. Transaction in the block are said to be "confirmed".

"if music/movie torrenting is ever successful we will just kill it" 
It turns out you simply can't stop decentralized systems. It will still be used "under ground" after the ban. Also, they can't ban it globally. There will be places where it will be thriving without interference - bringing prosperity and freedom.
There was a lot of fear two+ years ago that the ban will happen, that government(s) will fight us. With passing time it seems more and more unlikely. Too many smart (and possible influential) people understand Bitcoin &amp; banning it now would result in a massive wave of activism, public discussions &amp; outcry, Streisand effect and what not. Bitcoin is freedom; complete open and honest alternative to ossified vampire cartels and abused control; it's good for people - why would governments want to deny us that? They are there to do the best possible to improve our lives!


Unlike with the fiat system, nobody forces you to participate. Feel free to invest just a tiny bit of your time/energy/wealth, feel free to wait outside. For me personally - Bitcoin opened whole new world, it turned me from complete resignation and ignorance; it gave me hope. Anything can happen now. Look how new technology is taking the world by storm - AirBnB, Uber, IP telephony, encryption, data sharing ... drones, 3d printing, bioengineering, robotics, virtual worlds, space flight.

Depends on the price of BTC on both chains. 
Chain split chaos may lead to disillusion and to significant drop of prices, so the sum of value of 1 BTCA + 1BTCB would be lower than 1 BTC now.
Chain split chaos may lead to mass publicity, new people joining; relief in whole community and increased total utility (e.g 1 chain for decentralization and value keeping, second chain for coffee - somehow coexisting together and all together even more useful in total than Bitcoin is now), so the sum of value of 1 BTCA + 1BTCB would be higher than 1 BTC now.

I see the utility of Bitcoin (among others) in these things:
* it allows accumulation of savings without the threat of confiscation or dilution by inflation;
* it allows to transact freely with any peers anywhere;
* it is open technology platform that can be and will be extended in the future beyond our current imagination.
You really can't separate utility and scarcity when you contemplate value/price. We have essential things with utmost utility which are free - because they are so abundant everyone can have as much as he/she wants (e.g. air). We also have unique things that are valueless because their utility is near zero (e.g. every snowflake is unique, every stone or piece of wood is different, there are zillions of drawings or other "art" objects that nobody would pay for).
So what should be or is the value/price of objects? How much should a carrot cost? A cubic meter of air? A bitcoin? Is $600/BTC absurdly high or absurdly low? It always boils down to supply and demand...

Look at the shitty performance of dollar in last 100 years - its value went down to 10 % or less (and there are far worse fiats). Compare it to performance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going incredibly up all the time since its birth (if you smooth out the oscillations).


It's a tragedy that the average customer is dumb fool. I'd rather be free than be a servant. I despise banks - the way how they print the free "money" out of thin air - "money" that we have to work hard for. They abuse the regulations, they pretend they are helping us, they do nothing but accumulate wealth.




ETHF is too young. Also there are many new people that are not experienced with the scams and pump&amp;dumps. But I don't talk about that. I talk about the significant new ways of doing things that Bitcoin already enabled and about the things that can arise from the open platform in many years in the future. Maybe machines will be able to pay each other, maybe we will be able to transfer value to strangers just by look, blink/nod in return for small favors, maybe the blockchain will bring unprecedented transparency into state institutions. Anything can happen. Open source decentralized platform with open protocols where anyone can join &amp; extend the infrastructure. This is unprecedented in financial world.

They were part of the whole thing, they were creating the seeds of the community. People who didn't believe in Bitcoin sold already when the price rose 5- or 10-fold. People with many bitcoins who didn't sell after such rise took very high risk - as their bitcoins had considerable value and the future of Bitcoin was still very uncertain.
Also nice thing is that those people were different kind than the fiat-rich people. So - the "imbalance" in Bitcoin helps to balance things in the broader context.


This thing about savings is usually not understood by our economist charlatans. When you put aside some money (or even destroy it completely) - the value of the rest rises. So, people who do not use their bitcoins in fact increase the value of all other bitcoins (i.e. of possible investments of others, etc.).

Interesting idea. You might be on to something here - namely you are answering the question: *"How to allow miners mine bigger blocks - but at the same time disincentive it enough so they use it only if it is really needed so it doesn't burden foll nodes that much. (whatever 'really needed might mean')? ..."*
We could allow e.g. blocks up to 10 MB in size, but the miners would be required to "pay" if they want to mine bigger block than 1 MB.
The formula could be e.g. his:
    total_miner_income = block fees + 12.5 / max(1, (block_size / 1MB))
*  "total_miner_income" is the maximum allowed output of coinbase transaction
* 12.5 MB is the current block reward (will be 6.25 after next halving)
* max(1, (block_size / 1 MB)) is 1 if block is 1MB or smaller and block_size if block_size would be bigger than 1
...so - miner would be able to mine bigger blocks (up to 10 MB as we stated above), but the block reward would be smaller than usual if block is over 1MB (the bigger the block =&gt; the smaller the reward), so allowed size of coinbase transaction output (i.e. miner's income from block) would be as follows:
Miner income examples:
* 12.5 + fees ...if the block is 1 MB or under
* 10.0 + fees ...if block is 1.25 MB
* 6.25 + fees ...if the block size is 2 MB 
* 5.0 + fees ...if the block size is 2.5 MB
* 3.125 + fees ...if the block size is 4 MB
* 2.5 + fees ...if block size is 5 MB
* 1.5625 + fees ...if the block size is 8 MB
* 1.25 + fees ...if the block size is 10 MB
I can't see all the implications, but at first sight it looks like it could work. What is interesting is that the additional blockspace (over 1MB) will become cheaper when the block reward halves.
^(Technical detail: as used in discussion above - instead of burning it, it would be more simple not to claim it in the first place (as you can read in bitcoin wiki page "Controlled supply", coinbase transaction must not output more than reward+fees, but there is no rule for the lower bound - i.e. e.g. now, miner can claim just 0.1 BTC in new block instead of the usual 12.5 BTC + fees)^). ^(So - instead of forcing miner to burn, we can restrict her from claiming more than X in the coinbase transaction)^).
Edit: last sentence; less reward if bigger block clarification; 1.25 MB example
Edit 2:


might lead to 10 MB blocks if the transaction fee goes up just 3 times, so maybe the formula should be something that makes bigger blocks even more expensive, like:
    total_miner_income = (block fees + 12.5) / max(1, (block_size / 1MB))
or even
    total_miner_income = (block fees + 12.5) / max(1, (block_size*block_size / 1MB))

@_date: 2017-05-29 22:29:19
1. Yeah, many of the new ones might be just fads, just uninteresting mutations with carefully engineered marketing campaigns ...that will fade away sooner or later.
2. Who knows. What is "fake" anyway? 
3. Hardly. There will always be competition. Different alts will always try to succeed in general use or in selected niches. 
   Airplanes (or cars) are in many ways superior, but they are not the only way of transport (and best in every aspect). Bitcoin is decentralized (censorship &amp; confiscation resistant), programmable and with potential to evolve towards privacy, machine-to-machine use, more complex computation - but decentralization is hard in the same way as flight is hard (or maintaining the infrastructure for cars so all people can use cars) - you can't have airplanes that would out-compete tractors (or you can't have cars that would out-compete airplanes). 
   Important thing is that Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) bring us something that never was here before. 
   With regards to the "store of value" aspect of Bitcoin (and whether it can't be overruled by other crypto): I think Bitcoin has immense momentum (general public knows about it but not about any other alts), it has also the tradition (of cypherpunks, of striving for the alternative to official mismanaged "money") and the vision - the unique proposition of decentralization that is it's ultimate goal. It will be the antifragile, undestroyable alternative no matter what. It's hard to imagine how that should not be worth a lot.

If only they used "Replaceable" transaction for which they could be doing "increase fee"... Then - they can decide at any point if they want to bite their nails off or just pay one or two dollars as fee.


They will do what I said above. Alts are either cheap+fast ...or usable (well established, accepted at many places, not insanely volatile, well-known in general population). Still, Bitcoin is best (decentralization, security, innovation) and will be for a long time. Long Bitcoin short alts.

Online watch-only wallet - only knows about your bitcoin addresses so it can show you the balances, but it (hopefully) has no private keys.
Offline wallet - can't show you the balance (as it is not connected to the internet/blockchain) but you can send your bitcoins from it - which means you can offline-sign the transaction that is sending those bitcoins of yours.


Bitcoins are nowhere else than (in the transactions) in blockchain. What you store in your offline wallet are the private keys that allow you to send bitcoins from the corresponding addresses (from addresses that were generated from those private keys).

In x-middle I see sort of median - but this is by size occupied in block (i.e. what is the fee that half of the block space is occupied by transactions that have lower fee than this). 
What I am interested is median (quartiles) computed from transaction numbers (not sizes). I.e.:
* what is the (normalized) fee that 25 % of transactions in our block have lower &amp; rest have higher?
* what is the (normalized) fee that 50 % of transactions in our block have lower &amp; rest have higher?
* what is the (normalized) fee that 75 % of transactions in our block have lower &amp; rest have higher?
You should have good chance to be in next block if you pay higher fee than 25 % of transactions in the last block. Simple heuristics, but I didn't see it anywhere, yet.

How exactly you determine horizontal and vertical size of your orange boxes? I understand this: 


like that each orange box represents size of data of transactions that have this fee - but there are two vars (width, height) and this condition determines just a single one of those.
421657 - gray bar with $0.00 is confusing - at first sight it seems that the block is full &amp; contains many transactions without fee
When I click on the "green $ fee label" I fly sail to tradeblock where I see a single transaction - that is an example for the fee/box? There must be many transactions in the box, right? Maybe opening a list would be more clear? Or can't you display all transactions in each box? I.e. by composing each orange box of many tiny rectangles - each clickable, each representing one transaction...
I would like to see median line (or median mark on right hand side on the up-down axis) - also with number.
Great overall, very informative. Also data storage + static fee infos are nice touches.

What about this simplified version:
* P can spend only after the selected day passes (or blockchain block number is past defined number);
* people send bitcoins to addresses (or address? - could this be done with single address?) - but they can take back their bitcoins anytime (or e.g. two weeks sooner than P).
I do not understand the technical details (yet), but I am quite sure the above is possible with CSV.

Transaction throughput will be improved with time. Segwit first, eventual hardforks to bigger blocksize (years) later. A lot can be done with off-chain solutions, too.
We need to keep the decentralization at all costs. Because if we fail at that, the whole general idea of cryptocurrency might be suppressed for many years to come. Authorities attacking, new people scared off, everybody disillusioned. 
I would rather have $50 transaction fees than the real danger that nefarious authorities can go &amp; shut down all the seventy full nodes - putting the operators in jail for lifetime.
Even with $50 transaction fees, poor people in Africa can manage to do one transaction per year if the whole village joins (and if they keep the local ledger between them by their own means). They can be investing - accumulating deflationary currency, accumulating sound money. Globally, just this single "store of value" use can be very transformative. But again - it can only work if the whole system is decentralized - or else it will get destroyed.

Ponzi is this: you have a company that promises you to invest your money in some miraculous profit-making activity so you can have immense profit later. But in fact, there is is no such profit-making activity - they just use the money of the newcomers to pay off the previous "investments". 
Differences with Bitcoin:
* ponzi is pyramid scheme - it is guaranteed to fail sooner or later as you need always more and more money to repay the existing "investments" plus their promised profit... OTOH Bitcoin is different - if nobody joins from now on, Bitcoin will function just fine. We are - if you forgot about some civil wars - fine community of forward thinking people, we can build our own places and economies without ever needing more "money" from outside;
* ponzi is single company that sucks money from people... OTOH Bitcoin is not owned by any company, any fiat that is paid for bitcoins is received by "random" individual;
* ponzi is not useful by any means... OTOH Bitcoin is new technology that really works - transparently! - with numerous unique use cases;
* ponzi gives you just some vague promise from some company... OTOH in Bitcoin you really own the thing - that is useful and scarce;
...what makes people confuse these things is that you can try to pump the value of Bitcoin (even with vague or nonsensical arguments) in hopes to sell it with profit - but this is not different from any other thing that is being sold on Earth - I can come to you and sell you a painting or shoes or a necklace far above its **"**real**"** value if I bullshit you somehow - e.g. that painting is from Michelangelo! Those shoes are from camel belly skin (they will be in high demand by the oil kings as camels will be extinct in two years)! Those neclace is 100% gold with diamonds made in 15th century in Genova (its priceless, but I need the money now so I sell it to you for measly $10,000)! ...this happens all the time &amp; it is not a ponzi - its speculation or outright deception, but it's not ponzi. Ponzi sells you just vague promise, not a real thing (and contrary to what jstolfi just said to SEC, I believe that bitcoins are a real thing (albeit digital)). 
If Bitcoin is ponzi or ponzi-like - so must be also Google stock and any other thing you can buy.

Hashing **is** confirming transactions - once you found the correct hash - hash of the new block you are creating - this new block of yours becomes (in most cases) part of the blockchain. All transactions in this new block are confirmed by this.

If you make it through the registration process it is then quite simple. It should work as other normal exchanges:
You can immediately buy (sell) - "at market price" - which means that you fulfill the lowest sell order (highest buy order). 
Or, if the market price is too high for you and you think the price will go down, you can create buy order with a price you want to pay &amp; amount you want to buy (sell order with the price you want to get from buyer &amp; amount of BTC you want to sell). If there really be more sellers than buyers then, to put it simply, those sellers will be fulfilling more and more buy orders - starting with those offering to buy for highest price and continuing with those that want to buy for slightly lower price. This means that price goes down &amp; eventually some of the sellers will also be matched with your buy order.
When you buy/sell at market price you pay generally higher fees than when you are creating a buy/sell order. However, if you create e.g. buy order slightly below current market price, you run into danger that suddenly there can be a lot of buyers, price will go up and your order will still be there unmatched - now far below market price - so you will still have fiat and the price of bitcoin will be going up - so you will be worse off than buying at market price at the beginning without creating buy order.
There are also more complex types of orders, but you don't need to bother with those at the beginning.

Average is not that good measure here, because there is always someone who overpays by mistake or because the need for "ultra high" priority. Median or even other percentile on the lower side would be better. I.e. what is the fee in blocks that has 10 % of transactions in that block below (with lower fee) and 90 % of transactions above it in that block (with higher fee). That gives better idea what fees need to be paid to get confirmed. (OTOH, miners also include their 0 fee transactions in blocks - so the statistics will never be perfect.)
Also, absolute fee is useless indicator - you need to think in fee per byte. Your $4 avg figure (if it is right) is skewed by transactions which are not done by normal users - e.g. transactions with thousands inputs (mining pools, exchanges, mixers, ...).
Last but not least - fees required change with time. If this is right (I have seen it frozen for 2 days once):
\- it means that transactions with less than 90 sat/B are confirmed ...and it was probably even lower over the weekend (60 sat/B?). 100 sat/B is 1 uBTC/B - so average transaction with 2 inputs &amp; 2 outputs which is around 370 bytes would be 0.37 mBTC, i.e. 2850 $/BTC x 0.001 x 0.37 = 2.85 x 0.37 = $1. If you wait for weekend and/or use less than 2 inputs, you can transact in bitcoin for less than $0.6.

IOU stands for "[I owe you]( - they give you a paper/screen with a number, not the actual thing. It is not certain that you receive what you (should rightfully) own. They can go bankrupt or be robbed or just turn evil &amp; run with the bitcoins. Also, they can run [fractional reserve banking]( with the IOUs. (E.g. many people believe this is the case with gold - there are more gold IOUs that the actual amount of gold in vaults.)
Also we believe that Bitcoin is - or can easily become sound money ([fiat]( OTOH is not even money - as it is designed to lose value over time). Many of us believe that Bitcoin will be excellent store of value (the value might even multiply over time) - because Bitcoin is useful and it is [scarce]( The supply of bitcoins is hard-capped by the algorithm so it will never go above 21 million BTC.

Suggestion: 
Currently, there is no advantage for people who bet at the beginning. On the contrary - the later you bet the better for you because the multipliers are approaching their final state. E.g. I was betting on Portugal with multiplier 14x (after my bet it went down to 10x ...and just before the match the multiplier was 2.5x or something - even worse than on regular betting sites).
My idea would be that people who came late (just before the betting is closed) would pay the fee for the people who came first - i.e. for example if only two people bet the same amount, the first one will pay 0% fee and the last one will pay 10% fee (you have 5% fee, right ["*OneHash fees 5% of the bet pool.*"]( 
It could be even ampified a bit more - e.g. last to pay 15 % fee and first to pay -5 % ...so the first betters could even receive some small money from the late comers (in case they win of course).

Segwit itself is a good compromise. It allows very nice technologies [Segwit benefits]( and at the same time it surrenders to big blocker demands (Bitcoin Classic supporters at that time and XT after that) to enlarge the blocks.
Segwitx2 is not a compromise. It is contentious hardfork, hardforked coin will not be Bitcoin as it doesn't have consensus.


Hashrate is rather irrelevant for hardfork. Full nodes must upgrade. All of them. If they don't you get chainsplit and chaos. Also, there can be hardfork to other POW in some extreme cases (like China confiscating 70+% of hashpower, etc.) - hashrate means nothing then if (nearly) all nodes agree to HF to other POW.




You will have plenty of opportunities in the future to hardfork to more centralized and "less" Bitcoin systems.

Do not buy games directly. Instead, top up your Steam wallet (with enough to buy 5 - 10 games). Send the transaction as low priority (low fee) and replaceable (RBF in Electrum). If the transaction is not confirming in 1 week or so, you can incerase the fee. However, you have good chance that the transfer will be very cheap (fee might be 20-50 sat/B over the weekends) + there should be no surcharge (Bitpay should use average price on market &amp; then you have fiat and buy games for the fiat price that is listed in Steam).

Barry Silbert is pushing for what seems to be similar to Hong Kong agreement. This time it is New York agreement. (Un-?)Surprisingly without any core developers attending or agreeing (quite the opposite - see "LOL" [here]( But jgarzik is on the board (see github link below) for example.
The agreement between miners (and some businesses?) boils down to agreement to enable Segwit and then hardfork to 2MB blocksize limit (so blocks should be up to 8 MBs big with Segwit discount).
There is already [75%]( hashrate signalling. But the [hardfork code]( is rumored to be not finished yet.
The interesting question is whether this will lead to Segwit activation and whether the HF has chance to succeed (I suppose not or only partially as many people and even some businesses should prefer decentralization &amp; experienced dev team over hardforked coin). 
There were interesting things before this proposal - namely growing support for UASF-BIP148 softfork (also supported greatly by Luke-jr by including it as option into his Knots &amp; by discussing extensively [here]( and in other threads) and quite weird counteraction from Bitmain that boils down pretty much to *"if UASF-BIP148 succeeds somehow, we immediately do hardfork to bigger blocks (that we will mine in secret for some time)"*.

blockchain.info is 3rd party that you must trust, they can defraud your bitcoins or lost them due to incompetence (they had very serious security bug some months ago). I also personally hate them, because they stole the technical term "blockchain" for their business.
Electrum is fine - only you control your private keys there. However, if you generate/use your wallet on online machine, malware can steal your bitcoins. It's best to generate Electrum wallet in offline machine (dedicated old machine or computer booted with linux live CD with network off) - and use it like this:
(your private keys never left your offline machine; transactions you want to send are brought via USB disk/stick, signed on offline machine and then brought back again with USB disk/stick - so attackers from internet have no chance to infect your offline machine &amp; steal the private keys from it).

Buy your first bitcoins from ATM - see the [map]( and/or buy with cash from people in your ares - see 
For buying more &amp; regularly it's best to use exchanges (but they need quite intrusive registration): Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, GDAX, btc-e, Bitfinex...
When? ...It's best to buy many times ([cost averaging]( to shield yourself from volatility and also to reduce other risks (e.g. exchange can fail &amp; take away your bitcoins that you had there; also you will have time to research more secure solutions before you buy a lot - see e.g.  etc.).
You can watch the current price [here]( and you can study the history [here]( (switch to mtGoxUSD for 2009-2012).
You exchange back by reversing the buying process. You can sell to local bitcoin ATM, to local buyers @ localbitcoins or at exchanges. You can also buy stuff with bitcoins (e.g. games on Steam).
You should enable RBF (Replace-by-fee) in Electrum so you can send "Replaceable" transactions that enable you to increase the fee if needed. See [here]( for the current fee that gets your transaction into next block - the bigger the transaction (in bytes) the higher absolute fee needed to have the same priority. Usually, the network is least busy on weekends so it is best to do transactions over weekend if you can.
You can explore [here]( (blocks, transactions, addresses, ...and also various charts are there). And read [here]( and listen to [this guy](

If you have users, miners will come. ETC didn't die even though a lot of people were pushing pushing for HF.


You don't need to adjust difficulty - it is adjusting automatically. You just need to wait some time. If the hashrate is really small, fees will go up (if the chain is used - which it will be because a considerable amount of people will try to panic sell) and that will attract miners.

Bitcoin-core (Bitcoin-Qt) is the full node client - it downloads and verifies all transactions that happened since the beginning of Bitcoin (2009-01-03). With full node client you have maximum maximum security and privacy however you have to wait till it synchronizes for a day or two when you launch it for the first time (or after long time). Electrum is light wallet that synchronizes in seconds, it's secure too, but it can leak some information about you to the Electrum server. For basic use Electrum is great (also because it allows very handy coin &amp; fee control (manual selection of inputs; "Replaceable" transaction option to enable fee increasing; manual setting of fees).

First, money is not printed by banks into their pockets. Instead it is given to people who are securing the network.
Second, last 25 % of bitcoins are to be created. No fiat in the whole world can guarantee you anything like that - the only guarantee there is is that you will be losing value for all days till the end of the world. 
Third, while we have monetary inflation we have price deflation. More users are and will be joining. Even if not, the existing users will be more productive in the future and there will be more services and goods for the same amount of bitcoins - leading again to price deflation - to rise of value of our savings.
So, Bitcoin inflation is very different than fiat inflation.

Yeah. So, that is exactly the same as what I said - it's the same if you mine block that has coinbase transaction with outputs of 0 BTC and if you burn all outputs from your coinbase transaction - the effect is the same: there will be less coins.


That could work (100MB is too much though). There is already a mechanism how to make transaction outputs not spendable for certain amount of time - it's called Check Lock Time Verify (CLTV).
If making the block bigger means the miner will need to wait (far) longer for the coins to be spendable - then that could create some pressure for miners not to create too big blocks...


Yes. However, I would put there some fierce coefficient: 
* 1MB block -&gt; coins mature after 100 blocks (0.7 days); 
* 2 MB block -&gt; coins mature after 6400 blocks (44 days); 
* 3MB block -&gt; coins mature after 72900 blocks (500 days); 
* 4MB block -&gt; 409600 (7.8 years). 
:) Something like that... The above is this formula:
    time_to_mature_measured_in_blocks = 100 * (size_of_new_block_in_MB ^6))
(block size to the power of 6 multiplied with the current 100 block constant).
Also, I like the idea of prolonging that time after which miners can spend coins from mined blocks. I mean this unrelated to block size now. With every two new blocks I would make the limit 1 block bigger. I.e. after 1000 blocks from now, miners will need to wait 100+500 blocks for the coins to be spendable - instead of current constant 100. 
First, it could force miners to think more long term. - I think miners are quite short sighted. Their investments are planned to return in 12 or at most in 18 months (after that time they either need to buy new mining HW or switch to something else). They don't care much about what will happen with Bitcoin after that. The same like with politicians who plan just 4 years ahead - just for the length of their mandate. They give zero fucks about what will happen 10 years later. So - if we make the time to mature gradually longer, miners will be forced to think about the long(er) term future of Bitcoin, not just few months ahead.
Second, if coin maturation takes longer and longer with every new block it means that the supply would be decreased (more and more coins delayed) =&gt; price will go up. ;)

Some alts are on "mainstream" exchanges like Kraken or Gemini. Btc-e has also excellent track record despite being unregulated &amp; "anonymous". Poloniex is quite established, too.
You can see other alt exchanges also here:
Be careful - altcoins might be in a bubble stage right now. I advocate just buying &amp; holding bitcoins - buying using "cost average" method (e.g. buying $100-worth of BTC every month).

Use Electrum, enable "**Replace-by-fee**" and 
"Edit fees manually" in preferences, when sending transaction check "**Replaceable**" and select low fee manually (e.g. 0.0001 BTC). 
Then, look at that transaction in online blockchain explorer (in Electrum history click RMB and select "View on block explorer" - there you will see size in bytes.
Then, look [here]( to see what fee is recommended for next block (or inspect rightmost column to guess how can lower-than recommended fee work out) and calculate the absolute fee you need to reach fee per byte that you need for your priority (next block, today, this week). Click RMB on transaction in Electrum history and select "Increase fee" and put there the absolute fee that you calculated.
* flexible, you have total control
* cheapest, you can react to current situation
* you support Bitcoin Core miners (as other miners are not mining RBF transactions)
Other tips:
* consolidate small inputs in low-fee (-&gt; low priority) transaction that will confirm when network is not busy (over the weekend) - do as described above, aim for 20-40 sat/B fee (0.2-0.4 μBTC/byte);
* with a bit of skill - if you don't care about the exact amount transfered (e.g. when transferring between your wallets or when you have an input of suitable value that you want to send to friend) - you can create the cheapest possible 1 input 1 output transaction with fee that is just high enough to get you into the next block:
 1. wait for weekend when network is not busy
 1. select suitable input (Coins tab in nevest Electrum version)
 1. look at fee required (in sat/B), calculate absolute fee required - knowing the size of the tx will be 192 bytes
 1. subtract that absolute fee from the amount of bitcoins in your input - send that resulting amount + the rest will be the fee that is just enough to make it into block (still "Replaceable" is recommended) ...or you can first select that 0.0001 BTC fee (there will be change address) and the use "Increase fee" to set the fee to the fee you calculated above (Electrum will in newest version understand that what was going to change address in the first tiny-fee transaction will go to fee and will not include the change output in transaction at all (older Electrum version was still keeping 0.00000 amount sent to change address in that tx after "Increase fee"))

He has no other choice probably. The same what happened in LTC - threat of UASF forced miners to enable Segwit even though they were refusing it first.

If you do not understand something, try to find it first in bitcoin wiki (add "site:en.bitcoin.it" in google search):
    input site:en.bitcoin.it
...see the first [result](
[This]( transaction has 1 input, [this]( transaction has 4 inputs - notice that its size is bigger ("Size" field there).


Size in bytes doesn't depend on the bitcoin value that is send in transaction. You can have tx of size 250 bytes that transfers $100,000,000, you can have tx of size 100,000 bytes that transfers $0.1.
If you use only 1 input, fee needed for confirmation will be something between $0.5 and $2. Depends on how much busy the network is - watch [here](
I recommend using Electrum wallet - you can select there exactly which input(s) you want to use and you can also use RBF (mark transaction as "Replaceable" so you can "Increase" it's fee later when needed).

No. Not for EMV, not for existing credit card systems. 
Purpose of blockchain is to enable the money/payment system to be decentralized (no single center, no single company controlling the whole system) and trustless (you don't need to trust anybody, you don't need to trust any company - all you need is to run your node - your Bitcoin client that is verifying everything that it sees in blockchain by itself; nobody else also need to trust others, everybody just follows their own incentives (profit, security) and the system works).
To enable decentralization and trustlessness, blockchain is very resource hungry when compared to other (centralized and not trustless) systems - as all data (the whole blockchain) needs to be replicated at every node.
In a way, or at least in some niches, blockchain is here to complement and even replace that whole industry. (Bitcoin represents a complete alternative to fiat financial and payment systems.)
It might be interesting for you that some payment terminals already support payment with Bitcoins as the payment/terminal providers (or payment gateways? ...or how are these companies called) provide that option for merchants - they just need to enable Bitcoin acceptance by a single click in their exiting POS terminals.
But back to the insecure EMV terminals problem: terminals you are interested in just need to switch from one hash function that was proved to be insecure (SHA1) to other hash functions (SHA2 or SHA3) and the security should be re-established. Well, I said "just need" as it's conceptually trivial, but in reality it might be a tremendous endeavor as there is a lot of these terminals in field and a lot of things connect to it in both literal and figurative sense...


Yes, instead of broken SHA1, Bitcoin uses SHA256 that is orders of magnitude more secure. Satoshi took great care to make the system secure even if some parts of it get broken. There is [ECDSA -&gt; SHA256 -&gt; RIPEMD -&gt; 2x SHA256]( "chain" going from private key (that controls bitcoins) to bitcoin address (that "receives" bitcoins that can be then sent by the private key that generated this address) that is one-way even if SHA256 gets broken or even if RIPEMD gets broken or even if ECDSA gets broken - in other words: even if some of these functions get broken, attackers will not be able to take control of bitcoins they see "in" bitcoin addresses in blockchain.


SHA1 is a hash function - which means that it is taking on input arbitrary data (e.g. a .pdf document) and produces 160 bit number that is representing that original data. The function is said to be one-way, because you can always calculate the hash of something, but you can't guess from the hash what was the original data. This is because the hash function is mangling and mixing parts of the original data so much that the result (hash) appears to be a random number. If you change only one single letter in that .pdf document, the hash will be completely different. You will totally not be able to guess that those two hashes came from similar data.
That "one-way-ness" described above is used when we are signing documents. Instead of signing the whole document, we can sign only it's hash - because every document we will ever create will have different hash. Well - providing the hash function is sufficiently strong. I.e. if it is mangling&amp;mixing the original data enough and if it is not throwing away too much.
So, you have a digital signature that you can verify (you know that it was done by the right person and that it correctly signed that hash that comes with it), you have the hash that is signed and you are given the document whose hash is that hash that is digitally signed. So you can be sure that the person who made that digital signature was indeed signing that document that you have. ...well, you can be sure if the hash function is strong enough. Because if it wasn't, somebody can come up with completely different document that has the same hash!
As I said - that should never happen if the hash function is strong enough, but it was found that SHA1 is not that strong as previously thought - as the collision was found. I.e. two different documents were found that have the same hash. (There was an immense amount of calculation involved - but the fact that it was even possible makes the hash function &amp; everything else that is using it for security purposes broken.)


SHA1 is simple hash function, while Bitcoin is a complex system that uses many things (among others also SHA hash functions - but those are SHA256 functions which are secure unlike SHA1).
SHA256 hash functions are used in Bitcoin in mining (to ensure that finding new block is very very hard; there are 2 SHA256 used, the second one using the output of the first one as input - so it is even more "one-way" than a single SHA256) and also in derivation of Bitcoin address from Bitcoin public key (see link above).

Ponzi: somebody promises you (big) return. Also there is vague explanation where the money are coming from ("arbitrage", "stock market", "you know - like other banks - fractional reserve banking and stuff").
Bitcoin: no promise of return - developers present it as experiment.

Look at the fees [here]( - look at the rightmost column. As you can see in online block explorers, biggest blocks are 1 MB - so, all the transactions that are in rows that are above the row where you see 1,000,000 bytes will be confirmed (i.e. will be put into the new block). So right now these are the transactions that have fee 400 sat/B or more.
sat/B means Satoshi per byte. Typical transactions have 190 - 360 bytes - providing there are not more than 2 or 3 inputs (pieces of bitcoins that were received in previous transactions). Satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC i.e. 0.00001 mBTC i.e. 0.01 uBTC. So, 400 sat/B is 4uBTC/B or 4mBTC/KB or also 0.004 BTC/kB.
400 sat/B required to get into next block means that network is quite busy. Earlier today it was under 250 sat/B and during the weekend it can go as low as 60 sat/B. So if you do not need the transaction to be confirmed immediately - i.e. "low priority" as I said - you can broadcast it with low fee &amp; wait some hours/days for confirmations.
Especially recommended is creating low prio (low fee) transaction when you have many small inputs (you received your bitcoins in many small transactions). Because of many inputs, the transaction will be big =&gt; it should be done when network is least busy not to pay big fees.
Does it make sense?
Edit: there were 4 fast blocks (4 blocks in last 7 minutes) - so the fee required for next block dropped to 188 sat/B.

Should be bullish. 
If UASF-BIP148 succeeds it would show that Bitcoin is really decentralized even if mining is somewhat centralized. 
If mining gets centralized (mining pools create cartels or there is one big miner + HW producer), further development of Bitcoin can be stalled (as miners potentially refuse to switch on the new features that users want and developers put into the client software) ...unless there is a mechanism that allows users themselves to switch new features on. This mechanism is UASF - if it is done successfully now (or any time later), it will show that miners really aren't the rulers of the network.
The problem with user activation is "Sybil attack" - anyone can easily spin up many personalities - I mean: Bitcoin full nodes - and by it make it appear that all these are legitimate bitcoin users that want something (potentially different than the real users in the community). So, when doing UASF we would be always in the dark to some extend - will all ("normal") users switch to new version of the software? Will the UASF version become new Bitcoin?

Yes. For high-priority transactions it is best to use Electrum with RBF enabled - then you can increase fee if the transaction is not confirming.

...these are online blockchain explorers. You can see there what is happening in blockchain - i.e. what is happening in Bitcoin network - i.e. how bitcoins move.
When you are sending/receiving BTC, you can always check in online blockchain explorers to see if the transaction is confirmed (if and how bitcoins moved).
So, put there address that you used as "receiving" and check how much bitcoins you received. If you made other transactions, check also those (either by sending/receiving address or by transaction id). 
Your +1 BTC was probably glitch in the wallet or you reading the numbers wrong. Check all the addresses you have in the wallet (that received something) as described above - you will see whether your Mycelium wallet shows you the right numbers...

Politically pushed (some businesses + politicians + centralized miners) unsafe solution. Would make precedent also for other possible HFs in near future that are even worse.


Current sizes are barely bearable for me to run full node. It would double (or slightly more) with Segwit which is already too much. Quadrupling will have significant centralization effect.


I don't think they would do this.


nullc &amp; luke-jr are very vocal about possible Segwit ~2MB blocks being too much already. Pieter Wuille [proposed]( (very) moderate increase in blocksize limit of 17 % per year. I don't know about the the rest of core devs, but I think all of them oppose blocks bigger than 1.5 MB. Hence Segwit was already a compromise - it creates 2+ MB blocks potentially but these burden full nodes less as witness is not needed for 1+ year old transactions.


No, Segwit enables further improvements like Schnorr and offchain systems and MAST and completely new script languages. 


It's not this dichotomy IMHO as I pointed above, but let's say we are in that situation: I would choose "status quo". Bitcoin must stay decentralized at all costs. (INB4 "it's not decentralized already because centralized miners": that's not true - if it was we would need HF to other POW.)

Because it leads to centralization of mining getting worse (1 big miner or mining cartel can push small miners out of market) and because it hurts decentralization in general (big burden for full nodes) - which means Bitcoin losing it's fundamental property that is keeping it alive. Miners that are not shortsighted should see that.

Buy at exchanges, but immediately withdraw to wallet that only you control. Start with Electrum installed on your PC (it's very convenient and at the same time very secure (as secure as your OS if you have it on your online machine)). If you have more BTCs, do this:  (generate your new cold Electrum wallet on offline machine (either dedicated offline or booted offline with Linux live CD)). That should be very secure. If you have then more than 1 or 2 BTC, you can think about HW wallets as mentioned in other comments here.
But also localbitcoins.com are good (meet face to face in public place, buy with cash). 
Create there "buy" advertisement with your price or wait for some seller to appear that sells close to market price.

For me, experienced dev team is more important than miners that are more and more centralized and therefore vulnerable to attacks and coercion (from authorities / wannabe politicians / businesses / etc.). Bitcoin works till this day **only** because it remained decentralized (its centralized mining doesn't mean that it is not decentralized - as users can hardfork to other POW).
Also, if I was a miner who wants Segwit but hates hardfork and bigger blocks - I would be signalling Segwit2x too (as Segwit activation comes first and the HF that follows might not happen) and then I would refuse to support HF.

Target is ([some big]( number. Miners are trying to find a block that has hash (see 'hash' [here]( lower than this number (this is the reason why block hashes start with zeroes). If you make target smaller, it will be harder for miners to find the block... Harder =&gt; it will take longer. So - by changing the target you can fine tune the average time to get next block from the network...
It's similar as if we play this little game: 
We have a hat with numbers from 0 to 9999. I give you a target - say 2500 - and your task is to pull a number from the hat that is lower than this... On average, you would need four tries to get number which is under 2500... 
Now - if pulling one number takes you 15 seconds on average for example and I want to keep you busy for 10 minutes, I will choose 250 as target. ...so that's it. ;) 
...if you improve your number-pulling skill and you can manage to pull &amp; check one number in 3 seconds, the target would need to be five times smaller (i.e. 50) for the new round of the game so it takes you 10 minutes again (with target 50, you have the 1 in 200 chance =&gt; 200 x 3 [s] is 10 [min]).

There are not different types of bitcoins. There are different markets - there is always supply (asks - i.e. I can say: I want to sell 5 BTC for $399 each) and demand (bids - i.e.: I want buy 20 BTC for $315 each) - many people put there these orders. This is how price discovery works - the price where demand and supply meets (the highest price people want to buy at and at the same the lowest price at which other people want to sell is the current price at given market). 
You can see there are markets in different countries, markets for different currencies, some are not used by many users (i.e. they have low volume), some markets are unreachable from some countries, some markets have problems with banks, etc. - so, supply vs demand can create different prices on different markets. 
If price differences are big enough some people perform *arbitrage* - they buy on markets where bitcoins are cheap and sell them on markets where the price is higher.

Non-poor people can figure (&amp; pay) ways how to invest the money to avoid losing it due to inflation. Poor people have resources for their basic needs only - no reserves, no margins for risks, they have to work 100 % all time and can be controlled by the wealthier minority... With deflationary currency you have the chance to go out of poverty - you can save, bit by bit, and get out of the trap much easier.

Also, it was not "official agreement of core developers" (such thing is not even possible given that core devs are just contributors to open source project with minimal organization). AFAIK there were 2 core devs out of many - and they were just representing themselves.

I think devs were saying here in reddit that old node will know somehow that there is something new that it doesn't understand. But I would need to go wild hunting in the source code to confirm this probably.




For miners there is no difference - they must have new SW after the fork happens or they risk creating bad blocks or extending "wrong" chain. 
The difference is there for full nodes. In the case of hardfork, all full nodes must update otherwise they would be rejecting all blocks mined with new rules (as hard for is relaxing the rules, new block mined after hard fork is likely incompatible with the old rules and will not be propagated by old full nodes - which means also all blocks that build on it =&gt; immediate guaranteed chain split).

Enable Replace-by-fee and send transactions as "Replaceable". Then you have an option to increase fee.
@_date: 2013-09-08 21:50:37


You do not need to do this. This is needed if you want to: 
* see the correct balance of your addresses in your client; 
* be able to send from your wallet.
What you need is the backup of the wallet which has private keys to all addresses where you have BTC... So just copy your 'wallet.dat' file somewhere, you do not need to resync the blockchain (to do the backup (before your formatting))...
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:28:22
Yes. 
Only 1 MB of transactions can be in one block (that is mined every 10 minutes on average - but the block time could be anything between seconds and 2 or 3 hours). Miner is free to include any transactions - but rational thing to do is to select transactions that pay the highest fee. 
So, users choose how much in fee they want to pay (if they use RBF/"Replaceable" - e.g. in Electrum - they can even increase the fee when needed). If their transaction is in the 1 MB of transactions that paid the highest fee, it will get included in the next block.
If there is e.g. 3 MB of transactions that paid larger fee than you, there is still good chance that your transaction will get confirmed soon as block time varies and there might be 3 fast blocks in a row.
Also note that "fee" / "highest fee" / "low fee" above means fee per byte - it depends on the absolute fee you chose and on the size of your transaction (which may be quite big if there are many inputs in it).
Sometimes fees even below 100 sat/B will grant you confirmation in next block, sometimes even transacions with fees above 200 sat/B might be waiting for days to be confirmed (i.e. included in a block).

60 sat/B were confirmed over the last weekend. Default time to drop from mempool was increased from 3 days to 14 days. However, anybody can rebroadcast the transaction any time.
If you are attempting double spend to make it confirmed you can try CPFP as well (child transaction that spends output(s) of unconfirmed transaction pays larger fee - so the average fee of both transactions is acceptable to miners - so one of the miners mines both of those transactions (because the second one would not be valid without the first one confirmed either in previous block or in the same block)).
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:16:44


Technically, bitcoins never "leave" the wallet unless transaction sending those gets confirmed. This is the first thing that beginners should learn - that bitcoins are entries in a ledger - in blockchain. If Bitcoins didn't "move" in blockchain, they didn't "move" at all.

It updates in real time. If transactions are coming with high fee, it suggests high fee (the fee suggestion is for the next block). Today/yesterday it was recommending under 100 sat/B (which was the fee to get in to the next block at that moment).

There are two kinds of users:
* users who run full node (and transact)
* users who transfer value using (possibly 3rd party software operating on) Bitcoin network without running full node
I would argue that the first type is more relevant in technical discussions. That kind of users understand what decentralization means and how bigger blocks burden their computers for now and the future.
The second kind of users might be more frequent and more vocal or whatever - but they are less relevant for Bitcoin as a network and Bitcoin as a concept (I would argue). They are just riding the Bitcoin wave now, enjoying new options that Bitcoin enabled - but they will maybe not even notice when the 3rd party services they are using switch to other underlying technology (which may lack some fundamental properties of Bitcoin - but which will still be available for use as long as Bitcoin itself is immune to attacks from authorities).
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:07:09
Yeah, their low-prio is paying way too much in fees.
low-prio should be currently 160 sat/B or less as transactions with lower fee than that were confirmed earlier today.
Watch here:  
8 inputs is quite a lot though. Maybe you can export private keys from Mycelium &amp; import it to Electrum where you have more control over what inputs will be used and what fee you will pay (with RBF/"replaceable" enabled you can start with really low fee and if it doesn't get confirmed in a week or two, you can increase the fee).

No. It sends change to change address that it generates. It is deterministic wallet, so all future change addresses are derived from the (initial wallet) seed. So - you either take the seed as your next paper wallet, or you send the change back to your original paper wallet (with the same procedure I described above) or you send it to your other new paper wallet you create by other means.
Edit: Note: the procedure works for Electrum 1.8.X - not sure about 1.9.

Segwit is large step ahead &amp; miners blocking it (well, maybe they just want to slow the progress so they can collect higher fees short term) is an attack (in a way) on Bitcoin &amp; it's community. Centralized miners are too powerful &amp; we should think also about POW change.
HF to bigger blocks is more controversial and has smaller support in community (especially among veterans &amp; experts) than Segwit. Core developers will not budge to political pressure (hopefully) coming from politicians and businesses.
Most core devs are not supporting UASF BIP148 - as it doesn't meet their activation standards (that were used in previous softforks).

If you have wallet like that you are overpaying - especially for low priority transactions and for cases when there are more inputs.

Banks give their high ranking employees exorbitant bonuses &amp; when the bankruptcy is near they got bailed-out by taxpayers. Banks create fiat "money" out of nothing, then they lend this fiat to people and collect it back with interest - they profit from money that they created and that never should have existed in the first place. By creating inflation they steal the value invisibly from our pockets.

* Bitcoin has the vision and the strongest &amp; most experienced dev team; they will not be jumping ship as fast as some users are (I am working on this for 5 years, sweat &amp; tears - but omg, fees are too high! - I go working on LTC! - yeah! ...No.)*;
* there is a lot of veterans (including old cypherpunks) who have the feeling that if everybody just jumps from Bitcoin to something else (when the first mild problems arrive), the whole idea of cryptocurrencies would be significantly weakened; sound money must be durable, something can't be store of value if it vanishes in just a few years - being replaced by some random alternative.

Enable "Edit fees manually" and also "Replace-by-fee" so you can mark transactions as "Replaceable" and be able to increase their fee later.
For low priority transaction, set smaller fee (10 - 40 sat/B) and wait for weekend when network is less busy. Also watch [here]( to see what transaction (per byte) is required to get into next block.

No, I was expecting constant amount of new investors. But what you say is right - I wanted to say: if the difficulty rises "more than it should" - i.e. we are in mining bubble - i.e. the difficulty is so hight that you can never mine the amount of BTC that you could buy directly now... (Of course the difficulty should reach equilibrium eventually - so the mining is in the long run a bit more profitable than buying BTC directly.)


No, investing into mining and buying BTC directly are just two ways how to obtain BTC - if you want to invest in BTC you weight these two options against each other.

There will also be some people who will want to sell coins from the original chain - this can temporarily drive fees up significantly in this chain (potentially far more than 12.5 BTC / block in fees) - so it would be interesting for at least some miners to get back and mine the original chain.
I am not afraid that there will be large problem with low hashrate. Do you remember the FUD from the last halving? *"Reward goes down! Miners will left! Bitcoin will be slow! Price will go down! More miners will left! Bitcoin will be even more slow! OMG OMG OMG!"* ...Bullshit. Nothing happened.

51 % is not complete doom - they could only duplicate bitcoins they bought (so they cannot steal our bitcoins by that). Next, this attack would be revealed pretty fast - in a minute or so - and developers can promptly react. 
I can imagine even rollback of blockchain to pre-attack state + change of proof-of-work algorithm to counter govsters attack. This may upset miners invested in ASICs - but it is better than complete fall of Bitcoin...

Retarget happens every 2016 (usually close to 14 days, but can be up to 5 times more if we have only one fifth of the hashrate since the beginning of the 2016 block period). It sets the target in such a way that the average hashrate from the last 2016 blocks would produce 10 minutes blocks on average. (This means e.g. that the difficulty will not change if the hashrate drop happened right before retarget.) 
And additionally, change in difficulty is limited to 4x ([4x up]( or [4x down]( - so if the hashrate drops to 20 % right before retarget you would need 2016 + 2016 blocks to fully adjust - as the first real adjustment - after that first 2016 blocks will put difficulty down to 25 % (and not to 20 % as you would need)...

You can try CPFP, but it will be costly (especially if your transaction was big - i.e. if it has many inputs) as you are sending two transactions instead of one.
Use RBF ("Replaceable") next time.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:51:08
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:42:16
See [here]( for the current recommended fee that will get you into next block (see the rightmost column - 1,000,000 bytes will get into the next block).
Best practice - for high priority transaction: select only one input (Address tab, select address, click "send from" and then remove all inputs but one OR go to Coins tab if you have latest Electrum, and select there one input that is bit enough for your transaction), enable RBF in preferences, mark transaction as "Replaceable", use the fee recommended in above link (your transaction will have 240 bytes or slightly less if using one input only); if transaction doesn't confirm fast, use "Increase fee" (RMB click in history).
Best practice - for low priority transaction (and especially for consolidation transaction where you join many inputs into one): enable RBF, enable manual fee in preferrences, set very low fee (few cents), use "Increase fee" so the transaction has between 20 sat/B and 40 sat/B. Wait. It has chance to confirm overnight or even bigger chance to confirm over weekend.


Use very low fee manually + RBF ("Replaceable"), broadcast the transaction, look it up in online blockchain explorer, e.g. [this]( - see there its size in bytes. Then use "Increase fee" in Electrum with manual fee that you calculate from fee you want according to your priority (see link at top and explanation above) and from the size of the transaction you see in blockchain explorer (if the fee is increased, new transaction should have the same size). Don't worry about "Double spend" warning in BCI.

No. Miners have absolute power in very small domain: determining what happened in transfers - what transaction took place and which not. Users have far bigger influence - they choose the client, they choose what it even means to "mine" - users choosing different client can mean that miners lose their (very-limited-to-begin-with-) power completely (in case of POW change). Users can do less drastic things, too - like forcing soft fork to enable new features - like in case of UASF-BIP148. Miners can do shit about that - their emergency hardforks (to give them more power) will be frowned upon.


You got this wrong. Altcoin is what is incompatible with the previous Bitcoin (unless the whole community nearly unanimously agrees to change the rules...) - so - it's exactly what Segwit2x is when it hardforks without consensus (without 95+% support of users (not miners)).

Fee you paid was 426.265 sat/B, 290 sat/B would be enough now (and quite possibly 120 sat/B will be confirmed today and even less will be needed over weekend).
Fees went up considerably recently &amp; wallets are not prepared for that, yet. Best is to use Electrum with RBF enabled, start with small fee &amp; increase it if transaction is not confirming in hours/days.

Yes. Are you using their exchange (GDAX)? If you create sell order there, the fees should be lower than selling directly to them.
However you can also try  - create sell add there &amp; meet in person. Then you can sell for cash also with some premium. Localbitcoins work as escrow (for 1 % fee) so it is quite secure.

So you say the following (that I copied from [this post]( made by is not true?:


Stop spreading lies:
1. The HK agreement said the hardfork would only occur with "broad support across the entire community."  Which part of that do you not understand?  Nobody can force people to upgrade and Bitcoiners do not like being told what to do, if the HK agreement tried to force a hardfork it would backfire.
2. The miners breached the agreement, by continuing and accelerating an aggressive campaign to do a ridiculously stupid, almost laughably stupid hardfork without consensus
3. The developers DID honour their end of the agreement and code up countless hardfork proposals.  See:
* BIP-MMHF, draft patch last updated 2016/7/17, discussion, Luke-Jr, 2016/2/7
* BIP-MSMMHHF, ML discussion, James Hilliard, 2016/2/23
* Research update by Peter Todd, 2016/8/5
* Draft BIP: Hardfork warning system - Dr Johnson Lau, 2016/12/1
* Forcenet1 experimental hard fork testnet by Dr Johnson Lau, 2016/12/4
* Forcenet2 an experimental network with a new header format by Dr Johnson Lau, 2017/1/14

* Spoonnet: another experimental hardfork by Dr Johnson Lau, 2017/2/6
* Draft BIP: Extended block header hardfork by Dr Johnson Lau, 2017/4/2
However, despite all the great progress the developers did in making a hardfork safe and coding it up, they cannot force people to run it.  **Perhaps once all these stupid hardfork proposals stop causing such a large distraction, people will start running these safe hardfork clients.**

You have to understand that blockchain space is very scarce - you can't fit there unlimited number of transactions. So, transactions with zero or low fee can't be included. 
Also - what you call stuck transaction I might call acceptable low priority transaction. When I send between my addresses (e.g. from my hot to my cold wallet) I don't need to have it confirmed in 10-20 minutes. In that case it is perfectly fine for me if it takes 10 days.

3 of 5 multisig - seeds encrypted with password and stored in 5 different locations - bank safe deposit boxes or security companies as you say. 
None of those companies or their employees can fuck you over (unless 3 of those companies or their employees recognize you have seeds stored there &amp; collude - which is very unlikely ...and still they would need to beat the password out of you...). So a little trust is required, but really not much. 
Alternative would be 2 of 2 multisig seeds - buried deep in two gardens that are in different cities. It would be next to impossible for attackers to force you to dig out first seed, drive you to the other city and force you to dig out the other seed.
We are speaking about life savings here - that you need to use less than once per 10 years (so you can accept that getting to and digging out the seeds and signing the transaction will take whole day or more).

No. Bitcoin is designed to accept the longest (heaviest) valid chain. Crucial is that "valid" word there. What is valid is defined by the Bitcoin client software - which users are free to choose (and modify). The ultimate control is in the hands of users (users who run full nodes). 
Let's imagine a hypothetical (but entirely possible) scenario: China's government confiscates all big mining operations in China &amp; starts to demand registration (or their transactions will be rejected) and registration of all other miners (or their blocks will get orphaned). Also they will probably refuse to let in anybody who is evil in their eyes (the bigger part of western world).
Now, if your version of Bitcoin is the right one ("Miners control Bitcoin" or "largest hashrate decides everything"), then you have to agree that your Bitcoin is quite fragile and not immune to attacks from authorities.
What will actually happen: developers will implement switch to different POW in new version of software - this hardfork change will achieve consensus in community (nearly all full nodes will switch to this new version) and when the fork is activated, Bitcoin will continue as a decentralized system that is immune to attack from authorities - it will continue to be the Bitcoin that is ultimately controlled by users. (The original chain without the POW that will continue to be controlled by China will not be considered Bitcoin as it will not follow the [fundamental principles of Bitcoin](

Soft fork means that old full nodes can operate as they did before, with the same version of the software as they had before the softfork. They just will not be able to verify everything in the block (and they will know that there is something they don't understand). Look e.g. at P2SH softfork. Older nodes didn't understand new P2SH addresses, but other than that they operated fine (they were receiving and sending payments as before).
(In softfork,) Backward compatibility doesn't work for miners. All miners must have up-to-date SW after the softfork or they will be running into danger that they will be creating invalid blocks or extending chains that include invalid blocks. (It's irrelevant if the spending transaction you discuss was created by miner or by any other user - miner must be able to verify it using the new rules (which are more strict than the original rules because it's softfork).)

This is a misconception. It's hard, because you need veeeeeeeery many trials to be lucky &amp; find a block, but the single trial is trivial. It's just taking the data from block &amp; applying a function on it (a hash function) which is known to be one way - it is easy to calculate it from data, but it is impossible to go in the opposite direction - i.e. from it's result which is called "hash" back to the original data. Bitcoin miners are required to produce such block so its hash starts with a certain number of [zeroes]( But essentially the whole thing is a lottery - you are just "buying" tickets with hashpower (special hardware) than with money. It would be the same if we said: hey, let's mine like this: the next block will be mined by a person who throws 1000 consecutive heads by coin flips. If we saw that 1000 is too little, because there is a lot of blocks found, we could then adjust the difficulty and say that 2000 heads are required from now on - that's exactly what happens in Bitcoin, see [here](
Why we want blocks to be hard to find?
First, it's because we want the whole network to be synchronized. All nodes must have the latest block and this block must be the same for all nodes. Block propagation around the globe takes like 10 seconds (but it can go up to minutes if there are problems in the internet) - so the difficulty of mining is set to adjust so the blocks are not coming faster than 1 in 10 minutes on average.
Second (in a bit more general sense), blocks must be hard to find to make it hard for attackers to mess with Bitcoin network.  The attacker must have [at least 50 % of hashrate]( of the network so she can produce blocks faster than all the others (which gives the ability then to rewrite arbitrarily long part of blockchain - i.e. reverse and to some extent change the history).
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:01:32
See here:  current fee for next block is 60 sat/B, but if 3 fast blocks come we can go under 40 sat/B.
Use Electrum &amp; enable RBF ("Replaceable") - send the transaction with 20 - 40 sat/B &amp; increase the fee if needed.

Every day in Bitcoin is a day of an immense drama, fear, uncertainty and doubt. This technology is so new we can't even imagine where it leads us to. It can fail in so many ways - yet it is stronger and stronger every day...
One thing is convenience, second thing is the terrible shit that lurks just below the surface (datamining of users, selling the data to everybody who wants to pay, privacy breaches that might lead to very tragic results when the the rulers turn a bit more totalitarian (bit by bit) ...the same also for fiat itself - they destroyed our privacy and they are getting closer and closer to achieving total control over us).  is a thing &amp; it is not getting anywhere. It will get stronger as more people will get aware how our privacy is getting destroyed.
Take an hour of your time and watch this very carefully:  (**re:publica 2012 - Eben Moglen - Freedom of Thought Requires Free Media**) ...our civilization changed in our lifetime very profoundly without us even noticing. People might get finally to start thinking about these things &amp; it might be the next huge topic in politics in coming years. (Snowden, thank you very much, too!)
So, Bitcoin is a beacon in the dark, it is the alternative that they can't eradicate. Bitcoin must stay resilient and immune to censorship and other attacks. Some alts that lack these fundamental properties might be more convenient and used by more users, but whatever - we must not lose Bitcoin's decentralization - or all is lost. In case that there are alts that are both good &amp; decentralized (immune to attack from authorities), Bitcoin will become less used which will give it the ability to move faster again (as the majority of foul players will lose interest &amp; move to work against the alt that will be more used at that time). 
TL;DR: we must keep decentralization at all costs. If any of the alts manages to do it better (same resilience &amp; more users), we would be able to move faster then (because &amp; catch-up (again).

Ah ok, so the x axis gives space occupied in block, y axis (and therefore orange box size is not (directly) related to space occupied in block).
Maybe you can either describe on that page what is "increased fee level" - or maybe idicate it somehow.


Maybe just change the label from $0.00 to: EMPTY.


Yes. IMHO median is more interesting than averages that many people discuss. Using median fee should give you good chance to get into next few blocks, right. Now when I think about it also other quantiles might be interesting - e.g. [quartiles]( Maybe using 1st (low fee) quartile would give you good chance to be in next block while paying not that much.

Not one address, but many addresses. Look at all the blocks from the first year. All those addresses still hold those initial 50 BTCs. 


Not necessarily - after/during the crash, many other people could be buying - so there is no guarantee that he can buy cheaper all the coins he sold. He can even lose money in the whole crash-market endeavor. For example - say you are early adopter and that you have 300 kBTC. You look at market depth and see that with that amount, you can drive the price below $1. So you sell all your 300kBTC, price crashes and you make buy order for 2 MBTC @ $1, waiting for panic sellers. Then you look again &amp; see: somebody placed 3 MBTC buywall @ $1.01 - so he is getting all the cheap coins, not you... So you must start to buy higher than this... he will also move the wall and so on...This will result in the race up - many ppl will be placing buy walls a bit higher than the largest bid, many people will also be consuming the asks. As a result of this, the price could jump up fast (say to $50) and its entirely possible that you would not be able to buy-cheap back the coins that you sold below $50 (which could be significant portion of your initial 300kBTC)... Note that there may be far more money at the exchange that we see in bids, also many people who panic sell are "ready" to panic buy if the price goes down significantly...

If the transaction is not confirmed it is like if it never happened. In 14 days (or 28...) it will get dropped from node mempools and the original sender might not send those bitcoins (not recreate the transaction with higher fee) and she might even send those bitcoins to different address (invalidating all the transactions that used the outputs of the original unconfirmed transaction).
So, spending unconfirmed transaction outputs is fine if it is among addresses in your wallet or among friends, but unconfirmed transactions are not to be trusted.

Hardfork is not acceptable for most people. If I was a miner that wants Segwit, but refuses HF, I would be signalling Segwit2x, too (and after Segwit locks-in I would not be running HF client).


Hashpower depends on POW function which depends on client SW that users are running. If users switch to client that defines other POW algorithm, current hashpower would be useless. 
So, it's the other way around - nodes are more important. Now you know it, you are welcome.

Payments to original addresses in the wallet or to change addresses? For the first, backup should work. For the latter: 
If your wallet is deterministic, the backup should work. If you wallet is not deterministic, the backup doesn't contain private keys to change addresses which were created after the backup.

Usually, only the 1st private key would be used (to create the usual transactions with enforced wait). The 2nd key would be stored in your safe. If you spot a theft attempt, you will do these steps:
1. retrieve the 2nd key from your safe
2. create the no-wait transactions using the 1st+2nd private key - thereby averting the theft
3. fix your security
4. prepare new hot wallet with one "hot" private key and one "cold" private key and the outputs in your hot wallet that force wait transactions

I stay with core - they have experience and vision and they proved themselves. Scenario you described (not that likely IMO as I said) is not scary. Difficulty adjusts sooner or later and then we have more decentralized Bitcoin with experienced devs. Just a joke is how some of these businesses and mining cartels are trying to hardfork. If the code quality is the same we have seen in BU I'll be not only lmao but rofl.
So, Segwit gets activated - that seems very likely at this point - either through UASF-BIP148 or Segwit2x - and then someone will have very hard time explaining users (and other businesses) that they should follow the hardfork. How many users were running non-Core clients (Classic / XT / BU)? Not many.

Reusing one address is not recommended for privacy reasons - if you make one payment from your single address, payee will be able to see how much BTC you have (and track/guess where are all these coming from).
My suggestions:
* establish cold storage wallet ([Electrum cold storage]( / paper wallet / HW wallet),
* send your bitcoins there (in one or more transactions) - do this as low priority - i.e. in Electrum select low fee like 30 sat/B or lower and also check "Replaceable" - and wait for night/weekend for it to confirm; this will also consolidate your small inputs - so your next transaction will be cheaper then;
* use new receiving address (from your existing Electrum hot wallet) in your pool configuration so your new mining profits will not be (easily) linkable to your older incomes
If you have under 0.2 BTC and reasonably secure computer, cold storage is probably overkill - but still it is good idea to use more than one receiving addresses and also to consolidate small inputs via a low fee low priority transaction.
Did I answer your question?

You mean "address(es)" here, not wallets. Right.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:38:28
At the moment, you need 351 sat/B to get into one of the next blocks. See [here]( As you can see, there are 3 MB of transactions that pay 340 sat/B or more. It is also apparent that the required fee to get into next few blocks can drop to 150 sat/B in few hours (see the transaction fee distribution, see the rightmost column that says how many megs are there of transactions that pay fee in that row or above).
Your tx has 107.239 sat/B - there is 18 MB of transaction above you with "higher priority" for miners. If no other transactions are added, it would take around 3 hours to get that confirmed ...but unfortunately for you, transactions with fee of 150+ sat/B are added continually. So, your transaction might take several days/weeks to confirm (providing the network will get less busy than in the last few weeks) or it will never get confirmed.
I suggest using RBF ("Replaceable") in Electrum - then you can increase fee at will.

There will be a lot of users who believe in core &amp; who believe in decentralization &amp; who would not like to hardfork. If there are users (and experienced veteran developers), miners will come. 
If I was a miner that wants Segwit, but refuses HF, I would be signalling Segwit2x, too (and after Segwit locks-in I would **not** be running HF client). Other miners will stay/come for pure economic reasons.

Signaling doesn't mean anything. Even miners who oppose HF might be signaling now. Also - if there are transactions on the non-hard-forked chain, fees will go up &amp; some miners will come back (or other new miners will emerge). 
It's good to prepare for worst possibilities, but I don't expect critical problems. Slow blocks for one or two months - maybe, but nothing fatal.
OTOH if it is really that bad - emergency simple HF adjusting just difficulty would not be as controversial as rising blocksize now.

First, the philosophy of Bitcoin is that transactions are irreversible - therefore everybody should double- or triple- check before sending something. If it is sent, it is sent. If you sent it to stranger, you are fucked. No whining please.
Second, if you always help people out of the shit they inflict on themselves by their mistakes, they will never learn.

Better consolidate those inputs of yours while you still can...
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:51:34
You don't need anything - just run it on your machine, it will generate your seed (from that it generates all your private keys for many addresses that it controls - so you can also re-create the wallet anytime anywhere from the seed) and then you can sweep your private keys from Qt - sending the bitcoins to one or more addresses that Electrum generated for you. You can optionally select password that will encrypt the wallet file on your machine.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:10:16
here you see the current distribution (watch that several times a day):
and this:
...you will see that fees are quite high (2.5-4.0 uBTC/B) during the day, but during the night the required fees go down to sub-0.5uBTC/B (sub-50 sat/B). Over the weekend the network is even less busy. 0.2uBTC/B has reasonable chance to go through.
My recommendation is to use Electrum, enable "Replaceable", start with small fee and then increase it to recommended fee (see the 1^st link above) when confirmations take too long. Electrum also allows coin control - high priority transactions should have 1 input only - you can select that in Electrum.

Top up your Steam wallet with enough fiat for multiple games (and then buy using that wallet instead of BTC directly) &amp; do this as low priority transaction.

Unlike fiat, Bitcoin has sound monetary policy - it is sound money. Fiat is not money at all as it is not store of value (by design). This is especially important for non-1^st-world lands.
If people use centralized Bitcoin wallets and services that are controlled by government, it is not better than using banks *per se* - but in the larger picture: it creates competition for entrenched ossified vampire banking &amp; finance industry. This is not to be underestimated - Bitcoin is open for people and open for innovation. Banking cartels that are trying to strangle the development and charge exorbitant fees - and also print money, do risky investments and let themeslves be bailed out/in if it they are not lucky.
It is normal that 99 % of people don't care about anything. What's important is that the option is there - option to be more private, to be able to do censorship resistant stuff, to control their value completely and to be able to resist thefts &amp; other attacks.
Also, because Bitcoin is an (complete) alternative and because it is so different (and arguably better in many ways), there is a chance that a lot of people will become non-ignorant &amp; will realize how wrong is our current bank/fin system.
We might be not far from nasty global dystopia. Totalitarian regime can come back fairly swiftly and fairly unnoticed. Look how freedoms are taken from us - because of GASP! TERRORISTS! How many deaths caused terrorists in comparison to transportation, "normal" homicides, smoking, etc. Nearly none. But it led to stripping us of many freedoms and total surveilance (there are already backdoors in all computers, all internet services). We in Czech Republic went through 40 years of totalitarian communist rule &amp; it fucked us up for the next 80 years... And today, totalitarian gubmints have far greater powers. Please take one hour of your time and watch this closely:  (re:publica 2012 - Eben Moglen - Freedom of Thought Requires Free Media) I guarantee it's eye-opening.


Benefit of "decentralized" for all is that it can work at all. That there can exist an alternative. - All centralized attempts at alternative currencies were destroyed by government (e-gold, liberty dollar, liberty reserve, ...I am sure the list goes on).

**Ponzi**: system in which no value is created. Just the author (or the first who joined) promise other people that they will get large returns for their investments into this system. Of course, some bullshit (like eg. that the system will be "generating money on stock exchange" or by "doing arbitrage between exchanges" or that they have this miraculous invention etc.) is told to people so it is not obvious that nothing is being created - but every time this story is just some foggy bullshit. When you create Ponzi scheme, you do not want people to understand what is going on!
**Limited resource**: there is some value because something is useful - be it iron ore, land, gold, Bitcoin, water in desert. The more people want to get the resource, the higher the value (price) because there is finite amount of it. As simple as that. If no more people want it (or "join"), nothing spectacular happens - just the value (price) reaches equilibrium.
* promise **vs** no promise
* no value - just newcomers give money to ppl. who joined first **vs** objective value, this value depends on the amount of ppl. who want their share of given resource
Edit: wording

Deposit (nobody can touch it, must be available for withdrawal at any moment) **vs** loan (you give bank the money, tell them to use it how they see fit and that they should return it to you after agreed upon time passes - also with some interest).
If you make deposit, you explicitly want nobody to be able to use your money. If they break this rule it is fraud.

No, for ordinary Bitcoin transactions you use your "hot" wallet on your online machine. For (creating/using) cold storage, you need machine that is completely offline.
Look into Electrum - it is nice solution for cold storage: You have paper wallet (Electrum seed), you can re-create your offline wallet on offline machine from seed. From offline machine, you can sign transactions (you create them in seedless online wallet, transfer them to offline machine via usb key, bring back to online machine &amp; broadcast). So: convenient + secure.

Amount sent and absolute fee are completely irrelevant. The only thing that is considered is relative fee - i.e. absolute fee divided by the size of transaction - in bitcoins per byte (or you can see it also in other units: satoshis per byte or micro-bitcoins per byte or bitcoins per kilobyte).
Use Electrum instead of Multibit. Use RBF ("Replaceable") in Electrum so you can increase the fee when needed.

My speculation: Value of bitcoins could go (also) down because of USD deflation.

Also ordinary people will be losing jobs and will have no money to buy BTC...
No idea if the above makes sense :) or is more important than what says in [other]( comment here, I also do not know if the "money makers" (banksters/govsters) ever allow USD deflation again - maybe they just throw in yet larger piles of money again and again until we end in utter chaos or war.

Segwit is a way how to introduce new transaction and block format which is backward compatible (old Bitcoin clients don't necessarily need to update to stay being part of the network - hence it's call a "softfork" as opposed to "hardfork" where new format of transaction/block is introduced which is rejected by older versions of the client - so all nodes must update to remain working as a part of the network).
[Pieter Wuille: Segregated witness and its impact on scalability](
Segwit puts witness (the proof that the sender was entitled to send the bitcoins) aside from the rest of the transaction which has [multiple benefits]( - it also means lesser burden for full nodes as the witness isn't required for old transactions that are already buried deep in blockchain (as Pieter says in the presentation - see link above).
So, Segwit is a technological advance that brings numerous benefits (I look forward especially for script versioning) and is relatively safe - as it is softfork that is not disturbing the nodes that won't be updated in the moment it activates.
One of feats of Segwit is also that it blocks "ASICBoost" which is (some people say: unfair) advantage of some miners - they took advantage of some "random" things in the design of Bitcoin block header and engineered a solution in their ASIC chips that enables them to mine faster by a few percents (which is very significant though - as the margins are tiny &amp; few percents can lead to orders of magnitude higher profits). Well - all in all - some big miners who are exploiting some quirks in the current design are blocking legitimate Bitcoin upgrade. (As activation of softforks is usually done by miners - MASF - miner activated soft fork.)


As cartelized over-centralized miners decided to stall the progress in Bitcoin (they say they want to do a hardfork to larger blocksize but without Segwit as Segwit is too complicated or whatever - but that is probably just a stalling tactics by which they split community and block progress as hardfork to bigger blocksize is quite unlikely to succeed), a movement among users began to activate it on the side of users - i.e. users - who are full node operators - will run a modified version of the Bitcoin Client that will enforce Segwit with beginning of Aug 1^st . Ultimately it's users (full node operators, the whole community) who decide what is Bitcoin and what is the longest chain - all this by choosing what Bitcoin client software they are running.


Yes, pretty much. If chain split happens (which can be result of softfork or hardfork), you will have the same amount of bitcoins on both chains. Then, when you would want to use bitcoins it is best to split those bitcoins (so the transaction you intend only for one chain is not done on the other chain too). For this splitting it's most convenient to just send pre-split coins to exchange and withdraw from there coins separately for first and second chain (exchange will do the split for you and will maintain 2 accounts for you - one for each chain).

No, they should not - if you don't want to pay more to the recipient of your unconfirmed transaction.


No. 


Yes, this. 
There are only two conditions for successful CPFP:
* your new transaction must spend some output of your unconfirmed transaction - in most cases this will be the [change]( that is returned to you in your (unconfirmed) transaction;
* your fee in the second transaction has to be enough for the average fee of the two transactions (your currently unconfirmed plus the new CPFP transaction that you are going to create) to be interesting for the miners.
For the first point - see *Details* of your unconfirmed transaction in Electrum &amp; identify the change output (it should be the one that goes to new change address in your wallet), also confirm that you have the right output/address in some online blockchain explorer. 
Then you use this change - either by selecting *Send from* for given change address in Addresses tab or by selecting that exact change output in *Coins tab*. Then, with this output, you create your new **CPFP transaction** - that can go to your *Receiving address* (or anywhere where you need to send funds to (you can even add more outputs in coins if you need to send more BTC somewhere)) and send it with fee that you estimate to be the right one. 
I find easiest to do this: enable RBF in Preferences &amp; mark this new CPFP transaction as "Replaceable" - you can then write there small fee (you would need to enable manual selection of fees in preferences maybe). If you broadcast it, you can see in block explorers how big this CPFP tx is - in bytes. You will then replace this CPFP transaction of yours with new CPFP tx (that will be nearly identical) that has higher fee - by pressing right mouse button in Electrum's history on its line... 
To know how much to increase: add the byte size of your currently unconf. tx. and add the size of this new CPFP transaction. Then look here:
to see what is current recommended fee (or you can try less first - as there is chance that few fast blocks will come) and you calculate how big fee you need in your new CPFP transaction needs to be to have the average fee of your unconf plus your CPFP transactions match the fee you want to pay (that is close to the current recommended fee in link above).
    average_fee = (fee_paid_by_unconf + fee_paid_by_CPFP ) / (size_in_bytes_of_unconf + size_in_bytes_of_CPFP)
As I said, your CPFP transaction will be using RBF - i.e. will be "Replaceable" - so you will be able to increase its fee as needed. So if you are not totally in hurry, you can set the fee_paid_by_CPFP so your average fee is e.g. 150 sat/B (instead of the currently recommended 316 sat/B), and wait overnight if it confirms. If it does not you are free to increase fee_paid_by_CPFP to reach higher average fee. Note that "Increase fee" creates new transaction with new transaction ID - but the network accepts it fine (even though e.g. blockchain.info will still complain that it is double spend).  
**TL;DR:** you can use "Child Pays For Parent" mechanism by creating additional transaction that spends 1 output of your currently unconfirmed transaction. Miners will then calculate average fee of those two transactions and include both if the average fee looks good to them. It's advisable - not to overpay - to use RBF ("Replaceable") in the new CPFP transaction so it can be sent first with smaller fee but so its fee can be later increased as needed according to current conditions (over the weekend even transactions with fee under 100 sat/B are usually confirmed)...

.0. backup the wallet.dat before you use it
.1. be sure you have the right wallet (maybe you created more wallets?) - do you see your BTC address which you used to receive BTC from exchange in the client?
.2. I bet they sent the bitcoins to you, but you can verify - take the address you gave them to send BTC to, enter it in blockchain.info, hit search, examine the transactions and ballance
.3. be sure you download whole blockchain - if something is wrong, the bitcoin-qt client says that it is not fully synchronized or something - you can also try to delete the blockchain files &amp; try to start downloading blockchain again (but be sure you do not delete wallet.dat)
Alternatively, if you do not want or can not download blockchain, you can get your private key from the bitcoin-qt client, import it into some different client (there are clients that do not download blockchain) &amp; access your bitcoins from this other client:
.3b. go to console of bitcoin-qt
.4b. use the command (can't remember which) to input your password
.5b. use dumpprivkey command to get the private key of your BTC address
.6b. import priv key into other client
...however this is a bit advanced and you should better do it on clean offline machine

A special transaction is made that is recognizable by something. This is genesis transaction. The outputs (fractions of bitcoins) of this transaction will be then considered "tokens" for new purpose... Eg. the genesis transaction can have output of 0.01 BTC and this 0.01 will be consisting of one thousand 0.00001 tokens. Then, each token could be a share in a company or a coin of new currency. To be able to use this conveniently, you create new bitcoin client that recognizes said genesis transaction and shows you the tokens (shares / new coins / ...) instead of regular bitcoins. 
I just learned about colored coins also - so please correct me...

Changing to 0.1MB 1 minute blocks (from 1MB 10 minute blocks) will not bring any scaling advantage just some minor pros (e.g. faster 1st confirmation - but weaker) and cons (more orphans, more reorgs, a bit more data because more headers).
Changing to 0.2MB 1 min blocks will be the same as changing to 2MB 10 min blocks (or little bit worse I guess - from what I heard). However both these are hardforks, so not preferred by devs &amp; many users.

This was inevitable and it's exacerbated because Bitcoin is leading crypto - the moment it goes down to the second place it will get cleaner.


Mining centralization doesn't mean Bitcoin ceased to be decentralized. (Or is Bitcoin centralized, because it &amp; all its users use the same single Internet?) Decentralization means that it has no center &amp; that it is immune to attacks launched against any subset of its nodes or places where it "runs". If miner centralization poses a critical problem, POW can be changed which will maintain the decentralization of Bitcoin.

Roger is felon, failed politician &amp; early investor in Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin companies. He was the initiator of r/btc - he was crying out loud about gasp-[censorship!]( here in so he can divide the community &amp; grab the power over Bitcoin. 
In their sub they downvote any facts with a vengeance (socks &amp; bots involved probably) which then results in semi-censorship for all people with any sense there (as they get -100 karma soon &amp; reddit-wide 1 comment max per 10 min minutes rule starts to apply). They lie, do personal attacks against core developers &amp; support and spread conspiration theories about how core developers (and Blockstream company that was founded by some of those) aim to destroy Bitcoin. 
Their tactics is to behave like assholes in and then scream all over the place (in r/btc, in bitcointalk and other fora &amp; blogs) about censorship.
Meanwhile, Roger pushes his businesses there (bitcoin dot com he snatched; his new cloud mining; etc.).
Personally I think he is the psychopathic type that smiles at you while stabbing you in the back at the same time. Here: [Mt. Gox is totes fine, guys. ]( he vouches for Mt.Gox - because he was paid or as a personal favor to other felon Karpeles (owner of Gox) - right before Mt.Gox folded &amp; tool money of tens of thousands bitcoiners with it to hell. (Or maybe to hidden Karpeles' wallets - once Karpeles "found" 200000 BTC from older Mt.Gox wallets they forgot about or something like that.) And [this]( lets you see what kind of slimy lizard Ver is.
Also, lot of them in r/btc try to spread FUD and shit on Bitcoin as much as they can - either because they are paid to drag Bitcoin down or because they are invested in altcoins (+ shorting Bitcoin).
They say similar things about us, mods here, core devs &amp; Blockstream - we are at war and propaganda is working at both sides (also false flag attacks?)... However - I believe we are the good ones &amp; that they are lying and doing immoral things. :)

See, so with "ponzi-like" you mean **"fraud"**. 
I think fractional reserve banking is fraud and the fact that it is in fact legalized is just terrible. I hate people who did this. When I do deposit at bank I do not want them to take it as if I am lending it to them. If I buy gold, I want to own the gold I bought - not just some shitty promise. "You know, we only had 3 kg-s of gold, but we sold 1000 kg-s... You come too late - we already gave that 3 kg-s to others." WTF.

I was puzzled by this also - but now I think that miners who already paid for the HW are behaving just like all other sellers - they speculate and sell when they think the price is high. (I am supposing there are not many people that desperately need to convert mining income immediately to fiat.) So - only the potential future miners are important - as they choose between buying mining HW and buying BTC directly.


Unfortunatelly, CPU/GPU mining days are over... - it was good to spread Bitcoin because everybody could take part in mining. 
One more remark - with BTC value rising, nearly all miners could see ROI. Sad thing for them is that they could buy BTC instead of mining HW in the first place to have much bigger profit.

It is, because as new people join in, demand is higher and BTC rises in value (see also below).


Could be - but this doesn't matter as the economy is "price neutral" (price of BTC in USD) - it doesn't matter if BTC is changing hands fast or slow or not at all. What is relevant is: amount of newly created bitcoins and whether people want to buy all these new bitcoins at current price - if not, price goes down. OTOH, if people want to buy more bitcoins than the amount created, price rises. 
Let's try a little thought experiment: all people who use their BTC for purchases replenish their accounts (i.e. are buying back BTC *in the same value* as they spent - so they can keep purchasing same amount of goods/services in the future); miners hoard 100 % of new bitcoins ...and, BUT, we have some new people who also want BTC. Now, as we have no BTC from miners, we have more demand and the same amount of BTC =&gt; price of 1 BTC (in USD) must go up. So, people who purchase BTC denominated goods/services need to have smaller BTC balances to have/purchase the same value (see italics above) and also the new people have bitcoins they wanted. Summary: if there are no BTC created (or miners hoard everything indefinitely) and there are new people wanting BTC, prices must go up. The size of BTC economy is irrelevant.
Note that you do not need new people, it is enough if the confidence in BTC rises among current users (so they transfer bigger portion of their wealth into BTC).

Bitcoin banks (see eg. the recent Cypriot bitcoin bank announcement and there will be others), bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin stock exchanges, Winkle-ETF ...all these are holding bitcoins for you (or would be / could be). If they use your bitcoins for their things, you have little way of knowing - unless everybody withdraws from them at once. So - the fractional reserve banking is possible with bitcoin also. 
Calling fractional reserve banking "obsolete" is (like) calling stealing obsolete. It can be done even with bitcoin and it will be done, because there is good incentive: profit. 
*Note: I find fractional reserve banking immoral and hope it will not be widespread. I also do not say the above mentioned will do it - just that they can.*

blockchain itself is the chain of blocks; blocks are the lists of transactions done in Bitcoin network - so it is something technical &amp; internal to Bitcoin itself
[blockchain.info]( - is a service that shows you transactions and blocks being added to blockchain. Moreover, they offer the *online wallet*. If you register &amp; log in into their wallet - you have there your Bitcoin addresses where to and where from you can send bitcoins... There are other types of wallets you can use instead of blockchain.info wallet - "PC" wallets, mobile wallets. See [here](

You should not include price rise in your calculation - your other option is not to mine BTC and to buy BTC directly.

You have two approaches, both don't work:
* banks can create virtual currency backed by USD/EUR... - this doesn't work because banks are probably satisfied with the status quo (why to innovate when you can create laws &amp; suck blood out of people doing nothing?)
* somebody can create new digital currency - or take existing one and add central banker who is able to manipulate the value of the currency - i.e. put more coins into market when the value is too high ("print coins") or get coins out of market if the value is too low ("buy them and destroy them" or eg. say: "lets change value of coins - 100 bitcoins are now only 30 bitcoins...") - this will not work because value manipulation can be easily abused (why not to print money to yourself silently?!) and it also adds single point of failure - US authorities would visit your central banker in no time and they'll put him into jail eventually (see eg. Liberty dollar, e-gold, etc.)

Bitcoins are balances on bitcoin addresses (this all is stored in ledger that is shared among all nodes in bitcoin network (that run Bitcoin-Qt)) - see addresses, balances and trasactions here: 
You need private key for given address to be able to send bitcoins from it. Private keys are stored in your wallet by your wallet client when you generate new bitcoin address for you.
Regarding paper bitcoins - you are referring probably to paper wallets - in this case private keys are stored in some form on paper (instead of being in some file on your computer). This is for security reasons...

The more central banks print fiat the less value fiat has and the more obsolete the old system is. Also the current banking and payment system is so entrenched and petrified that it makes me sick. The potential for innovation that Bitcoin brings is enormous and unbelievable.


Bitcoin is constantly under development. It is open-source if you missed that. If sha becomes obsolete, Bitcoin will be switched to something else.

I think not. The momentum of Bitcoin is/was created by the community - the "core" users who believe in P2P principles (i.e. no central authority should interfere). Craploads of money and influence will not help you match it. See Hudson vs Jenkins - original developers and community forked Jenkins from Hudson because Oracle is not able to support the open-source projects it inherited from Sun properly. Oracle has craploads of money but Jenkins is far stronger &amp; better IMO.
Edit: also imagine the headlines: 
Google/US_gov/Amazon/whoever is creating Bitcoin clone!
...this would draw attention of many people to Bitcoin (must be good if so powerful companies/institutions are building very similar thing) and also to the idea of not being controlled by large institutions. Similar effect as banning Bitcoin - people will realize that Bitcoin is interesting &amp; important &amp; superior to things pushed by govs/companies.

Open-source - you can exactly see what the program is doing. You can see in the code that number of bitcoins is limited to 21 millions, that distribution of new bitcoins to miners is fair, etc. You can see that it is honest as it works now. I also believe that the developers are honest and are not going to change the basic premises Bitcoin is build upon (decentralization, limited amount, fair for all, ...).
Inflation - this is basically largest theft, perpetual. Government+banks create money out of thin air. They buy us or give the money to companies that buy everything and create bubbles and all kind of havoc. This is how they jam the dick up your asshole. Yes, of course they need to tax you - so you think they rob you... but well not that much, right? Bitcoin is digital gold. They cannot steal bitcoin from us, they cannot make our bitcoin value less, they cannot manipulate the prices.

If suddenly 100x more people would be using Bitcoin, transactions would have hard time to make it into block - so higher transaction fees would be required. People would be creating only "more important" transactions (i.e. eg. gambling would be limited). There is no imminent end of the world in such a scenario. However when this happens, we would clearly see what is the problem and how severe it is -&gt; solutions could be then discussed, weighted and eventually implemented accordingly. 
Edit: You should not be trying to solve hypothetical problems. It is possible that disk space / bandwidth will be growing faster than blockchain... Or maybe more people will be running full nodes on hosted servers and the remaining majority of users will be happy to use thin clients. Who knows.

I think this can not happen that fast. The transition to bitcoin is very slow, because it takes a lot time for people to understand how it works and to buy bitcoins and also for merchants to prepare the infrastructure. Even if bitcoin is better, the other currency would still exist for long time. Bitcoin is also not completely without risks - so it is wise for anybody anywhere to keep also the "old" official currency. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:45:59


This was a mistake?


Search @ blockchain.info returned nothing. I would check your wallet again - if you still see the same problem, you can try to re-create your wallet from seed (also on other computer with newer Electrum version). 
I would guess your transaction was too big (lot of dust) and was finally discarded. You should have your BTC @ your address (you can check this address balance also in blockchain.info).

Potential of Bitcoin is many orders of magnitude bigger than this IMHO... Inventions and new approaches are changing the world, not a bit of electricity you spare here and there. Take your 3rd world village for example - with Bitcoin you can now send value to people there. This was not possible before, because of their and our political and financial system. Now you and anybody can pay them for preparing news for you from the region or for sharing their culture and thoughts. African child needs some English lessons and Internet connection - then he/she can learn programming, web design, anything. Bitcoin enables them to join world economy as never thought possible before. 0.001 BTC is measly pocket change for you, for them it is really something that can significantly improve their lives... 
Next, Bitcoin is new which means the infrastructure is a bit crude. In one or two years, you will have ASICs orders of magnitude more efficient than the best mining HW we have now. Mining will also tend to be transfered to locations with cheap/abundant electricity. You have free market in action - if Bitcoin is good (better for something than the other financial options that is), people will use it and they will pay for the electricity Bitcoin needs.
Bitcoin is now in prototype phase. Look at how much resources &amp; money you need to build a prototype of a car - the order is tens of millions of $ for one prototype I guess - and we make cars for some time already... Think airplanes... We do not even know what could sprout from the Bitcoin principles/technology, there is potential for many mind blowing things. So it is a bit like basic research. Basic research is usually funded by state institutions, it costs quite a lot and the outcomes usually need many years to evolve into feasible technology. Bitcoin is like basic research that funds itself, that already delivers something usable and amazing.

Both these are just speculations. 80 % signalling now for Segwit2x doesn't mean that 80 % of hashrate will really mine hardforked coin (hardforked by businesses and some rookie developers). I think segwit will show that we don't need HF to larger blocksize and majority of hashrate will stay on the original chain (supported by veteran developers &amp; long time users).

Freedom, changing the world for the better ...to name the two most noble of the reasons.


Running at maximum capacity is rather nice problem to have - it means that users really want to use Bitcoin. We are still at the beginning. We want to have decentralization (censorship/confiscation resistance) but we still don't know what the killer apps of Bitcoin will be... Will it be store of value? Will it be a vehicle of cross border value transfer? Will it be micropayment solution (if some layers are added)? Will it be system for machine to machine value transfer?
Current state of higher fees might be just a temporary thing (if Segwit is done and blocksize HFs follow) or maybe the onchain fees stay high, but convenient offchain solutions will be developed that will give Bitcoin immense utility?
If you watch Bitcoin for long enough you realize that there is always drama with regards to technical issues (most of which are just virtual anyway).

Every full node in the network (i.e. every computer that runs the classic Bitcoin-Qt client) is performing the calculation of the target for itself. If new block (incoming from somewhere) is not matching the condition (hash is lower than target), the block is considered invalid - which means it is not relayed to other nodes.


There is no special individual in the Bitcoin network.

Colored coins - proposed way to track ownership of something. It would make easy buying some shares of something with Bitcoin as colored coins are also bitcoins. The way how you distinguish between ordinary bitcoins and colored coins is that you create special wallet software (eg. one prototype implementation used altered Armory code) - this special wallet recognizes outputs of some transaction to be the original shares - you can take eg. this [transaction]( and say in the wallet software that that 0.0001 BTC output is in fact 100 shares of your new company (i.e. 100 "tokens" represented by 0,000001 BTC values). Using your colored coin wallet, you can send these tokens (shares) to anyone via the Bitcoin network. Recipient's colored coin wallet then recognizes the tokens you are sending (because it can track the transaction back to the original transaction that created the shares - see the link above). 
Does this make sense?
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:45:12


Yes. You made a small mistake (0+10) not (10+10), so the result should be 8.8. But yes, you won but lost money - because you placed the bet too late!


Why? See also [this]( comment. There is basically a point in time when it ceases to be profitable to bet even on the winning side(!)... It is because the fee. And yes - it is a bit weird at the first sight, but you can learn to live with it &amp; enjoy it. ;) Personally, I find it brilliant. This happens also in life - if you come late, even the good things are not profitable. Or: two people starving + one bread. If the bread is eaten fast enough by the single one of them, then this one survives. But if they wait too long, even eating the whole bread is not enough to avert death by starving of both. :)

 .2. transfer &amp; install it to machine that was never (&amp; never will be) online 
 .3. create new wallet - remember and/or write down the seed (the seed is all you need to recreate the wallet later)
 .4. a. bring addresses from your wallet to online machine
 .4. b. bring seedless wallet to online machine (this is nice - you can watch your ballance and even create transactions that you can sign on the offline machine)
 .5. send BTC to your address (from 4.a. or 4.b.)

Correct! Write down &amp; test the seed first (that it creates the wallet) before you send BTC to those generated addresses...
Pro-tip: for best security &amp; convenience: you create hot wallet &amp; offline savings wallet. 
* hot wallet - 2 - 10 % of your funds, created by Electrum on your machine connected to internet, password protected; 
* offline savings wallet - 90 - 98 % of your funds, created using Electrum on offline computer (computer that is not and will not be connected to the Internet). (You can also keep only the seed as paper wallet &amp; restore savings wallet on offline computer only when needed.) Electrum lets you create seedless (without private keys) version of wallets - so you can have seedless savings wallet on your online machine to see your savings balance. 
Then - you typically use only hot wallet. If you have more BTC, you send some to savings addresses... On rare occasions when you need to use BTC from savings wallet, you create transaction in your online seedless savings wallet, transfer the transaction with USB disk to your offline machine, sign the transaction in your savings wallet and bring the signed transaction back to your online machine using USB disk again. This way nobody from internet can possibly see your savings wallet file or the seed you use to create it...

If there was no fee, it would make no difference if you bet early or late. This is because people place bets where they see they can profit (i.e. the side where the fraction of total money is smaller than the chance that said side wins). This leads to the situation that fractions of total money match the odds exactly ("crowdsourced odds" as other commenter puts it). So, you loose nothing by betting early...

When you first open Electrum, it generates 12 word seed for you. From this seed, all addresses (and their private keys) in the wallet (even all the future ones - unlike in Bitcoin-Qt) are generated. So all you need to remember is this seed. 
However, if you import your private key which was created elsewhere, it is not possible to generate this private key from the seed and you receive this warning


so you do not forget that you have BTC on address with private key that cannot be recovered from seed. Seed stored as paper wallet is the usual way how to keep cold storage, so the above warning makes sense... If you just import your key &amp; send your BTC elsewhere, you can ignore it.

You need to download the entire blockchain so Bitcoin-Qt client can work. Bitcoin-Qt is a bitcoin wallet - so are Electrum or MultiBit... (And also Coinbase works as bitcoin wallet.)
You need no bitcoin wallet for GUI miner to work. Miner program just does work &amp; sends results to pool. (So - no need for local bitcoin client - i.e. wallet.) Bitcoins you earned in pool are in your pool account. From there you can send it to your address (controlled by your wallet - Coinbase/Electrum/MultiBit/Bitcoin-Qt/whatever).

I think volatility will be decreased significantly in the future - when more people start using Bitcoin. Fiat-BTC exchanges are bottlenecks now - that should also improve (look at what NeoBee is doing with ZipZap just now; there is possibility/potential for decentralized exchanges; more people can also buy/sell BTC face to face via localbitcoins or similar)... 
Now I know BTC price will rise in future because Bitcoin is an amazing invention that will change the world (so I am not worried about bubbles and market corrections that bring us to price that we had one or two months ago...). Total amount of Bitcoins is limited to 21M - think about that for a moment. Think about fiat inflation - what it does to our savings...
Regarding merchants - they can use middleman who convert BTC immediately to fiat (Bitpay, Coinbase, BIPS) or they can hedge themselves, see the article on front page now:
...CEO of Overstock is talking about hedging against BTC price changing - as Bitcoin grows, there should be more financial instruments available (eg. options) in the future... 
I expect also services that will maintain wallets denominated in USD but sending will be done via BTC - this might also be close to what you suggest with dollar-pegged virtual currency...

For convenience, you may use online wallet (but preferably for smaller amounts of BTC only).
I would recommend downloading Electrum - it's quite convenient (thin client, easy to use) &amp; allows you signing transaction on an offline machine (if you want extra security). 
Paper wallet is also nice in this client - as all you need to remember is the seed. From seed you can recreate your wallet - including all the change addresses ("deterministic wallet").

Exactly. They are less valuable and less popular. OTOH, they make nice experimental "laboratories". Also, if Bitcoin ever fails (how unlikely it seems), we can switch to any other cryptocurrency... The cat is out of bag - now we have the freedom to send value to anybody anywhere without being controlled by govsters/banksters.

I think the better analogy is that in your box is cash (or maybe envelopes with something or checks) - you open it with your key, take all the cash &amp; throw some bills into your friend's box and some into your other box... The point is that the box is analogy of Bitcoin address - you have the access even after the transaction (and you can even re-use the box), you are not giving the control over it to your friend. Instead, you take something from your box/address and give it into his/hers.

When mining is unprofitable, less miners will mine in the future - so the mining becomes profitable again. Future fees depend more on the technical limitations (i.e. how much transactions you can put in a block) than on the current mining profit. If higher fees are required, people will be sending less transactions - then equilibrium is reached. I guess the fees (in $) will not be higher than today - we will have larger blocks and also much more efficient miners (plus also off-chain transactions perhaps)...

Bitcoins are balances on addresses in public ledger which is shared in P2P manner and extended with new entries which contain transactions that send bitcoins from one address to other.
Bitcoins are limited resource that is leveraged to store wealth and also to transfer it instantly &amp; seamlessly to anyone without the risk of losing value due to government induced theft (taxation, inflation, confiscation).
Bitcoins are freedom.

Oh common - sending money via bank wire is not difficult... (The difficult part is waiting if you receive something in return... :D)


Early adopters receive more profit later as a compensation for the difficulties they had to overcome.

From any type of bitcoin wallet you can send bitcoins directly anywhere. 
Regarding buying of bitcoins - main methods are: 
* buying with cash from local people - see [localbitcoins](
* buying with money using your bank (sending money via bank wire to banks of [exchanges]( or allowing the exchange to control your account directly - this is what Coinbase is using, but I never tried that)

Just buy for $50 ...or $10, whatever. Use blockchain wallet or Electrum/MultiBit, try sending coins to friends or your other addresses - that's the best way to learn... If you use only small amounts, you do not need to be afraid of hacks (I even think that losing $10 to find out your computer is insecure is quite a good deal)...

People who bought large amounts of bitcoin sometimes try to sell fast to induce panic selling (or "to convince people that the price is higher than it should be" to put it differently). If they succeed, they profit, because they can re-buy at lower price. Sometimes it also fails miserably - as there could be far too many others waiting for small dip to buy - then the sellers can't re-buy at lower price and effectively sold under market price...

We bought 100 BTC @ 600. Now the price is say $720. We like to hold BTC long term, so we will use only 5 BTC now. This 5 BTC we split into say 5 asks:
* 1.0 BTC to sell @ $750
* 1.0 BTC to sell @ $900
* 1.0 BTC to sell @ $1,080
* 1.0 BTC to sell @ $1,296
* 1.0 BTC to sell @ $1,555
we wait some hours/days - and the price jumped to for example $780 - this means we now have $750 because first of our asks was filled. Now, we place a bid:
* buy 1.0 BTC @ $700
Now - two things can happen - either price goes down again - then we re-buy our 1.0 BTC cheaper (we have $50 profit), or the price will never go under $701 ...then we just realized some profit "from before" (all our asks were placed above our original entry price). In the latter case it would be better to have that 1.0 BTC (@ $780 or higher) than our $750 we got from selling - but this is the price we pay for "being insured against the price fall" so to speak.
So, with the above system - if you are lucky and there are bubbles and oscillations, you make money and stabilize the market (panic buyers can not drive the price too high because of your asks and panic sellers can't drive the price too low because of your bids), if you are unlucky and the price only rises - your profit is less than it could have been - but that is the price for the "insurance against price drop" and "more stable market". Note that if you spread ask prices accordingly (eg. the ask prices above are geometrical series with ratio 1.2 (i.e. 900 = 1.2 * 750) ...by using this we know we are not selling our BTC too fast - ask number 16 is  you sell only small portion of your stash in the worst case (price going all the way up so none of your bids is filled).

I was explaining it as writing new page in the book with transactions - the catch is that when you think you finished the page, it disappears "mysteriously" in nearly all cases and you need to start over.
The purpose of the mysterious page disappearance is that we need creating new page to be far slower than cloning the book &amp; sending it to all places in the world - so everybody has the same book - i.e. everybody can look up and agree with other people which transactions took place.

So do some research then. You wanted security, I gave you a hint how you can achieve it.
Of course you can have other wallet on your online computer (or online wallet) for everyday small expenses. But having large balances on online computer is not recommended.


I disagree. If you say: "Look, you need some security. Do these 6 simple steps. You know, you are your own bank, your money deserve some protection.", people take it.

There is no last block - mining will continue forever as we need transactions be be confirmed... Only block rewards diminish. Once in the future, transaction fees will dominate the block rewards.
If you look in any block, eg. [this]( you see there "No Inputs (Newly Generated Coins)" ...this is the reward for the miner (the address it goes to is inserted by him) - note that it consists of block reward (25 BTC) and transaction fees (0.11177311 BTC in the example linked above).

Using second chain seems to be a big hassle. As I mentioned in the discussion of your original [post]( maybe the Bitcion [script]( mechanism (with some changes possibly) can do it in a simple way.
What about this: the output forces the next spending transaction to have big waiting time (NLockTime? / block number? / ...) ...unless two private keys are used. 
So - anybody with 1 private key would be able to create transactions from your hot wallet addresses (from the outputs there) which have (large) waiting times. If you spot malicious transaction, you will be able to override it by transaction that has no waiting time using your second private key... 
I do not know if this is possible now (probably not), but with my limited knowledge this seems far simpler than your proposal.

Total power of current bitcoin miners is huge, this worm would need millions of PCs (with good GPUs) under its control to match this (which is unlikely). 
Even if you double the speed of the Bitcoin miners instantly - it would take just approx. 6 days, before the difficulty adjusts. Then the generation of coins will be again roughly 25 BTC in 9 minutes... In that transitional 6 days, more coins will be generated (say extra 20000 BTC) ..but thats it, no big effect. And also - when the worm is found &amp; neutralized, opposite effect will take place - the difficulty will be higher than it should be for some days - leading to creating less BTC than usual for some days... 
The rate of creation of BTC is cleverly controlled to match this: [amount of BTC over time]( You could try to look [here]( to see the difficulty adjustments to the total power of miners.

I suggest to print eg. 2000 private keys or Electrum seeds twice. Keep these "key" books at two different safe locations. When one book is stolen, the thief needs to try the keys/seeds by hand or use OCR which takes time.

[Here]( may be some clues...
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:44:26
If you have majority of mining power, you can do this:
 
.0. spend some bitcoins (the transaction T is in a block B1 which is preceded by block B0) 
.1. you wait for 6 confirmations (i.e. 5 additional blocks B2..B6 which follow B1)
.2. (together with .1.) you mine alternative blocks B1a..B7a which **do not contain your transaction T**
.3. you mine one more block B7a faster than the rest of the network mines B7
now: your chain B0-B1a-B2a-B3a-B4a-B5a-B6a-B7a is longer than B0-B1-B2-B3-B4-B5-B6 created by the rest of the network (because you mine faster than the rest of the network). Chain is longer, so the miners will use this chain B0-B1a-..-B7a and not the chain B0-B1-..-B6. This means that all transactions from blocks B1..B6 are removed from blockchain - which means **you have your coins that you spend in your transaction T back** and you can spend them once more.
So 51 % attack lets you "erase" the transaction you made (which had 6 confirmations) and you have your coins again as if you never sent them away.

Freedom, convenience, avoiding theft which is  inflation, great transparency in some respects (blockchain, open-source) + nearly anonymous (new address can be created easily without giving away the owners identity).

For the whole thing (I mean Bitcoin) to work, you need to have blockchains on different places synchronized &amp; you need to be able to send transaction to some node of Bitcoin network. If you do not send data via Internet, you would need some other way how to do it (meshnets?, mobile operator data transfer?)...
What is significant for this ATM is that it can work in places without the Internet. This makes it's construction and operation (much) more simple. Think some hypothetical country in Africa that has mobile phone network, but no Internet: people can buy/sell bitcoins with this ATM - using their mobile phones to send the codes and also to use bitcoins. It can work also with dumb phones. The gateway into Internet could be even in different country. (For further info, see: Kipochi &amp; M-PESA.).

This is only because the (winning) pool where you place your bet has the vast majority of money (so the opponent pool is nearly nil) and because **you placed your bet too late**. If you placed your bet at the beginning when the fee is low, you would profit. 
Do not place your bets on pool that has nearly all money when the fee is high, ok?

You can say "spam" only if it has no purpose. This service allows eg. storing hash into blockchain which proves that you are the author of some given document. BTW: You cannot prevent ppl storing their data into blockchain (even if you make the script system less general, I can still code the information into the sending/receiving address or into the amount being sent).

My layman understanding: 


This is correct - the more money you print, the higher the prices (of everything) rise... 
If you keep printing fast enough, people eventually lose confidence in the currency ("Why to have $ when it is loosing 50 % of value every decade/year/month...?") - then they try to get rid of it, the prices rise even more as everybody is buying everything and nobody wants to hold $... 
The opposite thing is when you do not print fast enough - i.e. when the loans are being repaid and/or there are defaults - the amount of money is decreasing (or not increasing enough compared to growth of economy) - then you have a deflationary phase. Value of money is rising, bubbles in stocks/commodities etc. (formerly driven by money printing) are popping, misallocated capital must be liquidated, people lose jobs and have less money -&gt; they try to save more for even worse future -&gt; prices get even lower...

One idea for simple project just occurred to me: **Bitcoin theft preventor** - imagine someone steals bitcoins from your address. Our theft preventor sits on the network, if it spots the transaction that is robbing said address - it immediately ~~creates~~ publishes already created "double spend" transaction with far higher fee that goes to other address owned by the same owner as the said address above. ...of course: if that's you who is sending money from said (most likely savings) address - it is best to turn theft preventor off first... ;)

Your pool means "your pool without your bet" - it has to be like this to fulfill the premise that you (if you are alone on the winning side) take whole losing pool. Feel free to do the calculations by yourself.


No, the point you are trying to make is that it is unacceptable to have correct guess and still lose money. As I already said, I like this possibility in the game. You come too late &amp; join the winning pool with the vast majority of money =&gt; you lose money.

Yes. They can make ROI only if price of BTC rises - but even though it was far better for them to buy BTC instead of mining equipment in the first place.

Sometimes you just do not have other options than to cut off the rotten flesh (govsters, banksters, current system of financial control) out of the wound so it can heal. The pain is overwhelming (people poor, starving, fighting), but it is the only way how you can be healed. Do nothing, avoid the pain and you might find yourself dead or in far bigger pain. 
Now - you call the surgeons who try to heal the wound sick and you probably celebrate the very people who directly willingly created the wound. How sick are you? :)

Welcome! Local wallet (Multibit/Electrum/Bitcoin-Qt) should be more secure - providing you do not have malware on your computer. Online wallets were/are hacked often (Bitcoinica, BIPS, inputs.io, ...). 
Yet more secure are paper wallets and/or offline wallets - I recommend creating offline wallet (i.e. wallet on computer that will never be connected to the Internet again - or computer that you disconnect from the Internet &amp; boot a live CD/USB with eg. Linux) with Electrum. Electrum seed is your paper wallet (i.e. backup), Electrum lets you recreate your offline wallet from seed and then you can create transaction on your seedless (watch) wallet on online computer, transafer transaction via USB key to offline computer, sign it and take it back to online machine via USB key &amp; broadcast. This way your private keys are protected against being stolen (sent over the Internet). Needless to say - it is a bit of a hassle, but if you want to store significant amounts, you do not mind spending some more hours for the sake of security of your savings wallet. ;)

No, equilibrium will be reached &amp; maintained. Nobody is going to pay higher fees than necessary, but also everybody will need to pay some minimal/average fee to avoid delays or complete discards of transactions. 
So, people will pay fees according to how they value the service. Miners either invest and increase hashing power or cease to mine if it becomes unprofitable. 


Please note that you could process the transactions with 1 Mhash instead of current 600 Thash and everything would work - providing nobody would want to attack the network and create fraudulent transactions. Bitcoin needs as much hash power as possible to be immune against those attempts to create fraudulent transactions... As I said above - if people pay higher fees, miners will boost the mining power and the network will be more secure.

First, I do not think carbon is that important... But:
0.03% is laughable. He is taking blockchain.info power consumption which is way off (because it is based on GPU consumption estimates!). 


Not that important, but this assumption is also too high. Majority of bitcoins is mined with ASICs that are (and will be) under one year old - for those ASICs you pay far more for design/dev/manufactoring than for electricity.
Author also conveniently misses the amazing aspect of Bitcoin mining - it can move anywhere on Earth where electricity is cheapest (and/or cleanest). No other current technology is so flexible.


And what about block reward 6.25? Or 3.125?

Spending bitcoins and selling bitcoins is the same thing - either you buy goods with them or you buy other currencies with them. So both selling and spending bitcoin has the same effect - it adds to supply (as you do not want bitcoins - you want something else). I.e. also - it makes (available) bitcoins less scarce.
Supply drives price down. This is not limited to bitcoins, it is like this with everything. Imagine that all rich people get crazy (or they just know of new law forbidding luxury cars but other people do not know about it (yet)) - now all these rich guys try to sell their luxury cars. There is some demand at current prices that is going to be satisfied, but then - the sellers would need to offer smaller (and smaller (and smaller (...))) price to sell their cars. At lower prices, there is higher demand - I, personally, would not buy Lamborghini or Porsche for $100,000 ...but I would be tempted at $5,000 for example and at $1,000 I would buy more than one probably... ;)

There is no problem - if there would be less miners, there would be incentive for others to start mining. If there are many miners, mining profit is lower and some miners just buy BTC instead of re-investing into mining (or even instead of running their miners)... What you have here is a free market system that oscillates around the equilibrium. 
Simply: we have enough miners but not too much + miners have the incentive to be efficient (maximizing speed + minimizing costs)...

Bitcoin will not* help with moving wealth out of the country (in total). Imagine you are a rich guy and you want to leave with your wealth - you buy bitcoins from local miners and leave China (to some country where you exchange bitcoins for dollars or whatever). What happened? Did RMB leave China? No - you only gave RMB to another person in China and only "exported" the bitcoins. If you buy bitcoins not from local miner but from foreigner face to face he then either keeps the money in China or needs to leave with the money (which is the same as if you want to leave with the money). If you try buy bitcoins on some foreign market - you need to send the money out of the country which is prohibited and not possible probably (i.e. those capital controls you want to circumvent). In any case - the result is that bitcoins are not helping with moving wealth out of the country...
Note: For individuals, bitcoin can help moving wealth out of the country - providing that bitcoins are created in the country or that there is influx of bitcoins from abroad (eg. remittances)... but this wealth are in fact newly created/imported bitcoins only.

As far as I understand this [post]( colored coins can play the role of previous century banknotes (i.e. banknotes that were redeemable for gold in the issuing bank). The same way as the banknote represented some amount of gold somewhere, colored coins would represent some amount of USD deposited somewhere... Then, you can have decentralized (P2P) exchange where people freely exchange colored coins for bitcoins. At any point, holders of colored coins can redeem those for USD those colored coins are representing at the company issuing colored coins.

We also want to be able to fine-tune this "high" probability above - so we can control the average time to create new valid page (this is the *difficulty* coefficient - the higher difficulty the less probable that your new page is valid (i.e. that it doesn't disappear)).

Yes, it is ingenious.

You have a target - this is big number such as 
if the block hash (see 'Hash' eg. [here]( is smaller, the block is ok.
If you make target smaller, it will be harder to find block with hash which is smaller than target...
Now - the difficulty is the factor by which the target is smaller than the original target of block  The higher the difficulty, the smaller the target, the harder to find (correct) block.
Edit: you probably know that mining is trying different transaction trees and different nonces - each change of these leads to completely different block hash. And also the hash is completely unpredictable from the inputs (I mean block contents) - hence mining is the lottery as the other comments suggest.

Seed capital: +roll
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:29:58
No. When you enter your seed in Electrum (say on new machine) - it re-creates your wallet (it uses the seed to re-create all of the addresses in the wallet + all their private keys). Then all your private keys are unencrypted in electrum.dat file. Everybody who gets electrum.dat can spend from that wallet. To protect against this, you put password to lock this electrum.dat on this machine...
* **seed** is a 12 word thing that lets you re-create your wallet (its kind of wallet backup or "paper wallet"); 
* **password** is a string of characters that encrypts your electrum.dat (your wallet) on the machine where you (re-)created it.
Electrum seed is about re-creating your wallet (or storing your wallet "on paper only" on some secure place), it is not about protecting your bitcoins on wallet you have on your computer - for this, you have to have there a password. 
If you have Electrum wallet in your machine it is not more secure than Multibit - both have passwords (and the security depends on you - how you choose and handle the password among other things)... 
There is a way how to run Electrum in more secure "mode" - the so called *offline* wallet - when you have your wallet (electrum.dat) on machine that is never connected to internet...

Computers/apps/modules/whatever in Bitcoin network are individuals, but not special individuals - every (full) node in Bitcoin network is the same as all other nodes. If you shut down randomly chosen 98 % of nodes, the network will be working without problems. There is no special individual, no center.


This should not happen - ideally, all the nodes should have the same version of bitcoin client - so all the targets on all nodes are the same number. Your thoughts are certainly interesting - because what will happen when there are clients with different versions? (I.e. full nodes that work differently than others?) I am not completely sure - but I think you can have full spectrum of outcomes - if the new version is backward compatible, Bitcoin network will be working more or less the same (the new features/optimizations will not work on older nodes) ...if nodes differ more, it can lead to more severe consequences - eventually into split of Bitcoin network into two (if you are interested in these things, you can continue study with [march blockchain fork](


There is no other way to know how fast the mining network is than looking at how fast the blocks are coming. Block creation time is quite random (but 99%+ falls into 0..120 min interval) - so you need to average the block times =&gt; we take last 2016 blocks. Then we calculate the average block time... 
Let's say the average block time is 7.5 minutes (in the moment of difficulty recalculation) - we know that we want block time to be 10 minutes (2016 blocks in 2 weeks) - so we know that the new target should be 75 % of the target we had...
You can look here:
see the bottom chart ("Bitcon Block Generation Speed vs Difficulty") - you see there how the difficulty jumps every 2016 blocks. It jumps precisely to the value that moves the blue line (2016 blocks average to the value of 600 [s]) - i.e. this is what I described above - if the mining network cease to grow in the moment of difficulty recalculation, blocks will be coming in 10 min each on average. However, mining network grows, so the (2016) block average time jumps to 600 seconds, but then the average goes down (difficulty is the same, mining network gets faster)... You can observe this also here:
just before difficulty change, mining of the last 7 blocks takes usually 40 - 60 minutes. Just after the next difficulty increase, the last blocks take usually 50 - 70 minutes...

Limited amount of BTC: BTC creation is hard-wired in Bitcoin-Qt code (see "GetBlockValue()" in [here]( Every block now creates 25 BTC, this amount is already half of the original 50 BTC/block. Every 210,000 blocks this amount is halved. See [this](
Storing: there are [different types]( of wallets. Best security have solutions that are never connected to internet (i.e. offline wallets or paper wallets).

Sending to your receiving address in MultiBit is the correct way. "Receiving address" means that it is the address which you control when you use your MultiBit wallet (i.e. address you are able to send from). 
You should protect your wallet:
- from losing (having multiple backups)
- from being stolen (strong password and/or not giving it to anybody)
When your BTC balance gets bigger than say 1 BTC, you should also start thinking about the most secure option - cold storage (paper/offline wallets).

If they destroy Bitcoin (or nearly destroy), other alternative(s) pop up immediately into mainstream. Look how many altcoins we have already. People could be constantly switching to new currencies until the govsters + banksters accept their defeat in this. Heck, this could also spawn new political streams - look how Pirate Party came into being because people hate misuse of copyright. 
I say we do not want government that is stealing from people. Government that is hindering - without reason - the ways people use to store and exchange value.

The problem with democracy is that nearly all people are brainwashed by media propaganda. *It hurts to think.*
Similar (or parallel) crazy idea: Let Reddit be the "Government Engine" - we just need to force state institutions to obey to what we people vote here. :) I think the system here is one of the best ways to get important ideas into attention and have discussions about them. I suggest one more addition - if I upvote somebody, 0.1 % of my "citizen vote" will be transferred to this person. So when (s)he votes in the future for something, it will be also partially in my name. This is how we could upvote our representatives... ;)

Basics: 
* it's open-source - you can examine how exactly it works (C++ code) if you want; 
* it's like bittorrent - P2P - everybody who runs the (classic) client is part of the network that has no central node (=&gt; cannot be shut down);
* ...so it's about the freedom - you can send BTC to anybody anywhere, you can also be (pretty much) anonymous if you want (creating new address is easy, nobody knows how much addresses you control);
* each node in Bitcoin network has the same copy of blockchain (and shares it to all others) - in this blockchain we have blocks that contains transactions: who sends BTC to who - bitcoins are in fact only numbers in these transactions; 
* there will be only total of **21 million** bitcoins - this means that nobody will be able to devaluate your savings at will (as governments do with savings we have in fiat), now we have ~12M BTC - the way how Bitcoins were created and spread among the people was the most fair approach possible;

Oh, rly? Compared to what? Do you know how much energy (and other resources!) banks &amp; credit companies need? Even if Bitcoin really was using more energy I do not care because Bitcoin is so much better than status quo &amp; the energy cost is paid by people who buy bitcoin from miners so what? Are you really going to peoples houses telling them that they should have lower energy bill?
Bitcoin is a new paradigm. It was never so easy - never in the history of mankind - to hold and transfer value to anybody. If it makes you feel better, think that Bitcoin is now in research phase. As PhD. student, you must know how much money and resources you need to put into research / prototype design / testing etc. before you arrive at nice cheap solution.

Nice graphic, but bitcoin mining is not important for newbies... That should be your message. Bitcoin is great, but mining is unfortunately for experts only (say since Feb 2013).




As already pointed out, this is wrong. I say: utter bullshit.
"If the current rate of production remains steady (...)" - **not** going to happen. Not with US$ and most certainly not with BTC.
"(...) there will be more bitcoins (...) than U.S. currency" - **not** (unless you expect US$ HYPER-deflation or complete fall of US$).
I would suggest charting how much goods (gold, bread, whatever) you can buy with all bitcoins vs all US$ (or eg. with 1/1,000,000 of total supply of BTC and US$).
Other things:
Are the pictures hinting that CPU is faster than GPU? 
No mentioning of ASICs? 
"With the Bitcoin algorithms becoming harder and harder to mine, (...)" - this sentence is also wrong. Algorithms stay the same, only the difficulty rises -&gt; blocks are harder to mine.
You should compare electricity consumption to the drain of established payment systems - show that Bitcoin is in fact more environment friendly as it is more simple (-&gt;cheaper).
TL;DR Nice, but do some research first.

Mining is just creating new page in transaction book... The catch is that your page destroys itself in 999,999,999,999 out of 1,000,000,000,000 cases (this depends on difficulty) just before finishing and you need to start writing the page again. Eventually, one of the miners gets lucky and creates the new page and then all miners move on and start their attempts on creating the page after that...
The above mechanism is there because we want creation of the new page to be far slower than cloning the book &amp; sending it to all libraries... Anybody can add new page, everybody in the world has the same book.

Nobody, so I chime in with my dull common sense: 
[Wiki]( *A default could trigger a variety of economic problems including a financial crisis and a decline in output that would put the country into a recession.*
Also rating downgrades are mentioned - if you do not repay your debts, it is logical that others are not willing to lend you any more (or they do but with far higher interest).
People losing jobs, less money earned -&gt; cascading debt defaults (people, companies, banks, local governments) + also crashing prices (markets, real estate, Bitcoin, gold, everything non-essential)... Chaos. At this point, everything is possible. Maybe mega-QE is initiated &amp; hyper-inflation of USD follows. Everybody sells USD dollars for everything. Bitcoin is world reserve currency.

Transaction fee in Bitcoin-Qt is only enforced in GUI, network nodes are relaying (and miners are mining) transactions which are completely without fee... It is almost no cost for miner to add 0 fee transaction (providing there are not others with higher fee that would be forced to be excluded eg. due to block size limit) - so they add it just to help the network... (Better network -&gt; more people join -&gt; higher price of BTC...)
Now, let's say we get to the point when there are more new transactions each 10 minutes than could possibly be put into one block. What happens? People are forced to pay higher fee to get their transactions confirmed - some will do less transactions, some abandon completely. Developers see this and they think if they can rise block size limit (it should not be too big, because then blockchain grows too fast; but it should not be to small - to prevent detracting people from using Bitcoin).
TL;DR - Currently, you can get even 0 fee transactions confirmed. Developers set block size limit - then it boils down to free market economy. With given technical limitations, people pay as low fees as they possibly can to get their transactions confirmed (fast).

Just wait 5 years till governments get rid of cash completely. Then you'll have your non-secrecy currency dream come true. Every shit you will ever buy - even the slightest smallest shit you ever buy with money and not barter will be recorded in your bank records (also available to government). Just ask us - people who lived behind the iron curtain - how sick the government and state can be... The technology now gives governments far bigger ability to observe and track habits/opinions/money of people. Also the propaganda is far more effective with current controlled media.

Bitcoin is superior in many aspects to "regular" money: controlled &amp; decreasing inflation, no borders, instant transfers, nearly anonymous, no counterfeits, cannot be seized easily... (It is not free money though, you might get this impression from some older videos, but Bitcoin mining is very competitive now...) 
The underlying technology (Bitcoin viewed as protocol) can also have bigger impact than "just" improvements in money transfers. Eg. colored coins are a proposal to use Bitcoin protocol/network/transactions/data to track ownership of property (shares, real estate, anything). There is great potential for other things like this to emerge (bitmessage, namecoin, ...).

Ok, I am not familiar with their architecture. But using colored coins concept, we can have bids &amp; asks in blockchain and decentralized matching, right?
I imagine: 
* bid is a an output (you created by sending to random new address) that requires 1 of 2 multisig to spend  (either you or matching service can spend) - the amount of BTC in this output is the amount you want to buy shares with, the price (i.e. the amount of shares you want to buy) is somehow encoded in the transaction... in the same way:
* ask is an colored coin output sent to new address that requires 1 of 2 multisig - in the transaction that created the output the price in BTC is encoded somehow (for those colored coins that are in this output)...
...now, matching service scans the blockchain for bids &amp; asks and if there is a match, it creates transaction that swaps BTC for colored coins... 
If you want to cancel your bid (or ask), you just send the bid (ask) output to your address (which is no longer 1 of 2 multisig with matching service holding 1 private key)...
What do you think?

It's a little known fact that DPR has no 600,000 BTC. In fact, SR was a non-profit organization with the goal of spreading libertarian ideas... (If you wonder - DPR used the income to pay for services and the rest was just sent to addresses for which there exist no private keys.) ;)

Try harder next time.

 ...should read USD on y axis not BTC
 ...description of this chart is confusing - trade volume is higher or transaction volume is higher? (I.e. is it trade vol. divided by transaction vol or vice versa?)

Yeah, you cannot understand it without first-hand experience. 
Get a wallet (either install Electrum/MultiBit on your PC or use blockchain.info online wallet), then try to send there BTC you received here as that tip (follow the "what is this?" link - there is how to withdraw to your address (which you will have in your wallet SW after you install it)).
Have fun!

Either they hoard it indefinitely (die without spending) or they spend it finally after some months/years. In the first case - purchasing power of all others grows, in the latter case you get your customers eventually after some time. 
Where is the problem?

If you have 6+ confirmations... thats it. You do not need to worry. Sometimes blockchain.info shows more confirmations, but this is purely informative. 
If you have 6 confirmations it means your transaction is in the block and this block is already followed by 5 other blocks in the blockchain. If your transaction is in the block which is followed by 50 blocks - then your transaction is completely totally confirmed.
