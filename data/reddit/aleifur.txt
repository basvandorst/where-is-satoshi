There are two possibilities: 
1) A disgruntled customer can ruin his credibility and he gets more money in the long term if he is trusted. (Game theory option)
2) He really is just a swell guy that enjoys using his expertise to help people. (Swell guy option)
(my bet tho is that it is both option 1 and 2)

how can one save against this if the computer is already infected but the wallet is encrypted?
Transfer the wallet.dat file to another computer/fresh install and transfer then or what?
