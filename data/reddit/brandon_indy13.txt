Political uncertainty and capital control/ war on cash
are the main ones.

I like to point to Microsoft, apple, &amp; ibm back In the day. The people who invested early got rich :). 
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:23:49
Yes. But they sure know how not to email people or say shit about it.. not even a quick tweet. Good reason not to use them. I got 2 emails from other exchanges today
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:19:20
Yes, poloniex exchange :).

Just wait till Bitcoin unlimited gets more serous. The network will be forced to move to segwit or be left behind.

Who cares about the etf. Look at the Nasdaq. Hello! Huge fucking bubble about to burst. I'm holding if 1st ETF doesn't go through. I'm staying safe and take a small loss in case of a bigger one
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:20:25
Idk I can see more tracks through the clouds
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:22:18
Try out gemini exchange. You'll save money &amp; it's just far better

Craziest thing, Wikileaks has only leaked 1% of the file 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:32:03
Working fine here

More than likely there will be a fed hike increase on the 15th . Gold I know does extremely well and assume Bitcoin will as well. There's a lot of things as why people may be holding. The us market is very unpredictable in these next few weeks. I know I'm keeping Bitcoin as my safe asset

I don't want to tell you what you should do lol.. but hey 21 club, Nice job lol
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:53:53
If you don't trust exchanges. Buy a hardware wallet of amazon.

I've got BTC3.983E-5 today running off a 9 gh's gekkio and 40 gh/s rockminer. So I've lost money in power, but maybe the 100's of litecoins might be worth a little some day. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:38:01
 
@_date: 2017-01-15 15:34:29
I found out the coin it was randomly mining over the night was called MZC. Witch supports the Lakota Nation. They also helped in fighting the Dakota access pipeline. I learned something new this morning and maybe helped a tribe establish some help with there Cryptocurrency. I found this knowledge worth more than the money ;)
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:20:31
I'm running some extremely low GH/s miners right now on ipominer. It's pretty good. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:34:40
I've never had a problem and I used the same bank and exchange. But it's good cause anyway to divest. Defund the dapl :) 
@_date: 2017-01-21 12:56:12
Mining is profitable. People are constantly buying miners. I bought and sold mine for more. In the process I mined 1000's of litcoins. Worth nothing, but the broad aspect is I treat my mining pool account as a portfolio investment. You'll loose money from power consumption, but a year or so from now one of those litcoins that r worth 1/10000 of a dollar might be 10 cents some day or more :).  
@_date: 2017-01-15 03:46:39
You're not thinking big enough. We got megaupload bitache and segwit. Along with a little Donald trump political turmoil all in next few weeks. It's going to the moon
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:43:56
Defund. Buy more bits. Fuck the banks
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:12:45
Gemini exchange noobs. Fuck that coinbase shit. Then come to poloniex when your purchases come through ;). 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:32:46
Someone needs to start doing some investigated journalism. Start making phone calls and getting info. I'm little panic right now. I sleep easy knowing my stuff is safe 
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:47:58
It's a correction. You can't expect a straight line up lol. It will find its bottom and then continue to hit a higher point
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:10:37
Corrections happen. It's how people day trade. But the market as whole is only 87b. Apple is 800b. Until we hit a trillion. I don't think a crypto bubble will form anytime soon. Hell almost every person I know doesn't have I idea what a Bitcoin is. We're not mainstream yet
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:25:17
I saw many post on this also. Thought about asking trollbox before I withdrew, but said fuck it. My eth showed up on my wallet in 3 minutes(not counting all confirmations, it just processed and I knew it was fine. But It was like 50k users online. Those fucks don't know how to log off and let things settle lol... &amp; they'll prob be 60k by tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:30:19
Yaaa they got bad rep lol... they don't scam but they give horrible customer service and charge ridiculous fees. I guess gemini if you feel sketchy lol. Skip ahead and save on fees and they give instant trading also. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:30:27
I haven't had problems using the same bank and exchange. But it's the fees, customer service, and not being able to set your own buy/sell price. You're throwing money away. Gemini exchange  ;)
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:01:00
Buy high sell low 
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:51:46
It's not some dark net website. It be hard. You'd half to go on the run. They're in dilemma with customer base &amp; increasing fast with tickets piling up. But seriously it's impossible and stupid to exit scam . All exchanges are facing same pressure. /Poloniexforum  
There are some mods from polo that lurk the forum. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:05:32
It's the right section. I suggest coinbase to the beginners. There's a app on the App Store. Fee's wise and trading overtime I suggest Gemini exchange when you get the hang of it. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:32:55
Gemini exchange. Lowest Free's and instant trading 
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:44:22
So you're saying sha2 is more secure than sha3 lol?
