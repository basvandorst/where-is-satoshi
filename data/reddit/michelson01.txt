Someone is spending 1-20$ *each* transaction to spam the mempool? There are over 174k unconfirmed txn in the mempool right now. Who is paying for all this "spam"?
And if Bitcoin is so easily attacked with spam, then isn't it failing already?

But "Bitcoin isn't for people that live on less than $2 a day. You're imagining someone with your knowledge &amp; background that is poor."  
Doesn't this attitude exclude poor people in troubled economies? Like Zimbabwe?

in many countries LocalBitcoins is your only option. Especially countries with capital controls or looming hyperinflation.

mike hearn's london talk had an example where someone he knew had a payment reversed for a laptop for instance.  not to mention not sure if btc counts as "goods".   use localbitcoins or something -- depends what country you are in.  in US coinbase works fine.

if i had a site that converted your gift card to btc almost instantly, would you use it? (you'd take a hit off the face value of the gift card of course)
