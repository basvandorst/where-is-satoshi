I tend to ignore people who bash Bitcoin for being deflationary. If someone is highly confident that any currency will be deflating significantly in the future I can't see any reasons why they would spend their time complaining rather than accumulating other than stupidity, laziness or hating making easy money.

I'm 18 so I can gamble :D
Edit: Isn't a Satoshi the smallest unit of Bitcoin, so what happens if I gamble one and win 0.5x?
Also, I notice your payout is better than SatoshiDice

Indeed, and then how will the Bitcoin ownership natural selection process work :P

I'm not sure who I trust less, Paypal or the Cypriot government.

Also having inflation together with fixed tax bands is an excellent way to stealth tax because you don't even get in the news.

Agreed, and if you really want to be paranoid you can have different authenticators for login and security centre/withdraw for three level security. Maybe I'll do that if Bitcoins go over $1k :D

Well I didn't stand much of a chance vs a masters player even if I'd remembered that I'd changed all my hotkeys. The site worked well though and it seems like SC2 and Bitcoin should go well together. My concern would be will this attract map hackers at higher level payouts?

That's probably the best compromise for most people, I just personally like to have login set too so an attacker can't trade all my Bitcoin with only the password.

You can secure it properly by applying the authenticator to the security centre. However IMO it's not obvious from the site that without doing so you are unsecured. I only noticed because I saw the warning below and realised that was what I wanted:

Hold on. If you only set it on Withdrawal then an attacker with only your password can log in, go into your Security Centre, remove authentication from withdrawal and help themselves to all your coins. I think you need Login or both Withdrawal and Security Centre as a minimum.
I have everything locked down cause it's not paranoia when they really are out to steal your coins.

Yes, I was not impressed. A system which gives the illusion of security is very dangerous.
