6 hours? Ha amateur!
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:26:50
Well it peaked at 20k already. I'm sure 1m is only a few years away

@_date: 2018-09-24 11:24:24
I'm just sick of these predictions.
@_date: 2018-09-24 08:07:58
Do you guys remember 12 months ago when people were saying this about the end of 2017? Then it went to $20k

All someone needs now is the location of that room... Then OP can be joining in on the game.
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:03:20
Classic trend. Good eye.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:42:41

Satoshi didnt care about the name of what he was creating but for the underlying values and principles of the work he was doing for a world he could change.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:35:59
Check out as well. I prefer it to ETH.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:13:12
Cash? What cash?
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:58:58
Can't imagine what this cost and yet you also have spare money to buy the number plate 'L'. Nice moon vehicle. I hope to be there soon.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:08:53
my weey
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:53:52
Moon is coming.

If you buy 1 satoshi now, you'll get a Lambo in 2030!

Governments are buying now and will agree with bitcoin in a positive way at g20. Up up up.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:26:58
Fake news.
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:15:02
I prefer the left. Its cleaner and the shadow looks better, more of a sunrise/sunset as opposed to a midday heat on the right which also looks odd. The white background on the right doesnt look right as well.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:40:45
Because you're not selling
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:44:38
HahahahahhaHHAHAHAahaha.  
*wipes tear*   
HAHAHAHAahhh good one.

You are smarter than the average investor already

Grandpar: That's what this land used to be called before revolution, it was then renamed to the United Satoshi Association. To rally our nation together as we stand with technology to overcome the world's problems and issues.  
Kids: wow that's so cool. I wish they would teach that to us on history night around the bonfire.  
Grandpar: *smiles at their eagerness to learn more about the world that was, the world before the great circuit war*

To put this into perspective, $100 in 2013 would buy you 10 roast chickens. $100 in 1913 would buy you 200 roast chickens.

Geez tough crowd. I only made this account to troll BCash over in btc
@_date: 2019-01-19 12:35:12
I though it was 1m?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:52:51
Are they BCash fans?
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:45:28
This made me buy
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:08:41
Then we get to 100M and the late adopters can exchange $1 for $1
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:14:19
I agree. If I were in a position of power to help I would.

Was the pizza also burnt?

Donate to charity. Every bit* counts.

The past few days have put me back on bullish for BTC. I hope this is the low point.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:34:06
By then it's 1BTC to 1BTC or more commonly know, 1BTC to $100,000,000 (Satoshi's)
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:40:41
I let that sink in. Let that sink in.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:44:44
In that case I'll buy at 7k
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:48:25
I'm sure it would be a simple thing to set up but you would then have to scan through the entire history of transactions.

I believe we use all 3 to determine value. Everything that has a value to one thing must have a value to each other.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:14:39
It's just a  joke..
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:59:37
Is he trying to compensate for something?
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:51:30
I hope he go to jail again. This time for manipulation, fraud and all the other things I can't be bother listed. As well as losses his acquired funds from his actions.

It's a new coin, split from the South Korean Won.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:10:49
I thinks it's asking the safe side. When in reality he is the thief. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:51:45
Why can't OP post the relevant text with the source. I'm sick of these posts with just  linking to an article.
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:46:56
If 1000 years is useless, does that mean you've failed with the hatchet and gun in 100 years?

They can ban exchanges, they can make it illegal they can make it taxable they can do whatever they want. But they cannot stop people using it as a currency medium of exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:49:38
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:55:51
A low $70,000 at that rate
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:32:39
Its actually closer to 264% of people are classified as dumb.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:13:55
Leaked prices! Can't wait.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:56:11
That was corny.

Yes officer, my daughter's earned $32,678 through their lemonade stand with bitcoin.
