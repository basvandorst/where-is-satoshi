Say we have each node has 1gbit/s and we have 1 gigabyte blocks and 1000 nodes it will take 80 seconds. Lets round up to 2 minutes because networks aren't perfect. Thats 20% extra fee due to orphans.
But in that same time the fees should have dropped 1000x so the average would have gone from $30 -&gt; $0.03 so a 20% increase to $0.036 is not really significant.

The block reward is fixed at 25 btc (there are tx fees but they are mostly irrelevant). 1% of network hash rate on average earns 1% of the block reward. So if petamine still holds 1% of the hash rate their earnings (in btc) should stay the same. What can affect it though is changes in the global hash rate changes and as a result peta-mine's proportion of the hash rate changes. Generally higher bitcoin price means a higher hash rate as miners are more incentised to mine but this will of course be a delayed reaction as they will have to actually purchase hardware.

It can't be. The amount of power in a monopoly is just inherent there's no technical solution to it. When/if bitcoin becomes large enough though countries won't let anyone have large amounts of the mining market share for the same reason they don't let anyone own the majority of conventional banks.

You can't use an ASIC to mine that. The ASIC would need to calculate the lamport signature which I doubt any can be adapted that well to do.

P2P has its own chain similar to bitcoin itself except its much easier to mine when a P2Pool block is created that is also a bitcoin block it gets released and pays the last ~1000 users in the p2pool chain.
This is similar to the PPLNS model most centralised bitcoin pools use except because the number of shares ~1000 is much lower than the amount of shares a centralised pool uses it has a much higher variance. (But much less than solo mining).

This I think is actually the biggest issue with any pool gaining more than 50% that I don't think a lot of people realise. If a pool gets over 50% they can just arbitrarily increase their network delay and suddenly mining on them is significantly more profitable.

I'm not saying we never should increase the block size. But following that graph we still have at least a couple of years before it even comes close and prematurely increasing the block size would be a mistake. Even then most of those are very low fee transactions that are unsustainable anyway and will naturally vanish as fees stabilise.

There's a risk there will be less investment in mining due to expected lower return and fees will take longer to get a hold. It also unnecessarily reduces what miners can operate.

I believe P2SH requires the nested transaction to be a standard type. Also even non standard transactions are still not Turing complete.

The thing is ignoring spv mining issues, a large majority of miners (&gt;85% iirc) were on the new version so that chain would likely never get 6 more confirmations than the other chain and therefore never be seen as valid. If they hard forked it instead though when someone made a valid p2sh transaction old miners would see that block as invalid and would be fooled by duplicate transactions on the side chain.

@_date: 2015-08-13 14:18:42


Except that's not how it works. The old code sees the new fork as invalid and just pretends its side fork is valid which likely will have many transactions that are invalid in the main chain.
You've seriously being spilling so much BS in this thread.
@_date: 2015-08-22 03:25:23
Lightweight clients will not notice anything as from their perspective both chains are the same. However if your if your client is not connected to an BIP101 node and the chain is forked you will only see the old blocks and potentially someone could fake a transaction to you. 
For that reason I'd recommend avoiding transactions during that period. You might also withdraw your money from other providers if you are worried they could have issues during the upgrade and go bankrupt.
Within a day one of the chains will emerge as a clear winner. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:56:34
You can see what proportion of people are running clients with large block support and make that decision. People without full nodes won't actually know the difference.
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:35:06
Well yes but rejecting a valid blockchain in bitcoin means accepting a shorter, but valid to your client blockchain, which means that any node that does not upgrade on a hard fork will be vulnerable to double spending. You seem to imply they will just stop transacting. With a soft this is reduced to old clients just having spv verification.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:02:38
Coins generated one the other chain will only be valid on that chain. Otherwise transactions should normally be processed by both chains. However there could be issues validating transactions if one side is double spent.
So you should be able to send money if a fork happens but don't accept bitcoin until the dust settles.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:13:05
Why do you say that? With bip 100 they can increase the block size to whatever they want.

In fact, the job hunters may actually end up being used as "mules" to transfer stolen funds outside of Canada. Anyone who participates, even unknowingly, could be deemed an accomplice to a crime and may be prosecuted.
In order to appear authentic, fraudsters may present employment agreements, websites and other types of information, for example, a detailed contract, outline of employee job responsibilities, compensation, etc. While these websites and employment agreements may present an appearance of legitimacy, spelling errors or the use of odd wording may be a sign that the operation is not a legitimate one.

Most people would propose the land tax is a federal tax which avoids the whole rich neighbourhood paying less. Also it can't just be passed on to the tenant as the landlord has to pay it regardless. And sure it is a problem for people buying houses with mortgages however stamp duty is generally worse for those people as they may not be able to hold on to the property as long as others. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:13:21
Yeah however a hypothetical land tax wouldn't be.
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:22:44
The key point is that the landlord would pay the tax irregardless of whether or not there's a tenant inside. So it still becomes advantageous to rent out a property.
There are reasons tenant might hold on to property even if the tax was higher than the rent:
- the property will increase in value as the neighbourhood becomes more valuable.
- the property can be improved to command a higher level of rent.
- other investments like cash can still have negative returns. So a real negative return isn't necessary bad.

Looks like they are going to have to add ETC as well.

Source? Based on looking at the pools that support it it's ~0.5%

It says their hot wallet only so theres obviously still some risks. Still pretty safe but if you have no reason to keep it on an exchange don't.

That's node count which is pretty arbitrary as anyone can spin up a thousand nodes. The mining share is around 0.5%

 based on the hash power of the pools there that's supporting UASF. While you are true that it's a user activated soft fork it needs some miners to prevent 51% attacks.

Yeah I'm just counting the hash rate voting for UASF. While I'm sure it will grow we were talking about current rates. The problem is that with only ~0.5% hash rate is that in the event of a fork any miner with more than 0.5% can execute a 51% attack on the bip146 chain. While the mechanics of a user activated fork are valid it will depend on how commited the economic majority is to the chain and unfortunately they don't seem to be that commited. They are after all basically playing a game of chicken with the miners unless significant mining power supports them.
