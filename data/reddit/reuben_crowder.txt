Because they didn't get in on it early. Pure envy at another's good fortune (or foresight or whatever).

Used [bitcoin.tax]( for the last two years. Imports directly into TurboTax. Works slick,

An exact BTC clone already exists. Bytecoin (BTE) was launched in 2013 an an exact clone. Not to be confused with a shitcoin using the same name but known as BCN, launched pre-mined and worthless. See Bytecoin (BTE) at:

Sorry about your loss. Nothing to do about it. You need to check your machine for malware immediately. I use and recommend F-Secure Safe. A few ideas that might help prevent this kind of thing from happening again, assuming you are using some recent version of Windows:
Use a good AV as suggested above.
Get a reliable VPN service and change your IP daily.
Use a MAC utility like TMAC and again change your MAC address daily.
Change your computer name at least once a week.
Use a browser like Waterfox along with AdBlock Plus and NoScript. Set to clear EVERYTHING when you close.
Get an external USB drive case with a 1 TB drive. Get a copy of Norton Ghost 15, install it and learn how to back up your machine with weekly full and daily incremental backups. That gives you a full recovery image of your computer that is at most only a day old. If malware does get through, you just restore to the most recent clean backup.
These measures have worked well for me for over 20 years with personal and work computers.

Forget any quick fix or partial backups. Buy a hard drive enclosure and put a 1TB drive in it. Then buy a copy of Norton Ghost 15 and learn how to use it to back up your computer using weekly backups with daily incrementals. Then you have the option of selectively recovering critical files. AND if you happen to catch a nasty ransom virus visiting those sites with all the pics of naughty bits, you can recover the entire computer from your latest clean backup. Make an effort to do it right.

Whatever does the job to provide a full, recent image backup.

If you are a US citizen, you don't. The IRS has declared BTC as property, like stock or commodites. Every transaction you make via BTC, whether on an exchange, a purchase on a website, or meeting with someone at McDonald's to make a LocalBitcoins purchase, becomes a taxable transaction. Until that changes, the best way to use BTC is trading on a licensed exchange and paying capital gains tax on your profits. BTC is useless as a medium of exchange like FIAT until things change.

Bitcoin.tax worked fine for me. Imported my GDAX trades and created a .TXF file that imported into TurboTax with no problem. Return already accepted by IRS and waiting for refund. As-Easy-As 123.

You just found out why one should never run a computer that has financial items without a proper backup. Now go buy an external hard drive unit and a drive big enough to contain at least twice your computer data. Then buy a copy of Norton Ghost and learn how to use it. I learned this lesson back in CP\M days. Never too late to learn.

All the BS in the world doesn't make any difference if you live in the USA. The IRS has classified Bitcoin as property, like stocks and bonds, making use of BTC as currency for US residents null and void. Until that status changes, buying and sell using BTC as money will cause massive complications in one's finances.

I buy the dip when I have the cash. I NEVER sell at a loss.

You need to serialize every item you sell on eBay. Write a unique number in some obscure or hidden place on the item in ultraviolet ink.  Enter a note (only sellers can see these) when listing the item with the number included.  You have the right as a seller to require the buyer to return the item for inspection BEFORE he receives a refund. I've had several slimeballs try to return electrical items they claim didn't work and they turned out to to be NOT the unit they received.

Pay for a no-logs VPN and change your IP and Mac addresses daily.

I did this recently. You need to generate a .TFX file from Bitcoin.tax and import it into TurboTax. Once you have the TFX file click on File --&gt; Import --&gt; From Accounting Software and follow the prompts from there. When your transactions import, they will all appear in your form 8949 worksheet. TurboTax will automatically create a Schedule D and the totals will appear in form 8949. Works slick. You need the desktop premier version to do this. It doesn't work with the online version.

Don't trade on Coinbase. Get a GDAX account (you are already signed up on Coinbase so this should go smoothly).
Then learn use limit trades on GDAX and there are no fees.

Bitcoin lost any chance of being a medium of exchange in the US when the IRS declared it as property like stocks and bonds. You can't buy a pizza for 0.0000012 of 1 share of IBM. Until the IRS changes the status of BTC it will never be used like fiat.

There is. Loaded on my phone but haven't had the nerve to try it yet. Get it on Google Apps. it's called Felix.

You might need Home and Business version because you have so many trades. Once you have Premier desktop running it's just a $10 upgrade. Nickel and dime.

I have used F-Secure for over 20 years on PCs and smartphones and highly recommend it. my.f-secure.com

Yes, especially since BCH/BTC is now the default login.

Won't last long. Somebody will wrap a chain around it and pull it out of the store with a stolen car.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:14:06
Desktop version only. Depending on how many trades you have, upgrading TT to Home nad Office may be necessary.

You can do ACH transfer directly from GDAX. Still takes 3-5 days to show up.

From an old TV commercial, "In America it's always easy to find a party. In Russia, the party finds you."

If you're in the US, check out your local fed credit unions. They usually don't make a stink about crypto exchanges. Open an account, put in some cash. Most FCU's accounts come with both a checking and savings account plus a debit card. Transfer what you want to spend on Bitcoin to the savings account. The set up your exchange to do an ACH from that account. Don't use credit/debit cards to buy crypto. Works for me.

If the BTC ATM doesn't have a camera (not likely) the Hasty Market surely does. Some privacy. When buying make sure your phone and any open device (watch, tablet you left in the car, etc) is turned off. Better still take public transport to the store. Any US/CAN vehicle since 2005 can be location tracked even if shut off. It's really tough now to be in an urban/sub area and not be tracked.

Many modern ECU's (engine control unit) and other electronics in newer cars have built-in GPS. For instance, GMC vehicles with the OnStar system always keep track of vehicle location. They can even "phone home" to GMC OnStar when you have an accident and tell GM if your airbags went off. In many urban/sub areas, you can't go anywhere without someone's camera taking your picture. Just be aware of the area you are in and use common sense.
