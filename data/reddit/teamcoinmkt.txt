Yes, he did.  They spoke about it on stage, he and Ben are actually fairly close friends. Nas has invested in a number of a16z startups.  
It was a great talk and great time for BTC at SXSW.  We (CoinMKT) were even able to give out about 100K free doge over the course of the festival. Good times!

Unfortunately, I think those guys are on the way out.

Hey, 
This issue might have arised when we were switching banks.  We wanted to get you're money to you ASAP. Still not quite sure why you're upset.
EDIT: The paperwork definitely signified where the MO was coming from, as referenced in your post.  It came from West Orange Labs, our parent corporation.  We're sorry we couldn't provide you with wire, we tried to correct that inconvenience by providing an MO as soon as possible.  
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:39:43
We're sorry to have inconvenienced you.  We believed the return address was sufficient information for someone in receipt of the MO.  
However, to suggest that we're not above board when our only intention was to get you your withdrawal as quickly as possible (which we did) is unfair.  
We're a solid company with thousands of happy clients and customers.  We pride ourselves on being an exchange that traders can count on, and we go to great lengths to make sure we deliver, hence providing you with an MO as opposed to a wire.   
Thanks for trading with us.

Looks like they just want to put their own currency to act as their own 'online' dollar.   
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:14:40
BTC community saving the day as usual.

This is definitely a marketing stunt.  Biased graph all over.  
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:38:17
API is being tested right now.  Probably one more week of testing.  As to volume, we'd have to agree with Onetallnerd:)

Very interesting stuff going on here.  This isn't good for XRP, RL, but also Jed.  Since JEd pulled a move on a company he owns stake in, wha investors will invest in Jed?  How will he guarantee that he won't pull the rug underneath them too?    So much money invested and pumped into RL.   
I'm sure theres drama and I dont know the extent of it, however this kind of an exit is just implosion for everyone.
Food for thought.

Counterparty is a decentralized peer to peer exchange.   This isn't a first.

Udacity needs to accept Bitcoins for class registrations! 
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:41:32
No, I do not believe so.  Something like that will be passing in D.C. soon I think end of the year that would allow for such.  
@_date: 2014-04-27 01:52:58
More attention seeking ... just like NewsWEAK article.. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:16:42
Surely, the MO made an exception based on our track record of doing business with them.  We're sorry if we didn't answer your questions to the degree that you wanted, we're busy and thought providing you with your money in a timely fashion would provide the most utility to you as a customer.   Again, the MO did say where it came from.  It came from our parent Corporation, again, this information is available on the website.

First MTGOX scam, then China market play swings?   What more do we need for the crypto community? 
We need big players elsewhere to step it up.  
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:11:17
We'll be sure to let you know, personally, when it's published.
