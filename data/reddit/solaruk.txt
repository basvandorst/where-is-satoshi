Blockchain.info Rocks !!!!!!!!!!!

I still have faith in blockchain.info
using 2fa, on everything, deleting .json files etc, encrypting backups.

I'm still pretty confident in BC.i. Yes they screwed up but they put their hands up and are working to fix the problems. My wallet was created years ago so it should be immune to this problem. (unless it's found the random number generator was flawed from the start) 
Much of the panic is FUD IMO.

Great video Kwise, thank's for making this. I often wondered what was going on under the hood, now I know !!!
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:05:14
yeah I loved the ending too kwise.. keep up the good work dude !!!

Of course its BC.i at fault. The wider blockhain and bitcoin protocol has played no part in this. Im 95 % sure that BC.i will come out of this stronger and more resilaint. I'm putting my money where my mouth is. My coin remains at blockchain.info wallet.

Hi Shemnon. The stolen bitcoins are on the move again, hoping you will be able to provide additional tracking with your tool. Fantastic work. A+++

I'm posting this link in case anyone missed the post from the CryptoCrumb site that has a forensic analysis of the wallet that contains the stolen Bitstamp BTC.
Hoping that he will update this later now the coins are on the move. Great work shemnon.

After loosing 65 Bitcoins on Mt Gox when the site went down, posting this link, kind of feels like revenge. Feels good.

Occam's razor.... 
You are assuming that numerous employees of one the largest bitcoin exchanges colluded to commit a massive theft from their customers and further colluded to cover up this theft. 
or 
the exchange got hacked..
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:32:54
You will find it very hard to walk away and your life will never be the same again.. you took the red pill I'm afraid. Sorry to break it to you.
You could sell ALL your coins but then how would you feel if bitcoin breaks through the all high price again. That would break you.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:57:21
Sure you have a valid point however I think your on this occasion, mt gox creditors have nothing to worry about.

Why did he give up our coins if he got nothing in return.

The emergence of cryptocurrencies could enable a more even distribution on wealth from the have it all boomer generation to the poorer but more tech savy millennials.
The technophile boomers will be the last to the crypto party and could pay a heavy price for late entry.
I'm generalising of course but it will be interesting to see how this plays out over the next few years.

Bitfinex'ed has doggedly pursued Tether in a one man blinkered campaign of spite driven rantings and twitter posts.  He has taken confirmation bias to new levels despite having no real evidence.
Unfortunately this nutcases 20,000 post twitter campaign has gained some traction in the main stream press who love noting better than to give bitcoin a good kicking when he is down. 
Many thanks to Oleksandr Ivanov for producing this technical analysis to combat the every growing army of "told you so" merchants that have been talking Bitcoin down in recent days.
Let's see how Tether responds in the coming weeks. I'm sure they will provide some kind of audit to silence Bitfinex'ed and co once and for all.

Use this tool to calculate potential future bitcoin price. Move  the sliders to alter the percentages of certain asset classes to see how small changes can have a big effect on the price of bitcoin.

I lost 65 BTC at mtgox. Could not stand to be out the game so I put 10k in at 600$, the price of BTC soon dropped to 200$. No choice but to hodl or throw myself of the nearest tall building.
Glad I hodled now !!
