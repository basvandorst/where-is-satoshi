I got it recovered :)
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCC / BCH) are two entirely separate cryptocurrencies and they operate on two entirely separate blockchains. This means that Bitcoin (BTC) sent to an address on the Bitcoin blockchain will never appear nor be present on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. In this instance you seem to have sent a Bitcoin (BTC) transaction to an address in your Bitcoin Cash (BCC) wallet. Note that in the Bitcoin.com wallet you can set up both a Bitcoin (BTC) sub-wallet and a Bitcoin Cash (BCC) sub-wallet.
Don't panic though! If you sent the BTC to a BCC sub-wallet inside your Bitcoin.com wallet you can do the following to retrieve your BTC from your BCC wallet:
- In the Bitcoin.com wallet go to Settings &gt; Your BCC Wallet &gt; Backup
- Write down your 12 wallet seed words carefully on a piece of paper
- Download the Coinomi Bitcoin wallet app here
- Install and open Coinomi and hit 'Restore A Wallet'
- Enter your 12 seed words exactly as you wrote them down; they must all be lowercase with one space between them, and no space after the last word
- Hit 'Next'
- Set up a password if you wish; hit 'Next' if you choose to set up a password, or hit 'Skip' if you choose not to
- Select 'Bitcoin' (as you are retrieving BTC), then hit 'Finish', read the disclaimer and hit 'Agree'
You will now be able to access your bitcoins in the Coinomi app and you can send them from there to wherever you wish.
Please note that Bitcoin.com is not in any way affiliated with Coinomi so we cannot be held accountable for any issues with their app.
Please also note that the only reason you are able to retrieve your Bitcoin (BTC) from a Bitcoin Cash (BCC) address in this instance is because you had your 12 word seed phrase. Without this you would not have been able to import your Bitcoin Cash wallet into another wallet in order to retrieve your funds. You should always keep a backup of your seed phrase somewhere safe and secure as anyone with access to it will be able to control your wallet.
Finally, I would strongly suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the Bitcoin.com wallet here and set up a new Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. You will need to ensure that you do **not** press the 'Bitcoin Cash' button when setting it up (grey is off and sets up a BTC wallet, green is on and sets up a BCC wallet), and then send your funds from the Coinomi app to a receiving Bitcoin address in your Bitcoin.com wallet.
Again, you **can** manage both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCC) in your Bitcoin.com wallet, but you **must not** send BTC to a BCC address and vice-versa. You should send BTC only to addresses in your Bitcoin.com BTC sub-wallet, and you should send BCC only to addresses in your Bitcoin.com BCC sub-wallet.
