That's it. Its a more secure wallet than online/software. Basically a safe way to spend online. I don't see it as a device I would put my savings on though.

I'm having trouble grasping how this is any better than a paper wallet or even a client like Electrum? If you lose your Trezor and recovery code, you are still out of luck. Same if I lose my paper wallet and cold storage. You can also encrypt paper wallets so there's not much an argument over security either.

@_date: 2014-09-27 02:46:48
I am a Trezor owner. Those who are less technical or don't know how to set up their own *secure* cold storage and paper wallets may think Trezor is the only option. I actually prefer offline wallets like Armory in cold storage and encrypted paper wallets for holding, but each person needs to do the research and practice to find out what they feel more comfortable with and go with that.

Only problem is whoever receives the payment has to immediately scan the QR code on the paper wallet and sweep the private key or risk fraud. 
A bit easier just to scan a QR with your device in the first place.

@_date: 2014-08-26 22:52:54
Well, anyone who is smart wouldn't generate a paper wallet from an online computer. And of course you wouldn't put coins in a paper wallet you are going to need to spend. You use your spending wallet. 
Okay I  do understand the readily spending your BTC part. So the Trezor is useful for sending and receiving Bitcoins in a more secure manner than a software wallet. That makes sense. 
However, it still is not useful in day to day real life transactions, plus you need to connect the Trezor to your computer to send Bitcoin correct? 
Thanks for the response.

Well my argument is that I can install Electrum on my phone and/or computer and it accomplishes the exact same thing completely free. I would still learn paper wallets and cold storage if I were you. If anything just for Bitcoin educational purposes. I would also advise keeping a several separate, more secure savings wallets, but maybe that's just me.
@_date: 2014-08-29 19:57:25
I'm not a kid. What gives with that? It's a subtle jab at bitcoin enthusiasts. Also, any article that mentions Ethereum somewhat seriously (especially when you spell it wrong) loses all credibility.

I don't think this is a problem with Armory either. Electrum is know for a fact is at "risk" though.

@_date: 2014-09-07 00:59:07
Yes I suppose it's slightly tedious, but necessary. I think it was implemented pretty well though. I know you said you were trying to be picky so i can understand. Not biased or anything, I just set up my Trezor yesterday and expectations were completely surpassed. Thought I wouldn't really end up using it, even considered selling it to a friend before opening it up. Thing is fantastic though and one of the best methods for spending coin online securely, and another way to diversify your holdings securely.

@_date: 2014-08-26 23:11:40
Thank you for the response. Yes I agreed it was the same, minus security. At first I was under the impression Trezor was more than that and offered a way to spend coins in real life situations (ie coffee shop). Now I see it is just a secure wallet to store your coins and also manage your address and private keys while keeping you secure during online transactions. I see a use for it now and may even consider one in the future. It however won't replace paper/coldstorage/brain wallets for me in the least when it comes to long term holding.

Practicing is just a precautionary move. You must not have that many bitcoin to keep safe. I also take it you have very little skills or talents since you want everything to be made for idiots instead of trying to learn or improve on anything.

I wasn't insinuating that this was the case for you, but yes, it is entirely possible if you have a virus that it could redirect you to a different page that looks exactly like coinbase and could even have the proper address in the address bar. All possible and all currently happening. Keep in mind you are at a *much* higher risk for this type of infection if you are using a Windows OS.

"good strong secure"
Yet all the article talks about is Armory as if it's best use is a hot wallet. Talking about how he runs his in Windows. That is anything but secure. Totally forgets to touch on the the point that Armory is one of the best ways to create secured paper wallets offline.

If you have a way of getting fiat into an exchange then you can set up a bot. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:46:02
A "paper backup" is not a true "paper wallet". A true paper wallet needs to be created on a dedicated offline computer, where you would run the offline Armory client to create the wallet. Then you can create a watching only wallet in Armory on your online computer. 
Creating an online paper backup of a hot wallet is, in reality, not even close to strong or secure storage for your bitcoin. I just wouldn't want someone to read this article and then create a hot wallet, dump their life savings into it, and assume they have "good strong security". Because they do not. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 10:59:28
I'm still a firm believer the bulk of holdings should be in multiple encrypted paper wallets + cold storage backups secured in multiple locations. Can't find a method that gives me more confidence. Let me know if I've missed anything.

@_date: 2014-08-28 09:18:30
Here is what I have concluded as the best ways so far in no specific order:
* Encrypted paper wallet generated from offline computer 
* Armory offline wallet fragmented paper backup + password
* Trezor with seed + password
* Brain wallet (not for most people)
In all cases you will want to require a passcode or form of encryption. Place the paper wallets in a fireproof safe in one or more locations as well as a copy of them in cold storage on an encrypted usb or 2 (and/or paper backups/fragments) in a safety deposit box. I don't advise online storage. 
Someone improve on this.

@_date: 2014-09-19 23:12:50
I recommend using an old computer or building a new one for cheap and keep it offline forever. If you use a laptop, disable wifi in BIOS. Also either keep your printer offline forever once you use it, or buy a new dedicated offline printer.  I suggest one without networking capabilities to be safe. Boot up with a Linux live CD on your dedicated offline machine and then transfer the software over via USB or cd after you take your online computer offline. Also verify your download. If you generate a paper wallet or sign a transaction with a USB stick installed, those are to never go online again (unless you maybe use multiple dd wipe commands). Let me know if you have any other questions. For anyone reading this keep in mind this is taking extreme security precautions for the most paranoid. It's not that hard after a little practice, so I suggest it. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:37:28
No one mentioned the fact that the machine keeps your card? Thought that was most interesting. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 04:05:11


No, he didn't. You interpreted wrong. He was agreeing with wk4327's post that paper wallets are superior due to the fact that you *don't* need to spend $120; AKA "If you use a paper wallet "I don't have to pay $120 to secure my bitcoins".


@_date: 2014-09-20 00:51:16
@_date: 2014-10-02 09:17:21


Don't settle for Trezor. It's useful and I own one, but I prefer other offline wallets and the ability to make paper wallets with an offline machine. You are also on the right track already so finish learning the process. Usually you can unscrew part of a laptop and remove the hard drive. You can also easily build a budget pc brand new for under $200. You can use it for paper wallets and offline wallets like Armory and Electrum. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:50:11

Okay, so it does indeed accomplish the same thing, but is more secure... less liable to be hacked...? That's what I am taking. But since the Trezor has no QR scanner it won't be useful in daily transactions on the go. So does that mean its primary function is indeed to be a storage/savings wallet? And if so...I still see 0 benefit over paper/cold storage.

No, I get it. You want as many investors as possible. That's what you care about. My comment isn't directed at bitcoin. It's directed at the character of OP. It's more important that he grow up, learn to calm down and have patience, and realize that not every single thing is supposed to come to him as easy as 1,2,3. And when things don't work out you need to try again, keep pursing, identify why you don't have the knowledge to do what you need to do, embrace your mistakes, and learn from your failures. That is how you mature and grow as a person, something OP needs assistance with *moreso* than bitcoin. I really don't care if he ends up getting his couple of btc or not, won't make a difference as far as bitcoin is concerned.

You need to create an Armory or Electrum wallet **offline** and then keep the seed safe. You can then create a "watching only" wallet on your online machine. if your private keys have *ever* touched an online machine you are not secure.

This makes sense. But since you could also lose or break your Trezor and still recover your wallet, why can't you simply create a wallet, send funds to it, wipe the trezor, and create a new wallet. Is it built that if you wiped the trezor you lose your wallet? If so, that doesn't seem very secure.

I'm not being a dick (and that response was originally not written towards you directly) but the blunt fashion is for effectiveness. I'm trying to help. I figured you were 20 so I overestimated your understanding of basic internet/computers. You made 3 complaints in your short post, so I call it whining. It's really not confusing to set up a blockchain wallet or signup for coinbase. Just slow down and read the directions twice each time and follow them completely. It takes a tiny while to write down your backup seeds, verify your e-mail and enable 2FA but it's for your own security.

Yeah, it's called trading...Buy other alts with btc and when they go up sell them back for btc. rinse and repeat.

Im not talking about genuinely sharing information about bitcoin with someone. I'm talking about not letting it go when they show no interest like you said. There's no point in that.

Litecoin really isn't a scam. Not like many altcoins are scams. But don't worry about it. Concentrate on bitcoin.

Not necessarily if you click through a fake link and login, you can still be attacked. The vault will protect against that however. Obviously that is enough for the amount of .1 if he doesn't want to play around with it.

Have another family member memorize the brain wallet. I'm not saying I would do 100% brain wallets, but I would use 1 to diversify my storage of wealth.

May not be *the* most secure way, but pretty close... you could always install linux on a usb drive, and then boot from it, connect to the internet, install electrum, then reboot the usb stick on an offline machine and generate a new wallet. After this destroy the usb stick (after copying seed and public key if you would like to create a watching wallet). Probably similar odds in security risk to downloading the file and transferring it before installing. Although BobAlison seems to have the answer. Usually best to minimize steps while connected.

OP which code are you using?
@_date: 2014-09-07 01:36:33
By "account" do you mean wallet? You can only see how much bitcoin is associated with each address. If your wallet has balances on multiple addresses they will not be able to tell the two are associated (unless you have transacted from one to the other).

Stop pretending it's "their" economy when your bags are so damn heavy. Lmao.

I would. Doge is a joke, and I don't support it in any way.
