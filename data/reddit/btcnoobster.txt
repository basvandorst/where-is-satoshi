Love this example, shows real world use of coins.

Banking system are like the Hollywood Movie and music studios. Holding on to the past instead of embracing the future. Pirating of music dropped to all time lows since the coming of Spotify. Netflix for a long time had the same effect until people noticed they needed 6 subscriptions to see all they want/need to see. I say need because of peer pressure. And the pirating of movies and shows skyrocketed again.  
Same goes for banking, instead of embracing the change, embracing that block\-chain has a future and help develop and by that steering it into their direction. That put their archaic foot down in the hope of squishing it.

Tell that to people in turkey or Venezuela ask how well that is going for them.

Damm your making it rain aren't you.

Meh don't believe that. Crypto coins and block\-chain do have a future and are the future. If BTC is over valued.... only time can tell. Do wonder why a person who has Cryptousa as a name, has such a negative outlook on it all.

Wherever the money is, the flies follow.

Tell me how is he subverting the law? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:01:41
Your reaching, just because your bank doesn't allow it, doesn't straight out mean there is a law against it. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:22:56
There are more reasons then laws.
Maybe they don't want to be associated with gambling even though there is no law that prohibits it.
I'm not saying your wrong but blatenly stating he subverted the law is reaching.
The core of the story is that the banks held his money in limbo and charged him for it. While the bitcoin transaction was done in seconds.
