Interesting, well, we'll see if it goes. I hope you are right.

Right, that's a good point I haven't considered. So if 90% of miners drop out, it would actually become much easier to mine the 21 million. Interesting.

Btw, this is on my mind so I write it. Sorry this doesn't fit into your ideas of what MY titles should contain. If you don't like the title than skip it.

So now i have to be a famous redditor to claim any views? Sorry but morality has nothing to do with this.

Yes, Bitcoin is limited to 21 million but since the difficulty level rises it is very possible it will never reach its limits, or at least not for a very long time.

See, that's the thing, the governments or banks don't need to ban it, for them it's enough to crash its price and keep it low, even if only for a while but long enough for people to dump it or exchange it for a better investment or alternative technology. The ROI is nice when you buy at the right time, I agree.

Exactly thats all im saying.

First of all, if that's the case than perhaps it is possible for Bitcoin to reach those price levels when it goes completely mainstream. Who could make it move? I have no idea, market manipulators, hackers...

I agree, there is and going to be a cycle. People should observe this cycle and invest and sell at the right time. It's much better to buy at the bottom then when its about to crash. Btw, i am bullish on Bitcoin in 2017 but the 'rats' need to be watched very carefully. But although I am bullish on it I don't subscribe to the church of Bitcoin as much as others. Maybe because I don't fully understand the technology (I mean the coding not the basic mechanics) or maybe I just don't fully trust its decentralised nature. Imagine what would happen if the Chinese decided to pull the plug on all mining activity in China. The price of Bitcoin would probably plummet to a $100.

Try localbitcoin. ive used it in the past and was very happy with results. When you buy more move your bitcoins to cold storage. Online exchanges are never a good place to store bitcoins. Enjoy
