I understand *free bitcoin* may sound too good to be true but I can assure you that Lolli is not a s c a m. :)
We've worked hard to establish real partnerships with some amazing merchants like Jet, Everlane, Groupon, Priceline, Hotwire, etc.
I hope you check it out and earn all the bitcoins!

Hey u/juryriggedduty, this is Alex, one of the founders of Lolli. We do not mine with our extension. We have no need to or plan to do that. We've partnered with over 500 top merchants that pay us when our users shop their sites. We then share that commission with our users, sending bitcoin to their Lolli wallets. 
Let me know if you have any questions! I'm happy to answer them. Have a great day and feel free to message me if you need any help finding the most bitcoin back for any upcoming purchases. :)

We have just over 750 merchants on board and many of them are international retailers or ship internationally. We are working on better search, discovery, and localization features so non-US areas yield more local preferences. Feel free to reach out to support(at)lolli(dot)com or dm me here and let me know if you are looking for anything in particular. The team and I have been personally helping a lot of our early users earn the maximum amount of bitcoin from our top partners, wherever they live. :)
We're a small team and lots to do as you can imagine! Thank you for your patience as we bring on more merchants and launch new features.

Thank you for being a Lolli user! We are working really hard and launching a lot of great new features over the next couple months, including the ability to bring your own address and withdraw your bitcoin from Lolli. :)

Hey all! This is Alex, one of the founders of Lolli. To clarify, we DO NOT use people's computers to mine and will never sell your data. We make money when our users shop at our merchant partners' sites. We then share that commission with our users, sending bitcoin to their Lolli wallets.
I'll open this up to a Q&amp;A if anyone has any questions!

Thank you for clearing this up, [u/fiatectomy]( You are right. We do not use people's computers to mine. As mentioned in another comment, we've partnered with over 500 top merchants that pay us when our users shop their sites. We then share that commission with our users, sending bitcoin to their Lolli wallets.
