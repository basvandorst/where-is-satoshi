I don't know if I would, but I generally try to improve the mood of people who are down, for example by making a joke, instead of helping them by acting just as unhappy.

For your children's sake, don't rely on a single investment to fund your retirement.
Having to support a parent financially because they decided bitcoin was a safe sole investment does not sound very fun.

Sounds like a laugh may be a good idea to be honest.

I'm not sure I understand.
Sure, it would be a security benefit if the use of a technological exploit by "bad guys" was prevented, but if the security agencies that would prevent it needs to use the very same exploit to gather security-critical information about someone else, securing that loophole would prevent them from gathering information.
It would prevent crime in one place but decrease the ability to discover and prevent crime in another place. In the end it should come down to which of the crimes is more dangerous to the general public.
The danger of an existing exploit to gain access to any operating system:
* Compromised private and potentially sensitive data which would, in the worst case, result in financial losses
* Potential breach of privacy by government agencies
The dangers that intelligence agencies hope to prevent by using the exploit:
* Terrorism
* Organized crime
* Military threats posed by other countries
I'm not necessarily arguing for technological surveillance, just answering your question.

If we want our security agencies to be able to effectively collect evidence before and after potential crimes, it's obvious that there will be a need for tools that can compromise a computer from the outside.
While there could and, as this leak shows, probably should be stricter control on how these tools can be accessed and used, I don't blame the CIA for having them.
Eliminating the possibility of abuse for pretty much anything entirely is effectively impossible.

Excuse me? I literally don't know what you're trying to say.
Are you calling me a shill? Are you calling OP a shill?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:32:58
Automated does not mean it infects whomever without any control. It means that it does what it's supposed to without regular input by a human.
Simply because the tools are "automated" does not mean that, as OP and you seem to think, every Microsoft PC in the world is infected.
A machine designed to form metal into a pre-defined shape implements an automated process. That process would otherwise have to be done by hand. Doesn't mean that it's going to take a fucking banana and mash it into the form you want because that's not what it was intended to do. Despite being automated, its actions are controlled by humans.

Your pattern of behaviour is resorting to name-calling and burying your opponent in absolute statements that have no basis in the given context when confronted with a conflicting opinion, which isn't surprising when you spend half your time in which is simply one big circlejerk of people who share your political opinion.
I don't think I have the moral high ground. I do think I have the factual high ground, seeing as, unlike you say I do and very much unlike *you* do, my comments are actually based on the article OP cited lol
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:04:27
Looking at your past comments, these comments seem to fit right into your pattern of behaviour, so I'll just stop right here.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:07:44
Right? This is literally (and non-sarcastically) fake news.
Either OP has not read the article carefully, misunderstood its meaning or was simply keen on spreading misinformation.
Of course the CIA has the theoretical ability to infest a wide range of machines. Doesn't mean that every machine world-wide is affected.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:56:00
I didn't argue that its existence isn't worrisome. 
I just doubt that John Doe living in Bumfuck Nowhere, Montana has reason to worry about his computer being infected by CIA spyware, as OP claims.

And here you are, arguing back.
If only people were taught that if their argument ends with "shut your fucking mouth" or "you are just a fucking idiot", they should probably reconsider what they just said.
The title matters because it's sensationalist titles like this that make uninformed people who assume them to be the absolute truth believe in false information.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:15:16
I'm saying the title is wrong, yes. Because there's no evidence to support it in the article linked.
I doubt either one of those descriptions fits me, buddy.

Are we in Unless you have actual *proof* to show that terrorism isn't real you should probably keep your mouth shut.

I don't know just how helpful this will be to you, but [here]( a .csv file containing conf_time (in seconds), fee_rate (in sat/byte), transaction_id, block_height, fee (in total sat), size (in bytes), fs_timestamp, conf_blocks (number of blocks it took to be confirmed). Based on [this]( project.
The data set currently contains 1.5 million recently (~1-2 weeks) confirmed transactions and I believe is planning on posting regular updates [here](
If you're not content with that you can actually download bitcoin core, set up the RPC server, download the python project from github, configure it to your liking and farm data yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-28 11:40:32
What type of data are you looking for, exactly?
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:13:08
That might be an unhelpful thing to do, really. Announcing their strike in advance, the US probably anticipated potential targets to be moved. At some point, the trade-off between moving an object away from a position that the enemy may (or may not) know about and the possibility of the enemy picking up on those movements become pretty unfavourable.
