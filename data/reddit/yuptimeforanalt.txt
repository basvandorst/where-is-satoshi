Because there are political issues in Bitcoin and the most important dev team decided small transactions shouldn't be on the main chain. It's been going on for years, both sides have turned into cults

Steam will not reintegrate cryptos before long
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:30
I mean the actual size, not some other metric. Blocks right now are ~1.1MB, it needs a much larger increase than what segwit offered
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:37:00
It's not because it's well explained that it's accurate 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:23:50
It's only worth it for many transactions, otherwise it's still expensive 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:24:00
It would be the same? You need an on chain transaction to do that

G2A is very shady

It's on purpose 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:58:47
huh? because?

That's what S2X was about

We can't discuss alts here
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:00:23
? I am not saying I agree of this direction the sub took, I'm just saying it's difficult to have proper debate on the topic when we cannot talk about most competing alts.
A better comment would be "we can't talk favorably of alts here" so a proper discussion is a bit difficult

And what exactly is your point that it's not a bubble? Some bubbles lasted for years
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:05:10
Because bigger blocks, and thus BCH, is the solution B to LN's solution A.

The limit was realistically raised to 1.4-1.7MB, months ago. Segwit won't do more than that with 100% adoption. And we need more than that. And we need it NOW, merchant adoption is going down fast

Because I don't want to get b&amp; lol. I don't care much about downvotes
I hate those memes just like you

There isn't any evidence that Tether is backed. 0 is not greater than 0
And doing fake audits is a big red flag that they are NOT backed
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:04:09
Why the fuck is everyone buying in the tether ""audit""? The disclaimer literally says it's not an audit

How do you ever see btc as a global currency when a few already hold like 80% of the supply?
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:30:50
I'm talking about something different. I'm saying if btc becomes a global currency, 80-90% of the wealth would be concentrated in a few early adopters. How do you see governments being fine with the *entire country's PIB* being lower than a bunch of early adopters? It is so obvious they would make their own and never adopt btc
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:45:56
Or

I don't think it was a "buying opportunity", not every negative thing affecting Bitcoin is. In fact, if China didn't happen BTC would likely be where it is now + what it dropped from China, so you would have had the same gains

4 of those are bitcoin

how do they measure PoW differently?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:16:53
Different difficulty adjustment algorithm does not mean different PoW though? They could have a ridiculously low difficulty, PoW is still difficulty-adjusted, so that doesn't change much?
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:29:43
This is just a symptom of crypto communities, especially the bitcoin ones, being quite childish. I don't know if they attract greedy teenagers or what
