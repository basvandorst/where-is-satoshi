As much as I agree with you, this would not happen - people will be digressing from the BTC topic (purposely or not). This is due to the fact that a lot of people are simply bringing up topics which are interesting to them, shunning the reality that they're relevancy is obviously missing. So, even if you are asking questions in r/Bitcoin, there will always be people who'll start asking questions regarding Altcoins, ICO's, or even companies striking partnerships, such as Giftz.
Hopefully, one day, people will stay tangent to the topic.

Let's face it, it is in human nature to be interested only in the fast accumulation of profit rather than in understanding the nuanced details behind each innovation. Most people are not interested in the tech behind anything, regardless whether it is bitcoin, altcoins, ico's, gambling, horse racing, etc. Regardless of the flaws that you mentioned, people will still be interested in money making because of their faith that the problem is temporary. However, if the price falls down, now it is blatant that their profits might be curtailed. :)

Sorry to hear that. Misfortunes, like that, happen, unfortunately. Nevertheless, what matters is that you're alive.
Additionally, apparently trezors did the trick in terms of saving you a whole bunch of profit, as the BTC had an enormous growth the last couple of weeks (trying to ignore the latest drop, tho).
Hodl it, in my opinion. The price will go up, once again.
