Almost 4 years ago to the day.  
Keep in mind this discussion was just a few weeks before a major correction.  
Just trying to see if we’re having a shoeshine boy moment.

Fake jewelry ? You mean like Bcash or Ripple?
Maybe you’re talking about Dogecoin.

Cool story.

Actually.  That’s just a depreciating currency. 
In 10 years they’ll be a 100’ yacht or a private jet.  Not a car

Thats like saying that BTC is not going to work because there’s only 16M of them and 7B people. It’s fudd
Gold, like bitcoin, is divisible.  
I own both.  bitcoin is one store of wealth. Gold is another.  I also like silver for day to day transactions.

I don’t know if you know this.....
But gold comes in all shapes and sizes.  People seem to divide it just fine.
Some people wear rings.  Others put huge bars in safes.  Others gild a toilet so they can shit on it. 
If you don’t like it, you actually can reshape it or melt it. Using a hammer is actually pretty effective.   There are seven billion people and almost all of them have gold or know someone who has gold.  They seem to be able to divide it. 
There are various purities like 14k, 18k, and 24k.  All of which have detailed pricing and a reputable testing market.  
If you don’t think gold is divisible you’re just being disingenuous.

So, I don’t know the veracity or your assertion but I have a couple questions... first, why?
Why track people using bitcoin?  
Second question, you say there are only 1 million important users, what criteria makes someone an important user?
Criminals and terrorists definitely still use bitcoin.
