We actually tried to acquire Febreze earlier in the year. The takeover cost was OK, but the tx fee was too high and the deal fell through.

That link is talking about the issue when BTC is worth $1m a piece, and the fee will be a minimum of $2.25 as a result. 
We're talking about how sending $5 currently costs you $10. BTC won't make it to the $1m in the post if it doesn't solve this issue now.

What's the incentive for any of the players in the community to implement LN though?

Err... They can, and they do.

It's the complete opposite of what you've just suggested. You'd struggle to find a stronger indictment of the loan packaging practices than Margin Call.

It's not a can, it's an elephant. A huge dead elephant in the center of the room. Rotting. The BTC Core developers are promising that they're stitching together a gigantic cloth to cover the dead, rotting, elephant and that covering the elephant will make it disappear entirely - while ignoring the fact they've already thrown one segwit cloth over the elephant, and everyone can still see and smell it.
This post is asking if we can move the elephant into a different room until the magic cloth is finished - because all the people on the outside can see the huge dead rotting elephant, and they don't want to come join the party. In fact, some of the most excellent attendees of the party just left because of the huge. dead. rotting. elephant.

There are some jobs where breaking these rules would mean imprisonment. Those jobs are the kind where your family can't be custodians of your assets for the purposes of the contract (think senior members of a government bank for example).

Some folk don't get out of bed until December.
