Same thing happened with the snapchat IPO where people bought a different Snap company. Shit happens.

Too much.

Let's call it Segwit2x... oh wait.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:45
Good choice!
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:10:18
How can i check if these numbers are accurate?

Or you know, he could have died and those bitcoins are lost forever. It's not that anyone of us would know :/

Cute &lt;3

They tried that with Segwit2x. Too many people bitching about it.

Hate to break to you, but a lot of money is only 0s and 1s somewhere these days.

Bitcoin Cash alone is worth like another 100k o_O
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:45:13
Thank you.

Probably a keeper :)

Makes you wonder how many bitcoins are lost forever because someone forgot the private keys on a PC, or the password or something like that.

"Bitbond, a German online bank" - it's not a bank. I call fake news.

Now let's imagine if the blockchain somehow went corrupt due to a new version of a software having a major bug or a hard fork that went tits up or something like that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:10:52
Yes, they hold all the private keys. They could also sell all the bitcoins stored there.

I can get money from an ATM for 0 Euros. Bitcoin transactions cost a LOT more at the moment.

So a racoon chews through your power line or network cable, how would your access Bitcoin again?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:20:33
I kinda doubt it. At least not with the transaction fees as high as they currently are.
