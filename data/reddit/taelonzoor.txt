I'm far more interested how this will go for second-tier merchants that don;t have the money/power overstock does. The CEO made it clear overstock wants bitcoin to work, so they are going to go out of there way to make it consumer-friendly to avoid bad publicity. I imagine you could get almost anything refunded for any reason you bought with bitcoin on overstock just because of this.
But what about all these 1000s of little merchants that accept it. What do they do when you complain you never got your item in the mail? You as a consumer have no recourse other than the site. You can't complain to visa or paypal, etc. Bitcoin is a merchant's best friend--no chargebacks!

Agree with you on this, but isn't their argument that coinbase is not intended to be a trading platform? Sure, maybe 99% of their users are using it as a trading platform, but they know what they are getting into, and I assume prefer a US-facing company to the alternatives.
The issue I wonder about here is, what are they telling their investors? Are they trying to have their cake and eat it to? Are they giving the impression that their userbase is filled with long-term clients, when 99% would jump ship if there was an alternative site that did not have this 5 day hangup? Some days I'm more bullish on coinbase than bitcoin, and then I'll think about it and flip my view to being that bitcoin will succeed as the first mover advantage in digital currency, but that coinbase will quickly get swallowed by a competitor (perhaps an established ibanking subsidiary) for the problem you mentioned.

merchant services is a sub of BoA and pretty much operates as an entirely different company since it is made up of many recent acquisitions of payment processors. BoA likely closed the account for risk reduction since there seemed to be a lot of international wires going around that were probably substantial considering the balance of this person's account sounds low....

It's sounds like you are very well off. I don't think you need to go to the media. As an attorney who used to practice a stone's throw way from coinbase, I would suggest retaining an attorney in the SF Bay area (or at least telling them that will be your next step if they do not rectify the fact that thy did not fulfill their oder on the promised contract date.)
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:56:14
Thanks. I daytraded during the tech bubble, and am quickly seeing that coinbase is not the right place for this. I couldn't seem to easily get an account anywhere else though, and was keen on the fact coinbase is backed by venture capitalists I have personally met and trust (Union Square Ventures for instance).
I know this is a big risk, and am not risking my life savings or anything crazy. But I want to at least give it a shot. It just seems really difficult to find the right place to trade at. The same day I signed up for coinbase I tried 3-5 other sites and just got lost trying to set up an account and gave up on them.
Now that I have some bitcoins from coinbase, will it be easier to just send them to bitstamp or mtgox without having to connect my bank accounts there?

A lot of people on this reddit have a lot more than 1% of their wealth in bitcoins lol.

I wish people would understand this point, but at the same time I feel like perhaps a business-level decision should have been made to stop taking new accounts during some of the recent high volume periods. Obviously you want to scale as fast as possible and gain traction, but there is certainly a drawback from the negative publicity of some disgruntled users.

Each ACH dispute that gets file with a major bank is a pretty big deal for Coinbase's credibility with banks--I liken it to online gambling sites. So I hope they start speeding up some of the response times. Even in a perfect world, they are going to get shady users filing fraud claims and hurting them (again, common with online gambling), so it is even more important that they fix potential problems before a fraud claim gets filed!
My personal experience with coinbase: I asked support a simple question which I later discovered all they needed to do was link me to an FAQ... but the response was just irrelevant to my question, took a week, and gave the impression that an illiterate foreign customer support person was being used (which I don't think is the case!)
So I love the concept, but these sort of experiences makes it impossible for me to recommend coinbase to most of my contacts, because it will just lead to me having to do support for them!
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:34:19
The bitcoin community needs a volunteer security force to help out people like this guy. Each case like this sets bitcoin back, and since the traditional "police" are not really going to help, it is up to the community to step in and form a neighborhood watch of some sorts.
This doesn't seem too difficult with the amount of capable individuals invested in the success of bitcoin.

Are you SURE you did not buy during the period where they said they would give you Friday's market price? I was a new user to coinbase on Monday. When I first tried to purchase, it gave me that popup, and I was like WTF no way, and started bugging my friend who was hyping them, and reading this subreddit. I noticed that throughout the day, that window that said "Friday market price" came and went numerous times, a apparently when thy ran out of bitcoins they put it up, got more bitcoins, took it dow.
Reading your post earlier, I was worried this was going to happen to me, because I ended up buying some on Monday. I knew FOR SURE I did not buy during the market price period.
I received my bitcoins today at the price I was supposed to receive them for, not today's market price. 
(I did have to email support to get them to update my account though, arghhh, lol. I understand they are understaffed, but if you are taking hundreds and thousands of dollars from people, then you should hire extra support. they knew about the government hearings on Monday WAY in advance!)

What this means for those who don't do much analysis and just think every piece of positive news means "to the moon" is:
A super-wealth Asian investor used his venture capital firm to invest in Bitpay, a company that profits off of bitcoin if it succeeds as being an alternative to Paypal, Western Union, etc. Investing in bitpay in lieu of bitcoin implies that he may think that even if bitcoin is wildly successful, it might not be worth 40k a coin like the Winklevoss twins bizarrely suggest. It might mean that as the volatlity diminishes and bitcoin acts as a medium of exchange instead of an asset to pump and dump, the market become more rational since we don't actually need that many coins to transact millions a day in bitcoin. Supply and demand can be reconsidered as the utility and usage of bitcoin transitions into what it was intended to be used for.

As an attorney, your response to the legal question is a bit alarming. It appears your view is that simply using bitcoins instead of USD places you outside of the relevant gambling statutes.

I have a question about the Trailing Limit Order on Coinbase Trader:
Let's assume current price is 150 and you place this trailing limit order
Current Price: 150
Limit Price: 100
Trailing Offset: 5
If the price goes up, nothing happens.
If the Price drop to 101, nothing happens.
If the Price drops to 100, the offset is triggered, and the new trigger is 105, so if the price goes back up to 105 then a market order is placed? If it drops even lower before this happens, lets ay 90, then the new trigger event for a market order is 95.
Is this correct?

The current price of bitcoin assumes it will likely fail. If it works ad becomes the leading digital currency and you can actually buy a sandwich at McDonalds with it... it will go up a LOT. That's why you have long-term speculators.
There is a very high probability it will go nowhere, which is why it is not going up higher.

I don't trust the website, but I trust the people and investors behind it. I've personally met 3 of their venture capital investors and trust them to have done their diligence on the security of the staff. Sure, it's possible for anyone to be duped and coinbase could have senior staff decide to embezzle, but they would likely be caught, and unless it was the heist of the century, I don't think it would affect users like the poker site meltdowns did.

It's pretty hard to answer this question without knowing what type of business you are in and your location. But in the short-term, the only tangible benefit would be increased traffic from bitcoin enthusiasts, which is probably negligible if you are in a podunk suburban town. 
If your product is something that can be sold online, you could potentially drastically increase sales via bitcoin. i.e. If you sell gourmet chocolate and roatsed nuts in the middle of nowhere in Kansas, but have a tiny mail order website, bitcoin could potentially increase your sales tenfold.
But if you are a restaurant off the interstate, you would not benefit from bitcoin enough at the present time to justify training your employees to use another payment processor such as coinbase.
If you operate in a business where chargebacks significantly affect your bottom line, bitcoin has a lot to offer you as a merchant if it is successful long-term.

I think there are 2 issues here the bitcoin community needs to work on
1) We need to better explain bitcoin so that a casual reader of bitcoin on Wikipedia is actually able to understand it!  
2) We need to foster the growth of more unbiased resources (wikipedia, blogs, link databases, online courses on places like skillshare/udemy, etc.).
Right now, many very smart people are in the position where they hear about bitcoin on the news or from a friend, but after 10 minutes of an Internet search they are confronted with so many resources that do not actually explain the key points--they quickly give up.

It did not clear at the same hour so I e-mailed support. I figured it was not even going to clear today since it was passed 5pm when it finally cleared and I received an e-mail back from support. Who knows when they would have credited me if I did not e-mail them. 
I wasn't happy that it came out of my bank account for hours and hours without crediting my account--should be instant.
I would suggest e-mailing support first thing Monday morning, even if its earlier than the time of day you posted the buy since they have such a lag in e-mails and no phone apparently.

In laymen's terms: let's say you bought 10 bitcon on coinbase a month ago and the price dropped 90%. You could then call up your bank and claim the transaction was fraudulent. Now the burden of proof is on coinbase to prove the transaction was not fraudulent. And coinbase is a company where all transactions are made without a face-to-face meeting in an industry that has regular stories of fraud and malfeasance. And they are understaffed due to recent explosive growth and face a short, mandated time period to dispute your fraud claim. Oh and each additional fraud claim that gets filed against them--true or untrue-- makes their case harder to make! This is why you have some banks canceling people's accounts for using bitcoin--they just don't want to deal with the headache of increased fraud investigations!
