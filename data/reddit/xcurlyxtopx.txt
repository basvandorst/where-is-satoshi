It kinda sounds like their operations are working against them? If I’m correct?

I don’t understand, can someone ELI5?

I signed up for Quadriga only because they allow payouts to Canadian $. But I agree^

I think a large majority of the Coinbase users have just said “fuck it” and just stayed with what they were first given

Not necessarily, sure it can be taken into account, but OP probably just posted because of the similarity in terms of the usage
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:10:38
Tangerine doesn’t have monthly usage costs like most banks do. They are indirectly promoting their free of charge service.

What would actually happen when all the bitcoin become mined? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:27:00
As a Canadian, Coinbase is the only one(that I know of currently) that will accept Canadian fiat in exchange for crypto. 
QuadrigaCX is part of Coinbase and has to be used since Coinbase doesn’t allow Canadian users to withdraw our worth with them back to fiat(stupid I know)
So being that QuadrigaCX is the only option(again just from what I know) would that make it unreliable as well?

HA at the rate we’re all going I’ll probably live to see civilization die
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:09:45
Makes sense, but wouldn’t everyone just hold onto what they have? I mean that’s pretty much what everyone is doing now. And if there’s none being bought/sold wouldnt the market come way down? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:04:17
Haw haw, very funny sir /s

Fair, but even with Bitcoin being top dog, whenever it fluctuates in price so does everyone else to an extent. Obviously if bitcoin were to completely fall off the charts then people would begin looking elsewhere, so I guess the answer to my question is that everyone would just find something better ����‍♂️
