What's the music in the background? I've heard it somewhere. Fela Kuti?

He doesn't even give his name or *any* information whatsoever. This is a scam.

When will PVS-Studio be available on Linux? A simple command-line interface is enough, we don't need the GUI.
- You already use Clang
- The only interface you have with the system is basically file I/O
- There's [Mono]( for your C# needs
Seriously, how much work would it be to have a console program that takes a list of cpp files and some compiler/preprocessor flags and outputs the warnings?

I can do it. I will also accept a similar satirical newspaper from your country/place as a form of payment.

If you can't find one, just pick something unusual. Or comics. As long as it doesn't involve super heroes in ridiculously tight suits.

Sure. I will pm you both when I buy the magazines tomorrow. Well in a few hours. Its 5am and i still can't sleep...

tl;dr: because it's not profitable anymore, you will spend more on your electricity bill.
The recreational way to mine would be with your CPU or GPU. The difficulty of mining automatically adjusts to the network mining capabilities. Mining farm with hardware specifically designed to mine efficiently have made the difficulty pretty high.
Mining is also a race. The first node that finds a valid solution to the hashing problem can reward itself so unless you pool your ressources with other recreational miners and share the profit you will never win the race to the mining farms.
If the price of bitcoin rises a lot pooled mining might happen again.

Can't believe I've read all this. All I can say is that you took too many risks throughout this journey... Some of the things you've done are hard to believe...
Also, as a fellow frenchman... 2000€ for an internship? OK no way this is true.

Great service indeed.

This. Also the currency symbol should be suffixed, not prefixed.

I think you should make it shorter. He seems to already know a bit about it anyway.

Bitcoin Frenzy can't be real. They used to have a javascript miner on their site (running while you browse their site) but it seems it was removed.

I can confirm steps 3 to 5 only take a couple of couple minutes to do for any capable git user.
