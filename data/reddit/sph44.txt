You are asking all of the right questions.  Bitfinex has not addressed any of these questions to date as far as I have seen.  Another question I personally have: is it possible there were insiders at either Bitfinex or Bitgo involved in this?  It would stand to reason, because how else would $65MM worth of bitcoin fly out the door without any security limits enforced?

@_date: 2016-08-18 23:28:42
This makes no sense.  He could not possibly have bought at $500 and witnessed it tank to $12, because bitcoin never declined to $12 after it had been $500.  Not even close.  Not even below $100, and only very briefly was it below $200.  When did he buy it, and when did he sell it...?  Can you please clarify?

It is truly sad.  Many people only hear what they want to hear and disregard anything else, even warnings from those trying to protect them.  The OneCoin scammers repeatedly tell these gullible people that OneCoin is the  cryptocurrency and ready to overtake Bitcoin "with better algorithms".  I think I'm done feeling sorry for the victims of this scam.  Before investing significant amounts of their savings, shouldnt some of them take a minute to look around at real-world exchanges and try to find OneCoin...?  If they did that, they would see that OneCoin is not traded on any exchange, and has no value.  The problem is that once they invest, they are committed. Rather than help expose the scam, they perpetuate it by trying to persuade other gullible people to invest behind them, and by so doing they can make back some of their investment in commissions.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:20:41
The problem is indeed in the wording.  The words Bitfinex used implies that they are not backing anything and the users who trusted Bitfinex and kept wallets there have lost their money.  Hopefully I am interpreting it wrong.  Hopefully Bitfinex will back the users and compensate in some significant way for the losses that occured because of shortcomings in the way Bitfinex secured the wallets.  But that remains to be seen.
@_date: 2016-08-19 00:20:07
Unfortunately the information you are providing is simply a repetition of the talking points of the founders of the OneCoin pyramid scheme.  Even the 2 million users is not real: it is simply a number given to you by the promoters of the scheme, and those running the 'investment' seminars.  Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Ethereum, Ripple are all true cryptocurrencies.  They can be traded on exchanges, and in the case of Bitcoin you can actually buy goods and services with it from merchants worldwide.  There is a true value to Bitcoin based on supply and demand.  OneCoin is not a cryptocurrency.  It is not traded on any exchange.  It is not accepted by any merchants anywhere.  The price you are told it is "worth" is arbitrarily set by the OneCoin founders.  It's market capitalization figure is fake.  It has no real blockchain (the founders simply tell you they run it, but it is not real).  OneCoin is a multi-level marketing scheme.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:18:48
Disagree completely.  Exchanges or online wallet services holding funds for their clients have a responsibility to at least set some limits so that extraordinarily large transactions (eg those measured in millions) are at least temporarily held in abeyance until the owners of the contributing wallets can be contacted to verify they intended to move those funds.  If there are tens of millions of dollars flooding out of your exchange in a matter of hours, obviously something is wrong, or should at least be checked.  Unless of course those who would be responsible for checking it are in on the theft.

Buffet has already been proven wrong about Bitcoin.  Even if BTC crashes yet again, and this time drops all the way back down to $1K, Buffet would still be proven wrong, because he was saying it was overpriced and a "bubble" back when it was only a few hundred $ per BTC.  ie. investors would still have been better off ignoring him and buying Bitcoin back then.  He is good at identifying value stocks, he's just not knowledgeable at all about crypto-currencies.

@_date: 2016-08-18 23:31:57
That still makes no sense.  If he bought $100 worth of BTC, his account balance never, ever would have declined to $12.  You said the rate was $500/BTC when he bought, so that would imply that BTC declined down to $60 at some point, and it never, ever declined anywhere near that level.

Sorry, but this is just incorrect.  My recent BTC transfers have cost the equivalent of $15-$25 (not including when I swept out my old Strongcoin wallet which cost over $100 in fees).  For my business, I do domestic wire transfers in USD with my bank for $10, and ACH payments and online bill payments are free.  BTC transfers are more expensive than bank transfers, even more than domestic wire transfers most of the time.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:12:57
I'm waiting for you and others to spam the BCH network.  That will be easy and inexpensive since tx fees are so low.  The only thing is, whenever the volume of transactions grows, BCH miners include them all in the next block since there is plenty of room to do so.
Edit: I still have much more value in BTC than in BCH.  I am not someone who is all-in BCH.  I'm not here to promote BCH; I'm posting my opinions these days because I'm sincerely worried for BTC's future appeal to new users due to the network congestion.  Since I own roughly equal amounts of each coin, my BTC value is a higher % of my portfolio, and I want it to succeed.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:07:56
BTC has gotten to the point with its tx fees where it really does not make sense to transact anything less than around $400-$500, and that means per transaction.  It is unusable as a currency for anything less than that, which is sad, unfortunate, and unnecessary.  There are alternatives though, so check out ETH, BCH, or maybe some of the smaller, newer alts.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:18:59
You have posted some excellent questions, but as I'm sure you have found, trying to engage in civil debate on this sub and advocating for any on-chain scaling will just lead to users like "LightningFuture" (redditor for an extensive 2 weeks) calling *you* a shill (as ironic as that is) and telling you to get lost.

@_date: 2018-01-10 16:08:12
Ok, but back in 2010 with free transactions and bitcoin not yet having any real value, one could have spammed the network without spending much money (that was the point: someone could have just done it as a prank it would have been so cheap to do).
In today's market wouldn't it cost tens of millions of dollars to effectively spam Bitcoin?  And even spending tens of millions of dollars in spam tx fees, that would only create a temporary congestion.  I don't know if I buy into the believe that there are evil actors out there willing to spend tens of millions of dollars to create temporary congestion.  To listen to some on this sub, there are, but it just does not seem realistic to me.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:32:40
Don't mean to quibble, but BTC was never priced at $1200 in the year 2014.  It hit an effective peak of close to $1200 on Mt Gox in Nov 2013.  By Jan 2014 it was hovering in the range of $800-990, and for the remainder of 2014 it traded in the range of around $350-$800.  
Furthermore, it never truly lost 90% of its value after that, unless you are referring to some flash crash that might have lasted less than 1 minute.  I followed it carefully day by day and bought on dips during 2014-2015, and the lowest price level it hit in any meaningful way was in the $180s, and that was in 2015.

If this story is real, post some screenshots and I would recommend hounding him anywhere you can find him on social media posting evidence of his scam. Create new user accounts and post evidence as often as you can.  (He will end up deleting these of course, but you might get through to some of his gullible followers while the posts are up).
Trevon James is a known scam artist.  So is Craig Grant.  So are all of those who promise and "guarantee" high returns to investors on social media.  So are cloud mining offers and all 'lending' platforms.  Bitconnect and OneCoin are probably two of the worst examples of obvious scams that are somehow luring people in (usually people with zero knowledge of crypto currencies).
Now back to your story:  Anyone that promises to return to you 9X your investment "in a few days" is obviously a scammer.  It's hard to understand how someone could be gullible enough to believe that.  Just think logically for second: If he had some magical ability to increase his money 9X in a week, what on earth would he need your 1K for?  He could just keep reinvesting his own money and be a billionaire inside of a few months without bothering with your silly $1K.  Secondly, after a few days he said he had your 0.8 BTC "ready" to send you, but required you to pre-pay fees.  If that were true, why wouldn't you just ask him to deduct the fees from the transfer?  Offer to take only 0.7 BTC and let him keep the rest to cover the fees.  (Not to mention the fact that the amount of fees he specified was absolutely ludicrous and would in *NO* way ever be required to transfer you 0.8 BTC.)
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:34:35


Edit:  I own a lot more BTC than ETH, so I am not pumping anything.  Just answering the call.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:26:50
Very well said.  But even domestic wire transfers are less than that if you do them regularly or make an agreement with your bank.  You might get dinged for $30 or so if you go in as a consumer one time only to do a wire, but bank wire fees are actually much cheaper than that if you do them regularly and/or set up an account for wires with your bank.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:43:38


I agree completely.  Frankly, I don't think that was ever in doubt.  However, I would have hoped for a much more gradual rise in tx fees, and for transaction costs to remain low and speed to remain high to increase adoption. 
I do not believe BTC will remain as popular as other coins if users find it slow and expensive.  I think there is a certain tolerance for tx fees up to a couple of dollars per transfer, but paying $10-$30 per tx is a different story, and I worry that BTC adoption will suffer and some alts will take over and become dominant.


Once again, I agree completely.  I don't think anyone is arguing we should have completely free on-chain transactions for ever, or even now.  Reasonable tx fees are not a problem.  The current tx fees are not reasonable, or sustainable.
A clean HF to an 8 MB block-size cap would alleviate the mempool backlog, allow for faster confirmations and lower tx fees for years to come, allowing for a much better user experience and for BTC to grow in popularity and to maintain its dominance among crypto-currencies.

I didn't say there is a problem right now.  I was responding to the above post wherein he asked 'wtf was Satoshi thinking?'.  I just think the above post is unduly harsh towards Gavin Andresen, especially in light of the fact that Satoshi, just like Gavin Andresen, saw the 1 MB limit as a temporary limit.  SW is good for now, but that will only provide temporary relief as well.  I don't know why the above post or the op cannot simply state an honest disagreement with Gavin's position in a respectful manner. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:06:52
He said that was a *temporary* measure while bitcoin was in its infancy.  He said multiple times unequivocally that the block-size limit should be raised well before the blocks become full.  That would have been back in 2015.  He did not foresee any problem to simply increase the block size; and obviously did not think it would become a point of contention.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:16:48
I appreciate your thorough reply.  Reddit could use more of these kinds of informative posts, so thank you for taking the time.  
How would you respond to others who would argue that there is centralisation in BTC with the tight-knit BTC core developers with commit access, and the key developers are founders of and/or work for Blockstream?  Would that arguably be analogous to the ethereum foundation developers?  If not, can you elaborate on why we should not be concerned with centralisation of power with the BTC core developers? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:22:24
You are right.  However for those who already have BTC, they eventually might want to spend it or sell it, and to do so really does not make sense for any small amounts less than several hundred $.  It's actually depressing it has become unusable.

No.  Cold storage refers to any offline storage wherein you control your own private keys.  You could use paper wallets or hardware wallets.

You seem to misunderstand how it works. It is profitable for those fortunate enough to live in areas with very low electricity costs.  In areas with high electricity cost is is not profitable, but if it were not profitable anywhere, there would be no mining and the blockchain would grind to a halt.

The real problem is facebook is rampant with scammers trying to lure in ignorant investors into various schemes by using crypto buzz words. There are hundreds of scammers out there offering cloud-mining services etc that are obvious scams. "Earn 0.5 BTC daily, we have the machines, you just attach your wallet" and crap like that. One guy I just saw last week telling users they just need to load out a wallet and link it to him to use with his Antminer S9s, and he has his S9s "programmed to earn up to 80% of the wallet's contents per week", as if the amount of BTC you hold in your wallet somehow makes the S9s mine that much more profitably.  It's amazing what complete garbage some people will buy, but I guess these scammers figure if people will buy Bitconnect tokens and OneCoin, they might as well try to bilk them with a mining scam.  Makes me sick.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:01:47
Fair point.  It's probably fair to say there have been several "bursts" of hashpower tech and any one of those could be called sudden.  I remember when the Antminer S1 came up at I believe 180 Gh/s and that was considered huge.  Just a couple of months after it came out, I recall a majority of the total hashpower in the world was attributable to the S1.  From that point on it was a challange to keep up with the main point being the ratio of hashing power to the power required to run it.

Do you realise that the BCH network right now is processing a higher volume of tx data than BTC?  Take a look at the BCH blocks recently.  Most blocks are 5-8 MB.  Probably it's spam.  If I were a NO2X team member I would complain that BCH is being "attacked", but I'm not, so I won't use that word to describe what is happening.  In fact I'm glad the spam surge is happening, because it's serving as a proof of concept.  BCH miners are able to clear out the mempool constantly by simply mining larger blocks when needed, so there is no backlog.  Transactions are still getting confirmed very fast and tx fees are a tiny fraction of BTC tx fees.  I am still a big holder of BTC but this is making me question my decision to continue to hold a significant amount of it.
See below:
TL;DR BTC could easily fix it's congestion issues with a simple block-size increase, but refuses to do so.

@_date: 2018-01-09 03:45:41


You misunderstood his post.  But regarding the coins released per block, that has *always* been on a schedule to change.  Initially the block reward was 50 BTC, then 25, currently it is 12.5 and in another couple of years it will halve again.

@_date: 2018-01-07 15:31:58
Excellent point.  I'm willing to bet he did not factor that in.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:14:16
That's a very good point.  I have to admit I had not thought of that.  Even still, however, if we assume one of the largest mining pools to be trying to spam the network, even the largest mining pools account for around 15%-20% of the hash rate, so if one of them were to take that approach, they would still be spending huge amounts of money to try to spam the network, and only getting back around 15%-20% of what they spent, right?  It seems like most of their money would still be wasted in a futile attempt to increase network congestion, unless I am missing something.  I use the word "futile" because whatever congestion they are able to create would only be temporary.  Anyway I appreciate the point and it is a good one, I just still feel like it's not as likely there is some coordinated spam "attack" as it is the backlog due to the small 1 MB block-size cap.  I know we disagree on that, but anyway thanks for your time and comments.

Excellent. Makes perfect sense to me.  
(the user to whom I had responded implied he knows of some investors deeply hurt by this market price decline, so my comments were obviously not directed to investors like you who are taking a reasonable approach, but to any investors, if they actually exist, who would have gambled more than they can afford to lose by jumping in with a very large investment when BTC and other major cryptos were at all-time highs around a month ago following a parabolic rate of market price increase.  I simply doubt anyone would have jumped in heavy when BTC was at 19K for example.  Obviously there were some newer buyers at that level, but hopefully they did the reasonable thing and started small, investing only what they could afford to lose, and knowing there might be a large correction soon, and then maybe putting in a bit more on the price decline as you indicated).
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:44:43

In defense of OP, I do see irony in that.  I would say it is ironic that so many people are bemoaning the 'crash' in Bitcoin down to $10K, when just a few months ago $10K was an all-time high that many holders thought was unattainable in 2017.  Zooming out on the price chart to 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or all time, the price performance has been spectacular, so to watch so many people speaking about it like it's dying for the 1000th time is amusing, and arguably a bit ironic.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:21


That's what people said when it went from $30 back down to $2 in 2012. 
That's also what people said when it went from $200 back down to $30.  
That's also what people said when it went from $1100 back down to $400.  Or when 6 months later it went from $700 down to $200.

It is true most of their blocks contain less than 1 MB of data, but every once in a while there are blocks much larger.  Whenever there are enough transactions in the mempool, they get cleared out right away in the next block.  No backlog.

@_date: 2018-01-10 19:05:27
Agreed 100%.  Let's not forget, Buffet was already saying Bitcoin was over-priced back when it was $400.  He admits to not understanding it, so why do people have such a fascination in hearing him speak negatively about it?  He should stick to value stocks which is his area of strength.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:34:31


Not true. The BCH network has processed more tx data in the past day than BTC.  Even regarding the # of tx the values are close.  BTC has no where near "10x" the transactions as you claim.  And yet....BTC tx fees are more than 100 times higher on average when compared to BCH tx fees.
Think about that for a minute and let that sink in.  BTC fees are more than 100x higher than BCH tx fees.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:32:24
Yes.  The point being as bitcoin hopefully grows over the years, there will be a need for larger blocks, but technology will also be improving all the time, creating more options.  IMO an 8 MB block-size cap would be more than enough to relieve our BTC mempool congestion, probably for a couple of years, and if we had to increase that to a 16 MB cap in a couple of years, it should not be a problem.  You could still run a full node if you want even with an 8 MB or 16 MB cap, and years down the road that will still be true.   Meanwhile the BTC user experience would be much better.  tx fees would be lower and most transactions would be confirmed in the next block so users would not face long delays.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:17:33
Sorry, but that's false information that has been spread a lot around here, but it is false. BTC could increase to a 4MB or 8MB or 16 MB block size and you could still easily run nodes in your home. There would still be ~~tens of~~  thousands of nodes around the world, and it is simply untrue to suggest that nodes would be restricted to large machines in data centers.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:27:21
Coinbase is still one of the easiest on-ramps for new users.  You can link up your bank account and once your account is verified you can easily buy BTC, ETH, BCH or LTC.  Then once you have a wallet there, you can easily transfer to any other wallets or exchanges.  Gemini is another good exchange.  If you wanted to dabble in some more exotic alts (eg ADA, XLR, IOTA, etc), you could use Coinbase as your on-ramp and then transfer a small amount of whichever of the main currencies you have to an exchange like Poloniex or Binance to dabble in some of the exotics. Coinbase only has the major ones. 
However, a word of advice:  do not keep any significant holdings on any exchange.  Exchanges are great to use for initially buying and trading cryptos, but you should hold most of your savings in cold storage where you control your own private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:16:45
Agreed that decentralisation is vital.  But as you very well know, even if we raise the block-size cap to 8 MB, users could still run full nodes from home, and there would still be thousands of nodes running worldwide, and I do not see how mining would be any more centralised than it is now.  You would still have the larger pools such as Antpool, F2 Pool, Slush, etc and I don't see any reason to believe the hashrate distribution would change, so why would an 8 MB block-size limit suddenly mean Bitcoin is centralised?
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:36:31
Very True, but in the meantime, BTC is practically unusable, and other major digital currencies like ETH, BCH etc function far better, faster and minimal tx fees.  Everyone says "be patient", but they don't get that BTC risks losing customers who will go to the point of least resistance and switch to digital currencies that actually function as currencies.

That is not true (not that mining "suddenly" became concentrated; it was not really sudden at all).  He did foresee and stated as such that mining would evolve over the years to more powerful machines.  He did lament the early transition from CPU to GPU back in 2010 as he liked the idea of individuals mining on their computers in the early days, but he acknowledged that with technology evolving that miners would develop more powerful mining machines and that the days of being able to mine on home computers was limited.

If they are paying “above average fees”, why would they bank on the transactions “never getting confirmed”...?
The BTC network must be even more congested than I realised, if you feel paying above average tx fees will still result in most transfers never getting confirmed...

Great question.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:11:49
Sort of.  There was a soft fork introducing Segwit, which enables more transactions to be included potentially doubling the number of transactions that could be included (or more, according to some).  But getting all users and companies to use it has not been so easy, and so far it has provided only minimal relief, and even if it were used by all, the network would still be congested.

The 1 MB was explicitly a *temporary* limit while bitcoin was in its infancy, as a protection against a malicious actor while transactions were free and bitcoin itself was virtually free.  That is clearly not the case anymore.

I don't believe more than a few poor investors have lost 40% of their investment now either.  That proposition just doesn't seem credible.  It implies an 'investor' waited and waited all of these years refusing to invest anything at all into it, then waited until it hit an all-time high in December that represented such a fast, high price-surge that it could be described as parabolic, an unsustainable rate of increase obvious to even a novice investor.  The supposition is that an 'investor' then chose to plop down a significant investment at that all-time high, and then be surprised and saddened at a significant market correction.  After the parabolic price increases in late 2017, a significant price correction was to be expected, and you would not need to be a wise or experienced investor to have seen that.  
Bottom line is this:  If you investigated and believe in Bitcoin (or Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash, or other major cryptos) so much that you were willing to make a major investment a month ago at an all-time high, then you presumably believe in the tech long term, and so you should see this as a good buying opportunity to accumulate some more.  In that case, you should hold long term.  I would have little sympathy for someone who ignored bitcoin all these years, continued to ignore it through it's tremendous price rise from 2016 through most of 2017, then chose Dec 2017 to jump in with both feet, and then whined about the market correction we are seeing now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:22
You are very wise.  Stick with it, and try to always keep your crypto investments to an amount you could afford to lose.  Chances are high your investment will be worth much more in a couple of years than it is worth today, but there is always that chance that a specific crypto asset could fail (not likely, but one should remember it is always possible).  I would never recommend to anyone to invest the bulk of their retirement savings into a crypto asset, but I would recommend to buy modest amounts of several of the major cryptos (eg. BTC, BCH, ETH) and hold them long term.
Best wishes to you!

Pretty much everyone has known Bitconnect to be a scam from the beginning.
Regarding Bitcoin, I must be missing something.  Sure the market is down (a correction which was to be expected), and it could go down further, but aren't we still up more than 13X since a year ago?  If you had $1000 worth of BTC a year ago, you would have today around $11,000 BTC + $1800 BCH + $200 BTG so approx $13,000 today.  What stock, bond, mutual fund, CD or precious metals could you have bought with that $1000 one year ago that would be worth approx $13000 today...?  For all of those office workers saying "I told ya so", OP could simply compare his portfolio performance over the past year to see how he fared against them.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:55:06
That's most likely a good buy as a long term investment. Nothing is guaranteed obviously, but as long as you're not investing more than you could afford to lose, and you buy and hold long term, more likely than not you'll be glad you did a couple of years from now.  A bit of diversification among key cryptos is also recommended.

Funny.  If you check the BCH blockchain, they processed a significantly greater volume in tx data in the past 24 hours than BTC.   BCH tx fees were as low as ever, even declined slightly on average.  Still cost only around 2 cents to send a BCH transaction.  The BCH miners were mining blocks regularly greater than 7 MB earlier today.  And yet, there is no issue.  No problem.  They kept clearing the mempool by simply mining larger blocks as needed.  Transactions were still fast, with confirmations coming routinely in the next block, and tx fees remained so low they are virtually free.  So feel free to use your money to spam the BCH network.  See how that works out :)  
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:21:49


Bitcoin Gold developers pre-mined for themselves, which seems a bit shady.  Bitcoin Cash developers did not do that.  And as for Bitcoin *Diamond*, is that even *real*...?  I ask genuinely; I do not know, but I can't find it listed anywhere and I wouldn't be surprised if it were some kind of scam or in any case not a real digital asset. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:59:09
Right.  But I have to admit, I'm actually intrigued by it.  Almost enough to ask them innocently how it works (I just want to know the catch).  I'm guessing the catch is that they tell you to just pay the electricity and watch the Bitcoin roll in, and they keep "only 20%" (but meanwhile they control the mining rigs and can configure them however they want, whenever they want, so you never really know the total amount of BTC generated by the machine, yet you are paying the electricity I would assume).
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:34:07
Ok, I understand, but could you please explain how a simple block-size increase to 8 MB (which would completely relieve the backlogged mempool and lead to faster confirmations and much lower fees) would lead now to centralization?  I have never gotten a rational answer to that.  With an 8 MB block-size limit we could still run nodes in our homes and we would still be decentralized with thousands of nodes worldwide.  And please don't come back with the non-sequitur that 8 GB blocks would lead to all nodes in data centers.  Yes if it went to 8 GB right now, yes it would.  But that's not what I'm talking about, so please see if you can answer the direct question: an 8 MB block-size limit just like BCH now has, why can we not do that for BTC?  Then LN and sidechains can emerge in the coming years as additional options down the road.  I just don't see the benefit to BTC of keeping the block-size limit so tiny that it drives up mempool backlog, leads to long delays in confirmations and tx fees often higher than $10.  I understand that you and others do not see the problem the same way as I do, and that is fine.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:49:54
I'm really glad you are standing your ground.  Thank you for the posts.  I have held BTC for years and am deeply concerned.  Among others, look at the user above and so many others on this subreddit with their terse, thoughtless insults and dismissive attitudes.  If BTC fails, it will be due to users like them who are so abrasive, and absolutely dismissive of anyone pointing out problems with user experience such as the high tx fees and delays, and suggestions for a solution as you have.

Many of us have been predicting a significant correction.  The price surge was too high, too fast, and unsustainable. Bitcoin has crashed many times in its history, and yet every time it "crashes" it stabilises at a price higher than what it was before it began the price surge that preceded the crash.  So many people have such a herd mentality they cannot see that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:39:07
He did exaggerate.  There is no doubt about that.  But still, doesn't it concern you that most Bitcoin transactions now cost over $10 and often take hours to get confirmed...?  It's getting out of hand.  I used to give it away as gifts but I can't do it anymore as the fees are too high.

Reducing the blocksize would hurt everyone, including miners, IMO as the BTC mempool backlog would get even worse and BTC would decline substantially in value.

Would you mind posting the txid to verify this?  I ask because every time I see someone claim they are sending BTC with very low fees like I have to question it (even with segwit).  I have yet to see someone make the claim and back it up with a txid post, so if you don't mind, let's take a look at your transaction from yesterday (12/17/17).
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:23:27
Sure, there will be if the price were to decline all the way down to 1K.  I doubt it will decline that far.  In any case, the current rally really started back in late 2016.  Throughout 2015 the price was hovering between 200 - 300 most of the time.  In late 2016 it began its remarkable ascent that has now lasted over a year.  The current surge did *not* start at 1000-2000. I remember watching it closely throughout Nov &amp; Dec 2016 as it climbed from 600 to 700 to 800 etc and remember feeling great when it passed 1100 which had been it's previous ATH.  So in other words, 2000 was definitely not the starting point. 
Edit:  I had predicted a market correction back down to around 4-5K.  I hope I am wrong and hope it doesn't decline that far, but even if it did, that would still be *far* above the price level before the current bull market.

It's worse than that.  With Civil Asset Forfeiture, state or local law enforcement can seize your cash or your property without even charging you with any crime.  They can simply assert they "believe" a crime was committed involving your property, not that you would need to be suspected or charged of committing said crime. Criminal Asset Forfeiture is different, and that is less controversial.

Brian Kelly is not at all uninformed.  He has been a proponent of Bitcoin for years.

He holds both.

That's the way I was looking at it too.  No one knows of course, but I wouldn't be surprised at some point soon to see a correction back down to around 4K.  With so much new money coming into Bitcoin this year, my fear is that new investors will be much more easily spooked than those of us who have been holding for 3-4 years.  We've  been on the roller coaster long enough not to panic at some bad news here or there, but much of this new money might not be so steady, and a small correction could turn into a large correction fast.  But those of us who believe in Bitcoin will use that as a good buying opportunity to accumulate more and look for long term growth.

GWB first proposed TARP in 2008, but Republicans in congress opposed it for ideological reasons.  Pelosi and Reid supported TARP, and the 2009 budget was passed by the Democratically controlled House and Senate and signed by President Obama in April 2009.
As far as the deficits I would encourage you to check a world almanac for federal budget figures and deficits.  The deficits were highest from 2009-2012.  They did not decline appreciably until 2012-2013 after the sequester, but the sequester was against Obama's wishes.  He fought hard against the spending cuts.

So yesterday Bitcoin was around $10K.  Today it has been hovering around $11K-11.5K most of the day.  Let's say it shoots up to $12.8K tomorrow, but then overnight comes back down to $11.4K, you would say the market "crashed"...?  The 11.4K price would still represent an All-Time High as of just a few days earlier, but you would still say the market actually "crashed"...?  Interesting.
Edit:  bear in mind, the $11.4K price would still be more than double the price from just a few months earlier, and more than 10 times the price from a year ago.  So even after the astronomical gains in market value over the course of the year, one could still argue that the market has "crashed", because technically it is &gt; 10% below the new ATH.  If that's the case, I don't know why anyone would ever worry about a market "crash".
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:59:34


Although I think we might have been better of with the different outcome, this statement is unfortunately not true, but is a common misunderstanding of what happened.  There was one statewide re-count which still showed GWB winning, albeit by a smaller vote differential than the original vote.  The courts finally put a stop to the additional re-counts, that is true.  But the statement that the courts "stole the election" would only be true IF Gore would have won Florida with additional re-counting.  After the election was settled and GWB was president already, there were re-counts done by the media, and if I recall correctly there were something like 16 recounts, with GWB winning 15 of the 16 by margins ranging from a few dozen votes to a few thousand votes.  The 1 out of 16 that Gore "won" was by less than 10 votes.  So even though many people are bitter that the additional re-counts were not permitted to continue, the court's action did not actually cost Gore the election as he would still have lost Florida after the additional re-counts.

Agreed, and yes, I think many people might have at least entertained the thought of a 'flippening'.   But here's the thing: OP would have already had BCH 1:1 for every BTC he held as he had it prior to the HF 8/1.  So he was already hedged.  He claimed to have all of that BTC on a Trezor for years. So even if BCH were to take over and grow exponentially, he would already be participating in that upside with the BCH from the HF safely on his Trezor.  There would be absolutely no reason for him, a disciplined long-term holder and believer in BTC, holding through all the ups &amp; downs over the years, to read a few anonymous posts on reddit, suddenly dump all of his BTC, and then cry on reddit that some users posting on another sub made him do it because they said BTC was "dead".  It just makes no sense.  More likely this was a fabrication by OP.

Sorry, but that's not true.  Holding Bitcoin and not reporting it is not tax evasion (unless this bill were to pass, and then, who knows).  If you hold Bitcoin and have held it for years, you are absolutely not "evading taxes" as there is no taxable event.  If you *sell* that Bitcoin, or trade it, and do not report your capital gains, then that would be tax evasion.

Social security was lumped in with the general budget back in the 1960s under Lyndon Johnson's administration.  It might appear as a separate line on your paycheck when you see your taxes taken out, but it is part of the general budget.  Now that the baby-boom generation is retiring, every year less and less of the benefits paid out (federal expenditures) come from current contributions, and this is getting worse due to the aging of the population.  In just a few more years the contributions from those of us paying in will not even come close to paying out benefits to the increasing population of retirees.

This.  Even when it dipped from 11K back down to 9.1K, everyone quickly forgot that it was still above an all-time high from just a couple of weeks before.  Everything is relative, but for an asset like Bitcoin that has skyrocketed up this year, it's a shame to see people panic and call it a "crash" if it just drops back 10-20%. For me it could go to 50% of its ATH, and I would still look on the bright side that it would still be more than 5 times what it was a year ago, and I would see it as a new buying opportunity (just like when it "crashed from $1100 in Dec 2013 down to $400 by March 2014).
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:21:06
+1.  Exactly right.  It baffles me how so many deny this truth.  With all of the media attention, people everywhere are paying attention and asking questions about Bitcoin.  Up until around a month ago I enthusiastically promoted Bitcoin to anyone who showed any interest (direct payments, no trusted 3rd party, no financial institutions, no central bank, not controlled by any one company, immediate payments peer to peer, direct to anyone, anywhere in the world, inexpensive and no bank paperwork, etc).  Now when people ask I have to be honest about the mempool backlog, the delays in confirmations, and the relatively high fees.  It didn't phase me much when tx fees started costing me $2 - $3, but now that they are running in the range of $10-$15 or even higher in some cases, it is very troubling as I think we are going to lose our opportunity at widespread adoption.  This worldwide attention is what I dreamed about 3 years ago, but now that we finally have it, our congestion, delays and high fees will discourage new users.

I am too, and this is exactly what I have been saying for months now.  Responses to my concerns on the BTC backlog have ranged from *"no one uses bitcoin for payments anyway..."* to *"LN is coming soon..."*, to *"Learn how to use bitcoin...", to "why rush to send transfers now, can't it wait...?"* and others telling me to stop complaining about paying $15 tx fees because I'm not contributing to get it fixed myself and am thus not "entitled" to fast transactions (the latter posts made by those who were in favor of keeping this 1 MB block-size that is exacerbating this mempool backlog in a bad way, while I was in favor of increasing it, and I was shouted down for that too).  End result is those who want to stick to the tiny 1 MB block-size still have their head in the sand, and stubbornly cling to that position believing the mempool backlog, high tx fees and confirmation delays are not a big deal.  BTC will suffer for this, and users/new adopters will move to alternatives.

Ok, but isn't that an issue...?  Even if you see its primary benefit as store of value, wouldn't you like the ability to send $100 to a friend or relative without it costing you 10+% of the amount sent (often higher than Western Union)?  Bitcoin was initiated and presented as peer to peer electronic cash.  The ability to effect peer to peer payments is what attracted me to Bitcoin 4 years ago.  I just don't see how people can dismiss that attribute so easily and pretend it doesn't matter.  It matters.

Agree with all prior agreement and the upcoming ones.  At Thanksgiving just 1 month ago, everyone was amazed by Bitcoin's price surge (it was around USD 8,500).  One month later relatives are asking me why it "crashed".  They didn't bother to see that it "crashed" to USD 13,000, they all just heard on the news a couple of days ago that it crashed.  My in-law got from me $200 in Bitcoin (0.25 BTC) I owed him 1 year ago.  He held it on his mobile wallet for 1 year.  It turned into &gt; $4000.  He got nervous because of the "crash" and went all-in on Ripple.  100% he sent to Ripple and is holding on an exchange!  I would respect a hedge, but that's just ridiculous.

True.  IMO the one thing that has prevented widespread abuse by state &amp; local authorities is the public visibility eg investigative reports on behalf of the victims of CAF (eg. by 60 minutes or other programs) to shed light on abuse by the government.  They probably don't want to abuse their CAF power rampantly for fear of losing it altogether.  That's probably little consolation to those who have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on attorneys to sue and prove their own innocence just to get their rightful property or cash back, but anyway that's probably why it's not totally unrestrained to date.  The new Senate Bill S. 1241 however could make it worse.

Even CobraBitcoin admitted this is not true.  Satoshi's vision was peer to peer electronic cash, fast, direct transactions with low tx fees.  Anyone reading the white paper and reading his bitcointalk forum posts back in 2009-2010 would acknowledge that.  None of us truly know Satoshi's feelings on this subject today, if he is still with us.  Of course it is possible that he has changed his mind.  However if we judge Satoshi's vision based on his writings from 2008-2010, he definitely wanted bitcoin to be fast, economical peer to peer electronic cash, and he specifically said the 1 MB block-size was just a temporary measure, and that the block-size limit would be increased.  Segwit had not been conceived yet so we do not know how he would have felt about it.  My point is, you cannot say definitively that his vision is BTC and not BCH.  That just does not fit based on his writings.

If you were here before Aug 1 and have your BCH, try it.  I've moved some and it costs about 3 cents instead of $20+ and it's fast.  I was neutral up until a couple of months ago and held both, but I'm just fed up with the high fees and delays, and I find it frustrating because it was not necessary.  A modest block-size increase would have led us down a better path, but too many people shouted down anyone on this sub advocating for a block-size increase.

You can buy any amount of Bitcoin you want.  You could set up regular weekly buys of $50 or $100, or any amount you choose.  Realistically though, with BTC fees getting fairly high these days (often $5-10 to transfer), you should understand it is becoming impractical to send/transfer amounts less than around $100.  The fee to transfer $50 would probably be about the same as to transfer $500 or $5000 since it does not depend on the amount of money but on the tx data.

The IRS in the USA specifically said Bitcoin is *not* a currency.  Instead they chose to classify it as an Asset so that they can charge capital gains taxes on it.  You could be correct about mining as income as someone else posted above.  If that were the case a miner could deduct the extra electricity expense and the cost of the ASICs as business expenses and deduct those from the income valued at the time the Bitcoins were mined.  If someone mined Bitcoins back in 2010-2011 (as discussed in someone's post above) those would have had negligible value at the time they were mined, so still 99% of the person's tax burden would come when they eventually sell their Bitcoins for a gain.

A major problem with this proposed legislation is how vague it is, and how much additional power it gives to the government.  This bill, if passed and signed into law, will undoubtedly increase government's power vis-a-vis civil asset forfeiture, a practice that is already unfair and could soon be even more so.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:12:14
Right, but that's pretty obvious.  That's the difference between an unrealized gain and a realized gain.  The user above said in his country you don't pay capital gains tax if you sell after holding the asset more than 1 year.  That's why I asked which country.  I believe there are some countries that do not tax capital gains.

The post above (to which I responded) said he doesn't see how it impacts Bitcoin.  In my view the bill does not ban Bitcoin, but it clearly impacts it.  


Yes, absolutely.  But this is a non-sequitur.  If you buy and hold Bitcoin, that is *not* income.  You presumably already paid taxes on your income, and your after tax income is what you use to invest.  The IRS in the USA classified Bitcoin as an Asset.  So if you use your after tax income to buy Bitoin, and you hold it, there is no taxable event until you eventually sell it, spend it or trade it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:32:05


It should also be noted that BCH transaction fees are much lower (only a few cents per transaction rather than a few dollars), which is why supporters say it is the more practical peer to peer electronic cash.  The main challenge for it is that it's not as widely known or accepted as BTC, at least not yet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:28:16
Sorry, but how exactly is OP's post misleading...?  OP is saying that this bill is now in committee.  We all know it was introduced earlier this year, and many people posted about it at that time.

You do realise this is a regurgitated post with almost the exact same text as another user posted here on this sub a couple of weeks ago, right?  
And by the way, BCH today is trading at around $2500, at its all-time high, more than 7 times its value from 4 months ago, so even if you really converted some of your BTC to BCH you are not doing too badly.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:26:29
Maybe you can explain this to me.  I've always been baffled by people who say "Blockchain Yes, Bitcoin No" (something along the lines that the Blockchain is great technology to be embraced, but Bitcoin should be avoided).  How does someone reconcile that dichotomy?  It just seems like people who say that have no understanding of what the Blockchain actually is.  
If you remove bitcoin or another cryptocurrency/ token from the blockchain, the miners have no incentive to run computers verifying transactions, finding blocks and maintaining the network.  Without the currency as a reward for mining, there would be no blockchain.  Now if a corporation were to instead create their own private "blockchain" with no currency involved, because no incentive token or currency is required as they are paying for and operating all of their own nodes and miners, then that would be completely centralized and would bear no resemblance to a worldwide distributed ledger that is the fundamental characteristic of the blockchain.  
I suppose I could be missing something here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:43
BCH has increased in value to around $2500 today, so if someone were to have bought some months ago when you say you did, it would have proven to be a good investment.  Furthermore tx fees are around 2 to 3 cents rather than $20-$30 or even higher with BTC, so it allows people to use it as peer to peer electronic cash even for smaller transactions.  So I'm really not sure what it is you think you are protecting your grandma from first of all, and secondly digital currencies are obviously risky so no one should be mortgaging their homes or taking on debt to buy them in the first place, whether they are buying BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC or others.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:44:43
Very good points.  I agree with you.  I don't think the Braess paradox is applicable to the onchain scaling issue.  I would much prefer we were all on the 5 lane highway rather than the backed-up 2 lane highway we're on now.  It's like traffic is backed up for miles, but there is an empty 5 lane highway 10 metres away running parallel to our highway that we're not permitted to use because the authorities are telling us they are building a toll road as an alternate route a half mile off the other side, but that new toll road is still under construction and no one is certain when it will be ready or how it will work out.  I also agree the 5 lane highway shouldn't be considered temporary, because it would still alleviate traffic congestion even after the toll road is completed, and travellers (users) would eventually have the option of using either one.  I'm sincerely trying to understand the other side of this argument, but I'm having trouble getting there. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:37:45
Who said anything about avoiding taxes?  OP said nothing of the sort, nor even implied it.  Your question reeks of prejudice.  You do not owe taxes for purchasing and holding bitcoins or other crypto-currencies.  The taxable event occurs when you sell it or trade it, and then you owe capital gains tax on the appreciated value over your cost.  If you hold for more than 1 year, you owe the reduced rate for long term holdings.  I'm confident most holders know they will owe capital gains taxes when they eventually sell.  I think OP's concern is that this will induce audits to tens of thousands of taxpayers who have been dutifully paying their income taxes and who understandably don't want the added hassle of an IRS audit simply because they invested in bitcoin a couple of years ago.

A more apropos comparison would be 1 MB blocks and 8 MB blocks.  Bear in mind, there was no 1 MB block-size limit when BTC was created.  That was put in as a temporary measure when it was in its infancy to protect the network against spam attacks when it would have been very inexpensive for a malicious actor to do so (when 1 BTC was worth less than $1).  Now that the market has grown exponentially, it is not susceptible to such spam attacks and one could reasonably argue that the 1 MB block-size limit is now obsolete and leading to network congestion and high fees.

If you mean fees should decline to reasonable levels once the price settles in and the fee I paid last night was abnormal, I truly hope you are right.  I think paying the equivalent of a dollar or so per transaction is tolerable to most people, and certainly makes a transfer of $100 value reasonable.  But if fees are still often running much higher than that after the market settles down, I will be very worried.

It makes perfect sense to you?  Really...?  
OP is supposedly a long term holder and believer in BTC.  He held from back in early 2013 when it was $24, stored it safely on his Trezor for years, held through the Mt Gox collapse, through a 2 year bear market, through all those times China "Banned" Bitcoin and so many 'experts' declared Bitcoin "dead"...he held, and he held, because he believes deeply in BTC.  But then last month some anonymous guys on another sub said Bitcoin is dead and BCH will reign supreme, so in one fell swoop he converts ALL of his BTC (not some, but  ALL of it) to BCH even though he already owned BCH from the HF 8/1 (so he was already hedged, so even if the guys on r/btc were right he would participate in the BCH upside), but despite all of that, because some anonymous guys he does not know on another sub said BTC was dying, OP supposedly dumped ALL of his BTC at the drop of a hat..?  Because of what some guys on reddit posted...? Really...?  And to boot, now that he is invested purely in BCH, he now goes around publicly disparaging the coin he is supposedly invested in?  (Presumably because he wants his investment to fall even further....?)

Somehow they seem to be arguing if we can't be at Visa capacity this instant, we might as well sit at 1 MB with users unable to use BTC at all for the foreseeable future, assuming users worldwide will just wait patiently another year not using BTC at all and no one will flock to BCH, ETH, LTC or Dash in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:27:35
That's my question too.  There is an enormous difference.  You could have bought and sold a few bitcoins in 2013 and it would only have been hundreds of dollars, nothing important.  But if they were to use today's value it would seem like a lot of money.  More importantly, is it per transaction, or accumulated value of transactions?  If it is based on the value at the time and it's 20K per single transaction, then that would cover relatively few people, but if it's based on all transactions combined it would probably cover most people who believed in Bitcoin and began investing early.

You speak as if OP is an innocent child.  If his story is true (and I honestly doubt it, as it doesn't add up, and I'll explain), then he's an investor who made a bad investment decision, not a deceived child.  
Anyone familiar with the history and the recent saga of the on-chain scaling debate willing to read OP's post objectively should reasonably doubt his story.  
If he was truly intelligent enough to hold on to his BTC from early 2013 having bought at $24, he would be much smarter than most investors who could not resist the urge to sell or spend much of their Bitcoins when it rose exponentially in value up to $100, then to $500, to $1100, back down to $400, then down to $200, then back up to $500, $1000, $2000, $5000... you get the drift.  If his story were real he would be the ultimate hodler with the discipline to hold it that long.  It is simply not credible to me that he suddenly went to r/btc and was "tricked" or "seduced" into suddenly divesting all of his BTC and converting to BCH, coincidentally just at the moment BCH hit that peak over $2K.  
To me it is not credible.  No one who was that smart from early 2013 through all the ups &amp; downs, holding through Mt Gox and the fifty times China banned Bitcoin, and all the other issues, smart enough to believe in Bitcoin and hodl through all of that time, would suddenly become stupid enough to divest ALL of it in one fell swoop for another currency, whether BCH or anything else.  All because he was "seduced" supposedly by users on another sub that is disparaged every day on this sub that he is subscribed to and on which he is posting.  It just doesn't add up.  Sorry, but it just seems like a convenient story.

Look I gave you a +1 on another comment, but had to question this.  Anyone who thinks they can buy bitcoin or for that matter any commodity or currency at "90% off" is the same type of person who probably already lost their money in the Ruja Ignatova OneCoin scam, so they probably don't have too much more to lose.  It might sound harsh, but seriously, if we're concerned that someone might confuse a coin with an $18K price with one that has a $2.5K price and a different ticker symbol, I think we might just be overly concerned.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:51:57
This still seems so ambiguous to me.  Does that mean $20K in USD value at the time of the transaction(s), and more importantly, does that mean $20K per transaction at any time (ie. 1 transaction for that amount or higher triggering the release for probable audit), or does that mean $20K in accumulated value?  If it is in accumulated value over 3 years (I read it was 2013-2015 thus 3 years), then that's not even a substantial amount of money for many who have invested steadily over 3 years, so that would be hugely different than a single &gt; $20K transaction triggering it.  I find it odd that none of the articles I read on this subject specified any of that, but it would seem to be important to clarify it.

I was going to create some new BTC paper wallets as gifts but realised it was impractical to do so due to the high tx fees.  Then it hit me that we have a problem if it's economically impractical to send $100 worth of BTC.  That's not a cup of coffee we're talking about.

The bill is not saying it is illegal to buy or own digital currencies.  However it attempts to liken digital currencies to cash, which is already subject to government seizure via civil asset forfeiture if law enforcement authorities "believe" said cash could have been used in some unspecified crime at some point.  The person whose property is seized does not need to be charged with, or convicted of, any crime whatsoever.  To make it worse, state and local law enforecement in the past (this goes back to the 1980s) has had an incentive to seize people's assets because they have been permitted to liquidate those assets and use the funds.  People who have had their cash or property seized include many who were simply transporting cash (not even always more than $10K) and people running cash based businesses (eg. convenience stores, etc) who made regular large cash deposits to their bank accounts.
Edit: The proposed legislation would expand the governments authority in terms of CAF and specifically includes digital currencies, which were not included in prior federal regulations.

So many of us have been advocating for this for a long time, but the core developers are so dead-set against it, it simply will not happen.  Some of them (eg. Luke-Jr) have even maintained that the tiny 1 MB blocksize cap we have now *is too high*, and he has argued we should actually reduce it now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:37
 


Thanks for your post, but I would question that statement.  It seems like allowing the extra capacity in a block when needed means there is no mempool backlog.  On the BCH chain they clean up any pending transactions in the next block, and if they need to mine a block 1.5 MB, 2 MB or 5 MB occasionally then they do it, and it cleans out the mempool so there are no confirmation delays.  
Regarding fees: Someone just sent me BCH because they owed me around $75, and they could not send BTC because the fee would have been around $10 which obviously doesn't work for a small transaction, so they sent me BCH. They paid 5 cents. The BTC fee would have been 200 times more in terms of $.  So whatever opposition you have to BCH is fine, but many of us find it useful for peer to peer electronic cash due to the low fees. I get that BTC is a much higher price asset right now, and I understand that contributes to the $ value fo fees, but that explains only a small part of the differential (BTC is only about 5 times the price of BCH, but the tx fees can be more than 200 times the fees), so the rest of the huge differential in tx fees it seems to me is due to the backed up mempool on the BTC chain. 
PS: You didn't answer the question about the name.  Why is "Ethereum Classic" acceptable to you (in fact you used it as an example of the right way to fork), but the name "Bitcoin Cash" is not acceptable?

I was focusing on the title, and ~~his title was accurate I believe~~ [*Edit: I was focusing on the fact that S. 1241 is in committee and it is a good time to write your senators if you are opposed to it*].  We will have to agree to disagree on the merits of this bill though.  I read through this entire bill last summer, and after reading it I am completely against it, as it will increase the government's discretion vis-a-vis civil asset forfeiture which is already abused in many jurisdictions in this country, and it could (I'm not saying it necessarily would, but it could) embolden government officials in terms of scrutinizing the digital currency holdings or movement of funds of law abiding citizens.  I've never committed a crime in my life, and I do very well, but this is giving unnecessary power to the government, and I disagree that if you are not a criminal you would have nothing to worry about.  Innocent people are detained and even convicted all the time.  Innocent people have even been sentenced to death.  Think about that:  with the supposed burden of full proof of guilt put on prosecution, many innocent people are convicted of crimes they didn't commit, and many serve decades in prison, some on death row.  Add to that CAF abuse wherein law abiding people running cash businesses have had their bank accounts frozen and their money seized by the government (and used by local law enforcement) simply for making regular cash deposits to their bank accounts, which the government deemed "suspicous".  Others have had real estate seized because local law enforcement believed that some illicit activities took place in or on their property, even though the owners were never even charged with any crime.  I just don't think we need to be increasing the propensity for civil asset forfeiture in this country.  It is already bad enough.

So by the way, I assume ~~breadwallet is one of the worst options now~~ and unfortunately that was the mobile wallet I always used in the past ~~(will change that soon)~~ [EDIT: *breadwallet is no worse than any other.*]  The only drawback with breadwallet vs. others is that it offers no options for adjusting the fee or choosing economy options. The real problem is the ridiculous BTC network congestion due to the laughably small 1 MB block-size cap which is preventing us from growing with demand.  I tried Mycelium and although it allows for low priority and economy fees, even the lowest priority now is over $10! The "Normal" fee is around $15.  That was 45 minutes ago, 4 more blocks found, and my transaction I paid $10 for is still sitting there with 0 confirmations.  Sorry, but this is getting out of hand, and I am truly fearful that BTC is going to decline heavily when new adopters realize how inefficient it is for sending funds.  What baffles me is how the current set of core developers does not seem to think this is a problem.  I get that they're hoping to herd the users eventually into their LN project, which their own company controls (Blockstream), but this is just getting so ridiculous with fees and long time periods waiting for confirmation that they are going to kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs.  I think there are multiple other cryptos that are far better, faster, with lower fees that it's only a matter of time before users start migrating over.  We could have fixed this last year or the year before, but we're sitting here with our collective head in the sand and reveling in the recent price surge.  I love the price surge, but then instantly I'm worried that our current high price is a paper tiger about to collapse since our network is so restricted with the tiny 1 MB block-size cap that was instituted back in 2010 as a temporary measure only while the network was in its infancy.  Sorry for venting.  I'm a long term holder like you I think, but I'm starting to lose confidence because the thing that drew me to bitcoin in the first place was its utility.  It is losing that utility in large part, and that's making me nervous as hell.  I just had to vent and since we had some posts on fees I came here to vent.  :(

This is ironic, because I did not even read the editorialized content to which you refer.  I made my post today based on reading the actual text from S. 1241 months ago.  S. 1241 proposes to amend Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, adding the words "digital currencies" after "money orders" in a clause that included "cash" from the existing Title 31 regulations.  That is why I said it likens digital currencies to cash.  Some of the relevant text is below, directly from S. 1241 (not from anyone's editorial):
SEC. 13. PREPAID ACCESS DEVICES, DIGITAL CURRENCIES, OR OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.
(a) In General.—Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended—
(1) in paragraph (2)(K)—
(A) by inserting “prepaid access devices, digital currency,” after “money orders,”; and
(B) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: “, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency”;
(2) in paragraph (3)(B), by inserting “prepaid access devices,” after “delivery,”; and
(3) by adding at the end the following:
Edit: My concern with S. 1241 is that it would embolden government vis-a-vis civil asset forfeiture, and I believe civil asset forfeiture is often abused, and is already immoral IMO and should be abolished.  Any legislation which expands government power in this regard is bad in my opinion.

I agree in part with your point, but it's not quite accurate to say most blocks are less than 100kb, and I'm not sure about all the blocks being from the "roger/Jihan clan", but whatever.  It does seem a majority of BCH blocks are below 500kb, but with some over 1 MB.  I have seen several in the past over 2 MB.  3 of the last 10 blocks are &gt; 1 MB and 2 of those 3 were &gt; 1.9 MB, and it looks like 7 out of the last 20 blocks (35%) are over 1 MB (several close to 2 MB).  
In any case, I feel we could use more capacity in the blocks to relieve BTC congestion.

Sorry, but this story just isn't credible.  It does not add up. If you were disciplined enough to hodl BTC from early 2013 until a month ago, through Mt. Gox, through the 2 year bear market and all the ups &amp; downs, you did it because you believed in BTC.  It just doesn't make sense that you hop over to a sub that is trashed and disparaged by users on this sub every day, and suddenly you are "seduced" into converting ALL of your BTC (not some, but ALL of it) to BCH, putting all of your eggs in one basket.  Sorry, but good try. 
You appear to have gotten a lot of users on this sub to believe this story you presented, so congratulations.
Edit:  If your story were true, and it clearly is not, but if you were now 100% invested in BCH and had no BTC left to your name, you would not be publicly disparaging BCH in an attempt to bring the value down, as that would obviously be against your financial interests.

Who said we need to be at PayPal capacity right now...?  That is a non-sequitur.  We need relief from the backlogged mempool and high tx fees, and an increase to 4 MB or 8 MB cap will do that.  The mempool is so backed up now it might even take a few days to clear out, but it would clear it out soon and we would be back to normal which would buy time for eventually implementing LN.

If they have come out and admitted they were mistaken in their insistence on sticking to the 1 MB blocksize limit, I have not seen it.  There have been so many warnings for the past 2 years that what is happening right before our eyes right now would in fact happen if the network were to remain constrained by the 1 MB blocks as the user base grows, but they have always rejected calls for a simple clean block-size limit increase.  Two years ago I supported Bitcoin Classic, a straight, clean increase from 1 MB to 2 MB.  Greg Maxwell responded to me that the 2 MB block-size limit would lead to "centralization" as mining would be concentrated in the hands of a few miners with large machines.  Obviously I disagree and don't see any evidence that is the case.  In fact, we could go to a 16 MB or 32 MB block size limit and still have tens of thousands of nodes around the world.  I'm sure Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Back, Mr Todd and others should by now be at least a bit concerned, but I have not seen any comments from them indicating they have changed their position.

They did get mine resolved, and they even offered to credit my account the $ amount of the BTC network fee I lost.  They have decent customer service but it might take a couple of days.  Their chat personnel are not good at all, at least not when it comes to Bitcoin.  Somehow their customer service reps who do the chat support don't even seem to know what Bitcoin is or how it works, which is a shame.  Their CEO is very Pro-Bitcoin. 
One thing I have learned: whenever paying an online merchant directly with Bitcoin, you are better off using your Coinbase account if you have one.  I have done that and found it worked immediately.  When you use your mobile wallet to scan their QR code, it seems to fail sometimes, and it sounds like what happens is the order times out before confirming, so when the payment is later confirmed by the network, your funds are gone but the merchant's system does not see or recognize the payment, until a customer support manager looks into it later.  Email them the tx # and I'm sure they will handle it for you.

Surely you can't be serious...?  Or did you just mis-type this?  Due to the small 1 MB cap on the block-size the mempool has been backlogged for months, and many users have their transactions delayed in the mempool for days before confirmation, and sometimes if the fee is low enough they are never confirmed.  How do you propose to argue that the 1 MB cap "*propagates transactions on the network faster*"...?  That is simply untrue.  If you had a 2 MB cap instead of 1 MB the blocks would still be mined and propagated to the network as fast, but double the transactions would be confirmed in each block, and it would at least provide some relief in terms of the mempool backlog.

Ok, I get that.  I am totally fine that LN is in the works and hopefully coming soon as an option for users.  But my concern is why was there so much heavy resistance to a modest block-size limit increase to relieve the congestion and the high fee problem in the near term (especially since LN is not ready yet)?  My concern would be if the LN developers wanted fees to be higher and delays longer in the near term to force users into LN when it is ready.  That would be unethical in my opinion.  A much better solution would have been a clean HF to a modest block-size increase to alleviate the mempool backlog and keep tx fees reasonable enough so that we can still use BTC as electronic cash, still give it away as gifts to relatives, and/or still move funds between wallets without getting hit with tx fees so high that small transactions are uneconomical or even virtually impossible for transfers less than $50-100.

Spot on.  I'm tired of hearing people claim that an increase in block size to 8 MB would lead to centralization of mining and eliminate nodes. That's just false.  You could have just as many nodes as you have today with an 8 MB block-size, which would buy years of a far superior user experience with low tx fees and fast confirmations.  That would allow for years to work on LN or any 2nd layer sidechains of interest, without crippling the network in the meantime.

Selling or trading an asset, stock, Bitcoin etc a taxable event (capital gains on the appreciation in value).  Buying it in the first place does not.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:53:19
You only pay capital gains tax when you realize a gain.  If you buy and hold, and the value goes up, you don't pay taxes on it (yet), but when you eventually sell, even if it's years down the road, you would pay tax based on the total appreciation over your original cost.  Can you imagine if you had to pay CGT on your bitcoin gains this year (2017), and then the market were to plummet next year after you paid those taxes?  I don't think the government would be paying you back all those taxes you paid for 2017.  That would be grossly unfair.

Agreed, but do you really believe having a 8 MB or even 16 MB block size limit would mean you would only have "100 big nodes" worldwide?  That is simply not true.  There would still be tends of thousands of nodes worldwide. You could still run a node in your home if the block-size limit were raised to that level, and such an increase would alleviate the huge backlog in the BTC mempool and would lead to lower, more reasonable tx fees.

Back in 2014 and 2015 most people I knew had heard of Bitcoin, but most either assumed it to be a fraud of some sort, or would say they heard it was "a ponzi scheme".  (That still baffles me.  People who say that either have no clue what a ponzi scheme actually is, or they completely misunderstand Bitcoin and think it is a company or a centralized organization that is taking people's money when they buy bitcoins). 
Here's the thing:  This has completely changed in the past year.  Beginning early 2017 I noticed Bitcoin was finally getting positive media coverage, and with increasing frequency.  Now everyone I know seems to know about it, and none of them are asking if it's "a ponzi scheme" or anything like that.

Personally I don't like the tax plan but the 1 trillion is spread across 10 years, which is really nothing.  In Obama's first term, with Democrats in solid control of both houses &amp; a 60 seat Senate, they passed the biggest spending budgets in US history adding over 1 Trillion to the deficit every year from 2009 to 2012.  The increase in the total accumulated National Debt in those 4 years was larger than at any point in our history.  The annual deficits only started declining in the 2nd term after Republicans gained control of congress and forced the sequester.  My main point is that the same people now complaining about an estimated 1 trillion spread across 10 years are, for the most part, the people who were absolutely fine with running annual deficits of over $1 Trillion each and every year, ie. more than 10 times what this tax plan would add.

Just curious if I read this correctly, or if maybe you did not mean to write it quite this way.  Do you actually believe that in 5 years your bitcoin investment will *most likely* be worth zero?  Just seems odd for a long term holder. I would hope that we all feel there is a greater than 50/50 chance Bitcoin will succeed and still hold value in 5 years (hopefully higher value than today).

They are able to clear it because they mine larger blocks when needed to clear it.  They could handle BTC's current volume because they allow for up to 8 MB blocks as needed, and their tx fees would still be lower than current BTC tx fees.

Ok, then how about people making $20/day, or $50/day, or even $100/day...?  Are they also not supposed to find Bitcoin useful for payments?  I made 2 BTC transfers today, one cost me $9.50 and the other cost me $3.75.  I made these within 2 minutes of each other.  the $9.50 one was first, and that was the "standard" service (est. next 6 blocks) not the priority service which would have cost me $18.  Ironically the one for $3.75 went through right away.  But the point is, spending some highly variable amount ranging from $3 - $18 per transfer is just not economical for most people, and even people in the world making $50 - $100/day probably are not going to find this useful as peer to peer electronic cash, which is what Bitcoin was originally designed to be.

Could you explain this?  BCH has 8 MB block-size limit, transaction confirmations come quickly and it costs only 2 - 3 cents per transfer, as opposed to $10-$15.  Seems very practical.  I'm just curious why you think 8 MB would not be enough.  I think that would be *more* than enough for quite some time.  It would completely relieve our mempool backlog and fees would decline significantly, making BTC practical again to use for payments as it was before.

You can still gift anyone bitcoin, and you can still do so using Coinbase if you use that wallet service.  In fact Coinbase allows you to send it to anyone (even if that person does not have a wallet set up yet).  All you do is send bitcoin from your wallet to their email address.  That person will get an email that advises them you sent them bitcoin.  They click on the link in the email and Coinbase walks them through opening a basic wallet which takes less than 1 minute.  It does not require you do link to a bank account or anything like that (which takes longer).  A basic wallet can be set up in less than 1 minute, so you could send it to a nephew or cousin or someone who doesnt yet have a wallet.

Correct.  If account holders were simply credited with the BCH to which they were entitled at the time of the HF, they could have sent that BCH anywhere, to any other wallet, for pennies.  As Bitmex converted to BTC without the account holders agreement, the same account holders will get stuck paying higher tx fees to move those funds.  
Having said that, what so many others posted here is 100% correct:  account holders could have and should have withdrawn their funds from exchanges prior to Aug 1 to control their own keys.  By leaving them on the exchange, they are giving that exchange total control.

If you're truly concerned with including people in developing countries in the bitcoin community, how do you reconcile that with keeping a 1 MB block-size which has caused a backlog and tx fees often exceeding $20 per transfer, which is more than what most people in developing countries make in an entire day?  How are the less affluent to be included in our community if tx fees are so high BTC is unusable for them?

F/X exchange rates vary all over the map depending on where you exchange.  On my most recent trip to the EU my cc charges they charged me 2.5% for exchange conversion, but as another user pointed out, they should be lower than that if you are careful.  I was not as careful as I should have been &amp; after checking I overpaid on that particular card.  Market makers in F/X could work on less than 1% spread as its a near perfect market.  Having said that, if you exchange at an airport or retail bank location you could pay a huge margin (often &gt; 20%).  My initial point was that there is always a cost to exchange currencies as there is exchanging any commodities wherein you need market makers to buy/sell and they have to make a margin to do so.
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:52:54
I travel in a lot of countries, and I think one thing you're forgetting is the currency exchange cost.  You have the option to do your cc payments in USD or in the currency of the country you're visiting, but either way you pay a certain bid-offer spread margin.  It's usually worse to pay in USD, so when I'm in Europe I do my cc payments in EUR, but I still get hit with approx 2.5% on the exchange, which is actually reasonably small for a bid-offer spread on currencies but is still a cost you must consider.  (When the merchant offers the USD charge option, it is always done at a higher price than what would be the central exchange rate).
Edit: I believe OP had mentioned the attraction to many people of one currency accepted everywhere.  If Starbucks, a merchant with stores in dozens of countries, accepts bitcoin, I believe that would indeed be attractive to many people and offer an incentive to some new users to download a mobile wallet &amp; keep some BTC on it, knowing they have the ability to spend it at those retail locations.

You might have misunderstood.  Most people using their credit cards to pay for things overseas choose to charge in the currency of their home country (in my case USD), and if I did choose the USD option on my overseas purchases, I would also not pay any transaction fee.  The fee I  pay is because they are exchanging a currency.  If I pay for a transaction in EUR, the bank issuing my card has to convert to USD, and actually 2.5% is lower than what most banks charge to convert currencies.  If you are an American and you choose the USD option when purchasing overseas, you might think you are paying no transaction fees, but you actually are paying, it is simply disguised.  The merchants are not converting at the central rate, they have a built in % to cover the f/x spread. 
Edit: think of it this way: The USA bank needing to convert USD &gt; EUR to cover my purchases cannot buy EUR without paying at least a small % to market makers willing to exchange with them at any given time. The next time you are overseas and you use your credit card, you might notice the merchant will hand you the pad to sign with a USD total due (you can choose USD or the local currency). If you do the math on any specific purchase, you will find the USD amount does not correspond exactly to the amount it would be based on the central market f/x rate on that day.  It will be higher.  I have checked that with specific examples in many countries at many different times and the USD option via cc is always a bit higher of a price than what it theoretically should be. In short: exchanging currencies always costs something, whether people notice it or not.

Because it does not seem like a currency that should be one of three accepted, when the other two are the top two currencies worldwide, and this 'electroneum' fork of XMR (now I know thanks to the redditors above) is probably ranked around ~~150th~~ in market cap. *[Edit: just looked it up, it's currently 48th in market cap]*  
It just seems to me this billboard itself IS an advertisement for Electroneum.  Someone heavily invested in it and made this ad specifically to promote it by listing it as if it were a major coin or an up &amp; coming coin to peak the interest of viewers and to entice others to invest in it.  That's my guess, for whatever it's worth (probably very little :) or less than the value of 1 electroneum coin)

After reading the top reply and many replies below, I believe some newcomers might get the very mistaken impression that Bitcoin Cash, or Bitcoin Gold or other forks had something to do with increasing the total supply of Bitcoins.  That is obviously not the case.  Not sure why people keep mentioning increasing the 21 Million limit as if that were something advocated by others in the Bitcoin community or in the BCH or BTG communities.  I have been following this for 5 years and haven't heard anyone at all in the Bitcoin community (or among those who forked off ) promoting any increase in the total supply.  I would think that such a proposal would be so unpopular, at least at this time, it would be laughable, and would certainly not gain consensus.

Sadly, you're probably right.  We've had such a good run recently with positive media attention and a price that seems to only go up or briefly settle, but let's not forget how easy a target Bitcoin is, and how eager many people will be to disparage it given an opportunity.

Yes, if anything.  Some people seem to have the misconception that investors taking a short position on an asset actually makes that asset lose value.  That is not the case.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:09:05
True, however the short-seller would actually borrow the same asset in order to sell it, and would have to buy the asset later in order to pay back the loan.  You are correct they believe the asset will go down; my point is simply that their *bet* that it will go down will not actually make the asset go down.  In any case, OP was right, those investors who spend time on air bashing Bitcoin should put some of their money behind their statements, but I highly doubt they will.

It's an excellent question, and I don't think Shark Tank would exclude a bitcoin startup on the basis of it being too esoteric.  If such a startup gets on the show it will undoubtedly be very positive exposure for bitcoin, and hopefully educational for viewers.

No, you could not.  OneCoins have never been freely convertible back to any hard currency, nor to bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies.

I'm guessing that soon enough psychologists will begin using onecoiners as case studies for some sort of analysis of defective human psychology, wanting to believe something, investing time or money into that thing, and then reinforcing the belief at all costs and shutting out evidence contradicting what they originally believed.  It is truly sad watching this scam and knowing new people every day are buying into it.
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:34:06
Incorrect.  If you increased the max block size to 8 MB, the new blocks would not all be full; to the contrary you would have blocks with varying MB but most would be well under that amount.  Secondly, all the blocks to date (for the past 8 years) have been less than 1 MB, and for most of that history the blocks were well under 1 MB, and that is most of the blockchain you would be downloading if you wanted to run a full node.

Obviously a good move as such a large amount on an exchange is a risk.  But I am confused about your post as you made several references to having to download the entire blockchain to keep your own wallet.  Even without electrum, you do not need to do that.  You could just generate paper wallets and keep them in your safe.

You will always find that the exchanges that list lower rates of USD /BTC (prime example is btc-e which is invariably USD 20-30 below the average rate or a good average indicator) do not accept USD, so it's not a real rate.  It's easy to list a low rate when you don't actually have to honor the rate because you're not accepting the currency you are quoting.

I think it's amazing I've gotten downvoted for stating a very simple mathematical fact:  If you were to increase the allowed block size limit 5X it would simply NOT take 5 x longer to download the blockchain.  That is a simple fact.  The OP said if you increased 8X it would take 8 times longer.  False.  Sorry if it offended you or anyone else to state a simple fact.

A good response to what he said regarding the iphone, how does he verify OneCoin actually "works"?  An iphone obviously works as you can use it to make calls, email, text, check news, whatever.  How does OneCoin "work" for him?  Can he use it to buy things?  Do people accept it as payment for goods/services?  Can he trade it freely on exchanges thus verifying the imputed value stated by the Onecoin operators?  He is telling himself it "works" but most likely has no objective evidence it is working at all.

2.7% is a relatively high percentage.  I get that 0.27 is not much money because this was a tiny transaction, but the point is we should not be satisfied with paying nearly 3% in fees to send bitcoin.  That's what merchants pay to accept credit cards for payments, and the consumers making the purchases do not pay directly.  I don't think bitcoin will grow in popularity if users are expected to shell out 2.7% when making a payment.  They will prefer to stick with using credit cards.
@_date: 2016-03-10 03:29:13
Gavin and Mike Hearn sure did contribute.  They, along with so many others in the industry, including Coinbase of course, Xapo and other companies believe we need a larger block size limit to account for the growing number of bitcoin transactions.  What gives them the right to voice their concerns, you ask?  They have every right, as do all of the players in the industry and the miners.  Most people would consider this a real issue.  Maybe you don't, but I think it's fair to say most people do think it's real.
@_date: 2016-01-03 00:06:29
Yes, if you were lucky enough not to have to pay the electricity, you would eventually recoup your cost because you would have a continuing stream of incoming BTC (however small) without any operating expense, so eventually your income would exceed whatever you paid.  The length of time required to become profitable would be highly variable depending on (a) what you paid for the miner, (b) the market value of BTC, and (c) the difficulty which re-sets based on the hashrate (not to mention the next reward halving).
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:22:07
Ok, thanks.  Paper wallets might be good for you (if you dont get a Trezor).  You can download a wallet generator, take your computer offline, print some paper wallets, then keep them in your safe (should always be locked up).

Arbitrage would immediately erase any significant difference in rate quotes.

Probably true, especially given the balance of power in our government.  Unless the Democrats win back both houses, it's not likely he could implement much of what he is proposing anyway.  As Hillary pointed out correctly, even when Democrats controlled both houses, and had the 60 vote majority in the Senate to invoke cloture, they still could not get a single-payer universal health care bill passed, so they sent for Obamacare.  Even with the majority in both houses but if they only had 59 seats in the Senate, they would not have even passed Obamacare.  What scares me about Sanders is that he is not as realistic or sensible as Obama or Clinton.  At least Obama had the good sense not to spike taxes to ultra high rates when his own party did have complete control  He could have, but he and his advisers knew that doing so would wreck the economy, so to his credit he refrained for 3 years, then enacted a moderate tax increase to avoid disrupting the economic recovery.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:18:47
Sanders could potentially be the worst of any candidate in either party vis-a-vis bitcoin, because of all candidates he is the one who is in favor of far more government size and control across the board.

The purpose of an ETF would be to facilitate investment by mutual funds, etc.  To date investment funds cannot effectively invest in bitcoin; this ETF would have been the vehicle.

Right now, at the current market value and current difficulty, if you buy an Antminer S3 on eBay for around $130 which seems to be the going rate, it will take you 5.6 months to recoup your money if you are not paying the electricity.  That figure will vary based on the BTC market price and difficulty, but if you leave it running long enough you will always recoup your cost eventually.  That was the OP's original question.
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:31:10
Wrong.  If you are paying no electricity at all, there is no such thing as obsolete, because your energy costs to operate it can never exceed the revenue from the incoming BTC to your account.  BTC will be coming into your account from the mining, at at a certain point your revenue will exceed what you spent to buy the miner.  Miners only become obsolete when their efficiency renders them unprofitable based on the current market value, but that only applies if you have the operating expense of the electricity.  Take that out of the equation and it changes everything.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:39:15
Ok, I respect what you are saying, but it seems to me the riskiness comes from lack of consensus.  A hard fork would be cleaner if there is near universal consensus.  Seg-wit is just a temporary fix, it would not resolve anything long term.  A clean change to 2 MB block size would be a longer lasting solution.  Best wishes in any case, and thanks for your reply above.

That's easy.  You can pay money to someone anywhere in the world instantly and it's free or virtually free of charge.  Paying someone via Western Union or bank wire transfers is more expensive.  Sending someone a manual check is more of a hassle, and internationally it's not even feasible.  If I have a freind travelling in Europe and I owed him $20- and he asks me for it, with bitcoin I can send it to him instantly at no cost.  If I were to wire him the money the intl wire fee would exceed the value of what I needed to send him, so would not be practical.  Also, bitcoin is inherently anti-inflationary, so the longer it stands the test of time, it will be a better store of value than fiat currency which can be printed in limitless supply, and likely will be over-printed to account for staggering national debts in Western countries.

Love it.  Got my card a month ago and have used it everywhere.  I just swipe it like my regular credit cards, and then I get an email notification instantly that the vendor processed a charge to my account (nice service). Never had any issue except one small thing.  Oddly, a few of the charges that came through my account were 15% higher than the actual purchase, but then within 24 hours a credit comes through back into my account tied in with the same merchant name.  That's happened 4 times. Not a big deal at all but just not sure why it's happening.  Still I love spending btc from my coinbase wallet just by swiping a card. I highly recommend it.

Bernie Sanders ideals are completely antithetical to freedom.  He is a quintessential egalitarian, which is  incompatible with freedom.  He is deluding his supporters to believe that those few wealthier Americans who did eventually renounce citizenship somehow avoided their tax obligations.  They did not.  They paid very high taxes while they were citizens, and then on top of that they each paid a large amount of exit tax.  It's safe to say they did not take lightly the decision to renounce as they have forfeited their USA passports and forfeited right of re-entry into their mother country.  If Sanders were to win, and if the Democrats were to re-gain control of congress, and if the top marginal tax rates were to rise to 60-65% (remember many are paying 9-10% state income tax on top of that) I think you will see tens of thousands of other Americans renouncing their citizenship, and with very good reason.

I believe it would cause an increase in demand.  There would definitely be an influx of institutional investors and funds buying the ETF, and these institutions and funds were not able previously to invest in BTC due to fact that there was no vehicle on the major exchanges to do so.  The only way demand would not increase would be if they covered all of the incoming ETF investments with their own private BTC holdings, and it's not clear to me that is their intention.

We do know.  The major exchanges and wallet services, including but not limited to Coinbase, Bitstamp, &amp; Circle have already announced their support for Bitcoin Classic.  As far as nodes go, nodes and mining pools are not mutually exclusve.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 02:55:33
If you're just starting out, the easiest way is to open an online wallet with Coinbase or another wallet service (there are many).  With Coinbase you can link to your bank account, and then just buy bitcoin whenever you want.  If you're only storing small amounts of BTC any online wallet service should be o.k.  Once you get into larger savings you should consider using paper wallets or otherwise control your own private keys for the bulk of your savings.

@_date: 2016-01-24 20:24:19
Good post.  Arguments against Classic often focus on a presumed concern for a decline in the number of nodes, and imply that any reduction in the number of operating nodes would therefore mean Bitcoin would be more centralized.  There are thousands of nodes in operation, and with a reasonable block size increase to 2 MB there would still be thousands of nodes, and Bitcoin would still be decentralized.

I have checked all of the major exchanges and not one of them is down, so not sure what you're talking about.  Mt.

Fair point and possibly true (upvoted you), but it's also likely Mike Hearn was speaking out of understandable frustration at the intransigence of some, including those who paid some Russian hacker to seek out computers downloading XT and mess them up.  Hearn was right in his assertion that Block size capacity will have to be increased.  He wanted XT to either win or fail by democratic means; his frustration that it failed is understandable given the activities of the hackers scaring people away from it.  He felt it was not given a fair chance.

Download a wallet generator to your computer. Then take your computer off-line. Be sure you have no internet connection.  Then open the wallet generator, move your mouse randomly, and it will generate a random public-private key pair for you. Do not save that onto your computer, unless you're using a computer that never has internet connection. Instead you could either save it to a flash drive that you plan to keep secure, or don't save it at all, and instead simply print it out using a hard-wired printer.  Then keep the paper wallet safe &amp; secure and be sure the part that says "private key" you keep covered.  Ideally if you're planning just hold it for long term storage, laminate it or fold it so the keys are hidden and put it into a zip-lock, and then keep in a safe or SD box and don't expose it until you're ready to sweep /spend it.
For actual use, it's better to use a mobile wallet (eg. breadwallet), or if you are holding some value of any significance, then a hardware wallet, like a Trezor or Ledger Nano.  You can easily use a mobile wallet to scan the private key of your paper wallet, sweeping all the funds into your mobile wallet, which is secure &amp; easy to use for spending.

Paper wallets are far from the worst way to *store* coins.  Keeping coins on any exchange is far worse.  Regarding paper wallets, as long as you generate them carefully offline, do not reveal the private keys to anyone, and protect them well in a very safe place, they may not be the best solution, but they are far from the worst solution for long-term storage.

Fair enough explanation, however since there is now close to 75% consensus in favor of Bitcoin Classic, why would there be 2 competing chains...?  I think we all agree and hope 2 competing chains does not happen, but why would the core devs not get behind the nearly 75% already supporting Classic?  That move would help sway any undecideds and we might get 100% or near 100% consensus which means just one chain and one currency.

You misunderstand.  Mutual Funds cannot and do not invest directly in bitcoins, but the ETF would have provided that vehicle.  If the ETF kept the bitcoins backing it in cold storage they would be secure.  At the very least they would not be subject to loss such as the case of Mt. Gox or another exchange going bankrupt, and that was the point to which I responded.  You should really go back and read all the posts.

Be prepared for a big drop though if the SEC denies the ETF.  I'm still bullish long term, but I'm prepared for a significant drop in value if it's denied, and personally I will use that as a buying opportunity to accumulate more before it starts its gradual ascent after the drop.  I'm predicting if denied the price could temporarily drop to $700 or even lower as many recent investors are not long term holders like us, but speculators gambling on the odds of approval.

*"You just gave them a bunch of work to do to before they can receive and spend their money"*
1. It's not really a lot of work.  Downloading a mobile wallet &amp; writing down your recovery seed wouldn't take all that long. Once you do that, it takes only seconds to use your mobile wallet to scan the private key on the paper wallet and import those funds.
2. Spending a few minutes, or even a few hours, to learn about Bitcoin now will most likely prove very beneficial to you years down the road.
Edit: After 5 years on reddit, I can honestly say this is one of the more surprising times to receive a barrage of down-votes on this post.  I simply said that downloading a mobile wallet is not a lot of work, and that learning about Bitcoin might help people long term, and for that I get a hoard of down-votes.  I wouldn't have thought this to be such a controversial post.

Sorry, but you must have the wrong year.  You could not have CPU mined Bitcoin in 2013, not even in 2012 for that matter.  And to mine 4-5 BTC per day in 2013 you would have needed a lot of ASICs.

It sounds like you would prefer that OP hadn't left any tip at all.
Bitcoin was first traded for goods/services just shy of 9 years ago. Today, it is worth more than 500,000 times what it was worth when it was first traded.  In 2010 it took 10,000 BTC to buy 2 pizzas, valuing it at less than a penny per BTC. Today 1 single BTC is worth approx $4,000 and actually more, because you would have to add the value of forks like BCH, BTG, BTD, BSV that you would also own had you simply held onto BTC and not spent it at all.
If you had $10 worth of BTC in 2010 and simply held onto it, that $10 would today be worth over $5,000,000.  That's not a typo.  That's real: over $5 Million. And that's true today after the market decline in BTC value over the past 15 months (it was worth over $20 MM 15 months ago).
So it appears you're upset about a guy who left a tip of BTC worth $10.  My recommendation is not to disparage him and complain bitterly that he left the tip, but instead, take a few minutes to read about Bitcoin.  If you still think it's not for you, that's fine, just ignore it, and if you really hate that he gave you the $10 BTC tip then just give it away to someone else.

Nice thought to tell someone who gave you a tip to "go f--k themselves".  That's pleasant.
You don't have to "keep track" of anything.  If you just download a mobile wallet app you can scan the private key on the paper wallet he gave you and keep the funds on your mobile wallet.  You can just forget about it for years if you want, or forever, or just give it to someone else and do nothing.  No need to be bitter.

As an individual investor you are better off just buying your own bitcoin directly.  An approved ETF would bring in a flood of investment $ from all kinds of funds that until now cannot invest (at least not practically speaking) as they are limited to SEC approved funds.  The increase in demand for bitcoin would very likely lead to a surge in price, thus benefiting anyone who is holding bitcoin prior to the ETF approval.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:00:43
20-30% chance of approval is what most people factored in.  I'm slightly more optimistic only because it's getting within a few days of the deadline, and I thought by now they would have advised the Winklevoss brothers so that they could withdraw their application rather than be denied.  Since that has not happened, the chances of approval might have improved, but then again, maybe not...  I think the reason the price is surging is that people think the upside of approval is going to be larger than the downside if it is denied, so they are speculating with purchasing BTC

Paper wallets are an excellent option for cold storage imo for long-term savings.  You just print them offline and put them in your safe.  You have the private key so you don't need anything else. Using other options, you would need to hand-write your recovery seed, and you would need to keep that hand-written seed in your safe anyway.  It takes longer to write down the words in a recovery seed than to print a paper wallet.  So anyway that's one reason someone might prefer the simplicity and security of a paper wallet in their safe.
  EDIT: Obviously what I wrote above pertains to long term savings only.  Paper wallets are not as good as a vehicle for transferring or spending.  I use them purely for the bitcoin I want to save long term.

People can see what is in each wallet address, but if you use an online wallet service like coinbase, they will not know the amount you have in your account, because the online wallet services move funds around and often sweep out the wallets, so when you login to your account with that service you will see the BTC balance in your account, but that same amount will not likely appear if you search for your wallet on blockchain.info.  If you use a mobile wallet, or a paper wallet for storage, and if you gave your wallet address to someone, they could see the balance in your wallet.

  *"Are you implying Bitcoin is a better store of value, having lost 80%+ of its value three times, dropping by as much as 20% in one day?"*
Bitcoin to date at least has proven itself a far better store of value than any fiat currency, whether your starting point is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.....or 10 years ago to today. True, if you look at its value over the last 12-18 months, it has not been. You cherry-picked a time and said it "lot 80% of its value", but you are conspicuously silent on the fact that 1 BTC today is worth more than 400,000 times what it was worth just 9 years ago against the USD /EUR.

Personally, I feel if you want to hold gold/precious metals, you should keep it in a safe.  Letting some company hold your physical asset defeats the purpose of investing in it in the first place.  Precious metals are a good hedge against many uncertainties, but in order for it to have that value, you need to actually have it, not just an account number with a company.

I was one of the earlier users to post on your thread last night, and I got down-voted to hell for simply implying it might be worth a few minutes to download a mobile wallet to sweep the paper wallet, and God forbid, take a bit more time to learn about Bitcoin.  I received bitter replies and lots of down-votes. Makes you wonder why those people are even on r/Bitcoin in the first place if they are so opposed to learning anything about it.

You can change your phone and you would still have your funds.  If you took half the time you have spent already trolling on r/Bitcoin to simply learn something about how Bitcoin wallets work, you would already know that.  All you need to do is keep your recovery seed and you can restore your wallet on any new phone you buy.  
Once again, if you can't be bothered with it, then don't bother.  If someone leaves you a tip that you really don't want, don't keep it. Just give it away to a co-worker or to anyone else.

*&gt; "A sudden rise in price does not make it a good store of value."*
Do you consider 9 years "sudden"?  It is a relatively short time, true, but even in this sluggish bear market, even after losing almost 80% of value from its ATH 15 months ago, 1 BTC today is still worth approx. 400,000 times what it was 9 years ago when it was first used in a transaction to buy goods/services.  It's difficult for me to understand how some people do not find that impressive.

Fair point, however the problem with this company (Bitgold) is that they had no problem accepting his funds.  They simply don't want to release the funds to him.  If they were an honest company and subject to regulatory pressure, why didn't they ask him for such proof of source of funds before accepting his deposit in the first place?  Had they done that, fine.  They didn't.

As of 481842 they seem to be finding blocks at a normal rate: last 10 blocks found in 83 minutes, so if anything it's still a bit faster than "normal".  In other words, a decent amount of hash-rate is still behind them.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:50:05
Easiest solution: just download a mobile wallet (eg. breadwallet) on your phone, and when you have it all set up, just use your new mobile wallet to scan the private key QR code on the paper wallet to import those funds.  Always clean it out entirely (the paper wallet).  Never retain funds in any wallet where you have used the private key.

Sounds odd.  Best of luck dealing with them.  I wasn't familiar with Bbitgold but just looked at their site.  If the concept is that your deposit is tied to gold, I would think it far more advisable to just buy gold bullion and hold it yourself (in a safe, or a safety deposit box).  Many precious metals dealers accept bitcoin for payment, so next time you want to convert BTC to gold/silver you could just buy some online and pay with your bitcoin.  Then you control your own precious metals.

Thanks for posting.  I appreciate your time.  Interesting point, but it seems to relate to unlimited block size (eg "remove the constraint on capacity"), and I certainly am not advocating for that.  Nor have I seen proponents of Classic (or XT before it) advocating for unlimited block size, but rather for a block-size limit larger than 1 MB, as does Segwit effectively (and I'm in favor of that). My main concern with the 1 MT block size is that transaction fees might go up to high too fast.  We all understand that years down the road as block rewards are halved again and again, transaction fees will become more important than the block rewards in rewarding miners, and that's perfectly ok.  My hope is for that to occur after there is greater and more widespread adoption.  Speaking as a businessman with experience dealing with banks and their fees and paperwork, what attracted me to bitcoin years ago was that it was a way to transmit payment immediately and directly to anyone anywhere in the world, at virtually no cost.  Bitcoin is still in its early years.  If it is going to survive and thrive as I hope, it will need to appeal to a wider range of people.  Probably &gt; 98% of the population doesn't know what it is and maybe still doesn't care. My hope would be for increased adoption and use worldwide before fees become large enough to dissuade new users from acquiring bitcoin and using it.  Back to your point, I would agree that unlimited block size could create a problem, but I did not think that a modest block-size increase was the same as unlimited block size, and I think everyone is in agreement the 21 MM cap must stay.  
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:13:06

For anyone thinking that ApplePay and other mobile payments will make Bitcoin obsolete, or for those in the banking industry saying something along the lines of 'Blockchain Not Bitcoin', this post demonstrates why Bitcoin will always be vital.

@_date: 2017-01-23 15:46:04
Agree completely.  I am not a BU proponent either, but then again I am repulsed by all these reactionary posts implying that the 21 MM cap on BTC supply is somehow related to the block-size debate.  It is not.  Having a view about raising the block-size limit in no way implies any view about changing the 21 MM cap, and I don't know anyone on either side of the block-size debate in favor or raising the 21 MM cap.

@_date: 2017-08-22 22:44:59
Exactly.  The past 3 weeks since the HF feel like the best ever to me.  The combined value of BTC + BCH is far higher than it was before the HF.  BTC rose even higher after a great year already, and the added value of BCH is just a bonus the way I see it.  I'm hodling both.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:20:35
Agree totally.  I don't find it very ironic.  ViaBTC still has a majority of its hash power on BTC, but they allow for miners to choose to mine BCH.  I don't think anyone at ViaBTC complained about their block rejected by the BCH chain; it is working the way it is supposed to for both chains.  Peter Todd was just talking smack with his ridiculous "eat your own dig food" comment, as are so many people these days.  Everyone should just calm down and position their investments the way they see fit, and stop denigrating others.

I've read thousands of posts on the block-size debate and I haven't seen anyone posting on either side of the block-size debate advocating for removal of the 21 MM cap.  Furthermore the the matter of the block-size limit is in no way connected to removing the 21 MM cap on BTC supply.  So where are these "many" big blockers to whom you referred?

Try using breadwallet and see what happens.  breadwallet will charge a fee of more than 10 times that for the same amount OP sent today. Everyone on this sub has been boasting of low fees, but that totally depends on the wallet you use.  I have always used breadwallet in the past but I am going to have to make a change.  They offer no option as far as I can see to set a lower fee, and they automatically set ridiculously high fees, so even if the mempool is cleaned out and transactions are fast overall, users are still getting fleeced with high fees on many wallets.
Edit:  I feel like a wet-blanket today.  Here we are at a new ATH and it is truly exciting to think of where Bitcoin can take us, and I'm complaining that I spent $5 in fees to move some out of my breadwallet.  I don't mean to make too much of it, it's just that I always hoped for mainstream adoption and I do believe that most people will be less than impressed if they have to spend $5 to move money around, as they can do ACH payments via banking system for less.  Having fees like this far in the future shouldn't be a problem, but we are in the infancy stage of adoption.

I doubt it was an exchange as we would think of one today.  As I understand it, back in 2010 users would exchange with each other directly.  My assumption is that some users built sites and posted offers of BTC for sale, and maybe other users could post bids and offers, and users negotiated with each other.  They would have called those "exchanges" but not in the sense we think of it today.  Odd how with Bitcoin 2010 seems like ancient history...

Regarding Antpool, the user to whom I responded claimed that Antpool is effectively the only mining pool mining BCH.  If you are disputing that Antpool is contributing any of its resources to mining BCH, I find it curious you chose to respond to my post rather than his post, or to some others on this sub who have made the same claim (that this BCH phenomenon is purely fabricated by Jihan Wu).  I have not made that claim, but others on this subreddit have.  So feel free to debate them on this subject if you feel Antpool is not mining BCH.  (I think they are assuming that many of the blocks without a name assigned are in fact Antpool, and that is possible, but I don't know that for a fact).  I have, however, seen many blocks mined by ViaBTC, and Bitclub, and several (not too many before yesterday) by bitcoin.com.  My main point was that beginning yesterday BCH is actually more profitable to mine than BTC, based on the difficulty finally re-setting based on actual hash-power and the rising price of BCH (it shot up past USD 800 yesterday).  This will adjust itself within a week or so as the BCH blocks are now being found at an exceedingly fast rate, [edit] approx 20-25 blocks per hour, and this has attracted a significant amount of hash-power to BCH within the past 24 hours.

Very true.  I've read down this thread and may have missed it, but I can't even see anyone bringing up what might be the biggest risk for OP in this situation.  As he's buying dozens of obscure alts, I would assume (maybe incorrectly, I don't know), that he is keeping his funds on one or more exchanges.  He's in a deep hole right now with all of the alts sinking relative to BTC, but it could be much worse than that if any exchange gets hacked or closes shop.  He's got millions sitting exposed to exchanges controlling his funds.  Waiting for some of these alts to rebound seems less risky than where he is likely storing his funds.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:34:30
This was my thought exactly.  It doesn't fit, unless his parents are extremely wealthy, left him a huge inheritance or a gift of nearly 2 MM fun money to play with, and he has the security blanket of knowing there's more where that came from. If he made this money himself, it's hard to imagine him dumping 1.6 MM into dozens of obscure alts most of us haven't even heard of, not to imagine he probably has most of these on some exchange which would get hacked or close shop tomorrow, and his money will all be gone.

I have never heard one person or group in the Bitcoin community, including those who support Segwit2x, or those for Segwit No2x, or core devs, miners, representatives of exchanges, node operators, anyone from DCG, or any other group within the community advocate for increasing the 21 MM cap.

Thanks for posting.  This is a serious issue.  A $15 fee would be absolutely absurd...It would be cheaper to send him the money via Western Union, and much cheaper to do a simple bank ACH or e-check, and Western Union or a bank ACH would actually be faster too if you have to wait 3 or 4 days for your 1st confirmation.  If this doesn't get better soon then Bitcoin's utility will be greatly diminished.

Look at the case of The Stone Man, who 7 years ago Wednesday bought 9000 BTC.  He lost 8999 immediately, keeping only 1 BTC, so he lost 99.98% of his investment.  Even keeping less than 1/10th of 1 percent of his investment in BTC, his total investment still outperformed the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, Gold, Silver, and you name it, even if he had put the entire $600 into any one of those investments.  ie. notwithstanding the fact that his $600 investment in BTC would be worth USD 30.5 Million today had he kept it, and he lost virtually all of it, he's actually still ahead of the game, as his USD 600 turned into 3400 (if he even bothered to keep it that is).  I really feel for this guy :(

They're finding 20 blocks/day on average over the first 2.5 days (50 blocks so far it appears as of 00:46 UCT Aug 4), which is actually better than I expected considering the difficulty and lack of mining profitability during the first few days while difficulty resets.  Anyway you'll probably get sufficient confirmations within 24 hours so you can sell the BCC/BCH.  
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:56:45
Excellent point, and spot on.  This whole thing is based on a subjective interpretation of the word "threatening", and nobody can even see what that might be to debate it since no proof has been provided.  But that's exactly why u/TheBlueMatt and  should not be accusing Silbert of "threatening" others or accuse him of being a "liar".  I would guess whatever emails they are referring to would probably not include language any more "threatening" than what you could find in posts or correspondence from core developers discouraging companies from going with NYA.

ok, except his purchasing power is not declining, it is increasing...:) (at least so far this year)  We will see if there is some market correction, but even if BTC levels off, he is ahead of the game as far as his purchasing power goes, and if he was investing say $50 per month on the 1st of every month going back a year or so, his purchasing power in BTC is far higher than it would have been had he saved USD.  Each incremental BTC amount is lower at point of purchase, but the purchasing power at the time of purchase in USD is constant at USD 50, but each time he buys his total BTC balance goes up and he gets closer to owning that full Bitcoin to which he aspires, and his purchasing power is rising all the way...(again, so far....  I've been in BTC long enough to know it can go the other direction)

I never had any issue.  I did sweep a paper wallet a couple of times and it just swept right into my breadwallet when I scanned the Private Key QR code.  You might want to just check your paper wallet balance (the public key address) on the blockchain and see if it shows the transaction you just tried to do, or if it still shows your balance on that wallet.  Once you sweep the funds, the balance should transfer to your breadwallet and your paper wallet balance will go to zero.

I'm no expert so maybe someone else reading this can give you a better explanation.  It was my understanding if he had simply backed up before shutting it down, the change address with the corresponding private key would have been safe on his wallet.

I was wondering the same thing as far as RMB.  Only difference is I wonder if this isn't just a sell-off of profit taking, not necessarily a plan to force a flash-crash.  In the USA at least when BTC hit 1100 it's a great time to take profit as it's after the new year so you can defer your capital gains tax 1 year.
* Edit:  to be clear I did not sell off even 1 bit of my BTC holdings.  I believe in BTC long term and I dont believe in trying to time the market, except insofar as I usually accumulate with small purchases when the market dips, and that worked well for me over the last couple of years.

Every time we hit a new ATH, I think of The Stone Man, and in 2 days it will be 7 years since his loss.  There have been many BTC lost or locked up over the years, but this one case stays with me as an amazing story, and a financial loss which turned out to be much bigger than he could have imagined.  He bought 9000 BTC and lost 8999 of them.  Never heard from him since, but I always wondered if he bought back in while they were still cheap in 2010, or if he was disillusioned with the process and gave it up.  On the upside, the 1 BTC he kept is now worth USD 3400 :)

Are you spending the BTC you buy, or are you just buying bits each month and saving BTC?

Good point on the prospect of some BTC holdings moving back to alts.  However the BCH sell-off I don't think accounts for the entire BTC boost we are seeing at the moment, because the value of BTC + BCH is higher than it was pre-fork.

Interesting.  I havent seen that yet but will check on r/btc as I am curious.  Still, what you are saying they are doing on r/btc is exactly what is happening right here, right now on r/bitcoin.   Several on here are posting that increasing the block-size is somehow tied in with removing the 21 MM cap on supply, and it is simply not true.  I wish people on both sides of the block size debate could just calm down and debate rationally without making accusations about the other side.  I think all of us here want the same thing.  We all want bitcoin to succeed.  And I would think virtually everyone on both sides knows it is imperative the 21 MM cap be kept always.  In fact it has to be kept.  If consensus is this hard for a scaling debate, there is no way anyone would ever achieve broad consensus to increase the supply.  I dont believe that could ever, or would ever happen.

Ok just re-checked the price chart.  The heart of what I called the "bear market" was from Jan-Oct 2015.  For that 10 month period the price was in the $200 range, averaging mid to low-200s most of that time, and briefly dipping down to around 180.  The BTC price was in a downward trend though starting in Sept/Oct 2014, as each week had a lower average price and it declined fairly steadily from the 500s to the 400s, then 300s, and by the 1st week of Jan it was sub-300 already.  So anyway, a far cry from what we've seen recently.

your phone should go automatically to camera to scan the QR code.  As I recall it's automatic when you click "import private key".  You just scan the private key QR code and the funds are swept to your breadwallet.  
However I would recommend you keep your paper wallet, just put it away in a safe place and keep it for savings.  You can check your balance any time on the blockchain, just as fast as you could with any app.  Just copy and paste your public key wallet address into the search field on blockchain.info.

In a nutshell, because he didn't backup after his transaction.  Each transmission of funds from a wallet.dat file vacates the original address and returns change to a new address.  So he was sending 1 BTC out of his 9000, but in reality he was sending out the 9000 BTC and getting back 8999 change.  The problem was he sent out the 1 BTC but immediately closed it down, and shut down the system and "wiped system disk loaded into memory and therefore the ./bitcoin folder" he never backed up after the transaction, so the change was returned to a new address but the private key was lost.  Actually if you didn't already read through it, the attached link above is really good reading.

I believe you have this backwards.  To be sure, I checked a historical chart and sure enough, in the past 10 years there has never been a time the USD was so weak as to only buy 0.88 CAD.  To the contrary, 1 USD has been worth more than 1 CAD almost all of the last 10 years, with a couple of spots of approximate parity.  Right now 1 USD = 1.29 CAD and the average rate is usually in the range of 1.10 - 1.20 CAD to buy 1 USD.

Easy.  Just download a mobile wallet.  The main issue is focusing now on merchant adoption again (like we did 3-4 years ago before we all got wrapped up in the damned block-size debate and split into camps).  It would be easy for merchants to accept bitcoin, and more of them do, spending it with a mobile wallet would be easier than paying with a credit card.  Scanning a QR code with a mobile wallet is super easy and certainly does not require the user to be tech savvy.

He is saying that is a risk worth taking because while digital currencies like Bitcoin are easy to recreate, the opportunity for them to reach mainstream adoption is far more rare."

You definitely make some good points, but the issue of merchant adoption is one that I believe could be greatly improved if the community was as focused on that as they were 4+ years ago. The BCH community is more focused on adoption today, like the BTC community was in 2014. Then by 2015 as blocks were getting nearly full on a regular basis due to increasing adoption &amp; transaction volume, any discussion on this sub-reddit of removing the temporary 1 MB that was originally put in place to protect the network while BTC was virtually free and while tx fees were non-existent (back in 2010) was deleted by the mods &amp; users were blocked even for advocating for near term on-chain scaling.  Then it became an all-out war of sorts for the next 2 years until the HF in 2017.  The bitterness remains, the fighting remains (now between BCH &amp; BTC), but during these past 3 years it seems most on here have completely forgotten the main goal of promoting BTC and increasing adoption both among consumers *and* merchants.

You do not need to get your funds off your paper wallet and onto the Coinbase app to see your balance.  You can view your wallet balance on any paper wallet by simply checking the blockchain.  One easy way is go to blockchain.info and paste your wallet address into the search field.  You will see your balance instantly.
PS: when you do want to move the funds from your paper wallet, you can use your breadwallet app to import your private key by simply scanning the QR code on your paper wallet.  That will instantly sweep the entire balance of your paper wallet into your breadwallet.  After that you can send it anywhere you want.  Do not ever re-use the same paper wallet.  Once you sweep the funds, dispose of it, and if you want to store again on a paper wallet, print a new one (obviously using an offline computer and printer).
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:40:30
I never had any issue.  I've swept out a few paper wallets to move funds, and each time I just clicked "import private key", the camera came on automatically, locked in to the private key QR code, and the funds went into breadwallet. It might take a few minutes to register.
Once the funds are safely in your breadwallet, be sure not to re-use the same paper wallet.  Just create new paper wallets for any savings you want to hold.

Fair enough, but my original point was misunderstood, and I think many people today misunderstand Marxism.  Believing in universal education is not Marxist.  Believing in universal heath care is not Marxist.  Those who read his original text in full know that a fundamental principal of Marxism was that it had to be all-encompassing to work, both within one society with the State taking complete control of all means of production, and then it had to spread worldwide in order to ultimately be successful, according to Marx.  It was not tolerable to allow primarily capitalist countries to survive, and in practice in every single country that practiced Marxist communism, the government controls the lives of the people, determines what they are allowed to read/hear, and punishes those who disagree with the government (often executing them).  My point is that wherever Marxism has been practiced it has failed.  That does not mean universal education has failed, because having government guarantees of certain benefits does not constitute communism.  The original post was about Satoshi Nakomoto's lessons.  When one person posted a comparison of Satoshi to Karl Marx (of all people) I felt the need to point out the irony.  John Locke or Thomas Hobbs would have been more appropriate if he felt like including a political philosopher.

Thank you for your question.  It's interesting, but I think you missed my point.  The point was not to attack Marx.  It was to say that I think most of us on this sub really want Bitcoin to be successful and to endure.  Marxism or Communism has failed, and since I hope Bitcoin does not fail, I simply questioned why Karl Marx was the one political philosopher someone chose to compare to Satoshi Nakomoto.  I found that a bad comparison.
More specifically, my post regarding atrocities committed by totalitarian Marxist governments was in reply to someone who posted that Marxism "has touched lots of people".  I would hope Bitcoin has a much more positive impact on the world than communism.  That was my point.

Just curious then, in your opinion, what would incentivise users to run nodes and maintain a decentralized network?  I've asked this question to others who seem to think bitcoin is nothing but a frill to blockchain technology, but I've never gotten a straight answer. The only examples I can think of all would revolve around a centralised system financed by a company to maintain the network, but that bears no resemblance to the bitcoin blockchain, nor would it be revolutionary IMO.

I'm not sure I follow you here.  BTC hit its ATH last December, that is correct.  2017 was a tremendous year for BTC price appreciation.  It crossed the prior ATH barrier of approx USD 1200 back in January 2017 if I recall correctly, and throughout 2017 it hit so many new ATH's we all lost count, until peaking at around 19,800.  However, prior to hitting the 1200 mark a year ago January, the previous ATH was back in November 2013.  So in other words, BTC went more than 3 years without hitting a new ATH until Jan 2017.

I did think about China when making my post, and China does give one pause to think a moment as it is different than all of the other communist countries.  However, do you really think China represents a successful Marxist economy?  In China there is a greater disparity of wealth than in Western capitalist countries in Europe and North America.  You've got extreme wealth and extreme poverty.  Workers in the country often work 12+ hour days 6 or 7 days a week under conditions that workers in the USA, Canada or Europe would never have to endure.  It's not exactly a worker's paradise.  The poor working conditions and long hours the workers face is precisely why China is able to manufacture many goods much cheaper than we can in the USA or Europe.
And then consider freedom.  In China you are not allowed free information or news.  The government controls what you see or read.  Those who express views in opposition to the government are imprisoned.  Yes, modern day China is surely better than life in the USSR under Stalin, or Cambodia under Pol Pot, but it is not free.

You didn't, but to state the obvious, his point was El Chapo will probably do less time than Ross Ulbricht, which makes no sense.  Even more unfair, the leading sellers of hard drugs on Silk Road (cocaine, heroin, etc) got relatively light sentences, while Ulbricht got double-life + 40 years without any possibility of parole for operating the web-site.  As far as the presumed attempted murder charge, correct me if I'm mistaken but while they had accused him of that I do not believe he was actually convicted of that charge.  (And even if he *did* seem to try to hire a hitman, since when is that punishable by an effective triple life sentence without any chance of seeing the light of day again? and didn't El Chapo actually have some people killed along the way....?)

Correct, but like you said, you probably got yourself "a few years even if nothing happens".  In the case of Ulbricht, the people arguing his punishment was just constantly focus on that charge: that he presumably tried to hire a hitman to kill someone.  As I understand it, Ulbricht was not even convicted of that.  Even if he had been convicted of that, IMO people should question why that should necessitate an effectively triple life sentence.

So if you believe that is the situation, how would you explain the recent strength in BCH and the price rising from the low 300s up to 1000 today...?

However, the market already knows this is coming, so why would the BCH price be rising dramatically now if an increase in supply is forthcoming...?

Same as with any market, real estate, the stock markets, etc.  Nothing goes parabolic forever.  Whenever you see a sustained run-up in price for a while there is usually some market correction in which prices settle back down.  Even in this current BTC price rally we saw the price nip 5K and then settle down to 3.8K and float around 4K for a while before resuming its surge. That was a minor correction.  When BTC first hit 1000 it was a strong, fast run-up in late 2013 and the market correction brought the price back down to around 400 before strengthening again to 700, then correcting back down to 200, and in that case we had a sustained 'bear market' for about a year, wherein the BTC price floated around 200-300 from the end of 2014 until the end of 2015.  That's a nice long buying opportunity for those who believe in it long term.  Things have been pretty good since that time.

Ok, but (a) he was not actually convicted of the attempts to order hits, and (b) even if he were convicted of that, you're talking 40 years.  Are you aware of some "other crimes" he committed, other than operating a web-site that allowed for illicit trade?  If not, I'm not sure I understand your point.  OP made this post to show that some of the biggest hard drug sellers on Silk Road (ie the people actually *selling* drugs, not operating the web-site) only got a few years.  So the question remains:  why did Ulbricht get a sentence dramatically higher than everyone else involved in Silk Road *combined*...? And in your opinion, is that fair?

The idea is that Bitcoin was originally designed as a form of peer to peer electronic cash which could be used by people worldwide for common everyday payments.  However the scaling debate has pitted big blockers against small-blockers.  Big-blockers still hold peer to peer electronic cash as an ideal and want on-chain scaling which would allow for such transactions.  Small blockers feel increasing the block-size is a slippery slope which would eventually, even necessarily, lead to centralization of mining hash-power which could be dangerous to Bitcoin.  To avoid that danger, they prefer to keep the blocksize at 1 MB.  This small block-size limit will effectively preclude Bitcoin from being used for day to day transactions due to higher transaction fees, and thus Bitcoin (BTC) is now evolving to become a settlement layer for larger transactions, and a 2nd layer (off-chain) solution will soon be needed for day to day transactions.  The post is meant to ridicule the small-blockers for wanting Bitcoin to be something which soon will not be accessible to many poorer people around the world and not useful for smaller, everyday transactions.

Obviously there is no CEO of BCH.  There is no CEO of BTC either as we all know. I get that your statement is made in humor, but with a lot of newcomers reading this sub reddit and hoping for facts, it is not really helpful to make false statements, even when done in humor.

Yes.  Bitcoin is divisible into 1000 mBTC, 1,000,000 bits, or 100 Million satoshis.  Some day soon bits could become the primary source of measurement.
And more:  No one should invest any amount greater than what they could comfortably lose, and since we are at an all-time high, probably not the best time for someone new to dive in head-first.  Start small, buy small, regular amounts over time (dollar cost averaging).

I'm not 100% certain but I believe no, you should be able to restore from the recovery seed using another compatible wallet as another user mentioned.  In any case, I'm conservative and have the same concerns so I don't like putting all of my eggs in one basket, regardless of how secure that basket might be.

Bitfinex socialised the losses (around 35% IIRC); account holders were paid only a percentage of what they held, and it was converted to fiat and somewhat difficult to withdraw.  That's what happened to me, and I was slow to find out how to get it out, so by the time I finally did the USD had depreciated so much against BTC I got only pennies on the dollar.  IMO Bitfinex deserves to be mentioned as yet another example of why one should not keep significant deposits on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:03:04


You bring up some good points, but at the end you're a bit overstating the downside to the risk.  There is of course risk, so no one should invest more than they can afford to lose (just like buying a stock).  But, price is not what one person says it is. 


Price is what 2 parties agree on in a free exchange, meaning something is worth what someone else is willing to pay for it.  Secondly, the BTC market price has skyrocketed this year, increasing more than 7-fold, going from $900 to $7800 in less than a year. Giving up a piece of that gain is a perfectly normal market correction.  It makes perfect sense the price should settle down a couple of thousand dollars to solidify support.  Furthermore, most of us who hold BTC also hold close to the same amount in BCH automatically after the Aug 1 split.  The 15% price decline in BTC in the past 24 hours has been largely offset by a price increase in BCH of close to $1000, so holding both coins represents an excellent hedge.  I suspect only the pure ideologues decided to put all of their eggs in one basket and sell all of their BCH for BTC, or sell all of their BTC for BCH.  I don't care which side of the block-size debate you're on, that just doesn't seem like smart investing. 
I hold both and I sleep very well.

Absolutely not.  Bitcoin was envisioned to function as just that: peer to peer electronic cash.


Bitcoin already had quick transactions, virtually free of cost or with only minimal fees, up until 2015.  The growing congestion due to increased adoption coupled with the block-size limit has led to higher fees on the BTC chain (now on average several dollars per avg transaction).  On August 1 Bitcoin forked into two chains, BTC maintaining the 1 MB block-size limit but with Segwit adopted to ameliorate the congestion, and BCH with an 8 MB block-size limit and without Segwit. Transaction fees on the BCH chain are much lower, usually only a few cents per transaction, but BTC remains the main chain with the majority PoW and usage.

The author of this article, Aaron Stanley, apparently has no understanding of capital gains taxes, or is otherwise inadvertently misrepresenting it.  Your cost basis of BCH (and BTG) will in fact be 0, no calculations necessary.  However if you are simply holding it as most people are, you will NOT owe capital gains taxes in the USA based on the value appreciation over cost basis (meaning the entire value).  You will eventually owe capital gains tax on this only when you realize that gain (sell it or trade it for another asset).

If you have funds on a paper wallet and you are content to keep those funds long-term, I would recommend you just keep it there locked up.

Had you actually read the piece, you would have seen that they point out BCH has multiple development teams, not just one.  Here is an excerpt from the piece to which you linked:
"we use the swarm methodology for dispute resolution, which is
optimized for our kind of disorganization. It simply means that nobody gets to say
what anybody else gets to do or not do, and carries immense power.
We have been conditioned in the corporate world to think that power over feature X
for ourselves also means power over feature X for other people. But when we break
free from this idea, we have a much better dispute resolution than any voting or
decree ruling, based on these simple four principles:
Everybody is free to take any initiative for the Bitcoin Cash project.
Everybody is also free to follow any initiative taken by any other person.
Everybody is free to take no action at all.
However, nobody may tell anybody else what to do, what initiative to take, not
take, follow, or not follow."

Not bad advice.

Usually it is the assets that are acquired or earned during the marriage that are subject to split.  Anyway, if OP does squirrel some away for long term savings, I would recommend storing in cold storage laminated paper wallets in a safety deposit box, and telling a brother or trusted relative only in case anything happens to him.

Do you believe it we had a modest, conservative block-size cap increase to 8 MB to allow for increasing adoption and higher volume with fast &amp; low fee txs, improving UX, that most people would no longer be able to run their own nodes in their homes?  I would suggest even if we had an 8 MB block-size cap we could all still easily run full nodes, and that would buy years of improved UX.

Are you aware that the proposed legislation in fact increases government power vis-a-vis civil asset forfeiture?  Regarding crossing borders, it implies that law enforcement can deem you carrying crypto-currency en route to a port of entry or exit as being in the process of crossing a border, even if you haven't crossed any border.  Sorry if you disagree, but this is terrible legislation.  We should be doing away with civil asset forfeiture in this country, not increasing it.

This is a good point.  For newcomers reading this, mining profitably now entails not only operating in an area with cheap electricity, but it involves buying expensive ASIC machines which now require high voltage not normally available in homes or offices without putting in extra wiring.  It is important to have tens of thousands (or more) full nodes operating worldwide, most importantly by un-related parties without collusion.  Decentralisation is indeed a vital aspect of network security.  (Having said that, what constitutes true decentralisation has been the subject of the intense debate this past year or so).

This is interesting to me.  I thought all long-term capital gains were taxed at 15% (assuming you held the asset at least one year prior to selling for a gain).  I get that low-income households might be exempt up to 75K (makes sense).  But at what level of income do you start paying &gt;20% on long term capital gains?

lol I know the feeling...  Just don't wait to buy an entire BTC.  It is divisible to 100 MM satoshis so there's no need to wait to try to buy 1.0 BTC at once.  I would recommend to just invest what you are comfortable with in small amounts, maybe monthly or some other regular interval.  Then if there is a significant price drop, buy more.  (but no one should invest more than they could comfortably lose).

BTC fees have obviously improved greatly, and they're not so bad these days.

Right now fees are fine, but what worries me is what we'll face if there is a new bull run and a significant increase in volume.

If you have sincere interest in this subject, you can easily find and read accounts of civil asset forfeiture abuse in this country.  This abuse has been going on for almost 40 years.  What you described has indeed happened with people carrying cash, people who never were accused of a crime, never indicted for any crime, never convicted of any crime.  In some cases the cash they were carrying was even less than $10K.  In other cases people had their bank accounts frozen for regularly depositing cash from cash generating businesses.  Several had the cash seized from their bank accounts for making regular weekly cash deposits of $8000-9000, and they were accused of "structuring" deposits to be less than $10K each.  I doubt you want a litany of examples here, but you can easily find these accounts and then make up your mind if you think that sort of government power is a good thing.
Edit:  The proposed legislation would add "digital currencies" to the list of suspicious assets, in addition to cash, that can be seized if it is suspected that the asset could have been used in a crime of some sort.  The real problem with CAF is that the person from whom they seize it does not need to be charged with any crime.  They are guilty until proven innocent in a sense as law enforcement can seize their assets and then make them spend a fortune in legal fees in an attempt to get the assets returned.

This is my story almost exactly.  I remember back in 2011 reading a debate where one guy was arguing BTC was worthless.  He claimed to have thousands of them on his computer but said it was silly and they weren't worth anything.  He was making fun of people for thinking BTC might be valuable.  Another guy repeatedly offered to buy his Bitcoins for $1 each, but the first guy went quiet (he probably didn't really have any).  I looked it up and found that BTC at the time was trading for $3. I thought it was interesting but then forgot about it until the big run-up in late 2013.  Then I waited for the correction which I knew was coming, and bought my first whole BTC when the market corrected below $500.  Started accumulating for the next couple of years.

Is there any real evidence that many people are actually taking out loans to buy Bitcoin?  That would be incredibly foolish, especially given the strong price run-up in the past couple of months and the fact that we are at an all-time high.  I don't count credit cards as many people use cc's for convenience and just pay their bill each month, so that would not be the same as actually taking out a loan.  Anyone who would actually take out a loan to buy something trading at it's all time high has issues and will probably find other ways to lose their money as well.

You can use your hardware wallet (whether Ledger Nano, Trezor, or Keepkey, etc) to send and receive funds any time you want.  It is just as easy to send and receive from your hardware wallet as it is from an exchange or online wallet service, but it is far more secure.  You control your own keys, so you are not trusting a 3rd party such as a company that runs an online exchange that could get hacked or go out of business.

Great post, love it and I up-voted, but this one line should be clarified.  The new All-Time High did not happen just now, it happened back in late February this year, which was only 3 years (not 4) after the initial price collapse in January 2014.  
The true Bear Market, as I will call it, where the BTC market price hovered down in the $200s really lasted from September 2014 until Nov 2015.  So that very weak period for the BTC price lasted only a bit more than a year.  (Back in the spring &amp; summer of 2014 there was a resurgence of strength and the BTC price had climbed back up from $400 to the middle to high $600s in the late summer).
At the end of 2015 the market price improved slowly and steadily until middle to late 2016 when the pace of price strengthening improved.  And then we all know what happened in Dec 2016 and Jan 2017. Since that time the increase has been truly phenomenal.

I have no knowledge of OP or his company, but can you explain to the readers why your site accepted his deposit of 165 BTC if you have such concerns with his business?  Wouldn't the more sensible thing to do be to refuse the deposit?  If the red flag was the high value of the deposit, why could you not have simply put a limit or cap on the deposit amount?  I understand your points above, but it just seems terribly convenient for Uphold to receive his funds and then suddenly freeze his account, and hold his funds.  You should not have accepted his deposit in the first place.  Also, are you claiming that OP has lied about having an account with Uphold for 2 years?  You did not directly dispute that, so that would be an important point to clarify.  His statement that he did submit KYC paperwork previously seems plausible, and he has offered to re-submit it to you.  So it just seems to me you should return his funds, and then review with him what paperwork and "proof of wealth" you need to set his company up with an account, that is if Uphold wishes to maintain an account with him (maybe you do not).

Not exactly.  They are looking to purchase sovereignty, not just purchase land and declare independence.

Fair enough, and I agree.  I also supported Segwit 2X as I felt that would allow enough for the growth in popularity in 2017, and at least buy us some more time without such an extreme surge in tx fees.
I guess my thinking on the 8 MB cap is that most blocks would not actually contain 8 MB of data (I guess I could be wrong...?) but at least it would allow for extra space when needed for surges in volume.

Exactly.  Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and it might not grow beyond that if it becomes unattractive to new users.

Obviously decades from now fees will need to be part it as the block rewards will be much lower, but let's allow Bitcoin to grow in popularity first.

Now that BCH has skyrocketed from the low 300s to over 1300 in just a few days, it would be important to clarify the predictions on this sub of BCH 'crashing' in price.  If the BCH price continues rising to 1500-2000 and then in January at some point "dips" down to 1400, will those of you on this sub claiming BCH is simply being dumped take credit for an accurate prediction despite the fact that the BCH price is much higher than it was in October?  I've watched many users on this sub claiming BCH is 'sh&amp;t' and garbage and that it is being 'dumped' by the big mining pools that have been mining it...  None of that seems to conform to reality as far as I can see.
* Edit: for the record, I hold both BTC and BCH in approx equal amounts since the Aug 1 fork.  I want both chains to prosper.  I have not sold any of my BTC for BCH, nor have I sold my BCH for BTC.  I believe those who put all of their eggs in one basket are assuming unnecessary risk.  In fact, my hope is that both chains strengthen and one could even complement the other.  BCH could be used more as peer-to-peer electronic cash with very low transaction fees, and BTC could be more of a settlement layer which is what many have stated it should be.

The govt could classify Bitcoin as a currency instead of an asset.

The sub-reddit r/btc was created *long before* the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, so it originally had nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash. You are making it sound like it was created to confuse users, but how could that be? When it was created there was only the BTC ticker, and many users on this sub-reddit (r/bitcoin) were getting censored and even banned for advocating for a block-size increase to allow for on-chain scaling.  r/btc was created as a forum for those users to discuss that freely without fear of censorship.

Why would this be surprising?

@_date: 2019-04-27 18:28:26
I understand your viewpoint, but respectfully disagree. I read both subs regularly and have for about 5 years now. Those who favored on-chain scaling migrated to r/btc beginning in 2015, years before the HF. Most users there now favor Bitcoin Cash, as they are usually against Seg-wit and of course in favor of increased block capacity for use of Bitcoin as peer to peer cash without a trusted 3rd party intermediary, but favoring those that view of Bitcoin is not propaganda, it is an honest point of view.  You might disagree with it, but that does not make it propaganda. I still hold all of my BTC and also my BCH and I would be thrilled if both coins find great success and rise in market value in the future, but I do have concerns with LN as IMO trusting 3rd party intermediaries to hold your funds is exactly what Bitcoin was designed to avoid in the first place, and I don't like the idea of relying on LN to make small cash payments in the future. I'm sure you disagree, and that's fine, but I wish people on both sides could be more respectful in their discussions and stop the constant tribalistic attacks and accusations of fraud.

The statement that buying BTC is better than mining it is not a statement promising you can make money with it.  It is still a risky investment, but one with the potential for higher value in the future.  Mining today, depending on the type of machines you have and your electricity cost, would likely cost you more to mine 1 BTC than the cost of 1 BTC in the open market (currently around $600), hence the comment someone made that you are better off buying them than mining them.

With respect to BCH, it shares the same chain with BTC from its inception until August 1, 2017.  So say you had an old paper wallet from years ago with 1.0 BTC on it. You can use the private key from that old wallet to sweep your BTC to a new BTC wallet. Then you can use the same private key to send 1.0 BCH to a new BCH wallet.  I would recommend ensuring you safely send and store your BTC first, since its value is higher.  Be sure that is safely in a new wallet, then send your BCH.  If you had your BTC on a hardware wallet such as Trezor, they have coin-splitting tools to segregate your coins.  I haven't yet split any BTG, BTD, or BTCP but there should be information out there on how to separate those from your old BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:12:38
The main forks were all very recent (since August 2017): BCH, BTG, BTD, and a few smaller ones.  He should absolutely have the full 75.9 value of each of those forked coins as well as BTC.  It's not a question of finding out if he has them.  He has them.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:43:49
Several things are unclear in your post, so I doubt anyone can help you until you provide specifics.  First, neither Bitcoin BTC nor Bitcoin Cash (BCH) nor even BSV can be mined with GPU.  GPU mining has not worked for Bitcoin for around 6 years.  You would need an ASIC mining rig. Why type of mining rig do you have? Do you have a PSU? When you ask what software you need, that question is also unclear to me. You don't buy software to run an ASIC. If you have an ASIC and an appropriate PSU, just hook them up, start running them, find the unit on your network &amp; update the configuration to point it to whichever mining pool you want to use, &amp; set up your account with that mining pool if you haven't already done so.
Regarding electricity, you should take great care with that. In most places, your electricity for mining will cost more than the BTC or BCH you can mine, at least at today's market prices. If you think it's not an issue because you have electricity included in rent, you can bet your landlord will notice the new electric bills &amp; will address that :)

While poker is not a good analogy, I’ll play.  
So you go to a poker table with 100.  Your stake rises to 1200, then down to 250, then you cash out for 150, retaining 100 in chips.  You now have 150 in extra cash in your wallet + 100 in chips.  Your go up &amp; down and after a long session you win up to 9,850 in chips, but you lose some big hands &amp; your stack declines to 2,200.

Fair point, however he said 10 BTC, so he's planning on paying around 64K, which is about right for a typical Tesla, and then he will owe capital gains tax so he'll probably have to cash out around 85K total to pay for the car and the capital gains taxes.
If the guy was at a different stage in his life and already owned a home, I would agree with you.  He should buy a nice car and maybe convert a portion of the rest for investments, and maybe hold a majority of it hoping for more appreciation. 
However if you go back to his original post on this subject, he said he had a decent job but no home yet and to date he &amp; his wife had not saved enough for a down payment on a home.  If I were in his shoes I would probably cash out around 100-150K for a down payment on a really nice home, and probably would keep the rest as savings, not to take to the grave of course, but to await possible appreciation in value in a few years and then maybe pay off the house completely &amp; keep some long term.
In the end, the guy's going to do what he wants to do, and whatever happens I'm sure everyone here wishes him the very best.

That's people believing what they want to believe, because they don't own any of it.  Ask yourself this, today, with the market price around USD 8500:  What if I told you that in June 2019 1 BTC would be worth $70,000...?  Would you think that means BTC would be doing well at that time?  Obviously those owning BTC now would be ecstatic if they knew that would be true.  
However, let's fast forward and say BTC rises dramatically and by March 2019 hits an all time high of $155K at its peak, but then drops with a significant sell-off and corrects all the way back down to $70K by June 2019.  
I'm not saying I am predicting any of that.  But consider that IF that were to happen, two things are certainly true:
(1) The dramatic rise and subsequent market correction would mirror proportionately what BTC has done since January last year until now, and
(2) There will be people in June 2019 saying that Bitcoin "is doing bad" because it fell all the way from $155K down to $70K. Those who don't have it will look for any opportunity to needle those who do.

I'm not an anarchist.  Still, I don't believe the government should be regulating which crypto-currencies web-sites can sell. [Bitcoin.com]( clearly favors Bitcoin Cash (BCH) over BTC but it clearly states Bitcoin Cash, and if someone buys Bitcoin Cash and then decides they would prefer BTC they can easily exchange it in about 2 seconds and they still have the same value of money.  If they invested $500 in BCH and then converted to BTC later they will still have approx. $500 worth, just a different currency.  I know this statement is going to get me down-votes on this particular sub-reddit, but there is a clear difference between a fraud or scam (eg. "Onecoin" or Bitconnect) and marketing or promoting legitimate crypto-currencies that are freely traded and exchanged, even when said currencies draw ire from competing coins. 
Main point:  one does *not* need to be an anarchist to be *against* the government regulating which crypto-currencies can be sold or exchanged on various private web-sites, as long as those crypto-currencies are freely traded.
If you were talking about "Onecoin" then it's a different story: that is an outright fraud and the coin/token is not freely traded or exchanged anywhere.  It is simply a pyramid scheme luring in gullible people who want to be involved in crypto but know nothing about it, then once they're in they realize they can't actually sell their tokens and instead they're encouraged to lure new investors down line.

I know, right?  That was an odd question.  85K would be a fairly typical down payment in most of the world.  Maybe not in Hong Kong, San Francisco, New York, etc, but probably in most of the world that's a good down payment for a house in the $200-600K range.

Maybe.  If that's what he meant, it doesn't seem clear by his post:


To me that reads that he *did* inherit the money, and the inheritance was almost $100K.  If he did inherit almost $100K it's just funny that he said he was going to invest the whole pile into Bitcoin, but then didn't invest any at all.. just seems odd, not quite credible.  Investing the whole pile would not have been wise at the time (turns out it with the benefit of hindsight would have been great), but if he was interested enough to consider investing the whole pile into Bitcoin, you would hope he would have at least invested a bit of it.

Anyone dumbfounded by the sudden price movement apparently hasn't been involved with Bitcoin very long. Bitcoin's entire history has been filled with sudden drops &amp; sudden spikes, often in sustained &amp; dramatic fashion. Just to put things in perspective, for the last bull run (2017) to decline in a manner proportionate to the last one, the BTC price would have to decline to around 3,000, so if the market goes there (or even a bit lower) it is no reason to panic. To the contrary it's most likely a great buying opportunity for those with patience. Looking at the BTC price chart for 2013-2015, it is remarkably similar to the price chart for 2016-2018.  The bottom line is you either believe in Bitcoin or you don't. If you do believe in it, you might want to use this time to slowly accumulate more, but no one ever should invest more than they can afford to lose. Treat it like you might treat buying stock in a company you really believe in.

It's really not difficult to secure and hold in cold storage, and you don't have to be tech savvy to do it.  The easiest on-ramp is a major exchange (if you are in the USA, Coinbase or Gemini are good options to get started).  If you prefer to keep your Bitcoin in cold storage, you can easily buy a ledger or trezor hardware wallet, or you can generate your own paper wallet for free. If you do a paper wallet just download a wallet generator, then generate your private-public key pair offline, and print on a hard-wired printer while offline. Then you can laminate it if you wish, or put into a zip-lock, and store in your safe or in a bank safety deposit box if you wish. You can transfer all or part of your Bitcoin from the online exchange wallet to your paper wallet or to your hardware wallet any time you want.
EDIT:  
(a) I neglected to mention mobile wallets (eg. breadwallet) as another good option, very easy to use, so a nice option for someone new.
(b) Personally, I would *not* recommend any user to keep any significant % of their crypto holdings on exchanges. I do believe that using one of the larger, well-established exchanges (eg. Coinbase, Gemini &amp; Bitstamp) could be good as an "on-ramp", easy for new users, and generally increases utility, so keeping an account with one of them is not a bad thing, but my own recommendation would be to keep most or all of your holdings in cold storage, and simply using the exchange when needed.

Thank you.  I was a bit lazy so thanks for saving me the trouble.  Since they're not confiscating or freezing funds, much of what has been posted by those furious about this, to me seems to be an overreaction. The market should never tolerate companies or exchanges freezing users funds, but every company has a right to decide who it wants to do business with, and if they are being unfair, the market will punish them.

Are you under the impression I have most or *all* of my long term investments in crypto currencies...?  If so, that's pretty funny.  My original investments in Bitcoin from a few years ago I have already re-couped, so even if all of them, every single one of them went to zero (and I do *not* believe that will happen) I would still be o.k.  I only invested a relatively modest amount to begin with (less than 1% of my net worth at the time).  What I have now is a much higher percentage of my net worth, but that is because they have performed so incredibly well over the last couple of years.  Yes, even though the major digital currencies have lost more than half of their value in the last 5-6 weeks, they have still *by far* outperformed all other investments, the S&amp;P 500, the Dow, any mutual fund I have and other investments I have.  By far.  Legacy Bitcoin (BTC) is still more than 20 times higher than it was when I bought my first few almost 4 years ago.  Again this was from what was originally less than 1% of my net worth, and so I'm not going to complain about it because it's volatile. And you think somehow I was foolish for investing a very modest amount of funds I had and seeing the value of those funds grow more than 20-fold in less than 4 years...?  I'm not really sure I follow you.  But to answer your original question, yes, I do know what long-term means, and yes, I do believe investing a very small % of one's net worth, only what they could afford to lose, as a small part of their long term investment portfolio is indeed smart.  I've *never* tried to talk anyone I know into doing it, but if they ask me for my opinion, I will give my opinion but always repeat it should only be what one could afford to lose.

I've read through some of these posts about Coinbase banning gab.com, and sorry if I missed something obvious, but I cannot tell if Coinbase simply banned them or froze their funds.  There is an enormous difference between the two. Another user posted on a different sub bashing Coinbase and making it seem as if they confiscated the funds, but did that really happen?  Or did they simply ban them and tell them to close their account and remove their funds?  If it's the latter, then it's arguably reasonable, as companies can deny business with certain clients for any reason, and the market can decide if such behaviour is reasonable or not (personally I'm not yet sure how I feel about it), but if they confiscated or indefinitely froze their funds, that would be terrible and any exchange doing that should be shunned.  Again, sorry if I'm missing something obvious here.
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:28:35
Edit: I do not disagree with you.  Probably I didn't word my comments very well.
~~You seem to have misread my reply to OP.~~   I do not recommend keeping coins on exchanges, or at least not more than trivial amounts. Personally I have &gt; 98% in cold storage.  Having said that, Large well established exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini or Bitstamp are useful as on-ramps - off-ramps, and keeping accounts open there increases utility. I never recommended anyone keep all their coins on exchanges. Remember OP’s post: this is a prospective new user considering buying a relatively small amount (half a coin) but said he was too unsure of how to secure it. I was simply explaining how easy it is to use a hardware wallet or even a paper wallet if you want a no cost cold storage option for a small amount. I should have mentioned to him mobile wallet options as well.

The financial value of *anything* is what someone else is willing to pay for it.  That does not only apply to Bitcoin.  It applies to every financial asset or commodity.

Just to play devils advocate on this point, does it truly "defeat the purpose of cryptocurrencies entirely"...?  I don't use exchanges much, and of course we are all eager for the day when you will not need to convert back to fiat.  But at the same time, these days Bitcoins utility is greatly increased by having on-ramps and off-ramps, and for newer users especially companies like Coinbase and Gemini are providing a good service.   And yes, I agree users should control their own keys etc, and yes I do that with 98% of my holdings, I get it, so hopefully no one lectures me on that point.  I'm just saying to be realistic shouldn't we recognize that companies like Coinbase are making it easy for new users to enter the crypto world and that these days at least having on-ramps &amp; off-ramps are important?

If I were in his shoes with over $500K windfall like that, I would probably be conservative and sell approx 1/3 of it to invest in real estate or some other investments, but then would kick myself in 2 years after seeing how much the cryptos have appreciated during that time.
@_date: 2016-09-25 15:17:13
Coinbase and Circle are pretty good sites.  You can link up a personal bank account to your coinbase account and then once the account is linked, just login and buy whatever you want.  You might pay approx 1-1.5% over the average current spot price listed on the major exchanges as there is obviously a bid-offer spread to deal with, but that is normal for every commodity.  It's a bigger spread when buying precious metals so it's not so bad, and it's much better than buying on localbitcoins.  I would not recommend holding any large quantity in any single online wallet service.  You should use paper wallets or other cold storage once you accumulate enough that losing all or part of it (a la Bitfinex) would be a significant problem for you.  But one strategy which is convenient is to spread it around various other online wallet services so that all your eggs are not in one basket.  Other online wallet services are available at Blockchain,Xapo, Bitstamp, Btc-e, etc as well as Coinbase and Circle listed above.

If you bought 5 years ago, you are not losing 80%.  In fact you're not losing at all; you're winning.  The same goes if you bought 4 years ago, or 3 years ago, or 2 years ago...or 6, 7, 8 years ago... in fact, even with a &gt; 75% market decline from the peak, everyone should still be ahead, except those who ignored Bitcoin for years but then dumped a bunch of their money in during the huge run-up a year ago.  Anyone who did that will find other ways to lose money in the future, with or without crypto-currencies.

When there is a hard fork, you own equal amounts of both coins.  If you had 10 BTC before the HF, then on 8/1/17 you had 10 BTC + 10 BCC (BCH).  Many people thought the combined value of the 2 coins after the fork would be around the same as the value of BTC pre-fork (approx $2900), but that was not the case.  BTC continued to rise, and on top of it BCC (BCH) fluctuated in value between $300-$800, so just a week or so after the fork the combined value was much higher.  It sure felt like a bonus.

Very true.  This is why one cannot claim that all taxation is theft.  But others could reasonably argue that the majority of money taken in taxes is unjust.  Roads, bridges, traffic lights, other infrastructure and resources actually available for the use of all taxpayers is a remarkably small percentage of the budget.  I think all of us, even libertarians, are content to pay enough taxes or govt fees to support said infrastructure, or for resources available to all.

Could you think of one example of an investment, any investment, any stocks, bonds, mutual funds, precious metals, fiat currencies or anything that would have been as good a store of value as bitcoin has been over the past year?  How about the last 2 years?  How about the last 5 years?  Not sure if I am missing something, but whether you go back 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7 years and look at bitcoin's appreciation in value, it has proven a much better store of value than any other investment as far as I can see.

More than 60% of the budget is entitlement spending (social security, medicare, etc).  About 16% of the US budget is defense.  Interest on the debt is only around 7% now, but that's as low as it is only because the Fed has maintained a virtually 0% interest rate for 10 years now, so it creates the illusion that the national debt isn't as significant as it actually is.  If interest rates rise at all, that figure will grow considerably.  A 20 trillion debt is nothing to sneeze at...

If you're smart, you're not investing so much in crypto-currencies that a market crash will make you "poor".  People should only invest what they can afford to lose. Having said that:
If you bought Bitcoin at any point in its history prior to August 2017, you are well ahead with your investment, so no, most people who believe in Bitcoin are not "losing" and are not likely "poor" as you said.
The huge price spike in late 2017 was just the latest of many such price spikes in Bitcoin's history. Each time, a Bitcoin price "crash" ensues.  One time, it crashed from $29 all the way down to $3.  That one really stung: 90% market decline!  Ouch.  In early 2013, Bitcoin spiked all the way up to &gt; $200, but crashed down to less than $40.  And of course the next spike was the famous one that really put Bitcoin on the map in late 2013, right before the Mt Gox collapse, when it passed the $1000 level, but then came the long, brutal market correction until it finally bottomed out more than a year later at around $190.  That hurt too, but many of those who believe in Bitcoin bought more throughout 2015 in the $200-300 range. So yeah, we're all poor now that it has crashed down to $4500.

Just look at Bitfinex.  Many account holders reporting long delays and unresponsive support after sending in wires (not yet credited to their accounts) or requesting USD or EUR withdrawals.  
Bottom line: you should *never* keep any significant amount of your savings on exchanges.  It's fine to use exchanges like Coinbase or Bitstamp, etc as an on-ramp to convert your fiat to cryptos and exchange between them, or move it around to other wallets.

I've never, ever understood the mentality of someone who believes in Bitcoin enough to own it, but when thinking it's at a peak, selling *all* of it.  I do understand the desire to sell "high", but I do not understand the mentality of selling *ALL* of what you own.  Why not just sell *some* of it?  That way you hedge.  If the market continues to rise, you are still participating in the upside, and if the market crashes, you benefited from selling some of it at a higher price.

Totally agree, most of the inventions that fail were not widely heralded prior to failure, but Bitcoin is something which has spread worldwide and is not something that will be readily forgotten if it ever does fail.  I am genuinely curious if anyone here can come up with some really good examples of inventions that were lauded and spread worldwide with significant money invested into them, but then failed.

In Canada, they allowed Quebec to have their referendum for independence.  In the UK, they allowed Scotland to have their vote as well.  In each case the vote was close, but the voters, given the freedom to vote, wisely chose to remain within those great countries.  In Spain, a great democratic country, the central government took away the right of the people in Catalonia to vote.  The national police went in and seized all ballot boxes they could find, breaking in to polling stations, and in many cases physically confronted and even beat voters.  That is the key difference in what is happening now in Spain, and that is tragic, because the actions of the government to prevent the vote have lead to a majority in Catalonia now wanting independence.

Thanks, but in this case if you look at the transaction ID there are well over 100 confirmations.  In fact my payment was confirmed in a block apparently within 15 minutes of my order from what I can see (though I was not waiting at the time, I had already left the site).  Overstock.com received the payment (they noted themselves they detected the payment and were just waiting for the confirmations), but somehow they didn't register it in their system so they did not confirm the order and thus the item is still sitting in my cart.  I hope they can get it figured out.  Just curious if this happened to anyone else.

Quote from Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcointalk forum in 2010, when discussing the 1 MB limit to be set, he recognized at some point in the future with higher volume the limit would need to be increased.  He wrote this:
*“It can be phased in, like: if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete. When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.”*
Satoshi saw the removal of the blocksize limit as trivial and a foregone conclusion.  He clearly had no idea that such a minor code change would generate such controversy.
Now please share your source for Satoshi saying that the 1 MB had to be permanent.  I have been here for 6 years and in all that time I have never heard anyone make that claim. Please do share your source.

It's really not complicated at all. It would be incredibly fast &amp; easy to just create new wallet addresses.  You could move just enough BTC to your new address to pay them what you want to, but keep the rest in other wallet addresses.  The only wallet address they can see is the one from which you send.
@_date: 2019-09-18 19:22:44
Ok, fine, but still, even if someone paid USD 320 for 1 BCH, they do in fact own an asset worth USD 320 that they can immediately trade for the equivalent amount of BTC based on the current market value of each, if they wish to do so. They paid USD 320 and they actually own USD 320 worth of an asset that is freely traded and exchanged.  The site lists both of them side by side with the respective tickers BCH and BTC and shows the current market value of each. 
As far as those terrible scams you see on Twitter almost daily inviting you to send in 0.1 BTC and receive back 1.0 BTC, yes those are indeed scams. In fact IMO Twitter should get the police involved to try to track down the people making those posts with wallet addresses, as that is outright theft.  But that scam is not something ever done on the web-site we were discussing, so I'm not sure how it's relevant to the question of that site listing both BCH and BTC at their respective market prices.

I posted a couple of years ago I though Dave Kleiman could have been SN. I'm fascinated by some of these exhibits, including this one:
I'm not seeing others pointing out that in these exhibits, there are legal documents dated very early in 2011 specifying CSW as the financier controlling certain specific bitcoin addresses, and paying hundreds of thousands of bitcoins in April 2011 to addresses specified in the documents to finance W&amp;K Info Defense.
Among other addresses, the documents show him as controlling:
This address moved &gt; 334,500 BTC on 8/27/2011
 
I've never been a fan of CSW, but I think a lot of users are quick to say he is faking everything (faking legal contracts, faking emails sent many years ago etc), but how would he have faked sending hundreds of thousands of bitcoins back in early to mid-2011...?

So many points to make, but where to start?  Among other things, I don't recall Coinbase or anyone else ever arguing that it is a government "recognized form of U.S. currency".  To the contrary, the IRS has recognized it as an asset, not a currency.  But so what?  The point is, once the bank sends the funds to a vendor of mine, what difference does it make if I use those dollars to buy some form of asset once they are in my other account?  Anyway...does anyone in NJ have any recommendations for local banks that still allow transfers to exchanges?

 *"Roger ver basicly created bitcoin cash..."*
False.  Roger Ver did not "create" Bitcoin Cash.  He supports it now, but did *not* create it.  RV was still in BTC until November of 2017 when the 2X part of Segwit2X failed to be adopted  At that point it seemed BTC core developers and enough in the community were adamantly opposed to ever increasing the 1 MB block-size cap and without any on-chain scaling, he apparently felt Bitcoin Cash was the better option.
***Edit:*** anyone with any questions about the bitcoin(dot)com site should just go see for themselves to see if it's really as misleading as you and some others are making it out. Personally I don't think it is, but everyone should make up their own mind rather than reading a post on reddit complaining about it and believing the complaint without seeing for themselves.  That site lists both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin "Core" (BTC) which I understand rubs many people here the wrong way, and that I do understand, and can appreciate.  I'm not saying I agree with the description of BTC as Bitcoin Core. If it were my sight I would list it first and list it as "Bitcoin (BTC)", but in any case, the site lists both, with the tickers BCH and BTC, and at the correct market prices (at this moment USD 327 /BCH, and USD 10,220 /BTC), so you can clearly see which one you are buying.

Yes, that would be a bit naive...the federal auction in 2014 was for such a large volume that we assume the price/BTC was at least market price, which at the time was around $650/BTC if I recall correctly, but probably slightly above market for the reason stated above.  If you tried to buy millions of $ worth of BTC at once (in 2014 more than today) it would have driven up the price while you were buying them, so if you could buy a huge block at auction, it would be worth paying at least a small % premium to get it done in one shot without bidding your own price up all day while you try to acquire. The actual price/BTC I don't recall ever being disclosed, but it would not be reasonable to assume Draper got them at any discount to the market price at that time.  
Draper's gamble seemed to be a losing proposition for about a year &amp; a half *after* he bought them at auction. I remember the market price going up briefly to around $700, but then the bear-market set in for the end of 2014 and all of 2015, with the price hovering around $200-$300 for much of that time. If Draper had the courage to hold onto all of those BTC during the bear market, he deserves the rewards he has earned by holding them.

That is absolutely not what happens as far as I have ever seen.  If you feel someone has done that, then please post a link as a reference to a specific case.
Your comment implies that someone is selling BTC *at the BTC price* and then giving them BCH instead.  Do you know of a single case of that happening, ever?  Even once in history?  If not, you should edit your post to correct it. Considering the market price for BTC is roughly 32X that of BCH, that would be outright theft, and that is something that should be immediately reported, so I'm interested to know if you can back up your comment with actual examples of that happening.
The reference by bashco above was to the fact that on bitcoin(dot)com they list and sell both BCH and BTC, but they call BTC "Bitcoin Core" and they call BCH "Bitcoin Cash", but to be fair, they list each coin at the correct market price.  If you click to buy BCH you will pay around USD 320 per BCH.  If you choose to buy BTC you will pay around USD 10,200 per BTC.  That is fair, because those are the real market prices.
If a person would be unintelligent enough to buy 1 BCH at a price of USD 320, and then expect that because they bought a "Bitcoin" that the USD 320 they spent should immediately be worth USD 10,200, that person has absolutely no right to feel cheated or misled.  They bought 1 BCH and were given 1 BCH.  If they prefer to hold BTC, that's great, it takes about 2 seconds to convert that BCH to the correct amount of BTC based on the current market values.

I did give you the source, in fact the exact quote from SN himself.  You might want to re-read my post above since you erroneously said I did not give you a source. Try this article below, and read it all the way through. At the time the 1 MB limit was put in place, no block had come anywhere near that size so it did not seem necessary to make it higher, especially since increasing it was a minor code change.
EDIT: Here is a quote from the article answering your question about why the limit was not set higher than 1 MB in 2010:
\*"Many have asked why Satoshi didn’t create a larger blocksize, like 8 MB. The answer is three-fold:
It wasn’t needed, as even 1 MB was far larger than the largest blocks that had ever been mined.
It was technically easy to change, simply substituting one value in the code for another.
Larger blocks create technical challenges. Back in 2010, Internet technology was such that larger blocks would not have propagated properly."\*

I appreciate your comment, and I understand your point of view. 
From a personal perspective, I must acknowledge that although I openly supported raising the block-size cap back in 2015 (and onward), I was never outright banned, and I'm not certain any of my own comments were censored, so I have to acknowledge it might not be as bad as some others would make it seem. Having said that, I do believe that many legitimate people, Bitcoin enthusiasts who were on this sub for years, were banned when they should not have been, beginning in 2015 and continuing through mid-2017, and that was my point. I simply disagree with banning anyone for ideas and for participating in discussions, or making posts to invite honest discussion. If you're talking about an aggressive person who repeatedly makes personal attacks and/or uses profanity, then such a person could be banned, and the sub should not be criticized for censoring in a situation like that.

So you think that what Satoshi Nakamoto described in the Bitcoin white paper was not Bitcoin?  That seems odd...

This particular sub, the one on which OP posted his screenshot from another sub to brag, was the first to openly and unabashedly censor legitimate topics (such as on-chain scaling back in 2015).  r/btc is of course one-sided and now pro-BCH, but in part because many of those in the space for many years, some since the beginning, who favored a gradual on-chain scaling solution were either banned or had posts removed by the mods, leading some to create r/btc, which existed long before the 2017 HF that created BCH.

Ok, but wouldn't someone have to be insanely stupid to pay USD 300 and think they're getting 1.0 BTC, which is listed on exchanges at more than 31X that price? I'm sorry, but that just seems unreal. If they buy 1.0 BCH and sell 1.0 BCH they are not getting ripped off. They can convert it to the equivalent market value of BTC any time they want on any exchange.  So if a site lists both, and the site lists 1.0 BCH at USD 320 and 1.0 BTC at USD 10,220, it seems clear.

You’re going to get very politicized answers as most users are strongly biased for or against Bitcoin Cash.  In a nutshell, BCH forked away from BTC in 2017 to increase the block-size data cap from 1 MB to 8 MB to allow for on-chain scaling and keep tx fees low.  Since BTC maintained a strong majority of hash-rate it retained the BTC ticker and Bitcoin name.  BCH has yet to achieve widespread adoption,

But once again, if they click on "Bitcoin Cash (BCH)" and buy $100 worth of it, they do in fact own $100 worth of a digital asset that is freely and easily convertible to other digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). 
The post to which I responded implied, incorrectly, that some people are sold BTC at the BTC price (which is roughly 32X higher) and instead they are given BCH. If that ever happened, that would be outright theft and should be reported to the police.

@_date: 2018-04-29 18:52:52
How is that getting 'scammed'?. If you buy BTC you are getting Bitcoin. If you buy BCH you are buying Bitcoin Cash.  If you buy $1000 worth of either you will get the appropriate amount.  $1000 today would buy you about 0.7 BCH.  If you bought BTC you would get approx 0.11 BTC.  
If you invest that $1000 in BCH (and have 0.7 BCH) but decide you were "scammed" (odd imo), in about 10 seconds you can exchange it for BTC on any exchange.  
If you don't want BCH, don't buy it.  If you buy BCH but decide you didn't want it, exchange it.

A debit card will be good for bitcoin, whoever issues it.  One of the biggest issues for people who receive bitcoin but don't know much about it (eg as a gift) is that it often seems to them a hassle to figure out how to spend it.  You can point out some online retailers, or that they can buy a gift card online and use it, but it involves an extra step in their eyes, ie it's not as simple/easy for them as cash or credit or debit cards where they can go into any store and buy whatever they want.  A bitcoin debit card like this will solve that problem.  It will make bitcoin easy to spend in any retail store where visa is accepted, which is just about everywhere.

In order for bitcoin to get big, it needs to be easily accessible to people who are not at all technical.

I encourage people to just open a basic online wallet (eg xapo.com, coinbase.com, circle.com or bitstamp.com) and explain then give them a few web-sites where they can spend their bitcoin if and when they want to spend it, eg to buy gift cards, etc

Interesting.  Thanks for the input; that was not something I had considered.  My main concern is that some of the main selling points of bitcoin are now failing (immediate payments to anyone in the world virtually free of cost), and bitcoin is going to quickly lose appeal if we don't solve this soon with at least Segwit for now and at least a 2MB blocksize limit (+ Segwit) within the next 6 months or so.  If delays and high fees continue, bitcoin will lose its utility and appeal.

Although the black market rate is the real market price, it does not solve the problem for most people living in Venezuela (or other countries with strict capital or currency controls).  In order to get the black market price you need to have US Dollars on hand.  If you are an average guy getting your wage in the local currency with no access to US Dollars, you will not be able to afford to buy the McDonalds French Fries.  That's why tourists find the residents of those countries so desperate for US Dollars, even in small amounts.  Bottom line is the discrepancy between the black market price and the official price in local currency is not meaningless.  It is very meaningful for the unfortunate people who live and work in those countries.

I would agree with you, when it comes to substantial funds, but remember the context of this thread:  The OP has only a small amount and some trepidation about paper wallets, cold storage, or even managing private keys. My point is that if you have only a few hundred dollars worth and you don't have the time, knowledge or inclination to buy trezor or to manage cold storage, or even to manage &amp; safely store private keys, and you prefer online wallets like xapo or coinbase, that is fine for small amounts of money but you are quite simply more secure if you spread it out among various wallets vs keeping them all in 1 wallet.  Chances are slim any one of them gets hacked or goes out of business, but if one of them does, you only lose a small portion of your funds (and we are talking about small funds to begin with).  I did not recommend online wallets for long-term storage of substantial funds.

We do put it out there as an option.  We have added the 'Bitcoin Accepted' logo to every page of our web-site as well as logos on our office door etc.  We have emailed various clients &amp; vendors as well.  Will continue to remind people, but the reason it is slow-going is 2-fold:  The obvious issue that most people are still ignorant of BTC which we can work on and ultimately fix, but secondly in many countries I believe bitcoin is still either prohibited or somehow restricted.  We have several vendors in India where I believe there is some restriction, but will discuss it with them to find out more.  (In India, up until a few years ago, their government mandated that they present documents through the banks as L/Cs or collections, meaning hundreds of dollars per transaction in fees for both sides.  It took years of pressing and I believe some liberalization in India for the direct wire transfer to be accepted).  It's still over-priced and too many banks involved, but at least its an improvement.  Bitcoin would be a much better improvement.  If governments do not get in the way (as they too often do) bitcoin will be wildly successful...it just might take a couple more years before widespread adption

Good point.  One of many we could make.  I think most holders of bitcoin, while optimistic for long-term price appreciation, recognize there could be significant price corrections along the way.  We've had a good strong price run so far this year, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see a correction at some point.  My issue with the writer of this article (like many others) is that without sufficient understanding of the subject, he seems to conclude that bitcoin has no real value at all, going so far as to call it digital ephemera.  He seems to place no value on the utility or the limited supply.  Who knows what will happen with the bitcoin price going forward.  No one should invest what they cannot afford to lose, but I remain optimistic about the long-term value.

I believe security is a significant issue, especially for the average person who is not tech-savy.  Even for those with the knowledge of cold storage and how to make paper wallets offline etc, it seems there are stories of users who have apparently lost access to some of their coins.  That is very scary for a non tech-savy user.  Keeping their deposits in online wallet services is also scary as these are not FDIC insured so someone can be legitimately concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy of the company hosting their wallet, and thus losing their deposit.

I support Segwit, but your comment here might mislead someone unfamiliar with the scaling debate.  Many of those opposed to Segwit have been promoting larger block sizes to accommodate more transactions and thus reduce congestion.  I hope Segwit is adopted soon so we can move on and relieve some of the congestion in the network, but nevertheless I don't think it's quite fair to accuse those who favor larger blocks of preferring congestion.  Who knows, maybe some people prefer congestion, but I would hope that most people in the bitcoin community realize we need to reduce congestion and we need to do so quickly.

'Plenty of people have been bankrupted' betting on Bitcoin...?  Not sure that's true.  Do you have any evidence of that?  Bitcoin has gone from worth less than 1 penny to worth now $2000 each... it's hard to imagine anyone bankrupted by that.  As far as wealthy investors I think many of the wise ones are investing modest amounts in BTC due to the long-term potential gains.  Wealthy investors are going to diversify in any case and hold a broad range of investments.  I doubt any of them would put their entire portfolio into BTC, or into any one single investment for that matter.

Absolutely you could set that up. Coinbase offers that service as well I think.  So far I haven't gotten any clients to pay us in BTC and haven't been able to pay vendors with BTC.  One day hopefully I can get both clients and vendors to accept/pay BTC and if so, I would just balance it out and not convert to fiat - would just hold separate currency accounts.  Conversion to fiat generally costs about 1% on the major exchanges (not bad in that it's far less expensive than converting fiat currencies at retail quiosks or at banks) but that is an impediment for large transactions if you cant balance out to some extent the payables &amp; receivables.  For example, if 1 FCL I import has a USD 35,000 invoice value, the 1% conversion cost would be approx. USD 350 for my vendor if they are just converting directly to fiat.  That is actually far higher than the bank w/t fees and about the same as the bank documentary collection fees.  So the key for long term B2B success and especially import-export transactions would be widespread adoption wherein a business could both buy and sell at least to some of their clients in BTC and with the offset, avoid the 1% currency conversion cost.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:38:13
Excellent point.  Maybe some don't care about widespread adoption, but I believe we need widespread adoption (or at least much wider than it is now) for bitcoin to remain viable and to increase in value.  It needs to be easier for the average person to use and securely store funds.

However since you seem fixated on Zimbabwe and I happen to know people who lived there, I can tell you that Mugabe's government indeed created the problems that Zimbabwe faces today, including the hyperinflation, and no that was not a consequence of 'the war costs', it was the consequence of a narcissistic, evil, brutal, and racist dictator who was not content just to steal land from productive farmers throughout the country, he wanted an endless supply of money and thought he could print his way to wealth.

If your first BTC purchase was at 1734, just prepare yourself for the possibility that you will be in the red soon, but stick with it and wait it out if you believe in the technology long-term.  BTC can be a roller coaster at times, and we had a long bear-market in 2014 and 2015.  As far as your proposed mining business, you are probably better off for not doing it.  Mining is really only profitable if you are in an area with subsidized electricity or very cheap electricity in any case.  If you are in an area with relatively high electricity costs it is never profitable, and average electricity costs you would still find new, expensive ASICs to be obsolete less than a year after you get them.

Obviously you made that up.  You could not have possibly bought at 1700 two years ago.  Two years ago the price of Bitcoin was around USD 200, so if you bought 2 years ago at USD 200 you would be sitting pretty right now at 2200.

Bitcoin has very clear advantages, even if most people are not yet familiar with it.  With bitcoin you can pay someone anywhere in the world instantly and virtually free of charge.  If you used Western Union or a bank wire there would be a significant cost and it would take longer.  There is no easier way to send small amounts of money internationally.
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:29:39
I run an import-export business and the ways that payments are effected in international business remain astoundingly inefficient.  If people are not prohibited from using bitcoin or digital currencies in their home countries, once they learn the speed and efficiency of it, there is no doubt in my mind that 10 years from now they will look back and find it amazing they were still paying/receiving funds in 2015 using L/Cs, Documentary collections and even wire transfers.  Banks charge literally hundreds of dollars for each L/C or documentary collection they handle for our shipments.  A few years ago I finally convinced all of my overseas vendors to accept direct wire transfer (W/T) which costs only about USD 35-50 to send internationally and in most cases USD 15-30 to receive (per transaction).  But it's still not as efficient as bitcoin and it's far more costly.  The banks routinely pilfer extra fees in between.  More often than not, when I receive a W/T payment from a client overseas, it comes in USD 25-50 less than what they paid.  They show proof they paid the full amount, and my bank also charges me an additional USD 15 to receive the wire, but somewhere in between an intermediary bank pilfers another USD 50 on top of the w/t fee my client paid and the fee I paid to receive it.  That is on each and every transaction.  The scary thing is all of that is cheap compared to D/P, D/A documentary collections.  Once people realize they can pay/receive funds instantly and virtually for free anywhere in the world, bitcoin will succeed.

I recently paid the recommended fee sending from the Blockchain.info wallet and it hung up pending for 10 days before finally being confirmed.  Re: OP, even if it's a large transaction, IMO it still should not cost $26 to send a payment.  That's more than double what I pay the brick &amp; mortar bank to send a domestic wire transfer, and it's more than 25X costlier than sending an ACH payment through the bank.  Banks should not be cheaper than bitcoin.  This is getting to be a problem.  I'm all for approving Segwit but that is only going to be a temporary solution.  The block size limit is simply too low, and it's a problem that needs to be fixed soon.

Sorry, but which exactly are you referring to as the "centralized coin", and who exactly has said they "would like to remove the cap"...? Are you referring to the cap on the quantity of bitcoins that can be mined?  I haven't heard anyone on either side of the scaling debate ever propose removing the cap, so I'm just curious what you're referring to here.  Could you clarify?
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:38:23
Your English is fine, and thank you for writing to clarify your thoughts.  I would hope and assume that all of us in the bitcoin community are opposed to any significant centralization as that is contrary to one of Bitcoin's primary features.  However I am not aware of anyone, on any side of any debate about scaling, who has proposed removing the 21MM cap on total quantity of BTC that can be mined.  In fact it makes no sense, which is why I questioned it.  Even if one large player were to gain a majority of hashing power, it would be counter to everyone's interest, including theirs, to remove the cap.  The important point now is to reach consensus on scaling to accommodate more transactions.  We need more space in the blocks and we need it now.  I am fine with the UASF to allow for some growth in the immediate term, but people will have to work together to find a longer term solution at some point.  I just sent 0.3 BTC from an online wallet to my hardware wallet and I paid the full recommended fee, actually a larger fee than other recent transactions, but even with the fee this payment still hung in limbo for 10 days... This is a problem.  The blocks are packed full and there is no way there will be wider adoption if users are told it could easily take 5-10 days for a payment to go through, when they could do a regular bank ACH and pay less in fees, and have it take only 2 days.   
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:59:15

If anyone is keeping any significant amount of BTC on Bitstamp, or any online wallet service or exchange, they are foolish.  That was true already, but even more so as August 1 approaches.  Do not hold any meaningful balances on Bitstamp, or other exchanges. Aside from the known risks, after the HF on Aug 1, assuming it happens, BTC you hold and control with your private keys will be copied to BCC, so you will have 1 BCC for each BTC you had before the split.  Sure, BCC could end up being of low value, but so what...?  It's free money, whatever it turns out to be worth.  We will not know what it is worth until after the split, and of course the value will likely fluctuate, but the point is it could likely have some value, and it is free money.  Whether it fetches USD 100, 200 or 1000 after the split, why turn away free money by letting companies like Bitstamp hold your funds?

I'm no expert but I don't believe it would work that way.  If you have BTC already on Kraken, then yes, they will show 1 BCH for each BTC you had stored there prior to the HF on Tuesday.  However if you simply transfer BTC from some other exchange or online wallet to Kraken after the HF, I believe you might have only BTC.  I have asked a question on this and as I understand it, you would need BTC either stored pre-fork on a place that will split it for you, or you need to control your own private keys.  In the case of the latter, you can import your private key twice: first transfer it all to another BTC wallet, then immediately import the same private key to a separate BCH wallet.  As the private key existed before the HF, it will be valid on both chains.

Coinbase also has a vault with delayed retrieval which is more secure than the standard online wallet, as well as Xapo as someone else noted.  Another suggestion is to open a couple of other online wallet accounts (eg Circle, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, etc) and just spread out your funds across many wallets.  That way, even in the unlikely scenario one of those sites were to go down, you would still have most of your BTC safe in other wallets.

Probably too late at this point to move it out before the HF, but worth a try.  Not the end of the world though if you just let it sit there until things settle down.

Coinbase is useful for buying bitcoin, but it is just not safe to store large amounts on any online wallet service whether Coinbase or any other.  Once you buy and the BTC is available in your wallet, transfer to your mobile wallet or to any hardware wallet (Trezor, Keepkey, etc) or any cold storage.  You could just print a paper wallet, transfer to your paper wallet address and stick it in your safe.
EDIT: Think of Coinbase as a bank but without FDIC insurance, and with very thin (sometimes non-existent) customer support.  You would think twice about keeping a lot of money in any bank without the FDIC insurance, right?  Well add to that no telephone # to call customer support and having to wait days, weeks or sometimes even months for a customer support response.  I don't mean to dump too hard on Coinbase, as it is useful to use for buying/selling your BTC to USD, but it's just not wise to use it for long-term storage.

Even if it were not an even exchange, by asking for BTC in exchange for BCC, in whatever ratio, you would be ascribing some value to BCC, meaning it is not worthless, or 'DOA'.  Many people in recent days in this sub and on this thread have been calling BCC worthless before it starts.  By you stating it is 'Dead on Arrival', it just seemed you were joining in that chorus.  Look, I have no idea if BCC will have low value, or high value, or if it will die off, but I sure want to keep my BCC to find out, as do you apparently, so maybe we're on the same page.  I don't expect you to give your BCC to anyone, but I also think it's premature for people on this thread to be implying it's worthless, as many have.  None of us know yet what it will be worth.

Most r/btc users are simply passionate big-blockers (many of them already banned from this sub years ago) who might indeed resent this sub, but I highly doubt they're spending time trying to down-vote a quality post here like this one.

Ok, Mr. Redditor for 4 days, I'm not very interested in spending a lot of time and energy explaining my investment strategies to you in detail.  Let's just say I've done well for myself and I'm happy with what I have. But if I must explain at least a few things:
I would maintain what I said before: It is far easier to know when you are in a Bear market than it is to pick the optimal moment to sell (near the peak) of a bull run.  That's what it comes down to. If I had known that 19.5K was the peak in Dec 2017, yes of course I would have sold most of what I had, paid my taxes and then bought back in much lower.  But I didn't know it at the time.  Hindsight is 20/20.  You are using the benefit of hindsight to question why most of us did not sell at the peak. The honest answer is because we didn't know it was the peak (although I did post online several times in late 2017 that the bull run was incredibly good but that a market correction was due to come at some point soon).
Anyway I'm glad you joined Reddit 4 days ago so that you can come on here and start questioning  investment strategy.  I believe it is very difficult to identify a peak, so while I will be perfectly willing to sell some of my Bitcoin holdings on the next bull run, I will still hold most of it because I believe in it long term.  Sorry if that does not suit your own investment preferences, but maybe you can do your thing, and I can do mine.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:56:16
Capital Gains Taxes would be one reason.  
Apart from that, it is indeed easier to identify a protracted bear market than it is to identify the actual peak of a bull market.  I never knew the actual low point in 2015 when it dipped below 200, but I knew while it was hovering around 200-250 that was a bargain price, so I slowly accumulated.
I remember when BTC hit 3k, 4k, 5k etc I thought it was an amazing run &amp; I was tempted to sell most of it.  If I had sold, I would have watched it from the sidelines rising much further. Yes of course I didnt have the foresight to sell when it was &gt; 18K, but I’m ok holding.
Finally, I’m not in it as a trader trying to make a quick buck. I’m in Bitcoin for the long haul, because I believe in it.

Probably fair to say the crypto community is overwhelmingly *libertarian*, but not "liberal" in the modern sense of the word, which is more tied in with big government and increasing government control.

This might be just a semantic argument, but Bitcoin is inherently deflationary.  It's not curtailing inflation, it's actual deflation: 1 BTC *should* (assuming demand) have more &amp; more purchasing power in the future, albeit with short term bull markets &amp; bear markets all along.  Even without the % of lost coins (which is a significant factor), having a fixed maximum supply should be deflationary long term.

Me too.  I'm another ancient Gen-X guy.  My biggest regret is using around 15 BTC back in 2014 (spread across several different orders) to buy Silver when I thought silver was such a bargain at around $22-23 /oz (down off of its highs over $40), and to me Bitcoin was still too new, so I figured converting it to silver was a safe investment.  I accumulated around 250 ounces of silver.  That silver is now worth around $4K.  Had I just held onto the BTC, it would be around $90K worth of extra BTC in my portfolio.  I always feel smart when I think about it.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:52:07
I would definitely recommend you not store funds on any exchange.  Keeping an account on an exchange might be useful if you need to trade cryptos, but you really should not maintain any significant balances there. In the case of Bitfinex it's definitely not lack of KYC in most cases (I suppose it could be in some of those cases, IDK). Coinbase worked very well for me and when I did withdrawal some time ago it was instant. Same day. There was absolutely no wait. 
But still, if you really want to control your own funds, then control your keys. BRD is a great mobile wallet. Also, you could get a Trezor, or Ledger Nano, or KeepKey, or safely print paper wallets, laminate them and store in safe deposit boxes, then use your mobile wallet to sweep when you need to spend.  But using an exchange like Bitfinex is not necessary and definitely not advisable.  
You asked my advice, so I gave it :)  Anyway, sincerely, best of luck to you whatever you do...
Added in edit:
PS: I saw many Bitfinex depositors getting the bank wire delay excuse, and none of those were ever logical excuses Bitfinex was giving. I send and receive international wires all the time in business, and they are immediate, with value date the same day they are effected. Bitfinex has used that excuse many times, always blaming banks, but meanwhile they leave their depositors hanging for months and often do not communicate well with them. That's bad service.

Ok, but to my understanding, inflation of a currency is when the purchasing power of said currency declines.  When purchasing power increases, that is deflation (at least that’s what I recall learning in economics an eternity ago). By that definition, Bitcoin has been extremely deflationary through its short 9 year history since it was first used as a currency (traded for goods).  Yes, I understand the remaining  supply will continue to be mined for another 100-110 years or so, but in my mind that does not make it inflationary at all as long as purchasing power rises over time.

 *"The supply isn't going down. The* ***growth in supply*** *is going down."*
I think everyone gets that...(at least I *assume* everyone gets that).  However, with fiat currencies there is ever-expanding supply without limit, and governments are incentivized to continue expanding money supply (probably more so in the future given the relatively high levels of national debt among some countries). With Bitcoin, since the total supply that can ever exist is fixed, and moreover since some coins have been lost and more will continue to be lost in the future, the supply limit is inherently deflationary with respect to BTC pricing, in that the purchasing power of 1 BTC should continue to grow over time.
No one can predict the future with certainty, but it is clear fact that the purchasing power of Bitcoin has increased exponentially since it was first traded for goods/services in 2010.  In just the first 9 years of it's history, its purchasing power has increased by more than a million-fold.  That's some serious price deflation.

Fair enough, but I can think of several examples in recent history.  Bitcoin in 2011 lost over 90% if its value after a huge price surge up to $30+.  My favorite though is more recent.  Bitcoin in all of 2015 was hovering around $200-250 following  that surge pre-Mt Gox where it had surged up to $1140.  The part I find fascinating is this:  when looking at the historical price chart around Jan 2015, it looked at that time exactly like it does today.  The huge spike up to 19.8K has since dwarfed the last spike to 1140 so much that the prior spike is only a blip on today’s chart.  But at the time, in 2015, I remember thinking that BTC seems to be dying a slow death, and it seemed like it might never hit 1000 again, or even 500.

You're right that both major parties are primarily comprised of corporate minions. No doubt about that. But there is no way at all that 100% of Republicans would be for a ban. Think about it: until last year Republicans had control of both houses of congress, and they didn't make any effort to bad crypto-currencies. Now that the Democrats have the House, a Democratic Congressman from California is proposing banning all cryptos. Some members of both parties would support that bill, but I'm guaranteeing you that not all Republicans would support it, and I'm betting more Democrats than Republicans would vote for that bill to ban cryptos.  We will see.  I just hope their effort fails.

Sample letter  
Dear Senator [Name]:
I am writing to express my opposition to proposed legislation S. 1241 proposed by Senator Grassley.  This legislation poses as an effort to combat money laundering and other crimes, but it represents nothing less than an Orwellian infringement on civil liberties and a gross overreach by government against the citizens of the USA.  S. 1241 would allow the federal government not only to 
seize a person's assets without due process, something that happens with Civil Asset Forfeiture, but they can furthermore imprison someone for up to 10 years for neglecting to fill out one piece of paper declaring if they happen to be carrying more than $10K worth of any combination of monetary instruments including digital currencies, cash or prepaid gift cards.  This represents a massive abuse of government power.  I am asking you to please oppose this legislation and vote No to Senator Grassley's proposed legislation S. 1241.  Thank you for your time.

Your main point about finally forcing their hand is obviously correct.  However many people could genuinely find this post disingenuous as BIP148 is making the change, ie. they could legitimately argue if they remain on the legacy chain as always, that they are not the ones forking.  We might find that on Aug 1 the majority of miners find their financial incentives overwhelming to jump on with UASF and if that happens, it will be a relief to most members of the community and the market should strengthen, at least in the near term.

This is precisely why we have a problem that will be made worse if S. 1241 passes and becomes law.  Law enforcement officials around the country (worse in some jurisdictions than in others) have been taking advantage of Civil Asset Forfeiture laws on the books since the 1980's.  Using CAF law enforcement can confiscate any of your property that they purport was somehow involved in a crime, whether or not they charge you with any crime.   If they catch you with more cash than they think you should be carrying, they can say they believe it was part of a drug deal, and confiscate your cash.  They do not need to charge you, much less convict you of any crime.  With CAF they are actually charging the property itself with a crime, in a sense, and the property cannot defend itself so it loses.  One convenience store owner had his entire bank account frozen because he was depositing his store receipts every week at the bank, but they were on average around $8-9K, so the gov't accused him of 'structuring' his deposits to avoid the 10K reporting limit, and they froze his account.  In another case, a college-age kid apparently sold a very small quantity of drugs to some friends at his parent's house.  The government seized the house from the parents since the house was "involved" in a crime, even though they had no knowledge of it and they were never charged with any crime.  Civil Asset Forfeiture is a major crime being perpetrated on the American people by federal, state &amp; local governments all across this country.

Understood your point regarding supply, but AFAIK BTC price *deflation* to date has exceeded the rate of any currency price deflation in world history.  In the 9 years since BTC was first used as a currency to purchase goods/services:
2010 price for 2 pizzas:  10,000 BTC
2019 price for 2 pizzas:  0.0029 BTC
That's some serious price deflation :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:26:13
Yes.  (However, IMO it is unlikely that BTC + BCC (BCH) combined will be worth significantly more than BTC is today.)  More likely than not the initial value of BCC (BCH) will be very low as initial mining should be unprofitable, and some holders will likely cash out to BTC, but once the difficulty re-sets lower, if some of the larger mining pools devote significant hash-power to mining BCH then it could increase in value.  I would say there is almost no chance at all it will be worth anything close to $1000 on Aug 2.  But still, anyone leaving their funds on Coinbase is just foolish as they are giving up the value of the BCH to which they are entitled, whatever that value turns out to be.

The end of your comment underscores the main point: rather than complaining about the prospect of declining USD strength or importance and threatening to ban crypto-currencies, this congressman should consider an alternative approach.

How is that "run-of-the-mill"...? Making depositors wait months for a simple withdrawl is not "run-of-the-mill" for a good, honest exchange. That's not even to mention the alleged hack where they took 36% of all depositors' funds, converted those to BFX tokens, which was convenient for Bitfinex, but a loss for all of their depositors who had to wait to eventually convert those but at a value far below the current market value of Bitcoin when they were finally able to convert. If you really have funds with Bitfinex, good luck. You'll need it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:22:15
Many people confuse deflation with inflation, when in fact they are opposite.  Due to the finite supply, increasing mining difficulty and scheduled reductions in block rewards, if bitcoin survives it will get increasingly more valuable, ie prices in bitcoin should go down, while prices in fiat currency tend to go up in the long run as fiat currencies tend to be at least mildly inflationary.

I can fully distinguish between economic policy and social organization. I also understand that you cannot have fully collectivist, socialist government (wherein the government representing the collective owns and operates the full spectrum of the means of production) without also having totalitarian rule.  It has been proven throughout our history that such regimes require totalitarian rule to maintain control.  If you think you can find examples to the contrary, please share, but please do your research first and do not fall into the trite but fallacious examples of western european democracies, as they are actually capitalist countries.  Despite what many on the left believe, Denmark, Sweden, etc are in fact capitalist countries.  They have higher personal income tax rates and stronger social security and social programs, but they are capitalist because their industries are mostly privately owned, and in fact their corporate tax rates are LOWER than the corporate tax rates in the United States.  Find me examples of communist countries or other fully hard-line socialist countries that are free, open and democratic.  I am eager to hear an example so please do share.

I guess the idea is that bitcoin mining worldwide should always be decentralized. Unlike other industries where an invention benefits all, and the inventors of that deserve to be protected to earn profit for their work that has some benefit to the market as a whole, in bitcoin mining if one company makes a substantially more efficient mining rig that could quickly render others obsolete, and if they are allowed to patent it, then mining has the potential to be overly centralized.  The others in the market have no reason to want to protect one player, ie to give one player exclusive rights for such an invention, because all others would be better off if they did not invent it (unless it was available to all).

It's very difficult to imagine a mining operation funded by 416K creating many jobs.  If this is a grant, as was initially stated, it seems someone has convinced the State of MT to give them tax dollars, and its probably another example of taxpayer dollars wasted, lining someone's pockets.  I would have much more respect for MT if they financed a bitcoin mining operation and ran it, using the proceeds to help fund the government and if they are able to do so profitably (a big if) then eventually reducing the burden on the taxpayers.

You can educate me on this, but ideally the HF to 2MB would not split Bitcoin according to proponents of Segwit2x, right?  If there is very strong consensus for Segwit2x among miners and exchanges, as there now appears to be, then after Segwit is implemented, when the time comes for the 2MB blocksize 6 months later, wouldn't most miners build on the forked chain so that there would still be only one chain?  If the consensus remains strong, it just seems like the overwhelming economic incentive for all miners would be to follow the new chain, meaning we would stay intact with just one surviving chain.

I gladly would just cancel it and do a new transfer with a higher fee, but it sounds like I will be stuck waiting 14 days...  Definitely a serious problem with Blockchain.info.  I would recommend anyone stay away from their wallet service as it is clearly much worse than other online wallets.

The real problem is that you could be carrying a Trezor or Keepkey and if your wallet balance is over $10K, or even less if you happen to be carrying some cash or gift cards at the same time, then you could technically be found guilty, so they could use this to get someone if they have no other evidence but just feel someone is guilty of something.  This is a bad Bill masquerading as an anti-crime and anti-money laundering legislation.  Everyone should write their Senators to oppose S. 1241.

Simple.  Find any known exchanges on which OneCoin is actually traded.  There are none.  If it cannot be cashed out on any exchange, it has no value.  Just advise him to sell half of his holdings for USD or EUR, liquidate half as a test to see if it really has value, and then he can always immediately buy back in if he wants to.  Once he realizes he cannot sell it, he should realize it's a scam.

In a 60 minute TV program you're likely to have approx. 17-18 minutes of commercials, so approx. 42 minutes of actual programming content.  The TV show "60 minutes" is normally divided into several segments.  This particular hour had 3 segments, the last of which was about Bitcoin.  The actual content of the Bitcoin segment was approx. 13-14 minutes.

This web-site is obviously bogus, created for the specific purpose of listing OneCoin as if it were a traded currency.  It does not appear to be a currency that is actually traded on any known exchange.

I believe BIP148 already has around 12%, no?  But as I recall even Luke-jr said it would need at least around 25% to survive.  I don't quite follow you that if BIP148 has only 15% then the other 85% is crushed.  I can see there being 2 chains, but I don't see why the longer chain would be crushed.  Can you help explain it?  In your note above you said 21% from the legacy chain would be needed to "attack" the 20% that went to BIP148.  Why would they have to attack anything?  Again I think BIP148 will likely get more than 15-20% so I'm not predicting that to be the case, but if they do only get 15-20%, why couldn't the other 80-85% of hashpower continue mining the legacy chain?

My understanding is that Bitmain says they support Segwit2x, and if that is adopted by August 1 ie before BIP148, then no HF.  Someone can correct me if I'm mistaken.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:03:57
You seem to be conflating the UAHF announced by Bitmain and Segwit2x. These are not the same thing.  To the contrary, even Bitmain said they would not do HF as long as Segwit2x is adopted before the August 1 date set by BIP148.  There seems to be strong consensus in favor of the New York agreement and Segwit2x.

breadwallet on your phone is a good option.  If you mean specifically another online wallet, Xapo is not bad.  Better than Coinbase anyway.  But it's never wise to keep substantial funds on any online wallet service.  Keep on breadwallet, or move your funds to paper wallets, or to your hardware wallet once it arrives.

Excellent points made regarding this bear market vs. the last one, but Bobby Lee was simply saying *IF* this one plays out like the last one, then this is what would happen in 2020-2021. As you correctly point out, if anything, the outlook for Bitcoin should probably be even better than that. We will see.
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:29:53
Sorry, but I don't follow your logic here.  His bank sent $200,000 to Coinbase and the funds were received by Coinbase.  Not sure what possible reason Coinbase would have for accepting a regular ACH but not accepting an overnight ACH, but in any case, Coinbase has the funds.  Why can't they just credit his account?  Even 2 weeks would be too long, but after 4 weeks that's just ridiculous.

In all likelihood, far higher than that within the next few years, though we might still have another year or two to go in the current bear market, if it's anything like the last one (2014-2016). Whenever the next bull run strikes, I would guess it should go far higher than 40K. Having said that, there are of course no guarantees, and there is also the chance, however small, that it might go the other direction.

Agreed.  Olaf was excellent.  The other guy...not so much.

I think you misunderstood my post.  I have a Trezor and understand the benefits of a hardware wallet.  I also believe keeping paper wallets in a safe are a good form of cold storage. In your post above you seemed to imply one would need to go to an internet cafe or public place to sweep a paper wallet, and I simply meant to point out that you do not need to do that.  I would never take a paper wallet out in public.  However it takes only a second to use your mobile wallet to scan the private key and sweep the paper wallet funds into your mobile wallet, which you can use to spend or send anywhere you want.

Serious question:  If August 1 arrives and only 20% of hashpower runs with BIP148, then will you really consider the other 80% of Bitcoin hashpower on the legacy chain to be some "other coin"...?  I'm not saying that's what I personally want to see or what I think will happen, I'm just asking.

Could you please clarify this statement?  If we have a 2 MB block with Segwit containing 4 MB or even double that at some point would require a $20,000 machine to run a full node...?  Not sure that's quite true, but please advise.

True.  It is the Coindesk price index (not Coinbase) that crossed 3000 and has been holding in the 3000-3020 range for the better part of the last 3 hours.  Bitfinex, Huobi and OkCoin all crossed 3000 (the latter is over 3100).  Most others I checked are still hovering around 2960-2990.  Coinbase, 2999.

Excellent posts above btw.  Thank you for the analysis.  However there is a way to dramatically reduce the occurrence:  Localbitcoins could post a warning on their site and could use Safetrader.io as an example of a scam to avoid.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:16:20
To your point  above, is the information we've all been reading incorrect?  From numerous sources I've read that among the supporters of Segwit2x are OKCoin, Huobi, BTCCPool, Bitmain, F2Pool, BTC.Top, ViaBTC, BiXin, BW, 1Hash, Canoe, BATPool, Bitkan and others.  Barry Silbert noted the hash power of these pools exceeds 80% of Bitcoin network.  That would seem to me to be strong consensus.

And as long as you're not taking out loans or a 2nd mortgage or anything like that to finance said investment.  IMO Investing in Bitcoin is advisable long term but it is never wise to go into debt to do it. I advise people to treat it like buying stock in a company you like.  Buy conservatively, accumulate &amp; hold long term.

No, it's not the same.  The new "OneCoin" is a Multi-level marketing scam that entices those without any real understanding of cryptocurrencies, convincing them to buy a package, and then they are locked in and their only hope is to convince others to come in behind them to keep it going.

Trezor is a good hardware wallet, and you should keep your recovery seed in at least 2 separate and secure locations.  You can also keep paper wallets for additional BTC.  Print them off-line, use a hardwired printer (no wifi), laminate each wallet and put them in your safe.  Never re-use an address.  Whenever you finally retrieve funds from a paper wallet, import the private key to sweep the entire balance.  For that reason you should limit the amount you keep on any one paper wallet.
