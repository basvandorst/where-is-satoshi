It is right on the cusp. It most likely will be considered threatened soon. I read about what the IUCN said.

All I read is 'MARKETING GIMMICK!' Also, you have to pay for shipping on top of that price? Eat me.

Read the guys damn comments! He is not eco-friendly at all! He is using a tree that is going to be put on the threatened list and another that is basically a weed. He blatantly said that he does not buy North American wood. That means he ships his wood supply from another country, most likely China. None of that is Eco-friendly. And to top it off he makes claims like it moves your hair grease, no other comb will do this. Bullshit, a comb is a comb. No I will not shut up. Why are you supporting him? Because he supports Bitcoin? Who cares about that. If you cared about your bitcoins you would not support him because he is ripping you off with that $40 price tag.

You are FAR from Eco-friendly. So far from it that I think you are misleading the public about your brand. Almost false advertising.

I have seen wooden combs before for $2. Made from god knows what, but still only $2. Also, the teeth break easier with wooden combs compared to vinyl. And if you are not buying Paulownia from North America, how is that Eco-friendly? You have your Paulownia shipped from China or elsewhere then? On a big ass boat?

Ok, but how are you Eco friendly if you are selling combs made from Burmese Blackwood? You are contributing to the problem of this species going extinct.

I went one year without using shampoo as a dare from my wife. I used a 50 cent comb and my fingers. I had no problems with my hair. I did not need a $40 comb made from endangered trees being sold by a guy who claims they are 'eco-friendly'. Also, 5% off but I have to pay shipping? I assume I would also have to pay customs fees to ship to another country as well. Hell, I'll go to the local drug store and buy a $5 comb and save myself a wad of cash.

I live 2 blocks away from a gas station in a small town in the middle of nowhere. You can get a vinyl comb at the till for 50 cents. Fuck your 5% off of a $40 comb.

I see it differently. I see a guy who claims he is Eco-friendly when clearly, with his own words I might add, is not. He uses wood from overseas. He is overcharging as well. And he makes claims that it moves oils and such. This comb is no different than vinyl except for the fact that some vinyl gets staticy. So you, my friend, are being a dick. Buy one of his over priced combs and stick it up your ass.

You are not the first Bitcoin pet store. Google it.
