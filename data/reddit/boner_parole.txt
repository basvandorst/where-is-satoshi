Yeah, but how many legitimate businesses incorporate bittorrents/hacking? If the US starts moving to declare BTC illegal, I can see a lot of US businesses avoiding it.

I don't have an education background in economics or finance. Why isn't it reasonable to make that comparison?

The context was one of optimizing in general. Sometimes it's premature, sometimes it's appropriate. How was my use of the phrase wrong when speaking in the general context?

Okay, the physical uses of gold don't drive the price. What other tangible uses does gold have and how much do they drive the price? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, most of the value comes from the fact that people value it. Which is the same as Bitcoin.

In my experience CoffeeScript is easier to read, easier to write (in 99% of the cases), and is pretty much a 1:1 correlation with Javascript. I've introduced at least a half-dozen developers with varying proficiency in JS to CS, and they've all picked it up with ease.

You're not a liar, just confused.

I thought that the physical uses of gold were a very small part of its value, and that most of its value comes from scarcity and the fact that people choose to value it. Is that incorrect?

No argument there. And I never said that you can do it in every situation. But it's the wrong thing to optimize until you *know* that it's going to be a problem. Engineer time is the better priority, IMO.
Not everyone that warns about premature optimization is a script kiddie. I'm guessing you wouldn't dismiss [Donald Knuth]( in that way.

So then in that specific case it's not premature optimization.
I get it, finding optimal solutions and ensuring there are no wasted cycles is very satisfying. But not every system needs that kind of performance, and it's easy to introduce unneeded complexity solving a non-problem.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:58:17
Your point?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:30:43
Ah, but "need to optimize" varies. A bottleneck isn't a problem if it can still handle the amount of liquid you need to pour through it without backing up. And most often we can build bigger bottles, or just use more of them (better hardware, scale horizontally, etc).
As to your "actual engineer" comment, [it's a logical fallacy](
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:35:40
Choosing to write an entire module/project/etc in C isn't an optimization, but it is when you have a project in a higher-level language and write portions of code in C instead. Doing so at an early stage can often be premature optimization.
