There are no BTC ATMs anywhere in the Balkans...
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:41:39
Ok, thanks
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:42:04
Then I should buy BTCs? But where? Where is safe and cheap?
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:43:19
Dont buy BTCs or Mining contracts?
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:41:20
Elaborate please?
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:42:39
I saw some offers on Ebay. I don't know about sites. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:46:51
So, like 2FA, but for multiple devices?
That's great stuff!

@_date: 2017-08-01 09:35:52
I think so too
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:35:19
Do you think there is a difference in transfer fees between apps?
I don't know how these apps earn money, do they even charge such fees? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:35:39
Useful info, thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:58:21
What is that?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:34:40
Jaxx is far from safe

And this is why BTC will never become a "mainstream" global currency.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:39:58
I didn't send them. It was an exchange company that wanted me to give them all my info. I have no clue how to buy them anomimously.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:35:45
I understand. Also, if BTC is about anonimity, how do you buy Bitcoins without having to send a picture of most important personal documents? How is that remotely private? 
Also, you didn't answer my question.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:46:37
Yeah, why?
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:52:25
You're right. I think you understand, you should be very careful when you deal with big amounts of money. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:05:40
Ok, that's a good advice, I didn't know that.
