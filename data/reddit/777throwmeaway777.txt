I'm looking at it like this...I own a small business. It isn't a technology business, I deal in physical inventory.  I enjoy the concept of peer-to-peer banking and I have always been enthusiastic about a currency that was not under the thumb of the super wealthy power brokers of the world.  But.  BTC is very volatile.  A couple weeks ago I had never heard of BCC but now I'm being told that I have to choose between by BTC and the newer BCC.  If I were a cryptocurrency investor then this might be an exciting time and I might just be SO happy about the changes in the market that could result in a huge profit for me.  But my life is extremely busy with other things.  Why would I ever choose to accept payment in BTC or BCC or keep a line of credit denominated in any crypto if the value could plunge or skyrocket at any time, seemingly without cause other than some miners in China decided to take their ball and go play their own version of the game.  Real businesses that deal in tangible goods that already have slim profit margins might never be able to join the cryptocurrency world unless it calms down and there are some basic rules governing the possible changes to the way the coins are used and traded.

All of your points are valid.

I have an Electrum wallet that comes with the TAILS installation.  Will by coins be vaporized?  What is BCC?  I thought the BtC community was talking about segwit versus segwit2MB but now I log on and there's BCC.  What is BitCoin Cash?
