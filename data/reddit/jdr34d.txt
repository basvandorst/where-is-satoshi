Guys this upward train without fundamentals is over.

My point is that neither of these were easy.  They were equal effort.  Dialing into your ISP was easy only because you had it saved.  First time setting it up always sucked, especially for a noob.  A few years ago a friend of mine found a floppy disk that had some emails that we had exchanged in 1996.  It was hilarious.  He was using Pine on VMS and was trying to learn all the functionality and asking me a bunch of questions about how to do things.
Glad to chat with someone that remembers the old days.
I think the link between this and the potential success of bitcoin is pretty weak though.  Lots of technologies that looked promising have failed, and bitcoin is not immune to that risk because of an analogy to one cherry-picked technology (email) that worked out.  Let's not forget the Apple Newton.  When Apple canned it and put all their weight behind the iPod, apple enthusiasts were pissed and said that the iPod was going nowhere and they wanted their Newtons.
Bitcoin was first-to-market, but that doesn't mean success either.  Look at MySpace or CommunityZero.  Bitcoin may very well have a future, but the market is highly segmented with a lot of competition and the ability for anyone to start a cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin may very well not have a long or opulent future.

Sorry man, but neither of these instructions were easy.  This definitely preceded broadband, which means you had to dial into your service provider using Procom+ or Telix. Then you would have to open up Pine or some other email app and send the email. Pine didn't make much sense.  It was cumbersome and a pain in the ass.
Edit. Typo

Yes agreed.  They were great for their time.
