I suggest a Bit-Card or Wallet-Card as gift. I think it could be positive for the Bitcoin community.

You have a great idea.
I suggest to you to create an account on an exchange to buy some Bitcoins.  is a good and safe exchange (USD &gt; BTC).
As offline wallet, I found some Wallet-Card set and it is more simple to use and to store than paper wallet.
You can order 2 or 3 identical wallet-card that you can store in different safe places and a receive card with the same address to make some deposits on the wallet.
The wallet cards have a QR code to check the amount available and you can scan it with a smartphone. You just need an App like i-nigma on your smartphone.
A set of 3 cards (2 idential wallet and a receive card) will cost you arround 25 USD + shipment fees (only Bitcoins accepted).
