It seemed sort of cryptic/vague, the post.

Why is everyone freaking out?
There is no way they can enforce this. They can't prove I own a bitcoin or have made a transaction with it. Even if they audit me, they can't prove I purchased BTC.
I can P2P mine all I want without paying a tax on my mined coins.

Hopefully he gets his "reward". I guess it was his fault for shooting the phone, but the great lengths he went to do it were pretty amazing.

Oh my god, I can finally trade cryptos again!
Too bad for the people who got their PayPal frozen due to their past policies. :(

Eh, if you use something like Coinbase as a payment platform you can instantly send funds/issue a complaint.

Yeah, this poster is so incorrect I'm going to suffer from a migraine. Bitcoin is just an alternative currency, not one to "revolutionize". The symbol of Rosie the Riveter is pro-government, and "Let them eat cake" is pretty much a way of saying you're on an ivory tower fueled by ignorance.
