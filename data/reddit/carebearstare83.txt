Multiple reports in this day and age can just mean trolls took the time to make up more than one article.

Yea, you should read the average libertarian's book collection. You will find plenty of people who understood rational self-interest before the time of even personal computing much less blockchain. The point about capitalism was fairly well made I think.
I suppose it *is* very exciting though. I just wonder if BTC can keep up with demand for smart contracts and micro transaction s.

Neat. 
...and pointless.

This post is stupid.

Please don't take this as condescencion, but I don't understand your post...
You only realize gains when you sell at higher than you bought. And if you transact the currency in exchange for a different product, such as a t-shirt or a pizza, you definitely don't realize any gains. 
And you don't pay income tax when you purchase products, you pay Sales tax and/or Use tax, the former of which generally isn't collected online(except by certain large retailers) and the latter is basically honor system, so very few people even know about it, much less pay it.
Also, plenty of people are paying income tax on their cryptocurrencies. They might be in the minority but to say no one is paying their income tax is inaccurate, especially since coinbase was forced to turn over records to the IRS.

United States courts have determined that crypto currencies are to be considered securities. If a minor can buy Securities, then you can buy cryptocurrencies legally. However I'm not exactly sure what the legality of that is. Hope this helps.

Granted I don't understand complex markets as well as I probably should, so this might be totally wrong but I feel like your model assumes too many elements of the market remain static. What bothers me most in this respect is the phrase "all things being equal". In a complex Market are all things ever really equal?
 Im not saying I don't see your point, but I think in reality it's a little more complex than that. 
That being said I realize that's the point of models: to simplify complexity down into something we can easily digest. But I think maybe this model is an oversimplification...

There's hundreds of billions sitting on the sidelines waiting for the perceived bottom. Once that money starts pouring back in I wouldn't be surprised if the hype this year is bigger than the hype from last year. When people start hearing about growth in the hundreds of percent there's bound to be hype.

I never said they do.
 I said cryptocurrencies are securities. you said I was wrong. 
Got any more straw man arguments you want to throw at me?
Edit: my comment was about the legality of him owning them not the tax burden. So again, your argument doesn't hold up. Never said you were wrong. Just that it doesn't have anything to do with what I said.
Second edit: try reading what someone actually said before responding with argument.

I agree that it may take significantly more time, but I think it'll happen.

I'm talking about the entire crypto market. The market cap was $560B at one point-possibly higher. Now it's in the 200s. There are lots of analysts that have said this.  It would be very surprising-highly unlikely even- for that money not to come back into the market.

Do you really believe that guy is Satoshi?
The guy's own mother came forward about his habit of lying.
And then there's the whole negative gamma comment.
I don't know one way or another but it certainly seems a bit too suspicious.
Also, I have a hard time believing someone would go through the trouble of hiding their identity and creating a strong pseudonymous identity, only to launch themselves suddenly into the public spotlight later and try to gather as much credit as possible and as little time as possible. Especially when it can, and did, get him into trouble.

I really don't understand why the crypto world didn't see this coming. Yeah I get that patents aren't exactly the Crypto-Anarchist way, but without them did anyone actually think the big movers and shakers wouldn't move into the crypto space and essentially just take it over? Major banks and fintech companies have been pursuing patents left and right. I'm not even sure where I stand on this, part of me thinks Sotoshi should have gotten a patent. The other part of me realizes that's counter to the entire endeavor.
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:19:57
Yeah, too bad it's only BTC for the moment.

Did anyone think this wouldn't happen? People only want wealth  redistribution when it benefits them. Bounded rationality plus self-interest does not always equal the evolution of cooperation. Systems and Complexity 101.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:09:39
oh surprise surprise more straw man arguments.
I didn't say whether it was wrong or right to think of crypto Securities I said the federal government does.
But more importantly Dude, you need to get a hobby.
I don't even care that much and you shouldn't either.

You are talking serious in-depth research. That's a bigger ocean than I'm willing to wade into. Hope you have some luck with it- it's a very interesting point of research. But China doesn't really like sharing data about things like that.
Good luck!

Your statement doesn't really hold up as an argument against my comment. Securities are considered property. So at least in that you're correct...
Edit: in further researching this topic I found that Securities are considered Cass 1 personal property
See here:
And yes, the courts ruled that they are securities...
See here:
Further, cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the Securities Exchange Commission. The Securities Exchange Commission only has jurisdiction over financial securities...

Hey no worries I definitely understand that. It's a serious problem not only here on Reddit but in society as a whole. Again I appreciate the correction. If I can come out the other side of a conversation like this more informed than I feel like the conversation was a success
And I definitely agree with you on that point. People are waiting on more than just price points. Regulation especially is the thing that makes the people I talk to nervous about investing.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:43:48
Ok, so my concept of market cap was a bit flawed. But lots of analysts have said there are billions waiting on the sidelines. So the point stands, despite my previously fallacious understanding of market capitalization.
I appreciate the correction, but maybe not so much condescension next time(not sure if it was intentional or not, so no worries). Just try to remember: Everyone has differing levels of understanding, mate.
