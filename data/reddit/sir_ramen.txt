Your reality will slowly become less recognizable, so slowly you won't even realize it.

I love getting on reddit for the first time today and seeing all these "It's the end of crypto" posts.

IMO the bubble has popped about 3 times already. 
I think crypto is more like the frothy drool from a rabid varmint then any single bubble.

Split a bit, hit a tit, flick a mick, something something.

No, the worth of my investment went up, so the buying power of my btc went up. One day I'll get a computer for the amount of my original investment, witch is enough to buy a couple bottles of wine.
