This is a step in the right direction and I applaud Coinbase for apparently implementing many bitcoin storage best practices. However, this does little to prove that Coinbase has more coins than it owes it's customers. At best, this audit shows that Coinbase has lots of coins in cold storage, but we don't know how that compares to their customer account balances. A day before Lehman Brothers collapsed, they had lots of valuable assets...the problem is that they had even more liabilities...
I'm not trying to insinuate Coinbase is on the verge of bankruptcy (I actually think Coinbase is one of the bitcoin community's most important and trustworthy players) but our community needs to continue to push for higher standards. I think we've all grown a little bit more skeptical over the last few days, and that's probably a good thing for bitcoin over the long term.

It would be very useful if Google automatically created an online bitcoin wallet associated with each Google account. It should be integrated in such a way that allows gmail and google+ users to send bitcoins to any of their contacts without exchanging public keys. This would significantly shallow the learning curve for new adopters, because they could receive and send bitcoins even if they didn't understand the backend or take active steps to create a wallet. The benefits to Google could be enormous if gmail and/or google+ became a p2p money transfer standard. I think Google is one of the best positioned companies to build the user interface that makes Bitcoin accessible, and I hope they do it before Facebook does.

I'm no expert, but this is not how I understand it. A bitcoin is not a thing, it's just a balance in the blockchain. They can't give an "invalid" bitcoin to the next person who try's to withdrawal. The problem is that they own less bitcoins than they think they owe their customers.

I don't think this is insider trading. Was Gox's announcement this morning really bad news? No, not really...it was no news. And that's why the market has been flat since the announcement. If it had been bad news, everyone would have continued selling when everybody learned about it. I think there was just one guy who decided to sell big last night and that just happened to be a few hours before Gox put out a meaningless press release. Most people are calling the announcement bad news because the price is down so much, not because the content was negative.

Bitpay has switched to a flat fee model. Coinbase doesn't charge a transaction fee for the first $1M. Worst case scenario the business pays 1% transaction fee, which is still a big savings vs. credit cards. Best case scenario, the business eventually finds suppliers that take Bitcoin.

In response to your first question: yes, your investment will have the same percentage change in value as 1BTC. In your example there was a 50% increase in both. 
Here's some likely unwelcome advice: I think you should leave your money in the bank while you learn more. Your questions seem to indicate you have a lot to learn about Bitcoin and money in general. I'm not trying to be a jerk, I'm just trying to save you pain. The other responder who said Bitcoin is not an investment was absolutely right. Bitcoin is an incredibly risky experiment that could go to zero tomorrow. Do not buy Bitcoins with money you can't afford to lose.
Spend some time learning about the financial markets and Bitcoin, before risking your money.

Create a new address for each transaction, which most good bitcoin clients do. The client will keep track of all your addresses in a wallet.

This is really cool. I think you should put your son in charge of everything including selecting a wallet and instituting sufficient security measures. One of the purposes of an allowance is to teach children to make smart money decisions while they're young and the stakes are relatively low IMHO. Even if he makes a mistake and losses some of his money, at least he'll learn a valuable life lesson.
Maybe you should tell your son to spend some time researching on the bitcoin wiki site and ask him to propose how he plans to keep his bitcoin. If you're satisfied, then you can give him his coin. If he's not able to figure it out, maybe he isn't ready for bitcoin.

If I were pitching Bitcoin to a business owner I would focus on transaction fees, because this is where Bitcoin can have an immediate concrete impact on the bottom line. In many low margin businesses such as gas and groceries, profit margins are incredibly thin (sometimes in the 2-3% range).

Thinking about the potential impact on profit margin is likely to really resonate with your investment  focused reader...in my opinion.

You have a highly liquid investment that has risen significantly in price. While you're right that you have an unrealized gain from an accounting perspective, I believe you should think about your bitcoins as part of your total wealth. Does that change your feelings about the tremendous investment risk you're currently taking with bitcoin?* If you were to sell all your investments today and you were sitting on a huge pile of cash, would you reinvest it the same way? If you can't answer yes to this question, maybe you should think about diversifying. 
We all want to be 100% allocated to an investment that is going to go up. But since we don't know which investment is going to go up, we diversify to spread the risk. You've done a great job picking an investment that has probably gotten you way ahead of your peers. It might be time to take prudent steps to protect your wealth.

* I believe in the potential for bitcoin, but I think most of us can agree they are risky.

Try sending $10k of gold from the US to China and you'll find out exactly how *not* portable gold is. It would probably cost hundreds of $ in fees and take a month.

There's nothing preventing them from following the transactions from that address. If someone gives you bitcoin, they can see how much is in that address and what you do with it. That said, only you know which addresses you control.

Here's a metaphor I've been working on:
There's a room full of safes with combination locks. All the safes have the same combination, but none of the safe crackers know what it is. So, the safe crackers keep trying random codes until one works. When someone gets a code,  they yell it out so everyone else can try it.
To explain the "next block", imagine that each time the safe crackers open a door, they find another door inside with a new combination that must be solved. 
To explain "difficulty" imagine that the number of digits in the correct combination change to reflect the number of safe crackers and the sophistication of their tools. If you were to go into the room today, you would find that all the safecrackers are using custom built machines to enter random combinations many times faster than a person could by hand. There's nothing stopping you from trying a combination by hand, but it's very unlikely you're going to get a long combination before the machines do.

You're probably right, going to work everyday and investing in a well diversified portfolio is unlikely to make you rich in the short term. On the other hand, it is very likely to make you comfortable over the long term. Are there any other high return/high risk investments you've considered? Don't forget, get rich quick schemes are usually too good to be true.
That said, it sounds like you would answer "yes" to my question about how you would reinvest your portfolio today. So, you've thought about your investments and chosen the course you think is best. I think that's the most important part because you'll be able to live with yourself if it works out well or badly. Good luck!

If you set up your faux market, other people would eventually ask to participate. If you let legit traders participate, they would arbitrage the difference between the markets. For example, if your market price was higher than what other people were willing to pay, legitimate traders would buy on bitstamp and sell the coins to you until you couldn't sustain the price difference (ran out of money). If you didn't let other people participate, people may not detect your fraud but they would ignore the price because they know they can't sell at your market price.

Thanks, I agree. If all we talk about is the price of bitcoin then all we attract are short term speculators, who will sell tomorrow just as rapidly as they're buying today. But if we focus on developing community awareness of the incredible attributes of bitcoin, I think the price will take care of itself.

If you're in the US, it's hard to beat coinbase. It very easy and professional. It can take a few days to get your account linked and verified, but it didn't bother me that much.

I agree. I think the bitcoin community is doing itself a disservice calling these machines "bitcoin ATMs." Firstly, I think it's a bad description of what it does. An ATM machine dispenses cash from your checking account, but I don't think that describes their function. 
Secondly,  ATM machines come with a whole host of regulatory complications. 
Personally, I like the term bitcoin vending machine. If it sounds pedestrian, then I think that's a good thing because it makes the machine seem less intimidating to new users.
