can somebody inform blockchain? I used their automated send feature instead of selecting my own and now my tx is staying unconfirmed. how long until the coins return to the wallet they were sent from?

I sent coins a couple hours ago from my blockchain wallet. I did not use the advanced send feature or select my own fee. Blockchain selected the fee for me. the transaction is still unconfirmed. why did blockchain do this to me?

get jealous bro 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:12:32
what? I'm being serious. isn't trading Bitcoin what makes it valuable? i was being sarcastic at first saying it will raise forever because obviously it won't, but now you're just sounding mean. why would I be jealous? you kids these days crack me up

I think you're confusing "foresight" with risk taking. Not even the feds held on to their Silk Road Bitcoin stash dude... but of course every neckbeard on this subreddit saw the future and invested $0.01 in BTC 6 years ago and now drives a Tesla and bangs actresses all day.

lemme ask you this, if everyone HODL how would btc increase in value? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:25
yeah bro Bitcoin will raise in value forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

Common sense. I just find it hard to believe that any more than 10% of anyone who has BTC or any other crypto does not have the ultimate end goal of profiting in their fiat currency. Why else does it matter that BTC hit $6k? Because it means more $$$$. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter as well. Obviously I'm exaggerating but I don't think I'm that far off.

yeah I come to this sub for btc news and it's just all circle jerking
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:03:17
care to share how much you made, when you bought the coin? the time you purchased the coin to now is the time it took to make that profit, congratulations though

that's a pretty terrible analogy considering the internet and the mail are good friends now, because of ordering products online. one did not replace the other, they potentiate one another. this sub is so sensationalist at times, no one can see the future. sure, you've got your predictions, but they're just predictions. 90% of all Bitcoin is used for purchasing illicit items, which people exchange for fiat currency, or for buying low and selling high, and then exchanging for fiat currency. if BTC price stabilizes once all the coins are mined I could see it being a more dependable form of payment in everyday life though. it's just really hard to take a lot of comments in this sub seriously when there's this underlying tone of "I told you so!!!!1!1!!"
