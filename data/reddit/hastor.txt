The conclusion is wrong. The bitcoins are not more valuable for merchants so there is little incentive for a rebate. 
The charge back system solves a trust issue where a third party is a mediator between two untrusted parties. You trust the credit card company more than the merchant. Asking the merchant to cover the cost is not going to make using bitcoin efficient.
What is needed are either this parties that can insure your transaction like what credit card companies do today, or reputation systems where you can make an informed decision. Reputation systems work as long as the cost of destroying trust is higher than the gain.

FDIC isn't the problem.  FDIC is an instrument to handle the risk concentration in the banking sector.
The problem is the risk concentration represtented by huge banks and places like Mt.Gox.  
The bitcoin network, being decentralized has lower risk.  Although people get viruses that steal their coins and other things like that, there is no catastropic event that will take down the bitcoin network.
However, bitcoin has risks such as a 51% attack that can happen any time the exchanges want to, and wealth concentration undermining the coins.  Both of them are diversification issues.
So the FDIC regulation is not the problem.  The problem is any form of risk concentration.

The article does not properly focus on the way the US supreme Court has chosen to let financial interests go before democracy for the Argentinian people. 
No people of the world can be held responsible for paying back public debt because doing so is equivalent to slavery. Only if the people want should it pay and this will be reflected in the market interest rate for the country.
What this case has shown is that New York and the United States deserves to be weakened as a financial center as it is not to be trusted.
Bitcoin as a transaction medium gets around the anti-democratic blockade that is designed to enslave this people.
This is the core issue and why bitcoin is such an ideal platform without the slavery imposed by the US jurisdictional control over NY banks.

You are sort-of making sense, but not really.
A service cannot just force users to change their passwords.  The attacker can login and change the passwords for the users, so the service needs to do some backend engineering to analyze the probability that it is the user vs the attacker doing this.
It can send an email with a magic link or try to find another way to get a magic token to the user for password reset.
But that is just a comment.  The real issue is that everyone is using a password management system nowadays.  Either the browser keeps your passwords, or some password plugin does the work.
In either case, the generated passwords are strong and the password manager has features that for example wipes the master key from memory when the computer sleeps.  A BitID-like thing does not have an interface against this system which means that this "password" is not being wiped on sleep and generally is easier to access by a virus/malware.

In a way the author is confused. The over the top security is simply because the market value of bitcoin is way higher than expected.
The block reward or the market value needs to go down to decrease the cost of running the network. However since the block reward schedule was set in stone without  any possibility to predict the bitcoin market capitalization, this was bound to happen.
It should be a temporary issue that will eventually be solved when all coins are issued.  However a better way to look at this is that it isn't about securing the network at all.
It is really about creating a market for distributing the remaining coins, so accounting for these coins as the cost of running the network is wrong.

The "currency risk" is fabricated.  If you're in a professional market the currency spread is 0.15%, 20x less than what the banks charge in the retail market.
It's the same with the 3% "fee".  In northern europe, the fixed transaction fee is around 1 cent.

Yes, but then you are using bitcoin blockchain exactly like the banks use the central bank.
Account transfers happen instantly within the bank's system.  However, a few times a day, transfers between banks happen through the ledger at the central bank.

@_date: 2014-08-12 10:28:03
It is as meaningful as measuring the money supply.
We have M1, M2, M3 money supplies and similarly we have various classes of transactions.
Even within the bitcoin network we have transactions that are really "pointless".  When you transfer a bitcoin from one of your wallets to another of your wallets, the trust infrastructure that bitcoin provides is not necessary.  
Thus, we could define a bitcoin transaction volume that only includes transactions between at least two independent parties, and the cost of the bitcoin network divided by these transactions would be higher.
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:27:20
There are two problems that makes Bitcoin unsuitable for micropayments:  fees and latency.
I'll only focus on the latency, since fees have been discussed elsewhere.
If you want to buy an ice cream, the transaction needs to complete while you are at the counter.  The bitcoin latency makes that impossible.
For online transactions, you need the transaction to finish before the customer gets access to the content that is protected.
Bitcoin is suited for larger "bank"-type transfers or transfers between banks themselves.
Bitcoin is suited for transferring money in and out of your micro payment wallet, but actually being the trusted party that does micro payments is still up for the taking.  It will not be the bitcoin network itself.  It is way too costly.

This is interesting.  We have 6% known to be controlled by criminals.  Then we have a significant portion (how much?) mined by Satoshi and friends at the start.  Then we have the Slik Road coins.  Someone should create a chart of just how much is known to be controlled by these.
Which reminds me of  where each person on Iceland is supposed to get a part of the premined coins.
If a switch from BTC to "auroracoin" is done from time to time, when the public demands it (because of public issues like this heist), when we know that the monetary system has been corrupted, it could be a fantastic tool for society.
If BTC can expose the actual level of wealth controlled by people you don't want to have that money, and switching digital currency can be done easily, it means that those who controll large amounts of coins are not secure.  It means BTC is not a safe storage of wealth.
When people can choose to leave for another crypto currenty, it becomes the people who consume, the people with little money who control the value of money.  That is fantastic for democracy and freedom.
In the long term it could be hugely advantageous over fiat money.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

@_date: 2013-08-23 11:41:02
The author is wrong.  Let me give a proof.
There are strict upper bounds on the value of bitcoins related to energy consumption by miners.  This is a fundamental limit that can *only* be fixed by an altcoin or a change to bitcoin.
In equilibrium, the value of mined coins is approximately equal to the cost of electricity to mine them.  Difficulty is completely irrelevant in this argument.
Let's just use 1% of US electricity usage as an upper bound on what can be used for mining. 
The US power grid produces [10.000 GWh daily](
I use an estimated 0.2 USD/kWh, and 1% of 10.000 GWh or 100 GWh are used for bitcoin mining.
We know from the controlled currency expansion that BTC supply increased by 33% in 2012 and will increase by 1.69% in 2024.
So for 2012 we get maximum valuation of all bitcoins to be:
100 GWh/day * 365 days *  0.2 USD/kWh / 33.33% = ~22 billion USD.
For 2024 we get similarly:
100 GWh/day * 365 days *  0.2 USD/kWh / 1.69% = ~430 billion USD.
Bitcoin cannot hold more value than this in its current form and altcoin or design changes are *required*.

There is no need to explain any "connectivity issues".
With a block every 10 minutes, a sequence of 10 block wins will happen every 10 minutes * 2^10 = 7 days.  That's just pure statistics.
Even just delaying a block until a competitor has found one, and then outputting *two* blocks will trivially tilt the chain in favor of the large pool.
That can easily be done today and basically eliminate any chance of non-pools ever winning a block.

This is wrong.
VAT is an expense only on the difference between the cost of the inputs of product and the sales price *to a consumer*.
This is true for every part of the transaction chain from the inputs to some product until it ends up in the hands of a consumer (non-company) or is exported (where the VAT for the whole chain is reverted).
So in the worst case, there is $400 VAT on the hardware.  Then there is $500 VAT for the consumer buying the $2000 worth of bitcoin (sold for $2500) to buy the hardware.
For every business in between, the VAT is transparent.
Of course, no sane Norwegian will buy BTC at 125% of the market price now.  However, it is also the case that "importing" an electronic service into Norway means you have to pay 25% VAT on it.
It will be interesting to see the tax authorities argue that "transferring" BTC to a public key generated within Norwegian borders constitutes importing an electronic service.

Omsetning av Bitcoin er ordinær avgiftspliktig omsetning av elektroniske tjenester. Skattedirektoratets vurdering er at bitcoins ikke kan anses som «gyldige betalingsmidler» (merverdiavgiftsloven § 3-6 d) og derfor heller ikke kan anses som en unntatt «finansiell tjeneste». Bitcoins klassifiseres som «tjeneste» (§ 1-3 bokstav c), nærmere bestemt «elektronisk tjeneste» (§ 1-3 bokstav j).

I think Freicon is dismissed too easily in the article.
If you're not *buying* coins like most people do, but *receiving* coins, then some entity that gives out coins should have no problems preferring Freicoins.
For example if Amazon.com wanted to use a currency on their site, it would serve them well to use something like Freicoin, because it would encourage the receiver to spend the money as quickly as possible.
This is true for any large entity, like a state.  It is common knowledge that inflation is good because it means that wages never need to be adjusted downwards.  Just wait 10 years with no increase in wage and competitiveness has improved.
Thus bitcoin is good for the current use-case where individuals buy/invest.  However when crypto currencies take over as mainline currencies, we might see things like Freicoin be more interesting.

I wonder why this is a publishable paper, given that this attack has been known for a long time.
For you saying it doesn't work:
There is no reason why this need to be detectable by other miners.  Whether to attack can be guided by a probabilistic function which guarantees plausible deniability.
Bitcoin does not become worthless if minders collude like this.  Only two things happen:  The miners that collude become richer at the expense of others in the network, and the verification time increases.
This *will* happen and the only defense is to start calculating the probability that it already happens, and to create multiple groups that collude.
The network participants really need to incorporate the game-theoretic aspects of bitcoin.

Two solutions:
1. Instead of exchanging to fiat, someone should provide currency swap options.  Thus your loss would be capped and for that you pay some %.  Hopefully this % would be less than the exchange fee, and the institution that provides currency swaps could do identity checks and limit exposure per clients and thus to traders.
2. Indexed prices.  Inflation-indexed pricing has been used in many south-american countries with great success.  It separates the currency from the price.  In Chile for example, when you buy a house, you pay in "inflation-adjusted-units" which is then translated into the local currency.

That link is vastly wrong, the threat is even much larger than that.
Instead of reversing transactions, the first attack is a profit-hoarding attack.
If BTCGuild keeps a block secret for 30 seconds after finding it, the inter-block rate is 8 minutes and it holds 25% hashing power, it will effectively get 100%*1/16+25%*15/16 = 30% of the hash rate.
By delaying 2.5 minutes, a pool increases its hashing power from 25% to 50%.  Thus it is easy for any pool with &gt;25% hashing power to basically take full control of the bitcoin minting process.
As long as the distribution of hashing power is skewed, it is inevitable that the largest player will get all the bitcoins, because only another pool can thwart this attack.
This also explains why solo-mining is complete insanity.
The only reason why this might not be occurring today is because pool-owners are not rational and/or stupid.  The only requirement for this to work is that pool-owners create a cartel with large miners to not spill the beans on the pre-mining.
There are two wayt to analyze whether this is happening.  One way is to look for correlations between the inter-block rate and pool ownership.  The other way is to analyze the delay for transactions going through a pool.  The pre-mining will lead to a delay in transaction processing, because the pool needs to cut off transactions at a much earlier point in time.
So it is possible to detect whether this is hapening, but the model is broken because all you can do is to put pressure on the pool to get it to cheat *less*, just as you do with your central banker.

Certificate Authorities are old-school.  Look at what Google is doing to put all certificates in one huge merkle-chain, like the blockchain.
The X.509 certificates should likewise be in a merkle-chain to ensure that both client and server have the same view of which certificates are valid.  Bitcoin already saw the advantage of using merkle-chains, why not use it for X.509 as well.
The blockchain does not need to be involved, but a separate merkle-chain where all a CA is, is a namespace within a git-repo (merkle-chain) would suffice.

Sure, the profitability of mining bitcoins should be similar to the profitability of the overall economy.  This doesn't change my argument because these two equilibriums are almost indistinguishable at the macro-view that I use.
Yes the value is determined by demand, but the energy required to produce bitcoins will follow the market price.
If the value goes up, more miners will join do reduce mining profitability.  This is exactly the same as using more energy to produce bitcoins.
At some point, energy usage will be a political issue, and I am just setting 1% of US energy production as a limit to when "something will happen".  At any level beyond this, a significant portion of energy will be used to mine BTC, and a more efficient solution must be found.
Mind you, this doesn't impact the ability to use BTC for transactions, only as a way to store value.  For transactions we don't necessarily need a lot of coins.

Yes, merkle-tree.  I often use the loose term merkle-chain for all of this because the defining property that I am interested in is that there is a root that defines what has happened, like the root of the block-chain or the commit of a git repo.
In an ecommerce transaction, if you and I have different "git repos" defining which certificates/keys are valid and assigned to various names, then we cannot commence with our transaction until we have synched our world-view.
Then we can do the transaction and the transaction is blessed under this world-view.
Every piece of data that is relevant to the transaction can be put into the merkle-tree.
Having multiple CAs/ecommerce sites or users working on this merkle-tree in parallell isn't a problem, similarly to how distributed work on git is handled.  Only when a happens-before relationship on a given fact is required must communication happen.
This is a lot more structured and formal than the ad-hoc certificate chain stuff.  Nothing ties certificates to revocations.  Nothing ensures that both parties have the same view of anything.

Interesting. I'll try to get some time to read it.
I just did a few searches through the text and found no discussion about companies, and no discussion about intellectual property.  Those two seems like pretty big omissions, but otherwise I am happy to read that sort of stuff.
Regarding this polylegal system.  I haven't read up on it, but I have a few questions:
How would you be able to move from one law enforcement company to another one?  And how would this differ from seeking citizenship on Iceland?  Why would a law enforcement company not evaluate a new member similarly to what Iceland or Ecuador does?
Also, how would the law enforcement companies respect each other?  Either they would respect each other's physical borders, like countries today, or they would live within the same country, and not respect each other.  This latter case is identical to what we already have with government, gangs and mafia.  They are all different law enforcement systems within our society, but the government is what most people prefer.
So the only invention this polylegal system has over our current system is if the different law enforcement companies actually live in peace with each other within the same country.  How is that going to happen and what laws govern the law enforcement companies?
We have now recursed back to the original problem of deciding which laws to obey, but now it relates to which laws the law enforcement companies choose to obey among themselves.

Simply declare the bitcoins as illegal under some AML-regulation.   That is, it is illegal for any money transmitter to give those bitcoins to any customer.
It is only a software implementation away to calculate the taint on any transaction, and money transmitter will be forced to disregard the tainted part of a transaction.
Sure, the person who holds them can use them in the black economy, but it seems to me that bitcoin should be much preferrable to real cash for the FBI, given proper AML regulation.

But there is no privacy in bitcoin today.  A client can connect to all the nodes in the p2p network and discover where a transaction originated.  This has already been done.

What is subjective here?
Mining can only be profitable if the value of the bitcoins received is more than the cost of electricity.
Thus the value of mined bitcoins cannot exceed, say 1% of the value of available electricity produced per unit time.
In theory it can be 100% of the value of available electricity, but this will never happen so I'm using 1% as an upper bound for when something will happen or an altcoin will win.

Not getting real-time service is partial fraud.  I do not know the details of the Facebook case, so I am only basing this on what you write.
When you have pressed "Submit" and do not get any notification of what happened, you are left to speculate what might or might not happen.  The fact that somebody will go through the transactions later and sort out the mess does not mean that you have not been defrauded.
In such a situation you have an enormous information and knowledge deficit compared to professional actors in the market.  You have no idea what actually will or has happened.  This deficit was not something you could reasonably expect to have, and this deficit means you end up making decisions not based on fact, but based on ... well nothing.  Thus the herd mentality.
Anyone who can orchestrate such an unexpected knowledge deficit, call it panic if you will, is defrauding the herd.
Don't blame the herd.  It is entirely reasonable to expect things to work.

The causality in this process is an orthogonal discussion and unrelated to my argument.   My argument relies only on *correlation*, a much weaker claim.
It doesn't matter which process changes the price of energy or the price of bitcoins.  Bitcoin value has an upper bound in terms of energy.  The two are correlated, and at some point it affects real production output in society.

Selling bitcoins between individuals in a non-commercial manner would be VAT exempt.
And when you travel outside the country, you can take a few bitcoins back! :-)
Very interesting side-effects.

Bitcoins are mined by trading electricity and technology for bitcoins.
If you multiply the value of all energy produced on earth by the fraction of bitcoins added to the economy per year, then that is the maximum value that bitcoins can hold.
If we use the US energy market as an example, the cap for 1BTC is at $700k, which it will never ever reach.  At that point newly minted bitcoins will be equal in value to the current value of all the US energy output.
How can this be?  First let us assume that everybody has access to the same mining technology, given that they are willing to pay.  (If this is not so, then bitcoin is no better than fiat, so why bother?)
Then it is only access to electricity that is needed to produce bitcoins.  The hashing power of the network will stabilize at some level so that the cost of electricity (and depreciation of equipment) equals the value of bitcoins minted in the process.
If this is not so, then the mining market is not free, there must be significant barriers to entry (such as access to technology), and then its superiority over fiat is questionable.
If we look at this from another angle, if a significant part of our energy supply is being used to mine bitcoins, this will get us into a depression.  The rest of the economy is converting energy into useful goods and services, while bitcoin mining is wasting the same energy, meaning that less energy is availble to create the goods and services we love.
So to keep any meaningful growth, we cannot use all energy mining bitcions.
Now if we just assume that we use all US energy production to mine bitcoins and use the rest of the world's energy to produce goods and services, then in todays USD, the cap for 1BTC is at &lt;$1M.  I think that is a pretty wild overshot as I don't think anyone would be comfortable with even more than 10% of the US energy being used in this way since it threatens global growth.
Now there is a completely different way to "solve" this dilemma.  By restricting access to technology, mining bitcoins can be done at a fraction of the energy usage.
The plan for this goes like this:
1. Create a technology cartel that controls high-end ASICs.
2. Keep the impression for the gullble masses that bitcoin mining is really done by a large mass of diverse users.
3. Ensure that there is an exponential difference between cartel technology and mainstream technology.   For example, if the cartel can mine 10x more efficiently then the BTC value can reach 10x higher than if this technology is available to everybody.
The only downside with the plan is that it means that BTC becomes a scam.

I wouldn't assign more than 60 bits entropy to your example password. It's breakable. Maybe not by your average hax0r though.

If you lived in Europe, this would be what everyone is doing.
Economically, the EU is much less regulated than the US.  The corporate tax rate varies from 9% to 36% and you can run your business in any country you want to without any regulatory issues.
If you have been following the news, you know that Microsoft, Google, Apple etc only pay 1% corporate tax in EU.  They are doing additional trickery, but even as a private entrepreneur, you can easily go from 30% taxation down to roughly 5%.
The tax competition inside EU is fierce.

I think even in the early '90s, checks were like hen's teeth in Scandinavia even if the service was supported (like telegrams).  We have to go back to the '80s to see real usage.

No because then mining becomes the most profitable business on the planet.  This will attract new miners until equilibrium between energy cost and mining output is established.

It does enable tax fraud, since the bitcoin block chain is semi-anonymous unlike the banking sector in Norway.  When you can selectively report, that in itself is an enabler for fraud.

The block chain issue is solvable. So is the transaction speed issue using third party insurance.

Which is an opportunity, because if you alternate going in and out of bitcoin, you can provide documentation for the 50% of the time you lost.
I think the government will get some innovative tax returns.

There are so many problems with this:
The first problem is that society, rules made by groups, and government are much older ideas than companies.
Thus you can't just declare that just because companies were invented in order to reduce the risk of trade, everything should be converted to companies.  There is no moral or historical basis for you unilateraly declaring that to be the better option.
There is not even any reason to allow companies to exist in the first place except as a risk reduction technique.  As is government.
Without companies and without government, you would be back in a feudal society.  That also works.
Secondly, the government is empowered through law, and the law is made by the people.  You first have to define which laws you are willing to obey before you declare taxes to be theft.
If you are not willing to let your fellow citizens define laws, then you must accept that you are an anarchist with the full consequences of that stance.
Basically, you need to cover the basics before you declare taxes as theft.
My stance is that taxes are theft only in the sense that some people are paying disproportionately compared to others and this is discrimination.  The idea that corporations, a 16th century invention is somehow magically better than the government seems really weird to me.
If corporations controlled this, then like in a feudal society, you would be forced into legally binding contracts with that corporation in order to live a decent life.  In a game-theoretic sense, it wouldn't make sense not to subject yourself to be a servant of the corporation that controlled food, transportation, electricity and clean water.  Likewise, in a game-theoretic sense, the corporation wouldn't make your life a living hell, but there is no reason it would be any better than your current government.
Also, always remember that you are not forced to live in the country you currently live in.  You can always move to Ecuador or Iceland.
