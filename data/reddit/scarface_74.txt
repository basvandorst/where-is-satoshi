OK you win this - in the land of *possibilities* everything is possible and it was a nice discussion. I am sorry if I have offended you, I thought your persistence is aiming at FUDing the average reader here. 
Just to better understand your perspective - were you talking about a theoretically possible, lengthy, laborious attempt to crack these 12 words? 
I think from a realist perspective (emergency scenario: my HW is stolen and someone is trying to brute force; malware got my randomly ordered 12 seed, etc.; =&gt; then, how much time do I have to react i.e. recover my coin from another back up devise, send it elsewhere, etc.) your job as a hacker would be realistically very difficult and I would have time to withdraw everything.
Also, just to add here that the confusion at the beginning of our discussion arose because (I believe) you are talking about getting access to the words of a Trezor's 12-word seed, right? 
But that is not possible: a) Trezor One is using 24 words by default (so even if someone has a keylogger, they will have 24 words in random order to crack); b) Trezor T has 12 words but these never leave the devise, so no attack vector here.
Can you think of another (or 2-3) possible, real life scenarios of attack? I am genuinely interested to hear your thoughts!

So, what they have to look at is that the one in the news right now differs from previous proposals in that a) it is fully insured and b) will cost $200,000; meaning they aim at a different target market of sophisticated investors.

Not existential indeed; but shows misjudgment vs. current (and future IMO) conditions due to their greed to go after big money. 
Meanwhile new forms of trading venues are developing (decentralised exchanges, Coinbase entry in the UK, new product lines from BAKKT and NYSE after their initial products, possibly ETFs, and many more) =&gt; so neglecting their (core and loyal) clients could become catastrophic. We will see. In any case BTC will be around while Coinfloor will be fondly remembered.

=&gt; United Kingdom do not ask you to pay taxes if you earn less  than 11501 GBP a year. Everything what you earn between 11501 GBP and 45 000 GBP needs to be taxed at 20% if you earn above 150000 GBP then 45%.
This is incorrect as well (UK taxpayer here). You confuse 2 things: income tax and capital gains tax (CGT).
- CGT: a UK taxpayer is allowed to a non-taxable capital gain from investments of up to 11501 GBP a year. ANYTHING above that (a single pound or millions) is taxed at 20% CGTax as long as it is investments gain. Cryptocurrencies are classified to belong here and subject to CGTax (with minor exceptions, when they are classified as speculative gambling - but you have to argue with HMRC about it...).
- Income tax is about your job earnings and not to be confused with the FLAT 20% CGTax. Specifically: everything above roughly £10000 and £35000 GBP is taxed at 20%; above it with 40%; and if you earn above 150000 GBP then 45%. This does not apply to cryptocurrencies.
Summary: Cryptocurrencies' gains in the UK are subject to 20% CGT, that's the whole story.

I ordered it mid July and got it, after several delays, end of September. 
Several small bugs to be fixed (wrong PIN messages all the time, sometimes not synchronising with the Chrome-based wallets, etc.), will take time to iron these things out. Never really used it except for minor transactions to play with wipping out the devise, re-installing from the seed etc. 
Much happier with TREZOR but I will use it in the future.

Thanks, mate, that makes sense. It's a hassle to move BTC and I 'd rather avoid it. 
It's just that TREZOR's announcement is scary ("...Note that this process is manual and is without any warranties, due to the lack of replay protection...") while LEDGER's sounds reassuring ("...We'll offer support to transact on the current and Segwit2x chains - with a dedicated website to split...").

"getting to 100K is not about "good momentum". It needs an explosion, a couple of paradigm shifts maybe" : you are very right, indeed - but, then again, think all the way back 2009 - 2017. What happens now is *nothing* compared to BTC's humble beginnings.
Paradigm shifts are actually happening under our nose: CME, institutional money jumping in ... BTC (!), integration in everyday apps (Square), momentum triggering domino effects, countries de-facto adopting BTC (not de jure but who cares), millenials and grandmas investing and soon transacting in BTC, BTC technology quietly advancing.
Paradigm shifts don't shout "look at me, I am a paradigm shift". They come quietly.

It has been a lot tougher starting from $0.01 (less actually) to reach $1000 or $10000 (soon) vs. going from $10000 to $100000. 
Going another 10x under current circumstances is nothing compared to BTC's initial hurdles. 
$100000 could come much faster than anyone anticipates.

You may be right but I still think it would be best for CB to list the new chain (coin) as 2X and keep BTC listed as BTC.
BTC has the potential to reach the $1T cap within the next 1-1.5 year and all major stakeholders in the ecosystem should leave politics aside. 
On the other hand, as Andreas Antonopoulos said, this might be a great opportunity to test BTC. Time will tell but I remain optimistic.

Trezor One (the old) does it as well (I own both) - see "dry run recovery". 
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:21:23
Did you read the rest? I paste it here:
There are 24! possible orderings of a 24-word seed. That is 620448401733239439360000 possible orderings.
Each 24-word TREZOR recovery seed is verified with an 8-bit checksum. Using the checksum to eliminate invalid seeds, you can reduce the search space by a factor of 256. This gives us a search space of:
24! ÷ 256 = 2423626569270466560000
Going from TREZOR recovery seed to public bitcoin address takes 2 × 2048 iterations of PBKDF2, which in turn uses SHA-512. All in all, going from a potential TREZOR recovery seed to a bitcoin address, is slightly more difficult than running SHA-512 8096 times.
To summarize, in order to check all possible orderings in a 24-word seed, you need to run SHA-512:
24! ÷ 256 × 8096 = 19621680704813697269760000 times
The bitcoin network is capable of performing 176 537 883 000 000 000 iterations of SHA-256 each second.
If we wave our hands a bit, we can claim that SHA-512 and SHA-256 are equally difficult (which they aren’t but let’s pretend they are). Therefore, it should take somewhere around half of:
(24! ÷ 256 × 8096) ÷ 176 537 883 000 000 000 ÷ 60 ÷ 60 ÷ 24 ÷ 365 = 3.5 years
for the ENTIRE BITCOIN NETWORK to crack the seed. If you have that kind of hashing power, you’d make better money mining at Slush Pool than trying to steal bitcoins. :-) On a normal botnet cracking a TREZOR seed would take millennia.
