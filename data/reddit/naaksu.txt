@_date: 2015-06-30 07:18:08
i was just gonna buy, but 1-2buissness days for funds to arrive, then i would miss the bump in price thats coming. 
did creae and verify, but meh.

what kraken could do is invite all who got goxed, and let them trade free until they would have regined a good proportion or even all what they lost
(i mean, when they would have traded enough that theyr fees that they would have normally payed would equal the money they had in gox.)
or until theyr kraken balance was equal to gox (0% comission, you could day trade like a champ)
they who lost, prolly never would come to kraken (anytime soon atleast) and it is a great pr stunt, lots of karma for kraken
and they would get alot of new customers, plus more would join just because of this.

@_date: 2014-04-27 01:21:31

well, countries like sweden, finland. cannabis is illegal, and seeds are seeds, as long as you keep them dry, it is legal. 
but also having grow lights and seeds in a same room can get a conviction to. for preparing to break a law, yeah we have laws like that in finland and in sweden.

i cant read it because, when i try, it asks me to login with email and pass.
my pass i regged for winpoker, that dont work. and if i try to make one there on the ticket side login, it says my email is in use, and it wont send me a "ive forgot my password" email.
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:02:24
ive sold mine @ 
they are the ones who has that atm in the record store.
ive got the money same day when ive sold.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:48:22
in helsinki, there is one exactly like it.
worked very nicly, and i got the btc much faster than anticipated, i dont know how fast they got to my phone wallet, but it wasnt more than 1min after i checked if they allready arrived and they had.
i put 2000€ in it at once, in 50€ bills. glad none snatched my phone :P
@_date: 2014-10-17 00:40:44
crap, need to verify, i have such a nice login, it would take me a million tries to get one as awsome.
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:55:38
why i dont like having bitcoins on my laptop is because i dont feel i can trust the security on my laptop because im lazy with updates and such, ok sure i can have 100€ or so but not more.
but having a usb with 2partitions and having a live bootable on one and on the other having a wallet app, that should be secure, or am i wrong?. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:30:43
thats a good simple video, thx. but the piperwallet, i assume the software randomly takes a passprhase and hashes the phrase, but how does it randomize it? does it allways generate for example 50 random characters (or are we talking about couple thousand?) 
i mean, there is a chance it will generate 2same passphrases to 2different people aint there?.
even tho the chances would be 0.0000000000001% but theres still the possibility right? in theory atleast?
brainwallet does sound good too, but if i would do it, i would have 3phrases, each goes to sha, and then just add all 3, and get a sum of them. even for "hackers" it would be troublesome even if they had my keystrokes and nothing else.you know what i mean, 3words=sha001
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:03:09
pretty dam anonymous if you buy btc from a atm with cash, to a fresh virtualPC with a altered mac address with somones unprotected wlan, then do this, and send, and delete the virtualPc.
i dont think any real agency has the manpower or resources to trace that. tho i dont know if virtualPC helps anything since you could just take out the hdd and smash it to pieces
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:03:33
ive had them really fast everytime, in fact, ive used it as my online wallet to.
yesterday i donated to bitcoinwisdom for 1month premium, took about 1-2minutes to get my premium after i sent them from btc-e.
and about a month ago i bought stuff and sent from btc-e for bout 400usd, that took only minutes to.
are you doing it right?
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:49:02
this particular model, wich also exists around the world
don't need any id.

are you serious? you cant name your buisness cheaper than steam, and sell games, steam is gonna "FUCK YOU UP!" (in court)
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:14:43
i dont know what the fee is, but quickly scanning your text il assume its in 20-50cents. 
i have bitcoins, dont get me wrong, but never payed any real attention to the fees.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:51:38
yay im top 10% :)
but my trading awsomeness cannot be beaten, i had like 4bitcoins when they were at 800, now i have 2.7, i dont know how. (well ive bought stuff for 0.5btc) but still, *scratches head*
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:36:28
that would be a bad thing, because it would go upp too fast.
people would start panic buying and price would be 800-900 in a week, and then when it started to go down people would panic sell and it would be back to 600.
i believe 650 is where it heading and where it will stay for some time, ofc with some flux but itl keep bouncing around 650. (will be the new 450)
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:48:28
or it was like this, bitcoin is up to 350 on gox.
now, delete twitter feeds so people start speculating and price drops so we can buy again.
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:36:02
allmost lost 0.5btc yesterday, but i finally remembered the password to the blockchain wallet, to only find i needed a private key now since i messed up my phone blockchain app wich had it :P
lucky me i recogniced the public key to a old brainwallet wich they had been shipped to for somereason.
so check all your old keys.
@_date: 2014-02-15 08:33:12
how the fuck do you not see this is a troll/joke?
seriously? even tho i asked "am i being scammed into buying bitcoin?"
dewds. seriously. :P
people should laugh when they hear drugs for bitcoin, not take it seriously...
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:28:47
 works for me.
maybe they dont like you? :P 
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:26:15
i live 60km from helsinki, and i have not heard anything about theese.
what do 2way atm mean? you can sell bitcoins? it just dont look like theres a money "ejector" on it.
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:24:06
there is dam too many dam coins!
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:48:05
i just bought a 50$ and worked like a charm, nice. have bitcoins but no cash on my bank until couple days, and really wanna try out that game 7days to die
really like this service, keep up the good work!
most likely will use again
@_date: 2014-06-26 10:25:13
seems interesting, had a account in btc-e for some time but have not traded for a while, this seems nice, il try it now, but not more than 500$ to start with
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:06:53
huh, wondering if i can say i masturbated 3,237 times, all for bitcoin and world peace, would make me feel better about my self. :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:24:03
well finland for example has bitcoin "atm's" where you buy bitcoins, and you use cash, no identifying or anything. 
so i dont see how thats not anonymous.
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:31:33
how accurate wasnt that? :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:09:46
ah, i see you are enjoying watchdogs :P
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:27:25

go to russia for a work thing, customs check your phone, see blockchain app, investigate. boom, work trips takes 4years
@_date: 2015-11-03 08:08:05
i dont like bitcoin going up fast, it should be steady with growth with about 2% per month max, (no down hill tho  :P)
