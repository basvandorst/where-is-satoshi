I like the rock on top, nicely at odds with the rest of your setup.

Great to hear that tips are appreciated even when they force the recipients to learn how to make use of a basically foreign currency :)

Thanks for the update and clarification! I think it's a great idea, but only if the conversation naturally flows into bitcoin. Nobody likes being preached to.
Sounds a lot more reasonable (and less intrusive) way to get people actually interested started on using bitcoin rather than annoying random people by tucking a piece of paper under their windscreen wipers.

Totally agree, although as far as I understand bitcoin, easy is not yet one of its strong points.
At least when you compare it to handing a hand full of cash to the nice lady at the bookstore. Although not very much of that money would make it to the author...

How did that work out? Any feedback from the recipients? Did they collect their tips and/or ask questions?
Getting people exposed to bitcoin who are not yet interested themselves is definitely a good thing, even if it means some coins will be lost forever because they are learning and will make mistakes.

Still very new at this, so the link might not work, but should point you in the right direction if you want to send bitcoin to users.

Thank you for the tip!
Just tried it on a desktop computer, the difference in speed is astonishing, almost immediate "Password incorrect, you suck, try again!"

Given that the ones who paid had to jump over hurdles as you put it, even more will have tried to pay but given up in the process.
Interesting approach somewhat similar to your pay-if-you-like is pay-what-you-want but with some sensible amount to anchor potential buyers (i.e. the $2 you mentioned).

Fair point, I'll grant you that.

Pretty certain some bitcoin users are also science fiction readers, seems like a natural fit. I'd be one of the bitcoin-less science fiction readers though.
Experimenting with bitcoin payments on a honesty system sounds reasonable, initial investment is rather low, it might make some extra money and its get people to read your books and perhaps look into bitcoin as a payment method.
Fun legal and technical problems aside of course, e.g. publishing agreements not allowing digital distribution at a lower price or people replacing your QR code with their own and distributing the modified version of the book to others.

This contest is a great idea!
Learned something about BIP38 and had fun trying to come up with answers to the questions. Playing on a smartphone and having to wait for about one minute for each try (to eventually fail) made it even more exciting.

Interesting idea, I wish you the best of luck.
Roughly what percentage of paperbacks was paid for? I'd guess low double-digit percentage?
Perhaps my view of my fellow man is a rather dim one and there are way more awesome people out there who understand that producing content and making it available costs time and money (and who are also willing to pay for it).
Definite plus point of online distribution is reduced costs per unit, so even a relatively small number of payments is sufficient to offset lots of downloads. Reduced transaction cost of bitcoin should play into that quite nicely.

Happy cake day! (and thanks for making me finally look up cake day and learning something)
