Sorry for your loss, if you want I'll give you back triple the BTC amount you send me to help you get back on track, just PM me for my address
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:23:12
Someone forgot about BNB
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:43:20
Just use coinbase pro to buy BTC and transfer to binance as the cost would be free
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:30:11
People were saying the exact same thing when it crashed from $32 down to $2
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:21:47
Why no 3rd option to buy? I've bought some more BTC today 
@_date: 2018-10-27 11:48:00
Great! I can buy twice as much
@_date: 2018-10-28 00:39:22
What would you be more upset by?
Not selling and bitcoin's value dropping to zero or
Selling all your bitcoin now and it going upto $1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:50:28
Nothing would happen, just that the bitcoins that are left would be worth more.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:51:10
Coinbase, I've never had a problem
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:36:02
Yes, people will stop buying food as it would be cheaper later,
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:47:13
Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:48:19
Just like nobody buys the latest iphone or PC parts as they will be cheaper later,
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:54:37
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:21:51
that's what you get for buying on a scam site.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:47:04
Any one else feeling happy? I've had a few limit orders filled today and now I'm part of the 1 million club.
It feels good.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:56:39
You can buy 1 to 2 dollars of bitcoin, no need to buy all in one go
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:14:41
Let's ignore the fact that going from 6k to 10k in 3 years would still be a great return. If you honestly feel like this why are you even wasting time in this sub? 
It's because you don't believe the FUD that you type.

If I was a betting man I would agree with you that this is the main reason for the recent sell off.
BSV was catching up on block number so ABC sold some BTC to buy more hash.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:57:47
Nope the 21 million club is if you only have one bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:25:34
Doesn't bitcoin currently have 3.8% inflation due to the reward black every 10 minutes?
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:34:22
The whole point of bitcoin is that you can't alter the chain, the same data you're worried about is in all versions of bitcoin including BSV.
Also I would point out that the files arn't viewable on the chain without decoding the data and also knowing which files they are.  You cant view it without knowing what to look for and in order to find out what to look for you would need to visit sites with CP on them anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:11:51
You do understand that all the forks of bitcoin have the same old transations on their chain so the 'peadophilla' on btc can also be found on bsv, bth, diamond, gold etc
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:58:14
No what you need to do is fork a copy of reddit, lets call it redditSV this will be the real true version of reddit where we can delete and censor peoples posts as we see fit. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:13:49
Coinbase moved their cold storage wallets
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:23:01
No one voted to keep it in, do you even understand what a blockchain even is?
If you dont understand why BTC is the most valuable maybe you should go ahead and buy some BSV but dont come crying back when they block or steal your coins which they said they would do if they disagree with what you do with them.
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:52:28
OMG why are you still using reddit? the data I posted could be decoded into CP.
So by your own logic you must leave reddit and never use it again. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:45:13
The 'new' coins are just a copy of the BTC chain at the time of the fork so they share all the same data.
No it isn't like 2mb of CP every 10 minutes, if i tell you that '010101000101010100101010101010100000101010101'
is a CP link but you have to imput it into a special decoding program to view it does this mean that you have just looked at CP?

BCH was oversold compared to other crypto in the last 30 days
For example BTC went from £5000 down to £2500
Yet BCH went from £500 down to £60 in the same time due to the uncertainty around the hash war with BSV
Once the fear has died down it would make sence it would recover faster.
I don't understand why this would be worrying for the market or even BTC.
BTH is still at a lower percentage now than it was a few weeks ago
