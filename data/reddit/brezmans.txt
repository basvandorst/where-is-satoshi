The fact that the real satoshi is 
1. Alive and
2. Follows the news about bitcoin
is pretty big news, imho. Of course, this on the assumption that it is indeed the real Satoshi who wrote that statement. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:52:37
A lot of eyes are on you right now, if the message from Satoshi is authentic, it's some pretty big news.
I'm very much looking forward to your statement, good luck with the ensuing storm regardless of the results.

I couldn't agree more in principle. But, there's one big but. The people using bitcoins, like you and me, are not used to not having a central authority regulating everything and providing insurance in case something goes wrong. Our euros and dollars are kept by central banks who are backed by governments and if there's ever a security flaw, people get fired and a shitstorm rages through the financial world, but our money is more or less safe. I know that there's also the aspect of inflation and global financial conspiracies, but that's not what I'm talking about here. If someone runs off with your savings from your bankaccount, through a security hole in the banking system, you get every penny back.
Since MtGox is and has been the most known bitcoin exchange, people have not really (I know some have, but not enough) considered alternative exchanges, which made MtGox a vital aspect of the bitcoin economy, whether we like it or not. If we want to keep bitcoins decentralized, the trading should take place in a variety of exchanges without one central point of reference. The bitcoin value has been consistently based on the MtGox prices, even if other exchanges did not fluctuate as much.
So, yes, I agree with you completely. But there's still a lot of work to be done in changing the way the bitcoin users think. It's a new concept, a new approach to money and currencies, and we need to let go of some of the concepts we used to rely on.
I don't know if this makes a lot of sense, I'm insanely tired and have to go study some more. 
Good night.

Well, it is a finite currency but it could take a 100 years for the last bitcoin to be found. That's not really a rebuttal for your argument though, because we need more than a few bitcoins in circulation to keep using it as a currency. 
So, I guess it's possible in theory. But in the process of the government buying everything, some people will become damn rich. Also, they'd have to buy it all really fast or really slow, as the markets tend to be very volatile. As soon as a lot of bitcoins are being bought, the price skyrockets. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 10:01:42
You broke down? ಠ_ಠ
@_date: 2011-06-19 17:37:44
YES! I've never used MtGox myself because it's a pain in the ass if you're not from the USA and I'm glad I never did because of all the security flaws and compromised accounts. I use either tradehill or bitmarket.eu (I'm from europe), where the price seems to be stable. For now...
We need to get rid of MtGox imo.

Blowing the chip sounds like a very scary outcome to me, mate. Or am I missing something?
Anyway, thanks for the advice, I'm gonna let it run for a day now, see what gives.

Ok guys: I'm not following any longer. It seems not one pool is good both for payouts _and_ for morals. I have a 270Mh/s system, running around 8 hours a day. Can anyone tell me where I should join? I tried slush's pool, BTCmine, deepbit (currently there) and bitcoinpool.org. Now, I know it may sound rude or selfish, but I'd like to make as much money off of this as possible (not much, I know), so can anyone tell me which pool I should join for my setup? I'm not concerned about daily payouts, but as long as it evens out each week, I'm happy. For example: I' drop the deepbit daily steady payouts if I knew about a pool where I'd have more money at the end of the week than all the daily payouts of deepbit combined.
What can you recommend me, people?
@_date: 2011-06-15 09:22:16
Or by posting this you want to influence the market (not sure how though) and make sure your investment wasn't foolish? :) 
No guarantees man, no guarantees!
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:12:19
Very interesting assumption. Then again, and I'm only being the devil's advocate here trying to pin holes in everything, the occasional miners who had their gaming rigs mining bitcoins might now say: it's not worth it anymore to let my pc run all the time for bitcoins, might as well play a game. They could've grown bored with the whole bitcoin-madness and want to return to their normal lives.
While, in contrast, the people who got into this for the money and bought expensive rigs, can just let them run without too much risk: the value of a btc still outweighs the electricity costs. Also, they have dedicated rigs and don't need to do their daily reddit-surfing and gaming on a pc that's running fans at 70%. I myself have become rather tired of the constant noise of mining so I now let it run when I'm out of the room. 
Again, just trying to find a sustainable theory!

I'm also running a 5850, wiht mem underclocked to 320mhz and clock oc'd to 775. I'm a newb when it comes to this shizzle though. Can you give me some pointers on how to oc the clock even more? Do I need to change the voltage or something? It goes unstable on 780mhz.
Currently pulling a steady 290mh/s.

I've attempted to explain the current drop in value [here]( not sure I succeeded but I think it's a plausible explanation.
@_date: 2011-06-19 17:40:22
Wouldn't be surprised if a mtgox glitch fucked everything up. This is the problem with a more or less centralized trading place. There's lots of alternatives for mtgox, everyone! Move while you still can.
@_date: 2011-06-07 10:32:07
Will do. What settings would you recommend to start with? I used the CCC to down the memory to 900MHz and up the clock to 775MHz, but that does not seem to have much effect.

phoenix -u  -k phatk DEVICE=0 VECTORS BFI_INT AGGRESSION=7 WORKSIZE=256
is an example. The worksize, bfi_int and vectors flags are optional and are card-specific. Phatk is the kernel, you can also use the poclbm kernel. Search for phoenix miner flags to find your ideal settings.

I mined there for 2 days. At first, the payout was not bad, but since the difficulty went up yesterday they hardly find any blocks: their hashrate is on average 100 Gh/s and a round takes on average 8 hours to complete now. So, if they had more people, I'd go there again but for now I'm using deepbit. I am still thinking of going back again though.
@_date: 2011-06-18 08:45:00
I think you'd be surprised how quick people grow tired of novelties. Those occasional miners were making maybe 0.5 btc a week and that would be even less now. Seeing as they won't get rich quick and have to put in way more effort to get some btc, I think it 's fair to say that a lot of them just move on to something else.
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:15:52
No doubt in my mind. It's still the early days of a possible bitcoin economy so this issue will be resolved soon, but it definitely scares some people off.
In the process of a new technological advancement to become mainstream, it's bound to encounter a lot of practical and near-fatal problems. It's those that adapt that might make it. So, maybe it's for the better that these problems occur now rather than in a few months when more people could be affected.

This, I don't understand. Isn't it more profitable if I have a low hashrate to go for the steady payouts of deepbit? 
Hmm, I really don't get the finesse of bitcoin mining apparently :D
I will join MtRed in a heartbeat if it turns out it's all the same anyway :D (and if Mtred is stable ofcourse...)
@_date: 2011-06-07 09:59:01
I'm using -v -w 128 indeed, I just lowered my memory to 900MHz and upped my gpu clock to 775. Not really overclocking but simply using the Amd Catalyst Control Center. How much would u say I need to over- and underclock to really see a difference? I now upped it from 270MH/s to about 278MH/s, not really noticable.
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:41:41
Thanks, edited :) 
But, isn't it possible that some big mining rigs have joined btcguild? The bigger rig will invest more power and thus have a larger input percentage per block. This will lead to a decrease in everyone else's share in the input. The addition of bigger rigs is consistent with my assumptions, as smaller miners will disappear and more professional miners will up their input to be profitable.
I might be wrong on this, I'm writing it up pretty fast. I'll be back later tonight and re-check my argument here ;)
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:01:02
Erm, what? How? The only option I see is dwolla, but you need an american bank account for that.

True. But I'm damn curious to find out what the hell just happened.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:18:55
[Explanation]( So, no need to call for dramatic changes. What does need to happen is, as suggested in this subreddit before, an opensource bitcoin trading system to weed out the bugs and exploits and restore confidence.
@_date: 2011-06-08 21:45:50
The standard bitcoin program is not very efficient because it uses CPU power to calculate the hashes needed to mine bitcoins. There's a lot of bitcoin GPU (graphics card) miners out there (poclbm, phoenix miner are the most popular) that use the processing power of your graphics card instead of the CPU. This is a hundred times more powerful than your cpu (citation needed) and you should definitely opt for that. 
Also, with the current difficulty in the calculating of bitcoin hashes, since a lot of bitcoins have already been mined, it is now common to join a mining pool instead of mining on your own, known as solo-mining. May I suggest the [reddit mining pool]( There's some others out there, but the reddit one could use your support. Also, do it because I helped you ;) And there's a post here about how we need to even the distribution of miners because one pool has nearly 50% of all mining power, which could seriously disturb the bitcoin blocks or something (don't get the fine details, but not important atm, just don't join deepbit, join the reddit pool).
Ok, so summarized: 
1. get a GPU miner like poclbm or phoenix miner
2. join a mining pool (NOT deepbit, but preferably [MtRed](
3. ???? (a lot of calculating and overclocking cards)
4. PROFIT

Another massive sale? I have no clue at all. Price seems to be dropping still.
Edit: anyone want to get in the btc game now? Price is 3.3 usd @ mtgox. WTF?
Second Edit: one btc now worth 0.95 usd. All in 2 minutes. Hurray panic sellers! Mania buyers: now would be the time!
Third Edit (keep refreshing people :p): MtGox is now down due to heavy traffic. Bitcoinmonitor.com shows sales with normal prices again (around 14usd per btc). This was Black Sunday I guess, the second big crash and test of the bitcoin currency. It also shows the market is still as unstable as hell. Theory: with each crash the amount of bitcoins per person gets spread out more as it's mostly one person selling a lot of bitcoins at the same time. So, maybe, in the long run this is a good thing?
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:12:50
I second that! Also, on a related note: is it possible for anyone to make a portable cpu and gpu miner (preferably where u can choose) to use while I'm at work, for example? I now used the webpage version but I'm sure it can be made more efficient using a portable app. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 17:41:42

I'm using a 5850 that I bought around christmas for my new pc. Only started using it for bitcoins this week. I'm around 250 Mh/s, which is not bad. I don't run it 24/7 tho, just an hour or two per day.
@_date: 2011-06-13 14:19:49
1) True
2) Yes, but keep in mind that finding a block is always a combination of luck and computing power. The bigger pools find blocks faster because they have more hashes per second. The payout in a big pool will consist of small, regular payouts. This is the case because the processing power you invest will be only a tiny fraction of the total power of the pool. The payouts of a smaller pool, such as the Reddit pool (mtred) will be irregular but bigger, because the power you invest will form a larger portion of the cake. In the end it should even out, whether you choose a big or a small pool. Also pay attention to the fees some pools will ask. Deepbit is a very big but very expensive pool, whereas btcguild and mtred are 0% fee pools, meaning you get what you mine.
3) True, it will take about a day to confirm a block.
4) True. 
5) May I add: it is important for the bitcoin network that the mining pools are divided. One large monopoly could "fork" the bitcoin blockchain. Because it is a p2p network, every addition to the block chain, aka a "found" block (a certain hashing outcome), has to be verified by the other people in the network (p2p). If one pool has an absolute monopoly in the hashing power, they can start creating "fake" blocks, and thus "forking" the block chain. This can happen because it is the majority of bitcoin clients that decides if a block is valid or not. This is the power of a 2p2 network and at the same time one of the weaknesses. Deepbit is currently the biggest mining pool and I would like to advise anyone to not join their pool but look for alternatives. 
Also, deepbit charges a fee.
edit: spelling

I use it, I have no problems with it. They require a lot of verification but nothing more than mtgox to be honest. The transfers are quick and painless after all the verification has been processed. 
The fee to transfer from OKPay to btc-e is 2% though, which is quite high in my opinion, but that's on btc-e's end, not okpay.
