The game is a significantly different game EVER SINCE Bitcoin futures were introduced on to the CME. With traders being able to short it, Bitcoin is NOW a more fair market than it was PRE-2018. If there was no way to short it, it would keep going up. NOW, the game is not the same as it was 5 years ago, and I believe it is extremely important that any crypto traders realize this.

Yea, what’s up with that? How do exchanges allow people to 100x leverage? I don’t get how this is possible? Seems incredibly risky for the exchange.

You haven’t explained why Satoshi owes Kleiman anything. Just because they worked together? So? How come Kleiman never sued the actual Satoshi or Craig Wright while he was alive. Hmmmmmm.
You’re acting like Kleiman deserves Satoshi’s coins. If that’s the case, how the fuck would I know that? You didn’t explain that.
You just called me dense, yet your explanation explains literally nothing. Clear to me who the dense one is.

It’s not a limited resource because there is nothing proprietary about it. There are 1000’s of coins out there. Any company can make one, as Facebook has proven.

Because I feel the parabolic move ended, and now will come back down. I feel the 20k peak from 1.5 years ago was similar to the peak at 13.8k from a few days ago. Both parabolic moves.
I was long last week, and closed my position immediately at 12.8k right after the pop. I was watching and waiting for it to pop. And it did. And now I feel that going short is smarter than going long. 
I need to find a new exchange, though, as I was using Coinbase when I was long, and that exchange is pretty wack with its fees (not to mention you can’t short on Coinbase).

I understand that they worked together. Yet I asked why exactly Satoshi would owe K money, and you gave no explanation. If it was really so obvious (that I would indeed be dense for not getting it) then why would Craig claim to be Satoshi in the first place? If it’s so obvious, he would’ve known that he was about to get sued big time. YET, HE DIDN’T REALIZE THIS before claiming to be Satoshi. 
Basically, I asked you a question. You freaked out because you didn’t know the answer, then you blocked me because I was asking you questions that you didn’t know the answer to.

Thank you for that explanation. Now I get it.
The guy calling me dense had not explained that. And I certainly can’t assume that.
Now of course it brings up the next question...
When Kleiman died, he didn’t leave the key to the Bitcoin stash in his will? I guess not. Hmmm.

So if I claim to be Satoshi, I can get sued for billions? For what reason? He’s not getting sued for claiming to be Satoshi, that doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:54:32
I really have no idea why Satoshi would go anonymous from the beginning anyway, so I don’t know. Why is Wright being sued by the dead guy’s family for billions?
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:47:32
I see. Thanks.

It’s extremely risky for both. If I deposit $1000, and trade with $100k worth, and I’m negative $30k after a week, then both the exchange and myself are screwed.
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:43:41
Why is it definitely not Craig?
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:00:33
Thanks for the warning.

Thanks for the recommendation on GBTC. 
Why would you not recommend shorting Bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:15:23
Everybody here is dreaming, and nobody can actually back up “100k” with ACTUAL REASON why it deserves that value.
With that being said, I see no reason why it couldn’t hit 100k either, and I am buying as soon my transfer hits my account, hopefully tomorrow. I certainly like it, at the very least for the short term.
Why? Because the WORLD’S logic for buying will be “If Facebook is doing it, it must be legit.” And that is all I care about, at least for the short term.

I’m still going to wait for a more defined move downward. Just keeping no position for now until I see that more defined move. GLTY too.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:57:45
I see. Thanks for your opinion.
