1. There is a great [Video](  from Andreas Antonopoulos where he talks about this question (at min 9:48)
2. First if you use it as a currency the problem does not occure. If you use it as an investment you should probably reseach it deep enough to understand the fact that it does not matter.
3. Lightning network solves this problem 100%. The fees are next to 0 and the transactions nearly instant. Also it is fully functional today.  Try BlueWallet App for Phones. (Disclamer: BlueWallet is a custodial wallet so just fill it with money you could loss worst case. (Like with your real wallet) There are non-custodial solutions but they are to much work for beginners at the moment. I am sure this will change soon.)
The Infrastructur merchants could build on is there.
4. Yes it is possible. For example with a second layer solution like lighting or with a change in the consensus rules. The video from 1. talks about this aswell in the beginning. 
5. Better software solutions and if they feel the need they will learn.
Next part:
1. There is no need with lightning transaction. The fees are so low so it is no problem.
2. Maybe. Maybe a currency that is backed by BTC. But there is no need people could use it. A decentralized currency does not need a government like a central one.
3. I would be very surprised if Bitcoin ever goes past 3k.
Edit:  Typo: 2. that that -&gt; that

I googled a bit and found out that the BRD wallet doesnt use the standard 12 word seed as most of the other bitcoin wallets. [Source]( 
I can recommend the Coinomi wallet instead. 
Or you could create a new 12 word seed in BRD and send your bitcoin to the BRD wallet. Keep in mind if you for any reason cant use the BRD wallet anymore it could be hard to restore your funds.
If you interested in seeds and how they work you can google BIP 39 and BIP 44.
