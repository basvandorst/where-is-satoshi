Eventually people would seek alternatives if they believe the fees aren’t worth it, as we’ve been seeing....

Honestly why does this sub keep blaming Coinbase? How can 1 exchange drive the price of a coin.... Just saying, that’s literally what this sub has become.

He literally just explained why it makes no sense, and your response is, “welp I’m used to it so it makes sense!”

Made some day trades if that counts

Why are they using a paper wallet and not a hardware wallet like a Ledger, then taking it to a safety deposit box? I thought that was the safest way to protect your cryptocurrency

And the counter argument would be that limiting the block size puts a limit on Bitcoin’s utility, right? So what is the rebuttal to that?
Please expand on why it’s important to fix the bugs you speak of before a fork

Forgive me if I’m wrong but isn’t this the whole intention of Bitcoin being open source - to encourage forks?

Did you try sending $5 a second time to confirm?

The problem people may see with this statement though is that there are other coins with lower fees and it’s during the same time period. Not a matter of it being too early

Not trying to go against the grain of this subreddit, but ELI5 exactly what is wrong with Bitcoin Cash, besides the fact that it threatens Bitcoin?
Sure. Roger did have a bit of a tantrum on a livestream that one time and a lot of people seem to have a problem with him. But besides the childish Bcash/BitcoinCash name thing, I couldn’t seem to find a flaw in his debate. Especially in yesterday’s video with Jimmy Song.
This consensus I keep getting from this subreddit is that Bitcoin Cash is a scamcoin.
A bit of a noob/outsider here so all I’m looking for is some solid convincing that he’s wrong from you guys

Explain how it is theft if Bitcoin is open-source

Makes sense. Is it cuz they realize that was the exit they were supposed to take?

So if a bad person meets someone through craigslist and rapes and murders them... does that mean we need to give creator of craigslist a life sentence?

Seriously, hold that shit

Is it any different than storing coins on Coinbase?
