You mean like calling a Segwit-coin "Bitcoin"?

Let's compare:  [BTC]( vs [BCH](

I'm sorry for your loss.

Numbers seems bit off...

Perhaps you should read up on the history of and why it exists.  [This should help](

Time to boycott reddit, amirite?

"MoneyTrigz" is leading this up?  Seems legit.

If I try to sell you Segwit-Lightning coin under the guise it's Bitcoin, is that ok?

Bitcoin (BTC) wants to scale off-chain with 2nd-layer solutions like the Lightning network. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) scales on-chain by increasing the block size.  There has been a very heated debate over which approach is best, hence the fork.
The BTC people say that increasing the block size leads to centralization as it prices out user nodes, however, this was the plan all along:

Bitcoin Cash is lightning fast.

In May, BCH will be able to handle ~224 tx/sec.  BTC can barely manage 10 tx/sec.  
How does BTC plan to scale up to that?

SegWit blocks are only 1.8MB.  Meanwhile, BCH is adding support for 32MB blocks in May.

You realize that the private keys for addresses are the same in both forks, right?

Nope.
