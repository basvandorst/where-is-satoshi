It may never reach those prices again.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:18:33
The last thing hapless hodlers need is reassuring.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:05
I hear they are going to be huge. Massive. Everyone should message you and get in. To not get in would be stupid and they'll miss out.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:38:46
So... nothing to say? Are not merchants rejecting it because it is failing to do what it is supposed to do?
Why don't you read about the problems with bitcoin scaling and LN, rather than cheerleading?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:57:53
I want the market to go down and stay down. I'd be ecstatic.
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:46:43
Seriously. Centralized systems are easy and efficient. This nonsense around decentralization is stupid. Working well is a better goal. It is because bitcoin has been poorly guided by the core devs that you poor guys are losing half your money. Bitcoin simply can’t do what it was sold as doing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:34:00
Some of the best cryptographers? Really? We're talking about guys who couldn't get a day job so they glommed onto it... It's IOTA/Tangle level badness.
MY software does what it was intended to do. Bitcoin is being rejected by merchants and traders alike because it doesn't.
What you should be talking about is how Bitcoin survives the core devs. Not sucking these bozos off.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:58:28
He needs to be able to talk and be heard. The deluded people on here should not be denied another perspective right when they most need one.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:54:23
Bullshit. Loss is loss. It isn't realized, but your net worth has gone down. Don't kid yourself... Or the poor people on here. They don't need false hope.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:50:46
That sounds about right. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:24:41
I'm a software developer. Inefficiency and poor design upsets me... hence BTC and the core devs are on my naughty list.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:49:13
You and me both. I'm going to get a 1070 ti after this shit is over.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:13:23
Go ahead. Put your fingers in your ears and scream. See where it gets you. I've forgotten more about cryptography than you'll ever know.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:16:58
I think you are confusing outside with beyond.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:30:51
Especially with no practical use to back up the valuation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:28:24
I'm a software developer so I probably know much more than you about cryptography.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:06:22
Take my money! Weee.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:48:58
And that isn't working out.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:18:24
Do you know how the banking system works?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:36:33
Greed. Pigs are getting slaughtered.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:41:57
Not 100k, just 100.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:41:36
The problem is if you actually understood the technology and the math you wouldn't be saying that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:34:01
Here to stay because magic.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:33:56
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:55:30
No. Gold is gold. It's about time you crypto guys learned that ;).
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:08:35
Yeah, "stupid".
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:38:49
Does that 350 BILLION dollar valuation come from anywhere outside of your sphincter?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:12:33
Lol, lightning is terrible. Sell sell sell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:55:31
Unfortunately it's both.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:05:10
Too good.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:15:05
My account date matters how?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:15:43
Gotta get them sweet lambobulbs to the moon.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:54:55
He is right. Bitcoin is, as a currency, an abysmal failure. Even LN is a poorly designed wreck.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:34:37
He probably shorted on the way down, not up.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:09:33
Because your subconscious is trying to save your money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:05:37
Drug dealers win again, lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:50:31
Not yet... But it is dying.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:16:08
That's not how this works.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:36:34
You might understand LN, but I don't think you understand its limitations. Try reading the link I posted above on hackernoon.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:13:27
Final capitulation for a worthless asset is valuation in cents. And it is coming.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:52:10
Yep. Nerds, ideologues and fools.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:03:41
Which most of you don't understand. Because if you did, you wouldn't be buying.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:21:52
Do you have any data to back that up? Because the only news I've heard is tent pole merchants like Valve turning away from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:14:47
If your grandfather told you that he is a wiser man than you. Listen to him.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:01:18
That's kind of like saying "tell me why I shouldn't jump off this bridge, other than a horrible death and the orphaning of my children?"
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:33:07
I could scale Bitcoin completely, and easily myself. I mean writing the code and actually doing it. It isn't hard. But the idiocy of the Bitcoin community procludes good solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:10:43
Why BTC? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:47:38
But it's being developed in a dead end direction. Market acceptance is decreasing. Hey, it's your money
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:02:18
Let's hope it goes well under 100.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:07:16
Yeah. Who else is he going to sell to? He has to find a buyer somehow. Buy buy buy!
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:21:15
Do you see LN as a long time or short term answer? Do you see it as a singular answer or working on concert with other strategies? I don't see how LN scales to cover more than a comparative smattering of people.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:20:17
Nope. I've been saying it's bullshit since the beginning.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:11:59
"we Koreans got totally manic with this and NEED buyers to get out with our skins"
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:59:15
Don't let this ridiculous mob mentality cloud your judgment. The money you've got in this stuff is YOUR MONEY, and the only person who gives a damn about it is you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:33:59
Ha! Some of these guys are desperate to go broke.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:21:52
Because the dumb money in Bitcoin, from retail investors, is tapped out. It's going to take another fake manipulative rise, like that of 100-1000, up to over 20000 to dupe more dumb money into returning.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:53:47
If you're the one who told them to invest, you should be.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:51:39
Soon you'll be able to sell all your crypto for a down payment on one at Sears. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:46:33
Interesting. So how do you see Bitcoin scaling?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:32:34
Gold is gold. Crypto is nothing. Learn the difference.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:29:39
This is real truth
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:23:09
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:31:02
People who don't understand economics or technology aren't the best tech investors. Not surprising.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:33:01
Yep. Averaging is for people who don't know what they are doing and believe the overall trend will always be up. Piggies to the slaughter.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:38:38
I'd take advice to buy with a massive grain of salt. Bitcoin is coming down, big time, and guys on here need someone to sell to.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:55:11
Not everyone is good at investing or should manage money. He may be better off with a professional.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:38:40
Bless his heart though. Such sweet obliviousness.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:06:49
It's an assumption, but not a good one. I heard about this stuff back on the dailypaul.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:34:43
Yep. That. This is an incredibly wasteful mania.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:09:16
Doesn't help the average to the moon hodler. No mainstream adoption means no lambo, period.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:31:55
Yeah. I keep hoping to see it fall further. In the end I think it is inevitable, but waiting sucks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:54:29
Wait what? You'd rather lose more than 50% than pay coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:49:14
The adorable squealing of little piggies being slaughtered.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:33:57
And it feels so good right about now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:01:53
I'm thinking Bitcoin under 1 dollar.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:07:18
I was thinking more a professional broker or a mutual fund.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:40:06
Smart trade.
Hodlers are dangerously (to themselves) unsophisticated investors.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:17:40
But you see, Bitcoin does have operators. There are these things called exchanges, and they are known to have pushed up prices artificially, and to have been used by others to do the same. I'd call the exchanges responsible for the manipulation from 100-1000 fraudulent investment operations.
Do you think Bitcoin works through some sort of blackmagicfuckery? No. There are real people operating the mining and trading apparatuses. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:42:42
It is a bit different this time. Before it fell while relatively unknown. Now it has fallen and taken out mainstream folk. The well is poisoned; retail dupes know not to get in... It's over unless someone manipulates the price much higher.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:07:08
The most I can do is point to the big merchants who are leaving, and to the fact that confirmation times and fees are making everyday transactions prohibitively expensive. You know that.
Bitcoin is by its nature difficult to track. There isn't really a definitive list. There can't be; that isn't how it works, as there is no central authority, and not much of a bar to entry. Near anyone could accept bitcoin at any time.
But, again, if you look at the recent big departures from BTC acceptance, it seems unlikely to me that any non-notable new accepters are going to make up for the losses.
Can you tell me of any big mainstream merchants that have moved to accept BTC recently?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:52:00
Real American heroes. To be fair, they owe it to all the people they convinced to buy in.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:15:09
Reversing payments is a great feature. If you get scammed being able to get your money back is great. Reversible payments make it easier for people to buy online.
And government can certainly tax you and take your money either way. And just wait until people and business are examining wallets to see who buys from who.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:51:12
Why not use PayPal? Centralization isn't bad.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:04:42
Quantum computing is advancing faster than you might think. And I don't think Bitcoin is secure from quantum attack.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:27:50
Because NOT profit taking is how you make profit from a speculative bubble! You hodlers are incredible.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:01:27
"intelligent language"?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:25:28
So you think only people with long account dates know anything about Bitcoin. Very strange.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:37:51
Well you see, a stock represents part ownership in a company, and if that company does well and grows, your investment grows. Bitcoin is entirely a confidence game.
Gold and silver have real uses, and real physical properties. Bitcoin is entirely a confidence game.
Confidence game... con-game. Ponzi.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:25:18
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:04:00
You remember that no one here gives a shit about you or your money and do what is right for you.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:36:51
The bigger fool has arrived. And not a moment too soon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:13:28
I'm sure every shady merchant would say refunds are against their will.
Authority is important for trust. I can trust a company enough to buy their product. But it's good to know that if something goes wrong, and they refuse to make it good, that the courts are there as an option. The authority of the government eases and promotes trade.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:24:03
It isn't just not for me, but it's also not for the vast majority of people. And it certainly isn't for the governments of the world. People want the presence of an authority.
Convincing people to give up their protections and recourse for libertarian ideals they don't hold is going to be a hard sell.
