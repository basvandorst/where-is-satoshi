Hi. What's wrong with Jaxx? I thought they don't store keys in the app. They only store the encrypted seed phrase.

What’s fake?

Yes but I thought I’d just post in the general Bitcoin since it was about the wallet and exchange. But I guess since this is getting into ETH territory....

coinomi is also on iOS

If the wallet is not deterministic iOS (iPhone) is just as safe a hardware wallet if not safer then Trezor/Ledger because of iOS's SEP. (as long as user does not root their phone obviously)

Admin please move to ETH.

I read about this. But this was because they were using rooted Android / jailbroken iPhones. A big no no.
Have you heard otherwise?

Ok I’ll be glad to but how can I post it without revealing my wallet or the other person’s wallet? Let me know and I’ll post it. 
Is it possible I have found a problem in the ETH network by total chance? 
What are the possibilities for each totally unrelated wallets and totally unrelated instance with different funds for these two things to happen. BOTH on Ethereum.

Check this out. The Exodus transaction showed once in my Exodus wallet and TWICE on the network with the SAME hash number.  
With the second mystery it’s either an exchange error or someone made a mistake. But what are the chances it would go to my wallet? Maybe the chances are pretty good if the exchange is incorrectly using its address. This is a new small exchange. 
Lastly, the person who sent the ETH has several thousand dollars of ETH and has made over a hundred transactions with that address.  The info is right there in the ETH explorer.

I don't know any dev that has waited that long. I guess because it's crypto. 
What's your opinion on using these unsigned apps? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:42:33
Oh yea I just saw that. What about Jaxx? The only negative thing I've heard is when someone used a rooted Nexus.
