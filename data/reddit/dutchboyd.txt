Saying "greater than unity" means the same thing as saying positive EV or +EV... you'll just never hear a professional gambler say it the way you did. 
As far as +EV bets in casinos? They're all over the place. Besides the Take blackjack as the most visible example. A card counter sitting next to a sucker are both gambling. One is doing so with a positive expected value and one with a negative expected value. But both are by almost all definitions gambling.
Usually, the distinction between gambling and investing is going to fall on an "element of chance" and a "certain outcome". Here's the legal definition under federal law:
"the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome"
I'm inclined to agree with you that investing in bitcoin isn't really gambling, even though you can lose your shirt, because there isn't that chance element and the outcome isn't certain. Options trading, and betting on what the price of bitcoin is going to be tomorrow gets a little murkier.

As a professional gambler, I can tell you that the expected value of a bet doesn't determine whether it's gambling or not. There are plenty of +EV bets in a casino... it's still gambling by pretty much anybody's definition of the word (except for yours).
