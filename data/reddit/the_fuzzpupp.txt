Thanks DAD! I'm a 39 year old engineer who's only child is grown. My retirement is already taken care of, so I use money that I would normally blow at the casino. I'm not actually doubling-down, sorry for the misnomer. I simply buy what I can when weekly/monthly lows are reached.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:15:35
Same here...I just keep buying as the price dips, doubling down at new weekly/monthly lows, all in atttempt to keep my average BTC price as low as possile. Don't get me wrong, I still shit myself with every dip, but tend to wipe my ass by doubling down!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:59:54
Atta boy...try to buy in the dips (if there are anymore LOL), buy what you can when you can, and HODL!!
is right though, mums the word on exactly how much you're hodling.

Only 21M BTC will ever exist, and by the time they have all been mined there won't be  enough bitcoin for every millionaire on Earth to own even one. The top 8 bitcoin holders already control ~300k (~2%) of the roughly 16.8M bitcoin out there.

If you linked you GDAX account to your coinbase acct via your checking account, any deposits to your coinbase USD Wallet will be sent to GDAX automatically. Then it's best to buy from GDAX.
If you're using credit/debit cards, then you can only buy instantly from coinbase and those BTC will not appear in GDAX.

Dude said "growish hash"...wrong on a few levels LOL

If you're using a checking account, link your coinbase account to GDAX and you'll save 1.75% on the buy fee. Then, when you transfer out of GDAX those transfers are free. coinbase charges 1.5% buy fee for using checking account, and tacks on 0.5% onto the chart price. GDAX only tacks on 0.25% onto the chart price without the 1% buy fee, and GDAX covers transfers fees when BTC leaves your GDAX wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:28

It depends, are you only using a checking account? Or are you using credit/debit cards too?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:07:13
I understand that Segwit2x is what they're talking about, but what actually happened to reduce the price by "29%" was the mining cartels moved over to Bcash transactions and temporarily brought BTC transactions to a hault, thus causing the dip in bitcoin price and hyperinflation of Bcash (i.e. pump and dump).
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:32
I'm hoping it keeps dipping because I'm ready to throw down some serious cash.

I have a friend who was a miner from the early days and lost ~20BTC when the Silk Road tanked. When he lost them, that might've been enough to buy a weekend of fun.
I think after reading this and talking to him, you both share similar feelings today even though your journeys were different. Keep your monthly buys going, and be happy that your back in a financial position to hodl. 
BTC is here to stay, so buy what you can when you can and remember value is all relative.

Bitcoin is the yo-yo master and I'm the yo-yo, but I'm ok with that!
I was able to get in a $1000 at $9300/BTC. 
To answer your question, I try to get in when the value of BTC is at least 15% less than the previous all time high. Some people say buy what you can when you can, but I stick to my guns and it has worked out thus far.
Good luck, happy bitcoining!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:47:41
So, he shaved off ~5700BTC and has "double of what a normal person ever needs". Do you have an idea what value (USD/BTC) average he sold them at?
My buddy and I were in grad school together from 2009-2013 and he had like 4 computer consoles (owned by our college) all rigged together using the college's electricity doing his mining. He didn't have the foresight to hodl his, or maybe he was more interested in partying his up, but regardless I kick my own ass every day for not jumping in on the action. I started buying in March of this year and have ~8BTC bought at an average value of $4200/BTC. I'm doing the same as you and buying what I can and when I can, but I also splurge during the adjustments/corrections.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:58:18
Loaded question...absolute confidence in the survival and proliferation of bitcoin within my “long term” investment period is assumed, but obviously there’s uncertainty regarding how the control of the blockchain and tx mempool will shake out after mining rewards cease to exist. This makes my late-adopter investment strategy a bigger gamble since I didn’t acquire BTC for pennies on the dollar.
The players with the biggest wallets control whether bitcoin dies or doesn’t, much like chip leaders in poker control the length of the Holdem’ tournament. 
I’m just a short stack with a “chip and a chair” wanting to have fun gambling for long enough “to cash” in this crazy poker tournament we late-adopters call bitcoin.

I’m a late adopter (lost my BTC virginity in Aug 2017) with an average of $3600 per coin
I will never sell my bitcoin because I don’t have enough money invested (even at a much higher cost per coin relative to OG bitcoiners) to care if bitcoin goes bust
I’ve lost 40 pounds since Mar 2017 by not eating out and gambling and living in excess because I spend that money on bitcoin
Ergo bitcoin is making me healthier
I only hope that as adoption increases I will get the chance to spend small percentages of my holdings to buy things that would normally cost me way more with Fiat

Tails has many of the protections baked into it (Tor, Tor bridge, MAC spoofing, persistence volume, security levels for various browsing, etc.) 
It’s also a perfect forum for using these tools in a Linux-based environment that a fair percentage of non-techies who also reddit, use

I think so. Even if it dips to $2k or less, you can buy all the way down with money that won’t hurt you financially.

Yes, diversity is good. The Winklevoss twins’ exchange called Gemini has a nice tool for investing in the top 5 or 6 cryptos (by market share) with a single purchase. 
If you use Excel, set up a cell that you can enter the bitcoin price ($/BTC). I’ll use A2 for my example. Also set up another cell that you’ll enter your amount of BTC (B2).
Set up another cell (C2) with the formula:
=A2*B2 
Multiplying price times your holdings is your value.
This will give you the value of the amount of BTC you have in dollars.
Repeat this instruction using three new cells if you buy other cryptos.

@_date: 2018-12-08 18:18:46
I think the feeling of ownership without the high cost of investment per coin for the non-OG bitcoiners via the setting up of a lightning node would begin to take a foothold with respect to adoption among those who bought in high last year, and those who are new to bitcoin as well but may be a little gun shy.
I am in the process of setting up my own lightning node even though I don’t belong to either of those two groups of people I mentioned. I started purchasing bitcoin last summer, but backed off when the price got above $8000. I started reinvesting again this year when the price went below $4000, so I am sitting near $3500 per coin on an average.
For me, setting up this lighting node is the next step in adoption and me buying into what bitcoin stands for, and I think it can do the same for others.

I’ve suspended the instant ACH bitcoin buys that result in the exchange holding the coin and retaining the keys
I am increasing my ACH cash deposits a week ahead of when I intend to buy bitcoin so I can move the coin instantly to a wallet who’s keys I control

No doubt...took a while for me to finally get below $4k average, but I just started bitcoining last year from late August ($2700) to mid-October ($8-9k).
I felt like 8 times previous ATH was my limit....glad I stopped. I just disappeared from reddit and deleted my exchange apps.
Started buying again (10% post tax income every two weeks) when we hit $4k.
I’m following this rabbit hole all the way down.
Still not in the 21 million club though.....yet!

My first buy was early August last year when bitcoin was ~$2700, but that was almost 3 times the previous ATH. I bought in pretty hard, slowed down when the price went above $6k, and then stopped buying at $8k.
You’re in at roughly 18% of last year’s ATH. That’s good!
Every time price exceeds $3500, I’m in the black. Ever since price dropped below $4k, I’ve been upping my biweekly buys, and I made a couple of decent size ACH buys to crack the $3500 barrier.
The irony is, our average per coin is similar...I just got to ride the rollercoaster once already.
Keep buying with the money you’d normally squander in some other reckless way and have fun.

Pro only allows ACH and wire transfer of fiat from a bank account 
If you ACH deposit weekly on Thursday, you’re guaranteed to purchase every Friday starting eight days after you’re first Thursday-deposit
The coin you purchase on Friday’s after your ACH deposits clear is able to be moved instantly out of Pro for free

Tails operating system which includes an electrum wallet...see r/tails
There are different camps of people who will provide opinions on where to buy bitcoin, but with it being so cheap right now paying a little bit extra at a bitcoin ATM versus dealing with the exchanges it’s probably a good bet 
Edit: local bit coins dot com is compromised, so seek other venues for direct P2P 
Do not keep your coin on an exchange.... so if you want to go to Coinbase use pro dot coinbase dot com and put your money from your bank a week ahead of when you want to buy because then you can buy the bitcoin and move it instantly
If you don’t put your money in a week ahead on coinbase, your only option is to use a debit card or a credit card (if your companies will allow it), but then coinbase will hold your coin until they decide that you can have it
You can message me for further assistance assuming you like what I told you

My personal belief is that there are 1000s of people like me that have limit buys set up all the way to $1500. I’m thinking $2019 (no TA here lol, just an ignorant guess) is the bottom, which will happen on Feb 19th.

@_date: 2018-12-27 23:03:09
The mentality of buying value with credit is toxic, but I can understand the play in this case because there is (at least) one fundamental difference with OP’s scenario that distinguishes it from that same mentality which led to the Great Depression
In this case, buying bitcoin with borrowed fiat at the agreed student loan interest rate locks in the amount of future USD that it will take to satisfy the loan, but once the coin is moved to a private wallet that OP owns the keys to, the coin is “owned”
The difference here is that pending hyperinflation will only make OP’s coin more valuable (opposite of the worthless stock certificates left to “HODL” back in 1929), and as an added bonus the hyperinflation won’t change the balance due on the loan by much since the interest rates on student loans are stable(ish)

Possibly 90% of people, but yeah...
Hedging bets against a reality such as societal breakdown doesn’t equate to being in it for sheer profit in any conceivable way.
I’m simply insulating myself from the max harshness that the proposed reality will bring, but am also an advocate of decentralized p2p exchange of value....notice how wealth is not a part of this rationale?? 
Not a gamble bro.....
Who needs wealth when everything required to survive is free? That’s the point.

I would only send what they’re asking for so that way they can do their account setup and once that’s verified, send whatever you want to actually deposit
Over here across the pond they usually send two transactions to your bank and ask you what those small amounts were, for verification.

I cannot wait for extreme hyperinflation to hit the USD and Euro.
I recently bought a piece of land with my life savings in a place where food and energy sources are abundant, and now I’m buying as much BTC biweekly that I’d usually pffffffffft at if lost at a casino, or a night at the bars.
I may not be an OG bitcoiner, but I am a holder who is in the game for about $3500 average and am already a winner having experienced bitcoin ownership thru the 2017 bull and 2018 bear runs. 
Pretty wild ride y’all and I’m not getting off this roller coaster even when society breaks down and I disappear to my oasis in the tundra. That’s when the value of bitcoin will really take off because the Internet will always exist.

7.2 is a lot better than 5 sat/b or less
Tx volume would be the biggest factor for whether you get “closer” to the tip of the mempool
The fact you’re below 1mb means you’re moving in the right direction
Use mempool data to determine the tx’s sitting above a particular fee level (10, 15, 20 sat/b, etc.) and set your fee accordingly

No, that’s inverting my point by stating my happiness depends on others’ misfortune. It doesn’t, and here’s why:
I believe that modern society will break down after a few more financial crashes like in 2008, the one that put me out of business and led to my girlfriend of 11 years walking out with our daughter in case you were wondering. 
It won’t be a complete break down, but I believe only 10-15% of the human race will survive, but will be subjugated to the control of the “1%” (the NWO if you prefer)
I will remain in control of my life because I will be in the frozen tundra where nobody gives a shit that I exist.  Do you think those in power will come hundreds of miles just to extract me from my little piece of land in the middle of nowhere?
The internet will always exist because the “1%” will maintain the infrastructure, er go bitcoin will exist. 
If you think the Internet will die just because of societal breakdown, you are fooling yourself. It is the most powerful tool for control purposes.
Central banks operate on consumer confidence and the debt morons create by consuming confidently, so without consumers their fiat is simply glorified plant fiber (i.e. fire starter).
So now guess what, bitcoin is there still storing value.
Try carrying your net worth in gold or physical objects on your person when the NWO comes to your door and you flee their gallows.
Lottery?!?!? Really bro, lottery? Gtfo with that crap.  Bitcoin isn’t a freaking lottery.
