Thanks for the post!  I don't even know where to start.
I really love what you had to share -- many of the project ideas are similar to my own -- but your observations on the Bitcoin Foundation are great to hear as well.
It's also refreshing to know that other people are coming to the same conclusions about Bitcoin's Blockchain's potential  -- so if any one of us get's hit by a bus tomorrow - the plan will still come to fruition.
**tldr;**  -  Our thought processes on how Bitcoin, in conjunction with other protocols and technologies -- can be used to elevate Freedom of Information -- is remarkable -- including the set of tools which could be built on top of such an abstraction layer.
But none of it happens without a baseline tool.  As you were keen to point out -- Bitcoin possesses a required characteristic to allow for such a tool: it's a decentralized source of trust -- and it makes it indispensable to the project and to Freedom of Information.
I have done a lot of theory-crafting with my friends, and we are going to eventually deliver on an aspirational idea.  For us, it's watching the Internet's weak protocols get bent maliciously, and thinking about how a combination of technologies increase the resiliency of what we do online.  (I have included a summary of the "problems" we identified with respect to internet protocols and more clearly defined goals -- in my email to you.)
This Freedom-of-Information "abstraction layer" is a protocol that we've decided to call **STC**, and it stands for "Selectively Transposed Communication" -- and the meaning behind those words is very similar to your use of the words: "containing redundant copies of the forums."
It's not as simple as "baking in data into the block chain" -- that, for all effective purposes can't actually be done.  But there is an end result that is the same -- and still uses the block-chain, and it's the focus of a paper I'm writing and the development of the protocol of which is in the early stages.
Finally - there are many angles on how to offer additional value once the technology exists to communicate (privately or in broadcast-fashion).   Many of the best such ideas would benefit greatly from a compete rethink of Identity on the web.  
The idea that GooglePlus, Twitter, and Facebook are shilling -- that, in order for them to know you're not a 'bot' they need to make all of your information public -- is complete and utter bullshit ---- it's a money maker for them, because they sell ads against social interaction/sharing.
We believe that it's possible for Identity to be handled in a manner that would allow for "selective disclosure" of ones information -  being able to prove through a network of contacts -- that you are merely a person (not a "bot") - or - if you feel it's appropriate to disclose more -&gt; proof that you are a specific person - attached to specific credentials --&gt; or - any shade of grey in between.  :)
I will be attending the Texas Bitcoin Conference, and then GopherCon2014 the month after - and will definitely see the project through to its completion -- but it currently has no estimated completion date - because it is unfortunately not my only focus.
I started a free service for people to Gift Bitcoin to others about a week before Christmas this year ~ at spreadthecoin.com ~ it's receiving less attention in lieu of the STC project.
 
I also started the BitcoinBulletin.com in late 2010

How many items are indexed?  As in -- is it enough to make a decent search engine?  And what's next for search bitcoin?

Thanks for the awesome feedback!

That's actually quite a coincidence:  I just launched my Bitcoin project that helps you gift any amount of Bitcoin in a way that explains where to use it -- while spreading the spirit!

**1.)** Even if the *only thing* I commented on was the likelihood of LTC being traded on major exchanges ---- that (in and of itself) is enough to convince some (myself included) that it will be worth more down the road.
**2.)** Your thoughts about transaction times ( is explained as FUD.  There's a debate of security vs convenience.  Let's say Joe-Smoe wants to leave Starbucks after getting his caramel Frappuccino.  I can see a need for speed, and I can say that Litecoin-Qt recognizes transactions much faster that BTC-MultiBit, so maybe that's just the current state of the respective implementations or unfair somehow, but it's something
**3.)** ( "Diversification") Who are you to say that Bitcoin is an equal investment to Litecoin, etc?  There are separate risks and potential upsides for each currency.  *This is your weakest point*, and - combined with a generalization of Litecoin arguments as "fraudulent," seriously?
**4.)** About "distribution of wealth".  Much of the early wealth has not moved from its original wallets.  It's a legitimate concern of some, because it's not hypothetical
*edit: This comment has been "reported" and downvoted.*

At the risk of being downvoted...
I've been invested in Bitcoin since 2010, and blogged about it in the early days at BitcoinBulletin.  Here's an outline of a post that I am working on about observations of altCoins.  I'll focus on Litecoin since that's what this post is about.  It'd be awesome if you could provide some feedback.
**I. Technical**
**1.) Transaction times.**
Litecoin recognizes attempted transactions roughly 4 times faster.  If you have moved Bitcoin and Litecoin around in clients, it's a noticeable and positive benefit.  This does not change the wait time for all transaction confirmations to be received.
**2.) API similarities**
Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin in terms of API integration.  In this regard, merchants, app-developers and exchanges which have been set-up for Bitcoin should be able to adopt Litecoin with relative ease.
**3.) Solid Development**
The project is forked from Bitcoin and Gavin/Garzik/BTC-coreDev are working with Litecoin to tackle the same bugs, even with shared BTC/LTC bounties.  Bugs patched in Bitcoin are merged into LTC within days.   Unlike most other altCoins, Litecoin is actually invested in the upstream development of Bitcoin.  Charles Lee (the Litecoin founder) was a Google engineer.  Litecoin also has its own dedicated team.
Here's an example of a jointly-tackled bug: 
*edit:   and  differentiate LTC from some other altCoins, but BTC clearly has edge over LTC in these categories.*
**II. Circumstantial Differences**:
**1.)  Distribution of Bitcoin.** (edit: this point has pretty much been neutralized in the responses-comments, so I'd say it can be taken with a grain of salt, and thanks for your feedback)
a.) There is a poor distribution of early wealth, and b.) there's a possibility that a great percentage of all Bitcoins are currently held by unpredictable actors.
A few things to consider: 1. A list of richest Bitcoin addresses is not a good representation of the concentration of wealth. A single person can have x wallets. 2. Bitcoin wealth is often used to reinvest in mining equipment, which furthers one's wealth to a greater extent. Rinse/repeat.
Several of the oldest wallets have been dormant for years, which means that this is not hypothetical -- that wealth has not circulated.
If Bitcoin becomes a more important part of our daily lives, handling commerce ubiquitously, etc.--a single individual with ~10+% of said Bitcoin has enormous disruptive potential. I'm not referring to what said person could purchase with that wealth, but one's ability to manipulate markets.
This has never been a big issue, as far as the growth in value of the currency. However, I think this kind of uncertainty could freak out potential institutional investors.
Litecoin does not suffer as much from this issue because their exposure was far greater than Bitcoin ca. 2009, and the mining competition was greater on the respective debut-date by several orders of magnitude.
With Litecoin in particular, Charles Lee pre-announced that it was going public several days in advance.
**2.)  Access to altCoins**
Mainstream access to altCoins is minimal, and introduction to big exchanges (Bitstamp, MtGox, Coinbase) is likely, seeing that: 1.) MtGox has stated in multiple press releases that it intends to do so, 2.) Charles Lee now works at Coinbase, 3.) Charles Lee's brother is the owner of BTC-China.  On the other hand, liquidity from Litecoin into Bitcoin is everpresent.
From an investment perspective, this lack of historic access (and potential upcoming increase of access) to Litecoin is generally seen as a major benefit.  
That said, it also has a negative/opposite effect on the current usefulness/liquidity of the altCoin. 
**3.)  Mining**
Currently there is a surplus hash-rate in the Bitcoin mining community, especially for older medium-to-small rig-setups, as well as a bunch of GPU-based hardware that is no longer competitive in the BTC mining environment.   This means that alternative currencies benefit from that overflow and have relatively robust networks.
*edit:  thanks for the Gold!!!  Seeing that people have so much invested in one thing or another-who knows if it's for the merit of the comment. Either way, I'm still ecstatic, thanks!*
*edit2: removed bit about mining equipment*

I wasn't sure of a good title.
The soft mirror of the document is actually here:
The tldr; - Bitcoin is good, and it's because it allows for a greater deal of transparency.  :D

Specifically - are there any bugs you can find with the website, or page speed - load problems?
Also - how well does your browser print-to-PDF the HTML certificate?
The library used for the QR code upload is really pretty finicky.  I'm worried it will be a pain for people

This seems to be the kind of spam that plagues the Bitcoin community, 24/7.

First, I will answer your question to the best of my ability.  As to where the donations go:
1. My understanding is that ... with Not-For-Profits, the primary difference is the N.F.P. can't hold any of it's income -- it has to immediately spend it.  I believe we could verify, make public, the flow of money, because, this is Bitcoin, after all.  [I would be open to making some rules regarding guaranteeing where the money went/would-go. For example, x-amount over a minimum could go directly to the EFF or something to this effect.  I generally *am* self conscious about how much I'd take in donations, unless there's a need.]   I plan to have a couple of wallets set up and essentially not touch them for 14 day spans. I would then disclose the movement of money when I do move them.  (This plan would afford me a transparent solution that saves time in the short term.  I don't need to liquidate Bitcoin assets immediately, so this seems like a low budget, deferrable, and transparent system.]
2. I have not made any promises of shares of the company, despite having team members (see point   This means that I can, solely, be held accountable for the flow of cash -- of the Not For Profit.
3. The NFP entity will be actually recognized by the Arkansas SoS as that type of entity on Jan 1st (I am filing tomorrow).
4. Up until Christmas - I will be accepting any donations under a sole-proprietorship structure,  I have two team mates who are being paid as short term consultants.  They will not be officers of the N.F.P. and will be paid out of the first donations for their time and help.  They have made a commitment to help me up to at least 2 days after Christmas.  After that point - there is no residual payment to them, unless I make a new agreement.
Next, : No donations will be possible until the Dec-16th.
It will be a 501(c)(3) - I believe (again I'm not a tax guy, just a programmer).  I am meeting with a tax/corporate lawyer tomorrow and all of the filings will be on public record by Jan 1st.  Part of me wants to have something like a wordpress.org/wordpress.com setup - where I could leave the possibility open to have a business too.  It's something I plan to discuss with the lawyer tomorrow.
What  I do know at this time, definitively, is that none of the donations made before the next year will fall into the 'purse' of any NFP/company structure. - Because Jan 1st is the day all of that will be officially recognized -- the Dec-16th through Jan1st will be essentially to my name.
As for whether my site will be/I am -- the real deal:  After we launch, there will be plenty of social-proof---to help guide your decision making as to whether to trust me. 
This post is *not* part of the service's official launch strategy, it's just me testing the community-waters.  Furthermore, when the organization's filing-paper's become official I will verify/make them known that day - or show that they are in the public roman.
If you feel compelled to - you may donate to the wallet on bitcoinbulletin.  I just don't recommend that - because it's really not necessary, and I don't check that wallet very often.  It's also a separate, unrelated venture.
Again, THANK YOU.

Litecoin wasn't, it was pre-announced and is the primary differentiator.  This "fair competition" offsets some major concerns about Bitcoin's stability.


The same could have been said about Bitcoin at any point. many still do -- cue Schiff &amp; co.


 ... fair enough, though it is meant to be used "on the same hardware used to mine bitcoins"


Security vs. convenience is a fair and debatable point.


That's right.  Any merchants or exchanges which currently accept Bitcoin can use the same approach with Litecoin.  That's huge.


Yep.  Here's an example of a jointly-tackled bug: 


I'm diversified--about 50/50.
