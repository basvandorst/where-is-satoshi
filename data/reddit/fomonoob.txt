Do you think it would be a good idea to raise a Bounty on bounty0x for development goals? Like the first lightening integration into a wallet?

You do realize there are tradeoffs in the advantages you list right? Or are you just trolling? Curious though which altcoin has better security than bitcoin? As far as I know it is the one coin that has been running for 9 years without being hacked.

Jimmy Song had a great point on his channel. Lightning and Segwit are out but adoption is slow because companies are slow. We need agile new competition in wallets, and exchanges. A new exchange comes out with segwit and lightning it has a competitive advantage, we need to see more new competition.

Don't know if you're going overboard or sarcastic, who knows on reddit but its just important to force through change with economic incentives. These exchanges probably won't change until the have to. Look at the ridiculous withdrawal fees being charged right now on some platforms.

You've got to remember that decentralization is not a side feature or gimmick for Bitcoin but absolutely essential for its value and identity. Other currencies can compromise on decentralization for performance, that should never be an option for the true Bitcoin and only solutions that allow the underlying ledger to remain dentralized, trustless and immutable can be considered.

As I understand it he means that by taking the long term view himself, Buffet makes money of stocks that are undervalued because of the short term perspective of the rest of wall street.
If the rest of the market were all correctly identifying the long term winners there would be no undervalued stocks.

I do agree thats a legitimate criticism of Bitcoin. Bitcoin gold seeks to address that mining exclusivity but the whole project looks like a mess in so many other ways. I also don't like the huge amounts of energy expended but it does provide unparalleled security for the network.

Its great to have the option to have complete control of your own Bitcoin, I see that is its key strength and philosophy but I still don't like that access to one password is all you need to gain control and I think a lot of people won't. I would see a diversified strategy using 3rd parties, cold storage and hot wallets as probably the most flexible approach. Im still not sure it could reach full mainstream adoption while still open to being stolen without a trace or recourse but maybe its doesn't need to.

Once all the Bitcoins have been mined, how do transactions get confirmed?
Correct me if I am wrong but isn't mining new bitcoins part of the process of confirming transactions?
Once mining is finished, no longer profitable and the miners move on to new coins does the network still function?
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:11:19
While that is true, you are going to have companies/ funds who offer trading and investing in Bitcoin and they are subject to the usual regulations, in those cases it would be the company's responsibility to secure the Bitcoin rather than the customer. This setup is very attractive to the average person and companies will probably offer to hold bitcoin accounts too. This doesn't actually mean that Bitcoin itself will be regulated.

I could see BTC dropping through 4k and going a lot further down after this recent huge pump. Of course it will bounce back but a bit of a sell off is common sense at these prices and could trigger a bit of panic selling in the newer investors.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:29:28
Ha the whole name thing is done. Bitcoin cash hardforked off with block increase and EDA, whether its value overtakes Bitcoin or not it's established its identity, its not going to exchange its logo and name. That would be needlessly confusing for investors and merchants.

Sticky wages are not a theory, they are an observed reality. 
Phrases like "Thats how the free market works" are often used in conjuction to basic theories that often don't prove to be true in practice. The market appears far less rational in reality because economics is a social science as much as some don't like to admit it and feelings, irrational behavior are significant factors.
Having said that I'm not sure a deflationary currency couldn't work and I'm not a big fan of Friedman.

Surely with no replay protection the only way to sell it soon after the fork would be to leave it in an exchange which will credit both. Transferring it anywhere post fork may move both chains.

That's easy to answer. Because it has performed better as an investment than a currency.
I'm not saying it is not a currency and cannot be a widespread currency but it has performed extremely well as an investment therefore it is very easy to see why it is viewed as an investment. 
Maybe in the future when it stops performing as an extremely high return investment and maybe when the technology is capable of being a high performing currency then things will change
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:56:56
To be serious this does seem to be a major issue for a potential long term currency, losing a significant amount of the supply everytime a generation dies off.
This be could be solved with more trust in 3rd parties and better front end software but not without upsetting the purists.

Its the platform you're using. On mine they have a super saver fee option, they recommend to not use it but it confirms in seconds and costs almost nothing. Exchanges and wallets are just setting the defaults too high, it is not neccesary.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:15:05
They'd have to have a lot of foreign reserves for it. No exchange is accepting NK's currency. If they have their own exchange they still need Bitcoin holders.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:56:28
Its possible in the future, but we still need price discovery and a stable regulatory environment. Its still going to need far higher adoption to get anywhere near a stable price.

Ok.. but thats also what it says in the link you have posted. NK are hacking SK exchanges and alsp collecting ransoms for bitcoin. This isn't my own guesswork, just what you posted.
They can't 'buy' significant enough amounts to have an affect of price. Their whole gdp is a less than 20%  of Btc's market cap.

No you are probably not running a full bitcoin node. What wallet is it?
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:47:47
A computer running the bitcoin software with a record of every transaction ever made and the ability to check transactions. 
There are no monetary benefits to running one but they keep the Bitcoin network decentralized.

Yes I realize its just evocative writing. No one is buying stocks in an attempt to save the economy. Its just the buying the dip investors getting overwhelmed by another another leg down is what sounds familiar to the current state of the cryptocurrency market.
