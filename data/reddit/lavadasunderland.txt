Epic resistance at $47619 in 2022.
$47619 × 21 BTC = $1m

The Spain part is not that important.
The fact is, we gave you 5131 BTC in May 2016.  Now the market cap is 0 BTC because there's no exchanges, liquidity, utility, or shilling of the token.

The largest peer2peer OTC markets have all their volume in BTC:
1/3 of the ATMs don't even support shitcoins:
The largest DNM, Dream, only accepts BTC and BCH.  I doubt they have much BCH volume.  BTC is doing 15x more onchain transactions:
The CEO of one of the largest OTC trading desks said more than 90% of their volume was in BTC in October:

There are no other coins "just like it"
BTC has more buy support and liquidity than all the other coins/tokens combined: [
There's a scarce 17.4m coins (BTC) that have dominant liquidity, that can be used to move hundreds of millions without too much slippage.
The easiest way to obtain privacy coins or stable coins in a permissionless manner (no KYC) is still:
cash -&gt; BTC -&gt; XMR
cash -&gt; BTC -&gt; stablecoins
The OTC market is still dominated by BTC.  It's the largest fiat gateway and the reserve currency of the crypto market:  [
Stablecoins are not useful as a hedge against seizures.  They all have central controllers who can freeze balances. Stablecoins like USDT have been worse hedges against inflation than BTC for anyone who held 3+ years.

Central authorities could seize 100% of your value.  
Bitcoin is much harder to seize if it's properly stored.

If someone followed the lyrics to this fyrstikken song in February 2015, they would be a millionaire now.


Assuming they divided the mortgage money across the top 10 shitcoins and the 3 exchanges.  They would've lost some to scams like Cryptsy and Paycoin.  However, they would still be up more than 20x today, and more than 100x at the peak.

Currently the miners are dumping up to 54k BTC per month.  That cuts in half in 2020.
All else being equal, relieving 27k BTC monthly sell pressure makes it easier for the price to rise.
The "halving will have no impact" crowd on this subreddit in 2015 turned out to be wrong:

Your nonsensical Buttcoin meme is a joke.
People use USD as the quote currency *for now* because it's less volatile.
10 years is a short time in the history of money.
If all goes according to plan, Bitcoin's market cap will be in the trillions after a few more block reward halvings.
Bitcoin will become less volatile when it eventually reaches maximum adoption.
In a couple decades people will quote prices will like this:
1 USD = 286 satoshis
1 GBP = 362 satoshis

The majority of gold's market cap is supported by people who hold bullion in their vaults.
If all the bullion holders dumped - dentistry, jewelry, and electronics would only support a small % of the current price.
Value is subjective:


No one uses gold to buy drugs.  According to the UN's 2018 World Drug Report, the % of global drug users who source from DNM has been growing every year.  Up to 9% in 2018.
Decentralization allows for pseudononymity and permissionless access.  These features make it useful for trading drugs and moving/storing drug profits.  
If it's stored properly, Bitcoin is useful as a hedge against seizures, bail-ins, and hyperinflation in countries like China, Cyprus, and Venezuela.
It's also used for gambling, one of the largest markets in the world.
To pretend Bitcoin's only use is to sit in a digital vault is absurd.

There's been way too much tax shilling and fear mongering on crypto social media lately.
I pay my taxes because I'm happy with my government's service.

I've been here for 6+ years and cashed-out more than 500x my initial investment.
I will continue to hold my remaining BTC until it reaches parity with gold's market cap.  Then I will directly spend it and leave the remainder to my successors.

The fees and utility of every shitcoin are minuscule.
Look at Breadwallet's BRD token.  It's also an effectively useless token for a mobile wallet.  However, they got it listed and gave the token some symbolic utility for shilling purposes. Thankfully, their investors have some liquidity on Binance.
Breadwallet cares about their users/investors.  Mycelium are a bunch of scammers.

The 2020 block reward halving.
The maximum monthly sell pressure from miners will go from 54k BTC to 27.5k BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:26:08
How do any shitcoins provide any kind of ROI?
- Get it listed on Binance.
- Get it listed on Coinmarketcap.
- Give it some utility in the wallet.  For example, Mycelium collects 1% fee on every Local Trader transaction.  Use 20% of that fee to buyback/burn MT.
- MT holders would then have an incentive to shill for Mycelium
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:58:48
Yeah, similar to what happened with gold.
It has been relatively stable between $6T and $12T market cap for the past 10 years because of "adoption", aka people buying and holding bullion in vaults.
No one uses gold as a currency or unit of account because it's a physical object that's too difficult to trade.  Bitcoin is easy to transfer/trade.  It's already used as a quote currency on exchanges like Binance.

PSA: Mycelium scammed the community out of 5131 BTC:
They used the BTC to party in Spain:
They didn't get MT listed on any exchanges.  They didn't give it any utility in their wallet.  It's basically a total loss for investors.

"If you were rich, you wouldn't be using reddit"
I've seen this meme at least a dozen times, and it's not true.

According to the UN's 2018 World Drug Report, the % of global drug users who source from DNM is increasing every year.  Up to 9% in 2018.
BTC still dominates the DNM volume because most users don't understand or care about chain analysis.
Bromium's March 2018 research report corroborates the fact that BTC is widely adopted in some niche markets:

If the Chinese had central control of Bitcoin, their preferred fork (BCH) would be the  coin.
The economic majority overpowers the miners.
If the miners started freezing balances, users would dump their SHA-256 coins for a fork with a different consensus algorithm.  This would kill the value of the miners' SHA-256 hardware.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:22:05
Yeah, the 50-month Moving Average should also act as support around $2950

I increased the BTC value of my portfolio by diversifying into real estate and other assets.
My remaining BTC is pure profit anyways, and I bet it will be worth a lot more after a few block reward halvings.
