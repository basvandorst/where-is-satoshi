No one at my work knows I’ve been into crypto for a long time. People have been talking about it lately and asked me if I know about it. I usually just reply “yeah I’ve heard if it, but don’t know much”. And just leave it at that. It’s a good way to hear what people on the outside say haha.

I would love to punch that guy in the face. Idk why, just seems like a punchable face.

Not sure if it’s this  video but in one of the videos he rented a house to film at and proclaimed it as his own ������.

Good thing the  feature of bitcoin is censorship resistance.

Btc was 3k in september. Relax

You should advise them all to never leave their coins on an exchange. I see too many people feel ok to have their funds just sitting in coinbase wallets

Lololol voting on what our taxes gets spent on? Good one. No one wants most of their income taxes to be spent on defense spending...But it’s not a choice bc it’s companies like Lockheed Martin who decide. Through lobbying and building their factories all over the country, on purpose, so that congressmen have no incentive to cut funding bc that cuts jobs. Our vote doesn’t account for shit.

The way I’ve viewed scaling even before LN was a thing, was through a second layer. Kind of like a checking/savings or debit cards/checks. Where you take some security risks and gain some significant benefits for speed and low fees. 
If I’m moving large amounts of money, I don’t mind paying fees, if I’m buying things for under $100 I’ll take some risks to move that without fees quickly...bc well max I lose 100$. 
I don’t know wether LN is the solution or not, and I’m no bitcoin core shill, they have their own issues. But I do believe the LN could be the beginning of a solution. 
I don’t see constantly increasing blocksize as a feasible solution, til what end can you keep increasing blocks? Bitcoin cash is pro blocksize upgrades bc their miners are alibaba, who has computational powers to sustain that, but then you risk centralization. 
LN def has its problems too. I wouldve liked to see it implemented in Litecoin and widely used prior to bitcoin implementing it. 
As for opening and closing channels, yes it’s confusing but it’s also a brand new tech. If it’ll work I’m sure a GUI interface will be created down the line. Look back a few years, mining and even buying crypto was a fairly difficult task...now some projects have one-click miners. 
There’s a duality, we must on one hand keep core in check...on the otherhand, we must not count their skills out, bc let’s all admit, they know their stuff way better than I or most of us.

In September it was 3k...that was three months ago lol.

Someone should start an online car dealership dealing with bitcoin only.

You recommend selling a bit to buy back later? Buying the dip is easier than selling the top. I’m thinking bout selling 10% of my holding but want to regret it if it goes more parabolic 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:56:31
Fyi most of your taxes goes to the military. Plus we all already paid taxes on the money we earned to put into crypto. I pay a heavy 30% income tax on my regular income...i pay taxes on property, gas, merch etc. the little i have left to invest is also taxed...a little too much taxing for america to do their war games, dont you think?  
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:44:49
This! This is why I laugh so hard when people say on twitter now “i hope it crashes so i can buy back in later”. Yeah right, most noobs wish it crashed so they can buy...but when it is ACTUALLY crashing, they will be more scared, run, panic, panic sell. When I bought in the last crash I was 100% sure I’m making a mistake and I barely was able to get myself to buy...then next day I woke up and it was way below where ai bought in at haha. 
So yeah, when people tweet that they’re waiting for a crash to buy...in reality they don’t know what they’re saying.

If you click on 2x shillers on reddit, they have no other history than promoting 2x and hating on btc ��. Sketchy. Almost sounds like paid accounts.

So not to fud here, but if mt gox selloff caused this...imagine what tether can do. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:42:19
Agreed. I love this wild west shit. If people get caught in a scam, so be it...the market will teach you. "Regulations" in my eyes is just when the government wants a piece of the pie. Lol when did governments actually cared about their people?

I use blockfolio app, it is amazing. Highly recommend it. 
It lets you see your gains vs fiat or vs bitcoin. So when you trade alts it's good to keep an eye on your gains vs bitcoin...bc if you can beat bitcoin, you're better off holding bitcoin. (I learned this the hard way)

Fork.lol is a fun one to check out

I believe BTC can go up, it can go down, or it can stay the same. ��

I think i got into crypto at the worse time and even though i did decent fundamental analysis and diverse port folio, I'm down $3000 since i started in august 1. Losing patience, funds, and sleep 
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:58:32
Find proper resources. Anyone that has a paid group or does calls on twitter is a scam and should not be listened to. Do your own research, investing is a long term game, invest in companies who will be around 5 yrs from now.

What about the doctors who overprescribe opioids? Got my tooth pulled...they prescribed me a week of opioids. I was fine with ibuprofen.
