I agree, but it would be so heavily against the pool operator's interest that it's exceedingly unlikely they would try and intentionally take over the network.

To play devil's advocate, Gox may at least attempt to pay back as many people as they can. It's not 100% clear everyone's funds are gone right now, even though that's kind of what it looks like.

Agreed. It feels like they got the wrong guy.
It could all be true, but something seems off. Why in the world would he admit it to the reporter? Why would he use his real, true name if he was paranoid? Is there any proof that the man they found is a proficient C++ programmer? Math skills do not necessarily equate to programming or crypto skills.

I don't even understand why he's posting on reddit. I have no idea if he's guilty or not, or the amount of evidence against him, but the prosecution team is probably staring at his comments on reddit as we speak.
If dozens of years of prison were possible for me, I would keep my mouth shut.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:31:52

I believe the NSA/GCHQ will go out of their way to abuse their power to fight people they think are criminals, but probably won't do so to fight people they don't think are criminals. That is my personal belief.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:17:29
Is there hard evidence he's a criminal?
I don't know the full circumstances, but he was arrested for selling bulk Bitcoins at a discount, yes? The only problem is that he sold them to a guy who was using them to sell drugs online. It's not like he funded terrorists or murderers or kiddie porn.
Going by his comments on reddit he seems kind of sleazy, but he isn't a criminal until he's proven guilty. And even if he is a criminal, his offense seems more like funding a drug trade, not actual financial fraud (which at least in my view is a far greater crime than providing drug money).

I know you're joking, but if you look at some of their leaked Powerpoint slides, you can see memes and Internet references in many places.
NSA analysts are mostly not stodgy government suits. They are programmers and hackers who lurk and post on places like reddit and probably even 4chan. Their low-ranking employee demographic is probably fairly similar to and yes, even demographic.

Unfortunately they are a US startup based in Silicon Valley and have received funding from many, many US companies, so that would be pretty difficult for them.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:44:53
I'd like to offer an alternative explanation.
NSA and GCHQ are not like China or the Soviet Union's state security departments. Their goal is typically not to oppress, but to watch and infiltrate everything they possibly can.
I don't think the US government would have anything to gain by trying to "kill" Bitcoin, at least from a law enforcement perspective. Cryptocurrencies will continue to pop up indefinitely. People will still use them for legal and illegal trades.
Something more in their playbook would be encouraging all US citizens to use only Coinbase as an exchange. And Coinbase, being a reputable US company, will be forced to respond to any national security letter that is sent. The NSA may even be setting up a close relationship with them, so that they can query accounts and purchases any time they like.
Intelligence agencies and the military likely do not and will never give a shit about the Bitcoin market or the price. They don't have the time to.
They just want to be able to "follow the money" if and when the time comes.

I agree with you. I don't think he was trying to simply profit for himself.
However, I think he was criminally negligent and extremely incompetent. Many Ponzi scheme operators start their schemes for this same reason: they take a huge loss, keep it secret, and keep trying to make themselves solvent again. Many never intended on starting it out as a Ponzi.

I was replying to the post that mentioned GCHQ's "hacktivist" busting. That Powerpoint presentation he was referencing is here: 
They are targeting members of "Anonymous" here, and at least from a cursory glance it looks like at least one of the "hacktivists" engaged in mass identity theft.


I haven't heard anything about this. I know it was revealed they were monitoring congressmens' communications, but nothing like that. Could you link to a source?


We do? I didn't see any disclosure about that in the leaks. Could you link me to a news article or document/presentation that implies this?
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:27:26
To play devil's advocate here:
Hacktivists = criminals, by US federal law. They break into systems. They may cause financial harm by DDoSing. They may release sensitive information about customers.
The community that GCHQ infiltrated in their Powerpoint spread malware, used botnets, etc. The "hacktivists" were operating both illegally and unethically.
In contrast, using or trading Bitcoins is not illegal or unethical. They have no real reason to go after us.
I work in the information security field, and I do not share the belief that hacktivism is necessarily bad, but that's partly how governments will rationalize it.

If you were to attempt to "profile" Satoshi, what kinds of descriptions would you give? That is, vague idea of what nationality he may be, what kind of lifestyle he might have, what demographic, etc.
Obviously that'd still just be speculation, but I feel like your particular speculation would end up being more accurate than average.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:38:23
I agree with you to an extent.
The crypto presented in the Bitcoin paper to me indicates a moderate level of expertise. I suspect that the real Satoshi is/was a professional C++ developer who had a typical security-interested expertise of cryptography.
Not much intense math is included; just some equations relating to probability (which itself has nothing to do with crypto). A master's student could probably write this paper and implement it decently; the only "hard" part is the creativity behind the idea itself.
It is *possible* Satoshi is an applied cryptography researcher or expert, but he wouldn't have needed to be one to write that paper.
Despite that, there has been no evidence presented that Dorian Nakamoto knows anything at all about cryptography or knows C++.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:58:08
The article seems credible in some cases, but the overall sense I was getting is that it's not actually him.
It would be interesting to see writing samples of the man, to be more certain. Though I don't think his privacy should be infringed any further, whether he is or isn't Satoshi.

* He verified that the owner of the  Twitter and the reddit account is the same person here: 
It's probably pretty safe to assume he still owns that Twitter. He has plenty of pictures and tweets that identify him as himself.
* He's discussing having privileged knowledge of MtGox's operations (which he was apparently wrong/lied to about). He's also discussing the Bitcoin market in general. This could potentially be used by the prosecution team.
No offense, but do you have any law experience? 
Weev posted this reddit AMA the night before his sentencing. He says nothing really incriminating in it.
Literally the very next day, when he was sentenced...




And the judge seemed to be swayed by that, sentencing him to 3.5 years.
This is **not** paranoia. Ask any reasonable lawyer in the US and they will say Charlie is an absolute fool to be posting like this in Anything you say, *anything*, whether it is directly incriminating, can be used to harm your image or character in court.

It is a long stretch to say they are secure just based on this, but what this assessment means is that if they do in fact get hacked, 97-98% of the coins they're storing will probably be safe.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:20:57
Yep. The fault is not necessarily in being vulnerable to this bug (even though it was a known problem in the protocol and warned against on the official Wiki), but being totally fucking unaware your entire Bitcoin fund is being stolen over time.
Gox has always been known for being incredibly incompetent (did everyone forget they were hacked and their whole fucking database and hot fund was dumped?), but this really takes the cake.

He's undergoing criminal proceedings right now and is awaiting trial. He was arrested, charged with money laundering, and is currently out on bail and under house arrest.
This isn't advice for an ordinary person; this is advice for someone who is facing many years in federal prison. If his lawyer is remotely decent then he should know he shouldn't be posting on reddit, especially posting about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-27 01:49:33
Probably illegal.
However, it is definitely not unethical if he is telling the truth about what he's doing. There are hundreds (or more) of people out there running bots trying to find weak private keys and steal the coins for themselves. His bot is grabbing them before others can steal them, so he can hold onto them and ideally return them to the rightful owner.

MagicalTux, as most people know, is Karpeles' main Internet username.
It seems like there was a clear cover up here (and likely in other instances, as explained in the blog post) by someone at MtGox, and that the cover up was done in one of two ways:




I think this is some pretty strong evidence that this job was done by Mark and Mark alone, or was originated by him and involved only a few accomplices. And even without all of this additional evidence, it's been known for a while that Mark considered himself the head programmer, designer, marketer, and businessman of the company. Gox has always been synonymous with Mark.
I imagine a criminal prosecution will occur in the coming months or years.

It's really quite funny, since I find the NSA's domestic spying in general abhorrent and extremely unconstitutional. Warrantless wiretaps and mass surveillance gives law enforcement far too much power.

I don't think we should tolerate his actions, but intent plays a role in how we judge and punish people's actions. That's why 2nd degree murder is less severe than 1st degree.
His intent very likely was not simply to run off with people's money and personally profit, therefore he was not as immoral as he could have been.

Solvent: assets greater than or equal to liabilities.
Ponzi scheme: there are many definitions, but in the broad sense it means accepting money from customers for some sort of investment purposes, and then not actually investing that money and instead paying people out with other customer's money. Usually also involves pocketing much of that money for yourself.
Since Mark ran an exchange, not a fund or a bank, it doesn't count as a Ponzi scheme. But there are some parallels.

From the external Internet? No, it isn't, unless remote management is enabled and/or there is some sort of serious vulnerability in the firmware (which is admittedly very common, but often difficult to exploit practically).

Your position is far more idealistic than realistic.
*Replacing* an entire class of currency is not that simple. The vast, vast majority of the world uses paper currency and equivalents. It would likely be many decades, probably 60 years or more, before purely electronic currencies like Bitcoin could truly start to replace fiat currency.
And until that happens, exchanging between fiat and electronic currency is absolutely vital.
When you transition from one system to another, the rate at which that transition can occur depends greatly on how prevalent and long-lasting the old system is. And here, the old system has been in existence for most of human history.

I personally have always sucked at those algebraic series questions. So I find it funny that I'm a programmer who apparently isn't even fit to work a customer service role.
I can answer the Bitcoin-related questions, but I find it kind of odd they expect all of their customer support staff to know all the technical ins and outs to even be *considered for an interview*, especially since I imagine they'll be paid a very low salary and will mostly be doing drudge work.

Considering the anonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions, and the fact that it is piss-easy to make the source of a DDoS unclear, it is unlikely anyone would discover the perpetrator(s) if they're actually trying to hide themselves.
The only thing I could imagine is if Mt. Gox staff analyzes which accounts began selling right before the DDoS, but that would be very difficult to get anything conclusive from.

It's possible but it seems unlikely.
Also note that contrary to media sensationalism, the NSA does not have a magic key that lets them see the real source IP of any Tor user, or something that lets them decrypt properly encrypted TLS traffic (assuming they haven't backdoored or forced the cooperation of the server that's being connected to; Google is a candidate for that, but Some Random Dutch Server probably isn't).
It seems to me that from a purely technological standpoint, DPR was *mostly* pretty good with keeping his privacy (minus logging into the VPN from a cafe so close to his house). He was very bad from the logistics and operations security standpoint, though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:01:54
Yeah, it's a bit unusual. Feel free to report back and say how the interview went. I'd be curious if they ask customer support applicants very technical questions in the live interview, too. It's possible that they've changed their strategy a bit, since that post was made months ago.

Salts, by their nature, are always stored along with the hash in the database.
A pepper is an application-level secret usually kept in the application's source code. This wouldn't have helped either, though, because if the attacker was able to upload arbitrary files to the webroot, that means he'd be able to read arbitrary files in the webroot as well.
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:28:44
I may be misunderstanding the scenario, and/or I may be misunderstanding exactly how hidden services are set up, but I don't think this attack would work.
See the documentation here: 
All exit nodes (and really, all nodes in general) are totally unaware of the real IP of Tor hidden services. Only introduction points are involved in propagating the public key (which is essentially the hostname) of a Tor hidden service. And introduction points are only reached at the end of a full Tor circuit.
The hidden service itself does *not* act as any sort of Tor node/relay. It basically acts similar to a typical Tor end user instead of a node. The Tor documentation strictly states that Tor hidden services should NOT also be Tor relays, to preserve anonymity. The server ideally should not run any other Internet-accessible services (that is, a web server or IRC server accessible in the "clearweb").
So really, DDoSing wouldn't tell you very much here. What *would* tell you a lot is if you happen to control the *first* relay node the hidden service connects to, in addition to the introduction point. Here you could use timing analysis to determine the IP.
And you would know its IP with 100% certainty if you happened to control everything in the relay chain. In this case, you can intercept the original public key advertisement.
However, to control both the entry node and the introduction point would require control of a whole lot of nodes, and to control the entire path would require control of many, many more nodes. So in essence, the act of deanonymizing a Tor hidden service is done the same way you would deanonymize a regular Tor user: It is theoretically possible, but it does require control of a lot of nodes.
If you still think the DDoS scenario is possible, assuming the hidden service does not also act as a relay, could you describe it in more detail, or perhaps link me to something that explains it better?
I did some more research and couldn't quite find any details about this attack, but found information about another interesting kind of attack on hidden services released in a recent paper.
The paper is here:
I'm still reading it, but basically an attacker who controls one entry node (technically an "entry guard" node) and one regular non-exit node, is able to determine if any hidden service is using them as an entry node or not if they have a published list of introduction points. And if it is, it is able to determine the hidden service's real IP. This assumes that the hidden service you're connecting to is using you as one of its current guard nodes; if it isn't, you cannot do anything. The researchers estimate that a random hidden service has a 0.6% chance of selecting you as a guard node. But obviously if you control a lot of guard nodes though, the odds of this happening is 0.6% * number of guard nodes. The researchers here rented 23 servers and used them all as guard nodes, which gave them a 13.8% chance of deanonymizing any hidden service. So if the NSA set up 100 guard nodes, they would have a 60% chance of deanonymizing a hidden service at any given time...which is quite scary. Worse yet, assuming the hidden service cycles guard nodes (many do, but you can configure them to use only ones you specify, which you may specifically trust or control), the odds become essentially 100% after a few weeks or months.
And even worse still, that is a 100% chance of deanonymizing *all* hidden services aftera  few months. At least assuming they aren't using directly specified guard nodes.

Nope. Unfortunately that is not the case.
If you receive an email like that, it means their system marked your account and/or your transaction as potentially fraudulent. It has absolutely nothing to do with the price; it's simply them trying to prevent fraudsters from buying or selling.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:01:14
It is a bit scary to think that if you miswrite it by a cent or two, or if the teller doesn't read it properly, then your money might just vanish. Or worse, if there's some race condition or other bug in their value-generating algorithm that causes it to not properly tag your account with your unique amount, the same could happen even if you follow the instructions perfectly.
I tried LocalTill yesterday though and the money showed up first thing today. So, no complaints from me, really. It's just an odd system they have.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:18:28
They *could*, but do any major ones currently do so? I don't believe they do.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:49:56
And it's still just as absurd, because they're marking these transactions as potentially fraudulent, not cancelling them due to the price shift. So they are doing nothing different.
@_date: 2013-10-26 07:35:59
Nope. Because if you stop theft, that means Bitcoin transactions can be reversible. And if Bitcoin transactions can be reversible, that defeats a lot of the point.
Bitcoins are tied to a wallet. If someone is able to obtain (and, if necessary, decrypt) your wallet, then they have those Bitcoins. It's as simple as that.

Unfortunately, most forums have similar admin code execution flaws. vBulletin and PHPBB also allow attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code if the attacker has control of an admin account.

Re-paraphrasing a comment I made regarding this:
It's likely that the attacker simply used the avatars folder because it may have been one of the few world-writable folders present in the webroot. The fact that it's an avatar folder may have no relation to the nature of the exploit itself.
If there were other non-SMF Internet-accessible PHP files running on the server, the attacker may have just used the SMF folder because he knew he could write to it. If SMF was the only thing possibly accessible, though, he likely did exploit SMF in some fashion.
What you need is trained professionals with access to your server to perform a forensic investigation. That is by far the most reliable way to determine exactly how the hack happened, and other things the intruder may have done after he got in.

So are you suggesting the exchange would have full access to control people's bank accounts (deposits and transfers), or am I misunderstanding?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:15:35
It would work if it said "programs [that] solve".
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:13:41
That seems *wayyyy* overkill for a customer support position.

Unfortunately I don't like carrying cash, so this isn't an option for me. I might just go with a bank wire.

You could be right; I don't know the exact nature of the DDoS that's going on.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:42:37
I work in network security, so it's not really a shock that big sites like these get hacked frequently, especially since the payoff is so extremely rewarding. A good portion of programmers, even really good programmers, don't know how to implement proper security measures. That's why I don't immediately scream "SCAM" when I hear news like this.
Although, I also see how easy it is for a service provider to go "oops got hacked! sorry your money's gone" and laugh all the way to the bank. And that's happened at least a few times, of course.
I think both are pretty likely to happen. Which is why I keep my Bitcoins in the wallet on my hard drive and nowhere else.

Well, speak of the devil. The Guardian just posted a ton of the techniques they use, based on new leak information. Check it out. They clearly put a lot of work into it.

While PHP is definitely shitty, and MySQL isn't the best, there's no reason why a well-developed PHP+MySQL application can't handle a lot of traffic, other than poor implementation, poor coding, or lack of hardware resources.
In the case of a DDoS though, none of that even matters if their network provider simply can't handle the flood.

There are many companies who do this sort of work quite well (Mandiant, Fidelis, etc.), but they often will require a 5 or 6 figure payment.
Otherwise, you can try to reach out to security professionals you think you can trust. You can find a ton of great people in and likely also on Freenode. Just keep in mind if they are not trustworthy, they could potentially do a lot once they have access to your server. I have experience with this kind of work, though you have no particular reason to trust me; I am not even a Bitcointalk member.
Also, this should go without saying, but after a forensic investigation (or immediately, if you can provide people with a full image of the partition) the server needs to be completely wiped and have its OS and file system rebuilt from scratch. The database can be reinserted fairly quickly using a backup. This is very easy to do if it's running on a VPS.

They're in a tough spot.
They have to make themselves 100% compliant with US regulations and statutes, so they're being extra cautious with the fraud. It's a pain in the ass, yes, but they're just trying to cover their asses as best they can.
So while they are most certainly fucking a lot of people over, it is not intentional and currently somewhat out of their control. But I agree they could/should try and hire more customer service staff to deal with things like this quickly, and perhaps more often do manual reviews of transactions.
They're honestly way better than any other USD-to-BTC site, so I'm sticking with them. Even though I can't even fucking verify my own identity because they fucked up one of the answers to the multiple choice questions.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:37:15
Oh that's cool then. Nice to know they have good support staff.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:14:35
Why are they evil, out of curiosity? I know very little about them.
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:13:03
Ah okay, I see what you're saying.
The attack you're suggesting definitely does seem feasible, but if you look at the paper I linked above, there are some attacks that would allow similar deanonymization while controlling far fewer nodes than would be required in this scenario. And in certain cases, it can be done without strict timing or statistical analysis; that is, the IP can be determined fairly deterministically.
I suppose the tl;dr of all this is: if the NSA controls a lot of nodes, they can identify both hidden services and Tor users alike with decent probability. The only question is how many nodes they do currently control.

It's because there are two very distinct conceptualizations of bitcoin: bitcoin the cryptocurrency and bitcoin the magic investment stock. Most people tend to consider it one or the other, without thinking much about the flipside.
Many of the anti-bitcoin crowd are simply against the people who trump it as a fantastic stock, and even worse, the people who are throwing their life savings into it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:23:34
You're absolutely right. And that's why I don't trust it.
That doesn't necessarily mean all central exchanges are bad. But yeah, Mt. Gox is a bit of a "fool me once, shame on you" situation.
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:58:23
Well, you could always do these things with PGP anyway. It's not really anything new. The cool part is you can use the same public key to sign things *and* send payment.
@_date: 2013-03-13 03:22:46
It looks like they did pay out. The bitcoin network itself wasn't defrauded, but the merchant was. So it isn't as devastating as a true double spending attack, but it's still a major issue.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:52:37
This is a hoax/gravely misnamed exploit, either submitted intentionally to fuck with people or by someone who knows very little of security.
In essence it's equivalent to uploading an avatar link that is rendered as `&lt;img src=" when you post. All it does is causes everyone in the thread to make an HTTP GET request to a server you control. You can do the same on most forums by doing something like `[img]
This "vulnerability" can be found in 90% of forums out there. It is not an actual exploit, and is not related to the Bitcoin talk hack.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:42:37
Well I'm sure they are, considering the amount of VC funding they've been receiving lately.
Did you have to answer all those ridiculous highly technical questions just to apply to customer support?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:57:18
Anyone who seriously invested a significant portion of their net worth (like 10%) into Bitcoins is incredibly foolish. They don't deserve any sympathy.

It'd be better to say "it's not *just* a bubble." It may continue to become a bubble regardless of its legitimate uses, simply due to human nature, and also greed.

What directories are on the server have world-writable file privileges? So, either `777` permissions or otherwise having "+w" for every user.
If you run `ls -al`, look for folders that have `drwxrwxrwx` permissions.
I ask because it's quite possible that the attacker simply used the `avatars` folder because it may have been one of the few world-writable folders present in the webroot. The fact that it's an avatar folder may have no relation to the nature of the exploit itself.
Also note: if the attacker was able to upload and then visit arbitrary PHP files, they have arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server's user. Which means they definitely have the entire database. If you're seeing PHP files uploaded by them, you can be 99.9% sure they have the database.

If you're a programmer: PascalCase and camelCase.

Right, it is pretty interesting, because in most other message signing schemes you would need to attach the full public key to the message, not just a hash of it.
The answer is found here: 
Given the signed message and the signature, a client can actually compute the public key (but not the private key). And I imagine there's one additional step to confirm the public key, when hashed, is the source Bitcoin address.

At the very least, he was using prepared statements. Thankfully.
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:16:07
Yep. You would think he would use a truly bulletproof VPN, though I guess those can be difficult to find.
Even if he did, though, he made so many other mistakes that at least one of them would still end up bringing his downfall. He would have to have changed everything he did from day 1, starting with the "altoid" advertising. After he posted as "altoid" in January 2011, he had already doomed himself pretty much.

I think it's much more reasonable to say "some private entity, or a few independent private entities, are trying to manipulate the market." The notion that *Wall Street* or the entire US government is somehow manipulating the market is absurd. Some (maybe only recently) rich guy sitting at home, planning with a few others on Skype and Jabber though? Plausible.
Though there isn't even significant evidence of that. The only entities I could mark as true manipulators are the people who've launched DDoS's towards exchanges.
@_date: 2013-10-04 04:42:37
Do you have people analyzing the web server logs? Assuming you have access to all the logs of the past few months, it shouldn't be that hard to figure out how the attacker got in.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:36:54
Not necessarily. This could be a case of a misinformed/overzealous analyst. Or the analyst's manager is making shit up as he goes along.

They use various algorithmic methods to assess if a customer is potentially fraudulent.
For whatever reason, their systems suspected your account/transaction might have been fraudulent.

That's because they both suffer from paranoid schizophrenia.
