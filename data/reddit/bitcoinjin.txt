Thanks for asking! Your request makes a lot of sense as we wanted to do the same thing. Ideally, we would like to display prices with USD/BTC side by side. We can't see a setting for the Coinbase plugin for me to do that currently. We might be able to write a script to look for all USD prices and calculate BTC prices using the current BTC/USD conversion rate, but then the conversion factor it pulls might not be the same as the one Coinbase uses for payment (timing might be slightly off). This feature is definitely on our mind though :)

I'm a woman involved in bitcoin as well - currently attending Blockchain University, an 8 weekend block chain course/Hackathon event, and I must say, it is a very welcoming group (both attendees and organizers/instructors). I don't feel out of place at all.
I'm actually attending the Bitcoin Summit in SF tomorrow...wondering if it will be the same.

I think it's all about balance and the actual execution. If you have a beautiful classy and professional lady at the booth promoting the product/technology, and if she actually knows the product well and can answer questions, then I'm all for it.

Well Andreas will of course have to be extra careful because he's well known. Like you said, the line can be somewhat blurry, so even though I can say case A is ok for me (because no one knows me and gives a crap about what I think), Andreas might not be able to say the same thing without getting criticized for being sexist, so he might therefore choose to avoid it all together.

Booth babes don't bother me too much, but I might take a company less seriously if they choose to include them at their booths/events. I like to think that the crypto crowd is generally well informed. It just doesn't seem necessarily for companies to use booth babes to appeal to this crowd. 
I mean, if a guy is going to buy a Butterfly Lab miner just because of the booth babes....then I have nothing to say :)

Yes, my background is in physics/astronomy (did scientific computations), now working as a web designer/developer. I actually just started a bitcoin only e-commerce as well....kind of an experimental project but had fun with it. I personally know of a lot of women like myself. We just tend to be a fairly quiet group.

Just to clarify - I'm not "scoffing at" the models and I never said anything about "unclassy" (and I would say the same thing if these are male models). They can be a nice addition to some type of events, but seem irrelevant for crypto events. Just like I don't expect to see booth babes at a science conference or the NASA Ames Open House.

No one should be "remembering" passwords these days. Always randomize your passwords and use a password management tool like Lastpass.

I'm a woman who code and think that Bitcoin is an exciting technology, so I put together a bitcoin-only ecommerce site to introduce people (including some of my friends and family) to bitcoin.

Currently learning about blockchain programming as well. Fun stuff.
