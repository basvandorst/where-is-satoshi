The majority of users will be able to keep running their node with a blocksize increase. It's been proven time and time again that users ability to rune a node ≠ decentralization. There's only 11440 nodes up right now for fucks sake.. How on earth do you equate the ability to run a node to central banks controlling bitcoin. A node doesn't control anything. 
Bitcoin isn't even usable to the majority of the population and here you are worrying that not everyone will be able to run their own node.

You have a terrible grasp on how bitcoin works if this is what you believe

You resort to arguing with opinions and feelings rather then facts. When you lose the argument you block the person. LOOOOOL

Latency issue is propaganda, just google it and you will get tons of results disproving it. Even with a large block increase the vast majority of people that run nodes now will be able to continue running them. If only 10k people are running it now that makes it clear that an average user does not run a node

These are nodes. Doesn't mean they are mining
