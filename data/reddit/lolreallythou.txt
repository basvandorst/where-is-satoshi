IMO over a long enough timeline  it won't really stop increasing. The limit is capped at 21 million bitcoins and 16.5 million have already been released. The rewards will stop around year 2140. 
Here's some further info on the distribution schedule  
So bitcoin is close to reaching the value of paypal. 1 company that is used to send funds. I.E it's worth nothing yet. Bitcoin is becoming a decentralized store of value so hypothetically it can be worth trillions and I do not see why it won't be.
Do some research on the tech, do some research on what a store of value is - maybe look into what makes gold and ideal store of value and then compare that to bitcoin. Come to your own conclusions but imo it's going to reach heights that most cannot fathom and in hindsight everyone will realize that it was completely logical for it to do so. Most people still do not understand what it is or even what a store of value is

I think people skipped over the last part of the article. 
Bali has it right imo. New era, new rules. Google still has to compete.


This has the long-term potential to change the balance of power between search engines (especially Google) and content providers. Right now, Google's search engine crawls news websites like the Wall Street Journal and indexes them, which displeases many newspaper editors. The Wall Street Journal has wanted Google to compensate their organization for each page request for many years. Google currently counters by noting that should they desire to be dropped from Google's index, the Wall Street Journal or any other news organization need only modify their robots.txt file to block the Google crawler. Needless to say, few news organizations want to lose the traffic that Google drives their way, and so few have taken that option of self-delisting.
However, the introduction of 402-payable URLs and 402-aware web crawlers may change the balance of power. In the not-too-distant future, content providers - starting with individual blogs and then scaling up to larger websites - can set up 402 paywalls to charge a tiny amount of bitcoin to each individual visitor. This would be a negligible toll for the casual consumer of news content. However, industrial scale scraping of the internet on the scale of the GoogleBot could become very expensive indeed, as it would require that Google procure Bitcoin as a kind of digital commodity to power its search engine, much like Apple must scour the planet for rare earth elements to build its iPhones.

There's been a lot of growth..the price just doesn't reflect it until demand fights over supply.

/jealous. 
I tried to get in back in 2011 but MtGox scared me (rightfully so in hindsight) but wish I pulled the trigger. Sadly didn't get in until early  2013.
Plenty of bitcoin has been spent in 2015 trying to get a business off the ground once I realized I have literally 0 control if I don't agree with the devs.
Hope to get my stash back to decent levels before another rise but I may be running out of time.
Oh well..I can always think about the good old days of late 2013 when I was on top of the world.
U.S gov goxxed gox and has been goxxing us the past couple of years. They may have let their cronies fill their pockets by now.

He told everyone to pay attention to bitcoin when it passed $1 Billion USD Marketcap

But this time it's not so easy. Saddam and Ghadafi were also threats to the U.S reserve status. They could be fought and "taken care of". Bitcoin cannot. Bitcoin wins and the fact was just acknowledged. He just made a HUGE statement. Let that statement permeate around the globe...the U.S just acknowledged its unfair advantage and its weakness in 1 short clip. Amazing
