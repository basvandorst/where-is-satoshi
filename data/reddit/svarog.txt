Let me nitpick a little bit: If my understanding is correct, when you fund a channel, you need to keep your connection to the LN up until you close the channel.
On the other hand, a hot wallet can only be connected when you actually want to pay.
This is an important distinction, because it means you will need an on-chain transaction every time you connect and disconnect to/from LN.

Wouldn't this allow the other side to steal my funds?
As far as I understand, the security model relies on the fact that if someone cheats, he will have to use a timely led transaction, while in the meantime I will be able to withdraw my funds.
If I'm offline, I will not see the timelocked transaction being broadcasted, and therefore will not be able to withdraw in time

According to  a transaction with 110 inputs, and 1 output, will take ~1008 blocks(~1 week) to confirm if you pay a fee of 104$.
Of course, most transactions don't have 110 inputs, but if you are a merchant that got a lot of small to mid-sized payments and want to consolidate them into a single UTXO, you might as well get what Roger describes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:43:15
Yeah, I wrote exactly that in my second paragraph.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:59:33
According to  a fee of 0.056$ will get you confirmed in avg time of 2 minutes.
At the top of the CryptoKitties spike, I transfered some ETH, payed a fee of around $0.40-0.50, and got confirmed within 3-4 minutes.
What you refer to as "slowed down to a crawl" is beyond the best case scenario for bitcoin in the last couple of years.

How can you boycott them, if your coins are impossible to move anyway?
@_date: 2014-04-02 08:23:00
That's what raised my red flag.
@_date: 2014-07-05 09:53:40
True, but doesn't matter for the avarage person that just wants an easier way to pay.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:11:54
If you are into investments, get educated, otherwise someone will find a way to to you off.
So instead of worrying, go out and read the arguments of both sides of the conflict, and make your decision based on that, not on the fear some people want to instill on you to make you act irrationally.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:07:39
But hey, they'll have plenty of space in their 1mb blocks now!
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:27:33
The link posted above is the text of the agreement as I (and at least a part of the community) believe to be signed by you.
If that is not correct... where is the text of the agreement?
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:49:20
When did they unplug it? I have heard nothing on it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:53:41
I guess they don't want to mine spam transactions
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:04:24
Double spending is hard because you need to get your double spent transaction to the miners mempool before the merchant gets to.
Since transmitting the transactions to all miners is the first thing the merchant will do before allowing your payment, in most cases, for small payments, it's practical enough.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:43:27
So, what is the bottom line... Can a miner use covert AsicBoost now that Segwit had activated?
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:39:20
I bought coffee with bitcoin a couple of years ago (well, to be absolutely honest, it was a taco).
It was really easy and fun back then, and I had a great conversation about bitcoin with the place's owner.
Now they are no longer accepting bitcoin because of high fees and unreliable confirmations :(
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:20:05
Yeah, but now we learn that AsicBoost still works, even after the fix was implemented... So, was that really a fix?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:57:48
You are right to be worried. But you are wrong that it is easy.
Two years we are fighting this war. Both sides had great moves. The amount of popcorn consumed by yours truly was tremendous. But the standoff looks as close as ever.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:08:05
It's possible to replace your fee only thanks to RBF, which was removed in Bitcoin Cash.
Otherwise, the first transaction to hit the mempool will be the one that is going to be included in a block 
Of course, this mechanism isn't reliable enough for high-value purchases, but absolutely fine for coffee or a taco.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:25:58
Visa has more risk than 0-conf, and yet most business accept credit cards.
Double spending is not easy, and simply is not worth it for a taco.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:55:15
This means they can continue using AsicBoost even after Segwit activated?
If so, why did they oppose Segwit?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:46:10
If you are unaware of the politics and the hard fork situation, you shouldn't care that coins on both sides of fork were sent while you intended only to send one side.
@_date: 2015-08-01 06:09:38
For those out of the loop, like myself: why all the hate towards blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:37:47
Forgot to mention they released a patch that closes the hole, didn't you?
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:59:55
No kindness implied, nor did I see any proof this was done maliciously.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:56:38
Not true... SPV wallets download block headers, and they know that the blockchain they are working with is valid, they also can validate the transactions that are relevant to them by getting merkle proofs from full nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:53:00
The miners validate the blockchain. That's their job.
If a miner goes rogue, the other miners will orphan his blocks.
If 51% of the hashpower goes rogue, all the security of bitcoin goes down in flame. It doesn't matter anymore what you validate or not, because the coins you are holding are worth nothing right now.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:25:31
No, that was not my original point. "Scaling better" is something that is very hard to define, and therefore debatable.
My original point was that Ethereum does more transactions than bitcoin, while having lower fees and faster confirmation times.
That is a fact.
Also, SPV counts. It gives the same amount of security to your own transactions as a full node.
That is also a fact.
If there is an attack where an SPV node can be fooled by a false transaction, I would really love to read about it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:06:21
Why would I want to validate the whole blockchain?
Sync with --fast and voila, there you go, validate all the transactions you want.
In the future light clients would enable you to validate historical transactions too without validating the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:18:03
I did.
I explained that the ordinary person does not need to run a full-bodied node, and can do with fast sync.
All I said were not lies.  
Is it not true that Ethereum does more transactions with lower transaction fee than bitcoin?
I wish it was the other way round... But it is not.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:19:12
No, with 51% attack you can double spend.
The whole point of bitcoin is preventing double-spends.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:55:54
Ehmmmm... Ethereum does more transaction than all coina together, and it's doing better than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:14:11
If what you say is true(and it might be true) than the attack that described isn't viable either.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:19:18
The problems they encounter are elevated each and every time by raising the gas limit.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:54:15
If somebody has majority hashpower you are fucked anyway.
All the security of bitcoin comes from the assumption that nobody does.
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:48:02
How will you handle scale though?
If you scale off-chain, you will centralize it, making it much easier for gov to shut down or consolidate under its rule.
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:20:21
All of the above lead either to centralization, or the same problems OP has described.
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:45:22
Yeah, he defenitely has disability...
Nobody in his right mind says bcash. The name is Bitcoin Cas h
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:13:13
Yeah... Only there's no consensus about it, so I think its forbidden to discuss it by the rules of this subreddit.
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:05:03
A hard tree breaks when the wind blows, 
while the soft tree withstands.
Humanity did not get to where it is through being rigid, but rather through progress and evolution.
Cryptocurrencies are no different. They live in a violent world. And only those flexible enough will survive.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:14:25
Is there a continuation of said thead?
I'd love to see what luke-jr had to say to address the valid concerns that gmaxwell and the others raised.
