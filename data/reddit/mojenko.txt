Maybe it's because MtGox accept payments from countries with a weak national currency. ( 
I think people from these countries buy bitcoin because they try to keep the value of their savings by converting to BTC. For them the most reliable Exchange is mtgox where they can buy bitcoin.

If there is an increased productivity of TVs, but no increased productivity of apples then 
* with a fixed number of currency units the price of TVs would fall and the price of apples would be the same.
* with a price stability currency, the price of TVs fall only a little bit and the price of apples would **increase**. (this is whats happening right now)
The technological progress in electronics is much higher than in food production. That means by inflating the currency to reach price stability food prices go up and that makes live much more difficult for poor people. (although we have technological progress in food production)

Here is my most promising idea, let me know what you think.
As a normal user you can participate with your keyhotee account. Business owners can register their companies in a seperate section. These businesses can be anything: food store, kindergarden, road building, Friseur salons, greenpeace, wikileaks ...
Each keyhotee user can choose how much he/she wants to pay each week. Let's call this weekly payment a tax. A small percentage of this tax gets burned in "proove of burn", the rest can be destributed among the companies. The keyhotee user can decide which company gets which percentage of his tax
Each business must/can set a certain tax threshold to all keyhotee users to become a "premium customer" to his company. The business can also decide about the benefits for premium customer. e.g.: 50 % discount on Mondays or bonus track when selling music,...
The idea behind this circle is, that keyhotee users can buy stuff at amazon as premium customer, but contribute their tax to overstock, military service,  kindergardens, or whatever. That would switch to a situation where companies try not to sell you stuff like a car dealer. Because if people buy something and they think they got cheated, they would not contribute anything of their taxes to this company. But if you get some good consulation and even if you don't buy something from them, you will contribute a fair amount to this company.
Furthermore this can be combined with a decentralized voting system. Each user, depending on his payed taxes and the time since he or she had registered, has a certain voting power. The voting power would be in a logarithmic relation to payed taxes and time.
* User and businesses can both benefit from participating in this system, but nobody get forced to do anything
* Businesses benifit more from giving good consultion than from selling crab
* A user can have multiple accounts, but gets the benefits from companies (50% dicount on Mondays,...) only once.
* User who are paying more taxes have a higher voting power, but it becomes exponentially more expensive to "buy" more voting power
So, what do you think? Is this something that could work?

With a fixed supply currency which isn't created by dept, but by proof of work, do you think that housing prices will fall?
I believe that with a currency that doesn't get inflated, people have no incentive to invest in real estate, except they want to live in that house. Therefore house prices would fall, because the building is getting older and improvements in house construction will also lead to lower real estate prices.
What do you think about this?

I'm aware of anarchy and I do like the idea. My only concern about it is that you don't have any mechanisms to prevent monopoly. (&lt;- Please correct me if I'm wrong about this) I know we have many monopoly right now and it sucks, every monopoly sucks. So if a new system is created or suggested we should not make the same mistakes again.
So what i'm thinking about is a system that is controlled by noone and that gives either disadvantage for monopolies or it changes the enviroment in a way that monopolies are not bad, but good for everyone else.
I, as an IT-guy think about, how can information technology help people to organize themselves without getting organized by somebody.

It's just an idea, but here it is:


You could modify this to an automatic process. So as soon as someone contributes to a project, the information about this project is send to two randomly choosen other people on SatoshiVoting.
You could further improve this by making it more likely that someone who already contributed to similar projects as the previous contributer. 
To attract people from outside the SatoshiVoting enviroment, you could add a "share with friends" option. You could include a badge system to reward for sharing with people from outside SatoshiVoting.

I suggest that we morph from a community to a decentralized organisation with over 100.000 member. The advantage would be, that we get in contact with important people from outside the community and still keep the decentralized aspect. It's not important to name oureselves "foundation". My keypoint is, that we develope from beeing a bunch of people to a dezentralized organisation

Da im Rahmen des Minings der Bitcoin-Schürfer eine Leistung erbringt (Überprüfung der offen gelegten Transaktionen), um eine Gegenleistung zu erhalten (Bitcoins oder einen
Bruchteil davon), können steuerbare Leistungen vorliegen, **wenn der Leistungsempfänger bestimmbar ist**. Mangels anwendbarer Befreiungsvorschrift unterliegen diese Leistungen der Umsatzsteuer.
Wer ist denn beim Mining der Leistungsempfänger? Man könnte eventuell sagen, dass das die Leute sind deren Transaktionen bestätigt wurden. Die können aber nicht "bestimmt" werden - daher unterliegt das auch nicht der Umstzsteuer.

Building the pyramids was also only possible "thanks to" whipping slaves. 
A flourishing economy should not be the main gaol. We had an enormous technological progress since WW2 (thanks to exploiting resources?), but we still work 40h/week or more to make a living. Often both parents have to work to earn enough to feed a 5-person-family. The economy may flourished, but our living standard had not.

I think we will see many stores and usecases (micropayments) where you can only pay with bitcoin in the near future.  Therefore the average consumer will emotionless load his/her bitcoinwallet with bitcoin and pay for the product/service.

as far as I know the money got devalueted even during the gold satandard by reducing the amount of backed silver and gold. Bitcoin is not backed by any physical asset, so it's not possible to devalue bitcoin by reducing the amount of backed gold or silver
This devaluation started befor 1971:

I'm thinking about this kind of "globally connected direct digital democracy system" too for some time now. I also strugle with the 1 person 1 vote thing. Although I don't have a clear solution to this problem, I think that we have to think deifferent and question everything in the current democracy. So the question is: is it necessary that we have 1 person - 1 vote? What sacrefices do we have to make to achieve 1 person - 1 vote?
What alternative solutions are there? Maybe they are even better than 1 person- 1 vote?
What comes to my mind is: 
* proof of work - similar to mining
* proof of spend bitcoin - the more you contribute to a certain institutions or autonomus decentralized cooperation, the more value has your vote
* "membership time: the longer your identity is spending a certain amount of money  to certain (administration)tasks, the more value has your vote
These are just examples, and they are all not perfect, but maybe it shows that there are other solutions than 1 person- 1 vote.
Because actually 1 person 1 vote is also not perfect and fair. There are allways people who make much more thoughts about a certain topic than others. Or they do know much more about a certain topic, so to have a fair system these people should also have more votingpower.
Something else you also have to take into account is that in this new system you are voting for topics, not for people.
You would also have a system where everyone is free to join and leave a certain "digital crypto government" and then he or she can join an "alt-crypto government".
It's really amazing what Satoshi did. He had to think about so many new things to create a new system that is totally different but way superior to the old system. 
But all in all I would also love to hear andreas' opinion and thoughts on this topic

No, not exactly. 
This software should be able to replace rating agencies. It would work in a way that each user can bet on the rating of countries/companies/bonds by rating the country/company/bonds.
Let me give you an example:
The user visits the rating website and selects the countries he/she wants to rate. So lets say he/she wants to bet on the ratings of spain and france. The user select both countries, select the amaount of bitcoin he/she wants to bet and gives Spain a BBB and France a AAA-. 
In the moment the user rates these countries, he/she bets that most of the other users also rate Spain with a BBB and France with a AAA-. On a specific point in time, lets say on once in a month, the system makes a payout to all users who rated Spain and France the way most other users rated them.
