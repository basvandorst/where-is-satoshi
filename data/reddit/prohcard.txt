bitcoin the money does not have a global tps limit
Bitcoin the payments network does
bitcoin the money can scale even if Bitcoin the payments network can not

You increase the block size limit. When something is one way today, it does not mean it will be the same way tomorrow, or next year.

And rightly so, realistically that cost is borne by hodlers who are selling their coins for less than they could get if they weren't getting diluted by new coins.

Sure, so does synthesizing gold: 
There are a few other inaccuracies in that table, I created it a while ago. Source: 
The gist of it is obviously still correct.

Agreed, add synthesizing gold:

Sorry, it was a mistake!

"demandable bank claims that are not 100 percent backed by bank reserves of basic money"

This point is certainly debatable.

It's actually an absurdly powerful argument: 
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:26:27
No, it shouldn't, the "payment clearing" already states "cheap". Transportation is a separate issue.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:30:06
Transporting 5,000 BTC in a USB stick is essentially free. I realize it's confusing but I placed tx fees on the "payment clearing" row.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:49:27


fwiw here's the definition of transportation that I had in mind: "1. To move or carry (goods, for example) from one place to another; convey." Sending bitcoins to yourself wouldn't "transport" them, carrying a paper wallet/usb stick/iPhone with you would.
Personally I don't think of sending a tx as "transporting bitcoins" but you're welcome to use your own definition of "transportation" and create your own table, it is creative commons.

Transportation != transfer
@_date: 2016-06-04 15:31:21
Indeed it is not!

what's funny is that that site doesn't exist yet. Wonder why.

That was a great buying opportunity :)

It's me. The civil war won't be reignited, Core won decisively and Classic/XT lost.

No, I'm the guy who got into it with Gavin:

Wow. You're right. How did I not see that. I retract my joke and apologize profusely.

Good point, I’ll add that!
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:48:04
That’s my goal! Synthesizing all the best arguments and counter-arguments re: investing in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:47:05
Auto-update would be a massive vulnerability, a key part of keeping Bitcoin decentralized is node operators opting-in to what software they want to run.

Right, just give a proportional %

"already have to worry about capital gains tax"
You only have to worry about capital gains when you dishodl pre-hyperbitcoinization.

I think "free as in freedom" + "not free as in beer" could work. Paywall your binaries and git repository (with Bitcoin?).

Meanwhile, his nautiluscoin scam blew up. It's disappointing that bad actors like him get a platform.

Yes, dozens have! And I use it of course haha
