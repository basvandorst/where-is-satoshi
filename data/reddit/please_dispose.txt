The whole point of crypto is to remain decentralized and outside government control or regulation. You can't invest in this space then turn around and ask for protection.

Ripple can be generated at will; it is not mined. People buying into it are committing financial suicide.

As an Etsy shop owner, I think the majority of the problem with this is that Etsy has no way of protecting buyers from fraud with a currency like bitcoin. Credit cards and paypal will side with a buyer (mostly) if any issues occur and will refund the person if needed. With bitcoin this is not possible and it opens the door for scam shops. Scam etsy shops already exist but they're not very effective at the moment.
I'm not saying there isn't a solution to this problem. I just think the higher ups at Etsy don't have a deep enough understanding of Bitcoin to pursue this issue further for the time being.
On an unrelated note...I may experiment with accepting bitcoin payments on my Etsy shop. I don't have high hopes because of how little interest Etsy has shown in supporting it. Shameless plug if you'd like to try the payment option for a Christmas gift:

And the same thing can be done with a Ligntning transaction because it is off-chain. At least bank transactions are reliable.

Lightning transactions are done off-chain, then later settled on the Bitcoin blockchain when the channel is closed (if it is closed). Where do you think these transactions are happening if they aren't on the BTC blockchain? They're happening on someone's server, just like a bank transaction is. Any server based transaction can be blocked, modified, reversed, etc by the person in control of the server. 
Even when Lightning reaches 100% reliability in routing, users will still be dependent on server to server communications to route payments until their channel is closed and officially posted on the BTC blockchain.
Edit: downvoters should read the Lightning Whitepaper. :/

Both coins are mined by the same companies using the same algorithm.

To be fair, lightning transactions are not permissionless either. BTC transactions are only permissionless if they are done directly on-chain.

You're thinking of BTC transactions. If I send you BTC directly it happens on a network of decentralized nodes called the blockchain. When you open a Lightning channel it is done on the merchant's server and all of the transactions between you two are private. When the channel is settled it is broadcasted on the BTC blockchain but the individual transactions between you and the merchant are still anonymous and only known on the merchant's server.
