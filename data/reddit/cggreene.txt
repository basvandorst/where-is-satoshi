You are a really good speaker, you got your points across really well, I think I'm going to start watching your podcast.

Oh this again.
Putting "confidence" in investors of Bitcoin, 
People also said that the prosperity in the 1920's would continue for ever
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:59:59
I have no problem with that, but is just seems a lot of people need alcohol, or any drug to get enjoyment, a lot of people rely on it to feel good.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:36:45
Over the past few days , I just saw loads of posts of people blinded by the value of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:24:12
[Please don't downvote]
Anyone know how I can buy bitcoin with paypal, securely and safely? It's the only way I can use money online
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:15:46
reddit is a social netework
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:00:53
Or you could be more cautions of how you invest your money
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:55:20
Government was doing it's job, It's a website dedicated to the transfer of jobs, of course it would get taken down. ~Sad that this amount of people need drugs for enjoyment
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:15:05
Didn't see people this confident since 1929!
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:23:05
I don't know what bitcoin is, but I'm going to invest 5$ into it!
If it becomes worthless, It's only 5$, and if it goes up, then I stand to make some coin. should be a fun game!"
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:09:51
 I wish you could do it via PayPal too, I want to buy BTC, but I can't because of no paypal
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:18:30
Probably not a laughing matter, I know people who have killed themselves over a lot less then what some people have lost of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:58:18
Don't worry in a few weeks it will be back to normal.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:40:10
Another person who hates "companies"
There are many failed communist countries if you would like to live there. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:16:02
Why does everyone hate paypal so much?
I can use it to buy almost anything online without having to put in my CC details everytime
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:14:13
Most tube sites are in very shitty quality like 240p, for some that is ok, but for others  they need more. I personally need 1080p videos, and they are almost impossible to find without paying (or using hacked accounts)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:46:42
This is just a dip, it usually happens after a major drop, but not to long after , it will go down, it will be like one hell of a rollercoaster, we are at the top.

I believe it's a piece of hardware that "mines" bitcoins a lot faster then normal PC hardware
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:56:17
Do you ever think one day that we could transfer paypal into Bitcoin.
I would love BTC, but I have no means of paying for it other then paypal
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:18:58
I din't buy any, because it's all worthless and will never be worth more, if an "online currency" takes off, it won't be bitcoin, it would be more like "google dollars"
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:16:18
Then they call a suicide hotline because they lost there whole investment after the crash.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:57:19
No, but over a certain amount of money received, they could get in trouble
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:42:54
The difference is , the internet is useful.
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:12:24
Link? you cant use it for gold
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:37:48
Or it could be the mass influx in bitcoin users trying to ride the train
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:47:46
It doesn't work on most things, and makes everything worse?
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:31:32
OK, put your tinfoil hat on then. I thought I was going to have an actual conversation.

Historians will not write about it, more then likely nobody will even remember what it was in 10 years.
You can blame trading on MT gox all you want, but the fact is, most people are in bitcoin , to make money of it rather then using it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:54:21
I like the way that you came here and addressed users directly, that is a really good move.

Sell it, not just because of the money, but because of your life, sell it, and get out, the ship is sinking, get on the lifeboat.

Bitcoins are worthless now, all the idiots who didn't sell yet deserve to loose everything
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:19:19
You do realize countries don't function without taxes.
No really, please tell me how you believe the country will magically produce some sort of funds.
This is why kids should learn economics.

~This is ridiculous youtube, this is the start of the downfall,
it has no competition, we need a new VOD service!
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:35:42
That's not the point, you could use that argument against using paypal at all, eg. why buy things off amazon with paypal when you can use a debit cards?
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:51:59
I wish I could buy Bitcoin with PayPal, so annoying as I have no other means where I live.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:56:08
Do not get overly confident, I have seen this many times, "no way is this a bubble" , next thing it crashes, but because people invested so much money into something , they don't want to back out.
Get out now, buy again after crash.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:45:50
Yes, it all takes place on Mount Gox
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:17:57
No , I don't
The fact that most people on this subreddit are more interested in the actual charts then using it as a currency, show that there is no confidence in it.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:28:06
Could just be a paypal account either
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:19:50
Fox didn't actually say it, they were more leaning in bit coins favour, and they had a fair debate.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:25:01
That's implying bitcoin still exists within the next year or so
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:08:31
What big sites take bitcoin?
Amazon don't, Ebay and you can't even convert money in your paypal to it!
It's not a success until real websites accept it.
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:17:14
will LTC be the new BTC?
