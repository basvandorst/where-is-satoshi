Not true. If it was Bitcoin, it would have been transparent for everyone involved how much leverage was really taking place. Housing market is worth 500,000,000 BTC. Hmm, 17,000,000 BTC in currently in circulation? The ensuing collapse would be universally visible.
In reality it was opaque until shit began hitting the fan. No one knew anything about how much value was real and not real because it was literally impossible to know. Bitcoin is the most real value in the world today.

It still comes back to how much Bitcoin you own. If you don't own native blockchain tokens then you're at the mercy of some complex and often flawed financial systems.

In a society where everyone is educated, self aware and happy I could not agree more. In the society we live in these things are the exception not the rule, and unadulterated radicalism is something we should stifle not facilitate.
I think we will move towards what you're describing, but it will take centuries. In the meantime we can't have a wild west where known sociopaths are protected by idealists who'd sooner see violence than the voice of a loan madman quieted.

He's not banned from money, he's banned from PayPal. He can use other payment networks, Bitcoin being one of them.
This isn't proof of anything, other than people have choices, and so do businesses.

From what I did study about history; giving folks like AJ a platform is more damaging than not.
@_date: 2018-09-22 16:31:03
I don't subscribe to the idea that banning Alex Jones leads to the banning of normal users. That's concern trolling and not at all pragmatic.
PayPal can do what they want; their only loyalty is to their shareholders. People are behaving like AJ has been banned from the US dollar.

I'd love to agree with you, but back in 2011 there was a different flavour of delusion. It was: "$10,000 BTC".

Yes there was a splitting contract that plenty of people did not use and were completely fine.

We're not talking about BCH though, we're talking about Bitcoin. Ask that same question about Bitcoin and then it's clear why 2x has merit.

There are an enormous number of transactions that do not use smart contracts.

What you are describing is a cycle that has a good chance of continuing until Bitcoin reaches McAfee dick levels. There is no better evidence for this than looking at snapshots over the years and seeing the exact same threads/comments just with a different price alongside it.
I don't know what will happen; but saying Bitcoin is unlikely to have another bull run because "everybody who wanted to invest, invested" is a massive oversimplification.
I would avoid letting this echo chamber convince you that Bitcoin is somehow mainstream. Whenever I meet new people and mention my business, they're absolutely oblivious to Bitcoin. Occasionally one might show some kind of misguided pity. I also live in London, and most people I meet would probably rate their understanding of finance.
I also have business in esports, another market that so many would consider public knowledge (depending on the communities you hang out in) but the reality is far from it.
Bitcoin may die or it may lead to the loss of McAfee's member. But it's not going to sit on its arse and go nowhere.

"All others will lose funds".
People are over stating the impact of not having replay protection. Let's not forget ETH had no replay protection when it forked last year. I am not aware of any incidents in which  individual users were robbed.

It is *very* hard to find a moderate opinion in either sub. Best thing to do is to follow the developers from both sides on Twitter.

You can see the last (and first, if you needed them) several characters of the address; that is almost certainly a unique identifier in itself. Combine that with the value amounts and you're guaranteed to know which TX it was. How many other transactions in Bitcoin's history match these variables? If you did the probabilities, the answer would be "guaranteed" to be none.
Then just scrape a list of all the TX's from a likely time period that the TX was made and voila! TX data found and matched to OP.

It's nothing about Bitcoin's resistance. It is about a group of humans making a judgement. If they wanted to, they could have pushed on with S2X and split the chain. Stop praising Bitcoin and be thankful that the NYA leaders genuinely had community interests at heart.

I fully agree, I'm trying to use a logical extreme to demonstrate that Bitcoin will not stay in its current form. It *has* to change but nearly every BTC maximalist will tell you the opposite.

And all TXs are on lightning sooooo the miners will be heading for the exit.
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:49:26
I certainly oversimplified and closely follow the software upgrades from Segwit to Schnorr. I was referring to more intrinsic properties such as the fixed supply cap which - given zero flexibility - could become chain breaking.
There's zero doubt from maximalists I've spoken to that such a cap could become problematic. Not even giving a &lt;1% probability that it becomes chain breaking and that the parameters set in 2009 will be relevant in decades to come.
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:39:18
Given how fast technology moves, can we really expect users will be willing to pay *any* kind of fee for moving value in 100 years time?
I think it's fair to assume TX fees will be low and block reward will be zero. So who's incentivized to secure the network?
Tough question that's best not ignored.
@_date: 2018-03-03 08:39:18
Dude, it is OK to leave some crypto on exchanges. There are a plethora of reasons why. Coinbase - and it's an unpopular POV - is actually one of the more secure places to store crypto, particularly for new users that would potentially lose everything try to faff with their own private keys.

Robinson isn't just some random guy who is being persecuted for being a giant shit. He is the equivalent of the Islamist Imam preaching hate against the West (except with a history of violent crime). I am sympathetic to businesses that do not want to do business with these folk.
I'm not exactly sure why others feel the need to so strongly defend him under the guise of free speech - particularly when they'd happily see the Imam fucked at every turn.

Everyone values the US Dollar. The US Dollar is not a good global (and interplanetary) currency for several reasons; the most important being that it has been printed into oblivion.
I am suggesting that everyone will find that the most concrete value in the world is Bitcoin.

Hey dude, if you come into my shop and take a giant shit on the counter, I ain't serving ya.
Tommy Wanker Robinson took a shit, made money from his shit and tried to get PayPal to process his shit. PayPal said no.
People using this incident as a reason to be grateful for Bitcoin have become disillusioned somewhere along the line.

In finance, greed trumps tradition. The gold standard limited how much money could enter the system. Removing it was very desirable regardless of the long term (50 year+) negative impact.
That impact is now becoming reality as people come to terms with the fact that money is no longer real. Even gold is not real (there is more digital gold than there is physical gold). At some point, people will realize that Bitcoin is objectively the only real value in existence that everything will be priced in.

I thought the whole ethos of Core and their supporters was to take dev off chain? There are plenty of open source projects happening off chain.
Please do let me know what the next software upgrade for Bitcoin is (that will help it fulfil its potential) and I'll retract my comment.

Curious why this post hasn't been removed by mods? Anyone?
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:23:23
Keeping the software low level and with as few changes as possible is what will make Bitcoin the most secure store of value in the world. It will need devs, but the idea that the loss of Core will kill it is patently false.

I'm referring more to the moderators and influential voices. Very few are prepared to accept an S2X chain.

Bitcoin doesn't require devs if it is going to remain a store of value. No one wants software changes. 2X will be the last for a decade.

It's safe, don't listen to others. Moving your coins to Electrum or another awkward UI is likely to be *more risky*. You will then also need to know how to secure your private keys for yourself. Your wallet.dat file must be secured safely.
If you have a significantly large pile then you should research hardware wallets and buy one.
People here are not looking out for your best interests. They are anti corp and anti NYA signers which has clouded their judgement.

In the same way that EOS promises no profit for token holders; this type of language is important for platforms who are operating within a very vague regulatory framework.
The SEC will come down on you like a ton of bricks if you start making sweeping financial claims in an unregulated market. OP is missing the point.
