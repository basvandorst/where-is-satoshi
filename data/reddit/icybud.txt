Bigger Blocks would be a good idea
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:38
Dash haz 2MB Blocks
Cash is also working fine
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:03:50
the war is over...just use Litecoin or Dash...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:33:06
This topic is not sorted correctly
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:46:42
no, thats the same topic - so it's a valid argument
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:13:20
a very special situation thath would be maybe possible with a 50/50 fork - so not realy a problem?!
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:13:37
Kraken has for Bitcoin XBT or something (i'm not sure, because they are offline), so how cares
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:38:26
NYA -&gt; SegWit -&gt; 2x
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:46:37
so it's okay to do spam transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:46:57
common - a coin can't break an agrement! :D
i'm not really a fan of bcash, but it shows: 
- Bigger Blocks are possible
- HardForks are possible
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:37:49
right now: The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 480 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 108,480 satoshis.

it is supposed to be a upgrade and no split - so this protection is not useful
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:50:26
of course you can! It's like printing your own paper money - useless ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:01:33
Calculating is now easier because:
1 cent = 1 bit
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:03:28
He has still more bitcoin than you
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:33:46
It is just as correct if you say: 
SW was likely set up not to succeed, but simply to block any other progress from happening
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:31:04
then i would be rich... unfortunately not
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:54:48
It's decentralised together with core - very easy.
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:55:31
-7 points for a correct calculation?
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:39:27
is there somewhere a good explanation how uasf should work?
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:15:52
From wikipedia:


So... i wouldn't say "it is just a life insurance company"
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:41:22
Don't think so - the reasons are more / different checksums.
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:16:10
One point is that a lot of important people are not able to make any kind of compromise. 
"I am the best and most intelligent developer and my point of view ist correct. Any deviation from this would be bad for bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:01:40
i have no other account - i registered late - was reading only a long time
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:21:00
okay.... and you call me troll
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:43:52
some pay 20-30 cent / kw and others pay 0.75 cent or nothing
-&gt; will be centrally mined again soon
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:49:36
a checksum (hash) prevents you from changing something. in original bitcoin some part of the transaction isn't included in the checksum, so you can change it without destroying the transaction.
Thats the malleability problem - i think
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:31:25
95% - 29.4% = 65,6%
BU: 34%
so - no
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:48:12
i agree - time here is wasted life time
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:12:36
you should activate it now!
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:57:16
two weeks
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:11:37


so everything is a attack
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:14:32
one would have a fee market and the other would be usable
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:00:20
with "all" i meant the wallet.dat + the not 100% correct pwd
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:54:49
finaly i can post all online and watch how fast it's gone :/
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:51:49
do you mean a website simulating a mac?
I have no macbook for testing...
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:46:10
What coup are you talking?
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:00:22
just try it and softfork back, if there are problems - very easy
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:19:21
my pc is windows
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:16:48
mining full nodes define consensus
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:17:49
update: It was an macbook pro with german keyboard
what character is created if you press  in the client:
op + 8 (should be { ) , shift + 3 (should be § ) , shift + 5 (should be %)
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:52:21
What is the default codepage of a macbook?
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:54:06
but i have already tryed to convert the password with notepad++
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:00:38
you are trying to think for yourself. give a chance! :)
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:10:37


but only with a hard fork and that's a bad thing you know
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:43:41
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:49:11
How many miners / hash power do you have?
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:04:49
so and you are a miner or this is a main node from a business? no?
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:42:34
i think it's the same as the 2 year old hong kong aggrement
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:56:03
Everything gets bigger and faster - so 1 mb in 2015 is the same as 2mb 2018
So it's not bad at all - if you want use bitcoin and not just hold it
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:23:24
with 5% hash rate - not really
