Bitcoin can be decentralized while other centralized businesses build on top of it. Your argument is like saying email is centralized because of Gmail, while completely ignoring the fact that you can run your own email server.
Also, there are plenty of Bitcoiners who are interested in the tech itself far more than the ancap political nonsense.

Agreed, but that doesn't mean the Greek situation won't have any effect on the price of Bitcoin. All it takes is a few thousand Bitcoiners who buy in anticipation for some Greek-fueled bubble to make the price go up a few percentage points. Nobody ever said markets were rational...

Not everyone here is in it for the misguided Randian political bullshit. Some of us see a very useful and interesting tool. Personally, I'm not convinced Bitcoin will be a currency everyone uses daily. I do think it'll cut costs in the financial industry and remove substantial deadweight loss from the economy, and that it'll increase transparency. I could see stocks and other assets being stored on the blockchain, and remittances are a huge use case. Paying for coffee with Bitcoin is just a novelty, though, IMO.

Most people measure currency stability over the course of a decade or more, not over six months. I like Bitcoin as much as the next guy, but third world countries aren't going to switch to it any time soon. Even if they did, with the Blockstream team stonewalling the blocksize increase, an entire country adopting Bitcoin would kill it overnight.

Frankly, with the impending passage of the TPP, we need an unstoppable DNM.

Bonus points if it kills the fascist War on Drugs too.

Trying to copyleft the research involved in Bitcoin is even more distasteful than copylefting the code. Scientific research should be freely available to the world. Why should  for-profit companies need to reproduce research that's already been done? That just holds back human progress. 
GPL is freedom at gunpoint. Also, I've seen in projects in real life where the organization wanted to (and did) open source their code, but they used third party software out of necessity that was proprietary, so they were prevented from using any GPL projects, as it was not possible to release the third party's code with ours. Do you think that's fair? Because I don't. 
I generally dislike the GPL license in today's world for this reason. RMS and others say that if this is the case, we should develop our own OSS solutions instead of using a third party's proprietary solution, but this is so naive, it isn't even funny. It's just not how business works. We're not going to reinvent the wheel when we need to ship a product to appease some misguided ideologues, and neither will most companies and individuals that write software for a living.
IMO, the GPL is a relic of the Microsoft monopoly era, and it's outlived its usefulness. The LGPL is far more reasonable, although I still prefer MIT/BSD.

What they don't have enough of is technical competence. The US government is laughably bad at technology because they pay peanuts compared to the private sector and they work on extremely unethical projects. This would honestly be interesting if it came to be. Who would win, the world's academics coming up with ways to subvert the American regime's ban on math, or the dinosaur federal government that can't even secure the President's servers? It's not just about guns. If you can still stay hidden using encryption, guns won't do shit.
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:29:12
It's really not a problem, though. Bitcoin software should be kept modular. People should be able to run a full node easily without the bloat of a blockchain explorer. Blockchain explorers use a lot of system resources. Besides, I don't think it's a huge problem that people have to use a third party to access information on *other people's* Bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:10:46
Even if you do run a full node, you still need a tool like Insight or Obelisk to make the kinds of queries BC.I does (poorly). Bitcoin Core doesn't support querying information about arbitrary addresses. If you don't run a full node, insight.bitpay.com and btc.blockr.io are pretty good blockchain explorers.

I get the joke. It's that they're behind the times, along with the rest of the financial sector. However, the implication is that these PR people should be spending their long weekend Tweeting back at Barry about the pending Grexit, and frankly, the world would be a better place if every non-essential worker (meaning, police, fire, hospital workers, etc, not fucking bankers and PR staff) was prohibited from working this weekend. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 01:15:30
I agree, and so should any hodler of Bitcoin. If we're truly stuck at a 1MB block plus a pathetic 17% annual increase, we should all sell our coins now, because a 1MB ecosystem is not worth billions. It'll support darknet market transactions and that's about it. That's not the vision I have. When the "fee market" develops, international remittances go out the window. Micropayments will go to altcoins. Most use cases I can think of will go to altcoins, except maybe Bitcoin as a glorified SWIFT for Wall St.

You're joking, but for the new people's sake, I think it's important to clarify that with bitcoind 0.10 and greater, the blockchain sync is far faster than it used to be. Before 0.10, if you didn't use a torrent to get most of the blocks, it took several days to download. Now, you can get a full node running in under a day with modest hardware.

If the USD collapses, you're gonna want guns and food, not Bitcoin. My parents have their assets in 401Ks, not cash. If the entire US stock market goes up in smoke, we have bigger problems to deal with...
Some of you people need to take a fucking economics course. Bitcoin is amazing at evading capital controls. It's like a decentralized Swiss bank account. I just don't see it replacing entire nations' currencies any time soon. First of all, you can't even convince these pigheaded Blockstream devs to raise the blocksize limit to 8 MB. How the fuck do you think Bitcoin will scale to run an entire country's economy? Furthermore, half of Greece's problem is that they have no control over their currency, and we have a global currency war going on right now. How would Bitcoin, a fixed money supply, be any different? Greece's problem isn't inflation, it's debt.
This is becoming another nonsense gold-bug end-of-days forum, and it's a shame, because the tech behind Bitcoin is nothing short of incredible.

It allows you to increase the fee of a transaction after you broadcast it. Also, zero confirmation transactions are not secure, and this illustrates that fact.

Why should I care if miners are losing money because they're shortsighted and are mining without validating their blocks? If you're running a full node, it doesn't matter. This fork is much ado about nothing. Look at the price during all this: clearly the market doesn't care, either.

There's no such thing as completely impenetrable security. It's about minimizing your surface of attack, and Trezor does that quite well. If your adversary is the NSA, I'm sure there's some USB firmware exploit they could use to corrupt the Trezor's firmware. However, this is a very unlikely attack, unless you're the next DPR. A far more likely attack for 99.9% of Bitcoin users is malware that steals private keys, and Trezor is a great protection against that.
If your adversary is a nation-state, you need an offline Linux box for signing and an online, watch-only computer running Bitcoin Core over Tor. If you've seen CitizenFour, this is analogous to how Laura Poitras and Snowden used PGP to communicate. Such measures are impractical and downright paranoid unless you're somebody like Snowden, though.
Edit: To further extend the PGP analogy, many people use PGP on their normal computers, with their keys stored locally. More security conscious individuals use a Yubikey or another security device to store their PGP keys. The most paranoid individuals who have nation states after their information use an airgapped PC for encrypting and decrypting messages. Likewise, many Bitcoin users use software wallets. More security conscious Bitcoiners use hardware wallets. The most security conscious Bitcoiners use airgapped PCs with Bitcoin Core running over Tor on a separate machine.

Of course not. Bitcoin is the people's answer to the War on Drugs and all the fascist horseshit that happened as a result. Civil asset forfeiture? Should've used Bitcoin. Paypal steals your money? Should've used Bitcoin. Draconian governments are telling you what you can and can't do with your body (drugs, backpage, camgirls, etc)? Use Bitcoin. If governments wanted to end funding to terrorists, they'd go after Saudi Arabia and HSBC, not individuals.

This is why Coinbase exists. I wouldn't recommend running any Bitcoin software on Windows period, never mind by someone who's technically incompetent. Another solution may be to set up a 2 of 3 Copay multisig wallet that you control a key for, she controls a key for, and the third key is on paper somewhere safe. That way, when her PC is inevitably compromised, she won't lose her BTC.
