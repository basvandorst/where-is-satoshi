[A link to a shred google drive document with a short explanation of some of the technology needed to build Bitcoin]( (for a short community college class I teach)
It expands off an old article that says these were the parts needed:
1.2001: SHA-256 finalized
2.1999-present: Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT etc.)
3.1999-present: P2P networks (excluding early networks like Usenet, FidoNet, MojoNation, BitTorrent,Napster, 
Gnutella, eDonkey, Freenet, etc.)
4.1998: B-money
5.1998: Bit Gold
6.1997: HashCash
7.1992-1993: Proof-of-work for spam
8.1991: Cryptographic timestamps
9.1980: Public key cryptography
10.1979: Merkle tree
But those are the building blocks, what does an inventor need? I suppose knowledge of the coding language, a reason to create such a system, and the ability.

[While these type of stories happen from time to time the overall trend of news pieces on btc has gotten more positive in the last year and a half or so]( here is a link to a shared google document of info I've gathered on media coverage about cryptos/btc
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:02:21
After much trial and error I settled on engraving the cold storage key pair (BIP38 encrypted) on a set of 316 stainless steel 'rings' and encapsulating them inside a [small capsule I made](     
See the sidebar at for more about making them, I made about 50 and I was thinking of selling some if people are interested, but I wasn't quite ready to announce it yet. The capsule end piece is made of aircraft grade (6061) Al
[See here]( an example of the engraving, the secret key is engraved on a smaller section and that is epoxied inside this larger section, it is then sealed in a tamper evident chamber.     
I was unhappy with all the 'physical bitcoins'; I wanted a more tamper evident and destruction resistant way to keep cold storage so I made these, I call them cold hard storage.
I looked into many methods and things from hand engraving  to the metal stamps you are talking about (They are expensive). In the end this was a lot more fun but certainly not cheaper.     
However I can help you engrave your key pair like I have mine if you want (though you must promise me you will use a strong pass phrase for your BIP38 encryption).

Hello Bitcoin friend, if I may, I have some info that may interest you.
I teach a short course on btc/crypto at my local community college and all the info I have gathered is available free online.
I watched/read/did many of the online btc courses and tried to incorporate their best points into my own collection of data.
It is a large collection but the point was to take all the info you wouldn't know about and put it all in one place to give total exposure. But it is kind of geared for those with no knowledge previously, though I have lots of links you may like

Safes small enough to be easily picked up are often smashed open or simply taken to open later, I would recommend bolting it in or something, hiding it behind a picture would be cooler though

Thanks for the generosity but this was a labor of love and I am giving it away free. BTW I think you are thinking of Changetip, they are still used for @_date: 2016-08-28 18:32:02
Please do, any feedback is great too of course.
There is a lot to dig through, and much more info in the sources that follow each section.
 There is also a 'sources' document that has a lot of security minded information that I didn't put in the class.
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:02:12
That is what my research has shown me as well, a group sharing economy for people who knew each other, bartering mostly something done with strangers but not to support any economy that I have heard of.
(I teach a sort class on cryptocurrencies and I have a [section]( on money if you would like to look over it)
@_date: 2016-08-28 23:04:16
I didn't like other 'physical bitcoins' and I wanted a more secure and fancy version of those, so that is what I made. 
Part of the reason I did a key pair and not a seed was that I wanted to help others get engravings made too, and BIP38 encryptions seemed, well almost made for that purpose.
However if you encrypt your seed  I can help you engrave it or get it in a capsule!
@_date: 2016-04-13 02:13:24
Thanks, I've put so much time into research and getting the info that I forgot to publicize the class but we got enough people which I think is great. I hope I don't fuck it up somehow for these people.

Great news!
And this is where I get to jump in and say that Portland, Oregon's community college, PCC, has a course on Bitcoin, blockchains, and cryptocurrency and all of our take-home info is available online for free

Oh trust me, you don't want it. 
However I've made a bunch of power point style slides out of that information which I wlll freely share at a later date. These are far far more coherent and even had spell check run on them.

@_date: 2016-04-13 02:12:04
*To add to this, the course is completely non-programming. It is really more to understand Bitcoin and everything about it and there is so much to teach that I wouldn't have time for code if I wanted to.     
In a few years who knows, there might be a history of Bitcoin class or intro to Bitcoin 101 that some could take like CS before delving deeper.
I wanted to make the class appealing enough that people would show up so I had to limit my time which limits the amount of info I can go on.
I made slides but I don't plan on reading them, more of guidelines really. They are there so the students can have all the info already written down and I can mostly ramble.
@_date: 2016-08-19 02:51:17
I'm afraid I have no idea what you are trying to say. It's fine if you don't get Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but I don't have time to explain it to you.

It starts tomorrow, there were not too many signups sadly but there were enough to go forward with the course and for that I am very very excited.

I mean, I've taken 1 or 2 courses, and done some online things like all those codecademy and rubymonk so it's not like I've never *seen* code. It's like a first year foreign language student, I can read much of it but I can't speak it. 
I will check out that link for sure.

And as I'm *sure* we *all* know, there are a few 'competing' dates for the real "Birthday of Cryptocurrencies" so what do you think is it:
 * The [pre-release of the whitepaper]( on August 22, 2008? - When Satoshi gave a copy of his idea (allegedly already mostly coded at that point) to a few people for feedback.
 * The public release of the [Bitcoin Whitepaper]( on October 31, 2008? - This specification for Bitcoin outlines it's design and plan to the world for the first time
 * The creation of the [Genesis Block]( on Jan 3, 2009? - The first successful creation of cryptocurrency (that we know of) was actually implemented and cemented in history a few days later when...
 * The Bitcoin Client [was released to the world]( on Jan 9, 2009. - When the worldwide public first became able to interact with cryptocurrency.

Hey I just caught taht too, fixed.
I've split my work up into sections, what section might you be interested in?
there is the bitcoin stuff like: nodes, miners, mining, blocks, the blockchain, consensus, keys, and wallets
some background info like: hashing, ecdsa, decentralization ( thanks Princeton!)
History: Pre-bitcoin money, banks, technology. and history of bitcoin itself
Other stuff like R&amp;D, personal security, data security, media and reception, space including companies and important people and info on SN
and then a document that is just pages of links that I didn't fit in the regular text
I think all the stuff on bitcoin is well covered in Mastering Bitcoin but the stuff on history of bitcoin, related pre-history, and security are the more 'original' things. I
ve been working on this for 4 months or so

I like your thinking, but I have already looking into that and my problems are 2 fold, the size of the RFID that would go inbetween the rings is not long and wide enough that anyone will make it for me, and to make maters worse the titanium rings I do have now don't have enough space between them, the tags just aren't thin enough for these rings. 
I have looked into it, if there were another way to fit the tags in that was still pretty.
Without specialized equipment I can't spot weld or brazen the titanium rings. Epoxy is still not very easy to remove even if it's posslbe, at least not with everyday checmicals.

SW is not all some people crack it up to be, I don't see 95% consensus on it as obtainable. But acc'd SN, we only need 51% of miners to actually do anything, who know how it will pan out. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:43:21
They can be, they are also encrypted with BIP38 and a strong pass phrase, which will make it a lot more difficult. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:22:42
There are a few Bitcoin clients, some have the potential of forking at some point. Any of them will currently help you mine. However you will certainly want to read more about it as it is probably not really what you want to do.

Don't forget though that a CS is an investment for only 1 seed or address at a time and a one time investment can get you metal letters and numbers you can stamp into metal yourself, probably less than $20 for a set.
[Remember to stamp on the right kind of metals though.](

There is so much to cover I don't have a lot of time to spend on any issue in particular.
What do you think I should highlight about those above items?
The potential for corruption or misuse? Are they unfair to others? How does it affect the normal person?
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:30:51
What about QE? Just how it affect the economy or the project effects over time?
What about money creation? Do you mean fractional reserve? Or just printing press? I heard the US mint stopped reporting how much money they were printing around 2005 during the OI~~L~~F operation but I can't find a source for that.
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:23:23
Have you tried adding it? Perhaps they want a thousand dollars to list it?
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:32:14
Do you think I should just describe the issue or bring up and example, isn't glass-stegal an example them?
Other than highlighting issues in the current system you want to say that the decentralized system is better, what makes it better or less coruptable, can it still be corrupted just with more work?

What is the take away point from this? That there is precedent for the Gov taking items?
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:23:02
I say go for it, but another idea would be to try and help Btc grow by getting your local university or college to offer a course on it, offer to teach it.
That's what I did, and I am going to teach a short course at a community college if anyone signs up. But that doesn't give you a lot of room to get very in depth since there is so much to cover.
Also I am sure you don't need any more sources but have a skim [at my old data collection]( and maybe you'll find something interesting.
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:08:58
In either case I don't see any reason to fear a hard fork if it is well prepared. If it is not well prepared then people probably won't know about it and it wouldn't be a risk to the mainchain.

If you consider the pools to be representative of the miners that power them, then that is one way to think of that.

To add on to this, re-spending from an address also increasing the ease with which someone can 'track' who you are from the blockchain.

You have a long road of learning in front of you there but it can be fun, don't despair.
An offline wallet is one made from a computer that has no contact with the internet and won't for the purposes of the information. the idea is a wallet where no hacker, no matter how good, can steal your information. 
You may be fine with that small amount in a wallet on your cell phone, but keep your seed safe, I recommend stamping it in metal but you can get [things]( to keep them safe and look cool.

These slides should introduce students to most of the pertinent information, they can take this info home and not have to take fast notes. Then the class can be more fun.
I encourage any of you to write your local colleges and schools and ask them to offer a similar course, feel free to use this information I have gathered.

Lukejr, I continue to wait for you to respond to my post criticizing you for being dishonest. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:33:59
That's patently false however. 
A physical Bitcoin is a cryptographic key pair (or often just the secret key and address) put onto a physical medium. A physical key printed and affixed to what has always been before a coin.             
The first physical bitcoin coin was the [Casascius coin]( since then the world of physical bitcoin [coins]( has [blossomed]( as a fun part of the Bitcoin world.       
While you might not like the word, it is out there and a well established word. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:49:08
There are dozens of people, all proclaiming to be experts, and each spouting contradictory opinions. 
We need clear and open communication and we need clear and standardized definitions for what we are talking about so nothing ever becomes about semantics. 
But I must say, some people seem unwilling to do these simple things to help move us forward.
Also, I don't believe this is true:


Can you provide some documentation showing the original plan where this is true? As I see it this has only arisen in recent time and been pushed by a small group of people.

[Mastering bitcoin by Andreas](chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/pr02.html) is a great place to start
[the developer guide is great for the basics under the hood](
there are a number of books that aren't so much about the technicals [here is a link to 10 books](

If you think mastering bitcoin is only for experts then you should learn most CS Intro to Intro to computer science is free online via harvard through edx

Centerpieces are just for show, I designed the things around the tritium vial but made some things I could sell.
Yeah the user has to keep the decryption key safe, so is it worth it at all? But then if you made a secure pass phrase you could copy it all over and keep only one copy of the secret key.
Really it's not perfect, cool maybe, but certainly not for everyone. 
I made it to require a encrypted key so no one has to trust me with their funds, I could have gone like other physical btc and just made a compelte key pair but I don't want to trust others so why should I make others trust me

Hmm and it seems you have requirements as well, I suppose you want it very small.
RFID is one option, I looking into adding a RFID tag inbetween the rings of my capsule. RDIF/NFC can be made is a variety of sizes, very small is hard but perhaps thin and long? It could be threaded into seems or on corners. I question the long term durability and protection it would offer.

I wish we could move away from using twitter posts as links.
Just a personal frustration I guess. 
A working tumbler that's anonymous and safe (no chance of theft or malfunction) would go a long way towards better pseudo-anonymity in bitcoin than we have today;     
but would it be enough that the chain analysis and type companies stop their efforts? 
Are we inadvertently starting a war on encryption not by a state but by private corporations?

Please, show me an example of this here. I will wait. 
What cristicism? Luke pointed out some problems he has with semantics, and also made some statements that don't reflect the situation. At the very start of his diatribe we see him say,


Slide 4(there are over ten 'slide 4's) said,


so he starts out with what looks like false accusations and proceeded to ramble his opinion. I will take it into consideration but I don't take it as fact.

I have a type of [btc piggy bank]( Where you can put funds into it but you have to destroy it to get the key inside. It's fire/water/rust/time/smoke/heat/damage/tamper [resistant](
I made it because I needed a better cold storage method [than a paper waller or a flash drive]( and I wanted it to be tamper evident.        
If you live in an apartment in a city with no family/land what are your better options?

To be fair, the price skyrocketed long before the blocks were full and the growth is substantially lower now that blocks are full.
But you have repeatedly declared that SN intended for the temp limit to be permanent through trickery which is unbecoming of the character we know as SN.

Hey there I just wanted to say thanks for making these, they were my inspiration [to make my own physical bitcoin]( I wrote you a message maybe a year ago about wanting your coin with the key on a piece of metal but never heard back, [so I just made it](

From me, the team is me. [See more on the device]( or [see the capsules with glowing centerpieces](
The point of this is that the secret key is laser etched on some titanium rings and that is sealed in the tamper evidence (and water/air tight) capsule.

And I did write,        


How would you suggest I make this point even more clear?
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:19:41
Alright, now that we have more time let's examine what you have posted.
Also, note that you never said where you pulled these slides from, saying what set of slides would have helped everyone.


Did I ever say that? I believe slide 4 (in set 1) says this, "An address is where crypto tokens can be sent to, and with it their history and balance can be viewed."
So I don't see where you get that idea. You are starting out with a negative attitude which isn't helpful. 


What address is longer than 35 characters unless you change the base or format? I've never heard of such a thing so I am curious as to what you are talking about here. 


Do address starting with a 3 not mean they are P2SH addresses? 
The bitcoin wikipedia disagrees with you there if so, and I am also curious as to what exactly you are talking about, 'Newer P2SH type starting with the number 3 '
Also this is the very beginning of the intro info, so you should't get too complicated right away.
: Bitcoin is today not censorship-resistant due to mining centralisation. The blockchain does not preserve data, and while transactions can hypothetically commit to data, there is yet no sane standard for doing so today. In no case are these useful for proof-of-ownership and only to a very limited extent for proof-of-"originality".


..? do you not understand what you are reading? We're doing a *quick* intro to some terms.


You keep saying 8, Satoshi said 6, I don't see any reason 6 isn't good enough for now, why not just do 11 then?
 Bitcoin is today not censorship-resistant due to mining centralisation.
 Do you mean that due to mining pools? Do you have any hard data to support that claim?
 ---
Slide 13: Bitcoin is today not censorship-resistant due to mining centralisation. 


is tx data not preserved?


 conjecture


Where do you get this idea?


Can you provide me with some links, that would be great as I couldn't find anything and nothing comes to my mind but I don't know everything.


No one knows anything, all way can do it try to figure things out like Archbishop Usher. Like evolution or radiocarbon dating though we can make very educated guesses based on overwhelming support. In this case I think the records do show SN mined the great majority of blocks in the early months if not about half the blocks in the first year.
Rather than debate that, if you can provide a detailed response to the data showing that he *did* mine that many early blocks it would then be something I would consider. You could provide a coefficent of reality, where you take a reasonable chance for error, such as if you think SN mined the first block but not the second block (though it wasn't announced yet) then you have a very high coefficient for error, but if you think SN mined blocks at least until he announced the software your coeffiecnt goes down. 
So provide me with better math and statistics to counter the ones I've seen and I'll revisit your opinion on this matter. 


I'm not touching that *here* for fear my account would be banned. For everyone else I encourage you do you own research and not just listen to other people. 


Again, where did I say we *know* how many he mined? Please stop putting words in my mouth, that is dishonest and rude.
I have taken your other points into consideration, I welcome your review though you don't need to be so rude. Thanks!

pdf download of some research I made, the second part of the document is the part that concerns this post
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:59:05
This is what I have on the subject so far, but I'll use your list to add things
Companies are in an eternal battle against thieves. Digital data can have value, a competitor might want another companies research, a scammer can buy or sell personal information, bitcoin has doesn't need to go through as specific an intermediary as that competitor or whoever is willing to risk using strangers personal information which may make it a more valuable kind if digital data. That digital data can be stolen and not recovered, either tracking down the thieves is much more difficult and if you do they may have made copies or sent them makes a challenging threat. Bitcoin is a juicy target for malicious people, it can be stolen immeditally and without recourse. 
Bitcoin companies have been hacked many times, we will try to name some of them here. Also while we may say hack, strictly speaking a hack is a novel usage or idea while a 'crack' or cracking  relies on known attack routes and methods and in the actual definition of most mentions of hacking on news or in life. 
In 2015, Bitfinex was hacked, only 00.5% of their funds were possibly available, the rest were in cold storgae and they will restore all stolen funds out of their own pocket. [x] Excoin, Bter, and HitBTC all got hacked as well.
Flexcoin lost nearly 900btc in 2014 and shut down, input.io also got hacked and shut down. 
The email address Satoshi used was publicly hacked in 2014. [x] 
Nearly 80,000 coins were lost in 2011 to the MyBitcoin wallet shutdown. 
Bitcoinia hacks in 2012 lost over 50,000 btc. 
BitDayTrade was supposed to be an improved version of Bitcoinia and is responsible for nearly 10,000 lost btc. 
Around fall of 2013 Inputs.io ran by a party known as 'TradeFortress' claims it was hacked of about 4,100 bitcoin. [x] This site was intended to an a secure online storage medium and was apparently hacked with a very targeted attack. [x, y]
In 2013 Instawallet was hacked and shut down, OZCoin lost over 900 btc. 
Mt Gox, Silk road, and silk road 2 were both hacked. User data taken and coins stolen from hot wallets. 
Bitcointalk is a web forum for discussing topics related to bitcoin, whi it is not an exchange and no money is held online is has been hacked more than once. 
And there are many more examples of people being careless with their SKs or being unaware of an attack vector. 
Some people have hacked other's bitcoins because they saw a vulnerability and didn't want anyone else to get to it, later giving the btc back to those original owners a few times too. [x]
Passwords a list of 79,000 email, usernames, and passwords was allegedly stolen from cloudminr.io and put online to be sold for 1 btc, worth arounf $300 at the time. [x, y]
Now, let's run quickly over some other hacks.
In 2014 UPS announced hack compromised places in 24 states. 
A hospital network had 4.5 million records hacked. [x]
Adam Draper, son of Tom Draper had $50 stolen from his bank account.
In May of 2015 the IRS had a data breach of over 100,000 people's tax returns.
In June 2015 it was announced that hackers had gained personal information on every federal employee in the US, including social security numbers of almost everyone in the armed forces. [x]
The only bitcoin you can lose is that which you give up control of, but someone can take your personal information or bank information and commit identity theft with that stolen information. For this reason these communications are encrypted but we can see they are still open to attackers. In bitcoin there is no personal information that goes over the network, there is nothing to steal and if it were stolen there is no use for it. 
Many times as well people lost bitcoins on their own, due to carelessness or neglect. This was much more common early in the life of Bitcoin when there were few if any safeguards. On accident people could send bitcoins to the wrong person or and much more likely send the wrong amount. While giving a friend of your too much money on accident isn't so bad as you can usually get it back from them, sending too much money as a bitcoin transaction fee to a miner can be bad. In many cases there is no way to contact the miner and plead your case, and there is no guarantee any such attempt would work. However there have been cases of miners and mining pools refunding people money when they paid large amounts of bitcoin as a fee. [x] 
Scams significant amounts of bitcoin were stolen
Around 3,700 bitcoin were stolen by the former CEO, one Ryan Kennedy, of a company named Moolah. [x]
A Ponzi scheme using bitcoin called bitcoin saving and trust stole investments from new investors to pay off older ones. [x]
Butterfly Labs who took money for orders on ASIC mining rigs they never sent or used until they were broken or obselete then shipped them.
Another company promised delivery of mining units and never delivered, this company ActiveMiner has been ordered to hand over all profits and has been fined nearly $90,000. [x, y]
The Neo&amp;Bee company used a large amount of its startup funds to adverstise then someone within the compnay disappeared leaving behund a wife and children. Cyprus, the area where the company was and put up ads, had slogans that said, 'Who is Neo?' but people there now say, 'Where is Neo?” [x]

A Nobel Prize winner in Economics. He is a mathematician with work on game theory and more. John Nash is famous for his concept of 'ideal money' which is not backed by a government and can easily cross international boarders. A declassified letter form 1955 shows Nash advising the NSA of cryptography techniques and ideas in computer design that wouldn't become mainstream for 20 years. Nash has been a teacher at Princeton and MIT.     
He underwent a stint of psychiatric illness which he has since recovered from and he resumed his teaching position around 2000. He is known to have become fascniated by computers and as early as 1986 used email to send advanced concepts to other mathematicians. The movie 'A Beautiful Mind' is loosly based on him. He died  on May 24th 2015 and will be missed by many. 
Some had speculated that he was actually be even Nick Szaboor even Wei Dai  [x, y] but pictures of Szabo and Nash's death discount this. [x](Group pic)

In Fall of 2014 the email that SN used before disappearing was used again but the message was not signed by a PGP key and it did not sound like SN. Shortly later a message from another account that belong to SN, this time on the P2PFoundation website, appeared and it read,     
	"Dear Satoshi. Your dox, passwords and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet. Apparently you didn't configure Tor properly and your IP leaked when you used your email account sometime in 2010. You are not safe. You need to get out of where you are as soon as possible before these people harm you. Thank you for inventing bitcoin." [x]
At least one hacker gained access to the email and sent out multiple emails from the address, satoshin where they demanded a 25 btc payment not to sell SN's private details. The address they requested get funded never got above 2 btc. [x]
It may appear that the email account was used to recover passwords of other websites and that the emails in the account were deleted when SN last used it so that the intruder only had access to incoming emails since SN disappeared. However there is a screen shot that if real shows nearly 11,000 messages in the inbox. Maybe SN just got overwhelmed!  Some had thought the email expired but forwarded emails from at least 2011 show otherwise. Some things that someone spend a few years trying all the birthday combinations to get a link to a password reset but we may never know how they got in. [x]

I would say so, I have convinced a community college near me to do a course and I have about 10 sections, each with about 20 pages of what is more or less a now a textbook. There is a lot of information, so much that you need to be refining and distilling it to shorten it even.

**Physical bitcoins** are a type of cold storage where the secret key and address are printed on a tamper evident sticker, it's a fun version of a paper wallet that you can give and can have other value (made on gold coins etc).
These coins you have to trust the creator to not have stored the secret key if you want to actually keep any of your own funds on it. These are pretty items for sure, I will always be a bit bitter I didn't buy any silver casasicus coins at the time I saw them and was learning about btc.
I do have some problems with the physical bitcoins that I see on the market in that they have many of the limitations of regular paper wallets: rot, fire, theft by viewing. And for that reason I have made my own type of physical bitcoin, a new type altogether that I call cold hard storage. The secret key laser engraved and kept in a tamper evident box. They key will have to be a user supplied and encrypted key, so no one has to trust me. I will [sell](50 of them and if those sell I will make 50 more.

Pretty much, the screws will be loctited and have the heads drilled out.
The price is higher than I wanted for sure, and I wish it had been cheaper to make, I am hoping to lower the price still.
The secret key is engraved on a metal ring that is epoxyed inside the address ring and sealed in the tamper evident container, it's a fancy piggy bank. It's something I wanted because I was unhappy with other physical bitcoins, so I made this for me. I figure though that there might be some others at least like me that might want something similar

For learning I must recommend you read the Bitcoin whitepaper first to get an idea of what bit was intended to be.
I also recommend the cypherpunk manifesto for newbies it's only 2 pages long and gives an intro to btcland in a way.
[Mastering bitcoin by Andreas](chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/pr02.html) is a great place to start
[the developer guide is great for the basics under the hood](
there are a number of books that aren't so much about the technicals [here is a link to 10 books](
[Princeton video lectures](
If you think mastering bitcoin is only for experts then you should learn most CS Intro to Intro to computer science is free online via harvard through edx 
and MIT's intro to computer science is also free online  
this will give you more real knowledge then just reading about things

Benefits over a conventional paper cold storage wallet include:
 * much more fire proof (our R&amp;D team informs me metal is actually quite difficult to burn  )
 * virtually rot proof (compared to paper wallets)
 * made of corrosion/rust resistant metals (316 stainless steel which the key pair is engraved on and 6061 Al for the ends of the capsule)
 * key pair is kept in water tight space (non laser-jet printed ink paper can run if wet)
 * shinny and all awesome looking
 * ruby, sapphire, or tritium vial inside looks extra cool
 * can survive both being shot from a potato cannon, and being hit by a potato from one
 * can survive being boiled in custard and baked into a pie
 * tamper evident, if someone sees your current paper wallet you might never know but this is like a piggy bank. You have to break it apart to get to the juicy funds inside.
 * it's small but not too small, around the size of a ping pong ball

[Some prototype samples](    
I'm sure you've all heard of physical bitcoins, a fancy type of paper wallet and cold storage, well these are an evolution, adaptation, and improvement on those ideas. 
These, cold hard storage, are a tamper *e*vident type of physical bitcoin that are also fire, rot, water, time, and looking resistant. Sidebar at for info on how these are made.
These aren't for novices, if you don't know why or how to make a encrypted secret key then these aren't for you.

This is a fantastic book for everyone looking to understand the Bitcoin system, I also like the developer guide to augment it.    
For everyone looking to learn, I have also gathered much information for learning in one semi jumbled [collection](
We should foster understanding of the system, I like to point people to the whitepaper, then reading what Satoshi had to publicly say is also helpful sometimes I find.

Hi everyone, I wanted something better than what was out there so I decide to make it myself. It's more useful to me than a paper wallet or non tamper evident device (like cryptostel) plus it's pretty and fun.
Not only something that wouldn't rust, burn, rot, run, melt, char, bleed, or break down; but I also wanted something you couldn't just look at and steal. Something someone else couldn't take a photo of and rob you.
So this is tamper-evident, the screws and drilled out and glued together, and it's kind of fun with different options for the centerpeice. 
Want to know much more about the Keyois Capsule? [See Here](
Want to know more about why I wasn't happy with what was out there and see some dangers of popular cold storage methods? [Click here](
Want a bunch of photos? [Here](           
Included in that are:
* [Centerpiece]( [photos](
* [Melting in acid](
* [The making of](
* [Water pressure testing](
* [Crushing with a tractor](
I made these for me but it cost about the same to make more as to make 1 so I made 50 of each variety so I can sell them, but they are only available for sale for bitcoin or ether. The 1st edition is sold out but the second edition where the key is engraved in tungsten is still available.
You can make you own address with BIP38 protection and not need to trust me at all too!

I know you're the expert but I would like to piggyback your comment to tell people that some fire-resistant safes will actually break in a housefire.     
If someone doesn't have access to multiple locations and they don't have or want to use a safety deposit box then they should take extra precautions in choosing their medium of storage.      
[I recommend]( stamping or engraving on a piece of metal and keeping it in the lowest part of the house where it is less likely to burn (be careful though paper can get water damaged sometimes and basements/cells can flood).     
Those in apartments should be even more careful.

the stickers are cheap but they are just plastic mostly, putting them on something big with a high R value for conductivity would help, like if you warp a piece of paper in a iron bar and put that over a candle the paper won't burn right away

Hi friend, are you me?
I not only [made a big post on problems with cold storage methods]( including water damage and tampering, but I also [created my own solution]( which was a water resistant, fire resistant, time and damage resistant bitcoin wallet.
If I may say from your limited question, [I have exactly]( [what you are looking for.](  
In addition to [my capsule]( I would recommend getting a metal stamping kit and stamping your seed on a piece of steel, then you can plasti-dip that or do something else to make it tamper evident. You can set it in concrete or in some room-temp-drying clay; that way you can make something non-discreet that it can be in but that has to be broken to get the tasty insides. Almost like a crypto currency piggy bank
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:32:11
I use a BIP38 encrypted key laser engraved on [Titanium]( in a [tamper-evident capsule]( with the pass phrase split into many parts and stamped on stainless steel bars which are then secured inside contained that can't be resealed; so everything is tamper evident.
I actually just made  [a big write up with problems with many methods of cold storage]( that you sound like you would like. Though it only highlights problems.
I would recommend splitting and encrypting your keys and storing them in a time-resistant way
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:05:46
That is one way of thinking about it,     
but as I pointed out you really only need one secured, and as long as that security is good you can tell everyone about the other half.
Indeed I reference the cryptosteel in my post detailing things wrong with many common cold storage methods, the CS has problems that I feel are easy to fix. 
I saw what was out there and I wanted something better, something: made from a better material than 304SS, wanted it tamper evident, wanted it non-para/feromegnetic, wanted it pretty
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:22:44
I got an email saying it would be delayed and to look out for another email which I haven't seen yet.\
For what it's worth I teach a short course on crypto at my community college and I have gathered a huge amount of info on btc that you can see here: np.reddit.com---
Edit: Thanks! 
I'd also like to add that I watched all the previous course's lectures on this subject and tried to incorporate the best of that information into my collection of info

[Paper is a bad choice](  at least for long term storage 
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:27:15
I'd be curious as to what you're after. I really made the capsule thing for me because 1)I wanted something better than what was on the market and 2) I had just gotten gifted a [super cool glowing vial and I wanted to use]( it in whatever I made.
I am sure laser engraving on a [titanium or tungsten]( plate would have been easier and cheaper for me to keep my seed safe, but it's something to do.
I am afraid I have no telegram account, but feel free to PM me!
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:12:18
Yes, it is far from perfect, but it is what I wanted for me so I made it. Of course you need both the pass phrase and secret key to spend so in theory you only need to secure one.     
Another reason is that without an automated system engraving or stamping your pass phrase and secret key or seed is a time consuming and annoying process so this cuts that in half and you get something pretty too.
I could always just make a non encrypted key pair like other manufacturer generated physical bitcoins and you don't need any pass phrase, but then you would have to trust me. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 19:36:46

Hello Everyone, [Happy Pizza day]( a new brick of information here for the class we recently finished.
This is part 1 of 4 for lecture 3, I have decided to release each part separately which means these posts will go on for a while unless you guys really don't like them.  
[Information relating to Lecture 2](
[Information relating to Lecture 1](
The college will be offering the course again in the summer term, Wednesday nights from 6-8PM for 5 weeks; if you know anyone in the Portland, Oregon area you might encourage them to take the course.
To reiterate my previous posts these slides are information heavy because there is so much information and little time.     
They are intended to serve as a brief introduction to the subject matter, if the students are interested they now know about the subject and can learn more.     
That way they have all the information they need already written down and don't have to take heavy notes and the class can be more lively and fun with its discussion.      
I received positive feedback from the students about this format.
The class itself is me talking to the students about things that interest them and that I feel are most important, I try to engage the students in the subject matter.      
The slides are like footnotes for my lecture and are not intended to be read aloud.
I encourage all of you to try and do the same thing.
And if you don't like my format and information that I spent lots of time gathering then you are welcome to do a better job or      
I would be happy to have one of you rework all this information into a format you are happy with that I can present in a timely manner. E.g. this is post is equivalent to 25 minutes of lecture time.
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:14:08
The term you want is a consultant, they exist and I've met some people who do just what you've said. 
Is it worth it to you? Do you think it will help the btc ecosystem? Would there be better ways that are more or less profitable? 
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:27:38
Now to be fair I don't recall ever asking for advice, and the feedback was noted but ultimately useless as I tried to spell out in the text above.
PR is one of bitcoin's biggest problems yes, (also it isn't bit-coin) which is exactly why I started the class.
These slides are information heavy because there is so much information and little time. They are intended to serve as a brief introduction to the subject matter, if the students are interested they now know about the subject and can learn more.
Lastly to reiterate what I believe I have tried to say many times, the class lecture is really between me and the students, the lecture slides are just footnotes to remind me what to talk about. They are not 'presentation' slides like you would see in a normal class that is taught over 30 hours or more, largely due to time constraints. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:18:05

[We also see]( that although some aluminium alloys will withstand a housefire not all will, and deformation occurs before total melting.
@_date: 2016-05-22 21:24:20
I think that's a great idea. 
It took me a while to learn all about bitcoin and I wanted to make it easier for newcomers so I gathered all the information I thought I could find that was relevant and put it together.
Knowing what you don't know is a big part of learning and this gives an introduction to that.
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:31:01

Hi everyone, good news, the course is going forward and in fact is almost over. This is the first course related to Bitcoin in the PNW of the USA.

Here is some information I have gathered as someone who has spent years in this space I teach a short 10 hour course on btc at my local community college, I've read most of the books, lectures, and links in this page and tried to add the best of that info into my slides.
[1.0 Introduction Lecture Info](
[2.0 Bitcoin the system vs bitcoin the token](
[3.1 a history of money  ]( 
[3.1b]( the history of relevant technology before btc.

 the more sources and the sources under each section have many many many relevant link, look through them if you want to know more
For learning I must recommend you read the Bitcoin whitepaper first to get an idea of what bit was intended to be.
I also recommend the cypherpunk manifesto for newbies it's only 2 pages long and gives an intro to btcland in a way.
[Mastering bitcoin by Andreas](chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/pr02.html) is a great place to start
[the developer guide is great for the basics under the hood](
there are a number of books that aren't so much about the technicals [here is a link to 10 books](
[Princeton video lectures](
If you think mastering bitcoin is only for experts then you should learn most CS Intro to Intro to computer science is free online via harvard through edx 
and MIT's intro to computer science is also free online  
this will give you more real knowledge then just reading about things
I have dozens more 'learning' links there are just too many to post

Hey there, so I teach a short (10 hours) course on Bitcoin at my local community college and I have some information on Satoshi Nakamoto and who some people think is behind the name

My smiling friend I think you have some misconceptions.
Of course there is the chance that I am the one who is wrong but I must admit your (diatribe) words do not hit home for me.
For instance, when I first became interested in btc and wanted to acquire some, it was not based on hoptimum, there was no greed or price factor. I liked the idea of a unique digital information token that I could have and no one else. I guess I was attracted to the rarity then, like a collector might be to the scarcity of gold. 
That said, if I were like that there must be others, and your argument that no one wants it except to gain their personal wealth is proven wrong, if only by an anecdote because you said no one wants it except for reason X, which is patently false. 
If, in the cases you pointed out, these people are purchasing it as a  store of value, if it gain a steady value and their other holding maintain a lowering of value in relation then I think they will continue to hold it, as it continues as a store of value. 
You are right of course that without others wanting btc no one has any use for it except to collect it for it's scarcity and rarity. That said, there is a large (and increasing) amount of people who *do * want it, they want it for many reasons but if they are willing to pay for it then it become an attractive means to transfer value.


I don't know where you get this information but it is not correct. Although I rarely use btc for purchases (few places accept it) when I have the option it is by far the easiest method of payment online when using new sites. I know of a number of people that live now without bank accounts, and buy everything with btc. The idea that it can't be used is silly, it can be used directly and often for a discount in some online places and it can be used in a round about way to pay for anything visa or mastercard can buy.
This point is also patiently false based on my experience and knowledge. 
The next argument about fees is not wholly accurate either. @ things will happen, btc will function as a P2P digital cash system over the internet and there will be a great number of txs, the volume of fees will act as a subsity for a mining subsidy. Or btc will become a expensive settlement system with high fees and not able to be used by many. In this case, yes, fees will go up, but btc retains the power that no banker can steal your funds as easily. In the other case, fees will remain low.
Also note that calling the electricity wasted is naive, and a sign you either don't fully grok btc or you don't want to and are actively rooting against it. The electricity serves a real and existing purpose to secure the btc from attack. You may disagree that it needs so much electricity, you may not think a Ft. Knox needs so much concrete, all that concrete is a waste! But that doesn't make it do from all sides. 


again, this shows you lack of understanding of btc and history.  You can in fact do these things, but you would have to be smart about it. you can't have only enough knowledge to cause damage.
I dare say your points are all conjecture. 
No one is talking about btc    
yes some people buy as speculation, the more these people profit from their speculation and tell their friends the better chance btc has of surviving their exit    
it has a number of uses, your failure to acknowledge that only shows your ignorance or lack of understanding    
Do *you* understand the basics of internal combustion, surfactants, logic gates, Ohms' law, and statistics? If not you have no place to judge anyone for using things they don't understand, yet work.
In your closing paragraph you again make statements not backed up by facts, many thousands of btc can be unloaded on the open market all at once, not to mention (as you did) OTC trades which can also be arranged.
The last point is largely irrelevant at the time, if one can sell all these btc (millions of satoshis, which is what the system actually counts) with 1 tx, and there are more txs over time than users making then I can almost always get through fairly quickly. In addition I could always make my tx more valuable to mine (by increasing the fee, this is clearly not a good solution but not everything is perfect). I am curious where you get the information btc always has a backlog, and if that were currently the case would you think some of those txs might be "spam" as they say? Making a more valid tx easy to get through? I think I would.
I might also note from you old blog you base btc's performance on its price


the price is 20X higher then the high you mentioned, do you still feel that way?
Thank you for wishing me success, it did take a long time to understand the system and all of its parts. From what you have said I think it is clear you do not fully understand all parts (or you are being deliberately obtuse but that isn't logical so we'll move on) and I might suggest reading about the system
  here is a shared google drive presentation that might help
Though I talked at length about initially wanting to buy some because the premise of the honest system piqued my interest I must admit that greed is a large part of the driving force with investments into btc. However that doesn't make it the rule and by no means the case all the time. Btc has use as a less corruptible means of sending value. 
M[ight I recommend watching this]

Yes it is, but it's also a little more. It's non-denominated and tamper evidence like some other physical bitcoins but it's more disaster resistant in addition.

Well this website has yet to show me something I don't like. 
I will be adding this link to the MEDIA section of my community college course on btc/crypots. I think it would fit in well after the Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain section.

Bitcoin has just enough of many other subjects that to fully understand the many aspects of btc one has to learn a variety of fields.
What is there?
Computer Science, for obvious reasons
Economics, for the monitory policy 
Financial history, for the design and reasons for wanting to build a better system
Cryptography, for understanding of asymmetric encryption
Mathematics, for understanding the discrete logarithm problem and the power of very large numbers

well radiation is a big term, the light from your desklamp is radiation, the heat emitted from your body is radiation. The type of radiation is more important, and that's why tritium isn't a problem is your aren't ingesting or breathing it.

You can provide your own encryption phrase so that there is no danger or you can buy one the manufacturer has created securely but you still need to trust the process.

This capsule somehow ended up in a beaker of HCl for 30 or so hours. At first it looked [okay]( but when it was moved again some metal parts didn't make it.       
But the titanium rings were still stuck together and didn't seem to be [hurt]( Which is what this is really all about.

Great work! I myself got a community college where I live (Portland, Oregon) to offer a course on [Bitcoin and Cryptos]( 
How did this course come about? In my case I emailed the school and suggested the offer it, I wonder if something similar happened or if the staff came up with the idea. 
Were you involved with this class? It's always great to see new courses popping up.
