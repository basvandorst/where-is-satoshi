yes this is easy to understand, i'm keeping track of it that way as well. the question is about taxation of the profits when they're not listed as capital gains, which is what they are. 
it's another attempt to discourage us from participating in these markets. the question is how to deal with the scam.

'15 is on the daily no BTC/Coinbase info for the 4H

[consensus '18]( even tho we're entering consolidation on the daily, weekly and even 4H, the more the corp media hypes this event the more people FOMO in. and then it's sell the news for a day or two after.

a take profit order is in the opposite direction of a stop. i won't use stops on Kraken. i monitor my positions closely and back that up with 2 reliable app alerts. Blockfolio &amp; Coin Stats have an alert system that is fairly reliable on IOS, after trying about 30 others that constantly fail.

nope, it's a play i apply to every long and short with a take profit order. hoping to catch one eventually, you can place a stop loss and take profit at the same time in the [drop down]( while a lot of traders in my chat fish for wicks, i've never heard of anyone trying that with a flip because few use Kraken. just thought i'd share the concept. if it executes correctly it could potentially double the profit of a a standard fishing sell/long or buy/short play.

Flip Fishing on Kraken. flash wicks move in the direction the price is moving and often reverse after. so based on previous action \(yellow arrows\), blue line is a long with a sell at the blue arrow above for double my position. this will flip to a short upon executing in immediate profit for the same size as my initial long, which may be able to swing for a day or two to capture more profit.

Kraken allows margin and leverage on a few coins and is the only option outside of a VPN for US residents to actually trade. GDax is more like a bank. Binance is only one direction, no leverage. other countries get it. you'd think the state with fucking wall st would understand how important it is to stay competitive in this space.
