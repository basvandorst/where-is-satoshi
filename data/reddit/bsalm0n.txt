I agree that Bitsquare is simply superb!
BTW the trade limit is only 1 BTC when exchanging fiat. For trades between BTC and altcoins of your choice it's 3 BTC.

Being a frequent user of bitsquare myself I'm not sure if what you are describing here can be right. I think you could only lose the dispute (and the 0.01 BTC fee) if you didn't deliver the coins/fiat. SEPA and other fiat transfers are allowed up to 8 days to settle (but usually takes 1-3 days) to allow for bank holidays etc.
If you believe the dispute settlement was unfair, you'd need to describe the situation in more detail. Perhaps the best place is

Oh great, more Rare Pepe exposure. How am I supposed to catch 'em all if the price keeps slipping out of my reach! FML :P

BTC mining is vital to the network, yes. Outside the bitcoin economy the BTC mining serves no purpose, unfortunately.

+1 for Gridcoin. This is the one project that is bringing real benefit to all humanity by incentivizing contribution of idle computer resources to a wide range of different scientific projects using the BOINC framework. Everyone can join in our mission and become part of the (future) largest supercomputer!

If you have a half way modern computer or laptop your best bet in the land of crypto right now may be to try and mine Gridcoins. 
Instead of wasting computing power you'll be contributing your CPU or GPU towards a good cause (choose from a list of 30+ scientific and commercial BOINC projects) and getting rewarded in Gridcoins.
