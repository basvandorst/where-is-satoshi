Thanks for your support of our research and for taking the survey. Thanks also for your feedback on the website.
The survey results from BitcoinCensus Survey 1.0 will be made publicly available through reports published on BitcoinCensus.com, once enough people complete the survey and we have the time to run some statistical analysis and generate the reports. 
All raw data will be kept strictly confidential. So we cannot provide you with the raw data. However, in support of your thesis, if you would like, perhaps we can collaborate on a survey in the future. In that survey, we can inform the participants that their data will be shared with you in support of your thesis.
I have a lot of experience working with students progressing through graduate school. I am aware of the enormous pressure you are under, and I remember it all too well. Thus I would happy to help if I can, especially since it overlaps with my research interests.
Please help spread the word about the survey and the website.

Hi, thanks again for your interest.
 
You bring up a good point…I have striven to make our surveys 100% anonymous.
As far as I can tell, the Bitcoin culture values anonymity. I am following suit trusting that the anonymity is there for a good reason. To my knowledge, everything on the website is 100% accurate.
Thanks again!

While you are at it, please take our survey at BitcoinCensus.com
All anonymous. Did a lot of work to ensure that. We believe in the protection of your privacy and the pursuit of solid of research.
We take a psychological point of view with our research, so our is a little different than most surveys...but in a good way :)
I think we need more research in cryptocurrency.

Hi Julia,
I have a PhD and I am also researching Bitcoin. My post is here  My website is BitcoinCensus.com We are conducting a survey of peoples thoughts on Bitcoin. It is open to everyone.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help. I am also in contact with another graduate student studying Bitcoin. Would you like me to put you in touch with him? 
I do not have any Bitcoin shop contacts, sorry. But you might want to reach out to the Bitcoin Foundation. If they decide to help you, they will be a great asset.

The poll on BitcoinCensus.com shows how many people think 1 BTC will be worth more than 2,500 USD in 2014. Go to BitcoinCensus to see the poll results.
Let data be your guide.

Thank you very much for your support. The more people that take it, the more accurate the results will be and the more we will all learn. 
Thanks also for the feedback. You are correct, the survey is a bit US-oriented. It is difficult to create research that is 100% free from cultural bias, but we did strive to make the survey mostly appropriate for just about anyone.
I think the Bitcion price predictions will generate a lot of interest for the study report. Gathering and then sharing public thinking is a main point of the project.
Thanks again for taking it and for your feedback.
Please help spread the word.

Hi Thanks for the tips. I thought Reddit says not to give out personal information.
No one is funding this work. We are doing this in our spare time, for now.
Thanks again for the thoughts.
