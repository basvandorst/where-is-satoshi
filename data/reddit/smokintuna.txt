I've been slowly buying the whole past year, my last buy was at 19k xD oh welllll. Still way above
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:27:04
lmao this is why you don't take advice from strangers on reddit
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:30:55
exactly xD haha. Of course they'll say yes.
But if you're asking "should I just drop it all into BTC right now?" then you shouldn't be investing in the first place lol.
Looking to here for reinforcement is eve  worse
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:20:43
you need to do more research. a fork usually implements a new change (hence why they forked in the first place). it may be ground breaking it may be a shit coin.
point is it doesn't effect the original coin, you aren't adding anything to it. it's different than just "printing more btc" since btc is left unchanged
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:30:44
yes. btc are virtual beanie babies. you solved it good job bro 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:24:42
Aw someone's butthurt. did someone on the internet call you a bad name and hurt your feelings?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:27:21
lightning should resolve some of those issues.
I understand that leaving on an exchange is worrisome but since it's only $50 just wait next time haha. Just wait a day next time theres a jam and fees will be much lower xD
I understand wanting your coins in your wallet "right now", but when you're spending 38$/50$ on transfer fees just wait it out :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:13:57
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:16:38
you have no idea what youre talking about. predictions are literally guesses. I pray nobody actually looks to this for real advice.
quit making shit like this on the off chance someone thinks you know what youre talking about and you ruin their life with hair brained half thought out guesses 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:42:47
I didn't downvote you haha. But if you need an exchange GDAX always works good for me. You can exchange coins for USD then deposit to a bank account directly, and last I checked your bank was supported.
But yeah, just transfer to a wallet and wait a month. it'll be worth even more :)))
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:17
don't sell you'll just regret it later!
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:31:51
you should research the technology more if you don't understand. this is very basic (not trying to be rude).
As long as you don't share any of your private keys or your xpub/xpriv key then it's virtually impossible for anyone to reverse engineer your key.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:41:16
any reason. some people cashing out their profits at the all time high. some people selling some for Christmas money. some people Seeing the price fluctuations and panic selling.
Most people guess it was a combination of selling around holidays and panic mentality
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:37
no the price is just rapidly increasing because it wants to

if he was panicking then selling 0.005 btc of 1 btc won't do any good xD.
If I give you $7000 and you try to buy something $3.5 but instead you give me 7k, that's your own fault xS don't be impulsive and double check.
I know it sucks, not denying that.  But lmao that big of a mistake is def a troll OR an idiot with too much money
Also, nice username bitcoincash shill troll
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:33:41
you don't need to buy 1 btc. just buy small fractions when you can. 
also yes, this subreddit isn't the place to ask for btc. if you wanna buy coins check out gdax/coinbase its great for beginners
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:23:47
I did the same thing but it was a mining pool. I had 12 BTC and they required 15  BTC to withdraw. Years later I remembered but the pool and my account is long gone  :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:10:16
Look at my last post. it's real. I got an account notification last night my account was compromised. 
This morning my account was used to downvote pro btc posts on and upvote negative btc posts.
It also was used to upvote all posts onThere are also a few Reddit users who are very vocal against vote manipulation and my account downvoted _every_ one of their comments.
There is 100% manipulation happening to be pro bch. be careful and don't buy into it. bot nets are definitely being bought and used (I was one until I changed my password).
Be careful!!!
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:22:24
they take the money out in 1-2 business days. the  they usually take 3-5 days to deposit the money to your account (in my experience). 
I'm in the USA and it usually takes 1 full week from starting the transaction to being able to buy BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:01:12
If you dont believe me look at my post history? I wish there was an age limit for Reddit. 15 year olds on here are getting so annoying
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:49:22
look at the orders tab. When you place the limit order it takes the btc or fiat from your balance. If you cancel the order the money will appear back in your account 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:51:06
would you please explain these fundamentals you're so passionate about? Educating someone is always better than being snarky.
my guess is the price is dropping and you're pissed
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:43:49
Do some research man. Mycelium gives you your private keys and your extended private keys. also your seed words which you can use to derive your private keys lol.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:28:13
it's not me. my account was used to downvote specific comments and posts that had over -400 votes In 10 mins
You piece of shit shill.  quit spreading fud
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:24:45
Google xD it's your choice. this question has been asked 2000x already.
If you want coins in both chains then yes buy before. If you don't care buy after.
Nobody can predict the future so asking is useless, nobody knows how the prices will change or anything
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:57:26
lmao if you can't do basic math you probably should look Into something else.
You buy a certain amount of bitcoin (100/7700 = 0.012987013 BTC). You now own that much BTC. 
now if the price is 8000 you have (0.012987013*8000 = $103.8961038961)  worth.
that's  $103.9 - $100 = ~3.9$
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:58:27
Nobody knows when that'll be. Buying now and holding, or dollar cost averaging always works best than guessing. 
No clues on the negatives of cancelling.
Your best bet would be to transfer cash to GDAX (Coinbase's exchange), then setting limit orders or waiting for the price to drop to your desired buy-in point. That way it's instant and no 10 day wait
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:19:49
that's not BTCs fault, it's yours. But small if you can't afford to buy a lot at once. it'll always fluctuate ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:17:07
just bought 1 more at the dip.  here we go!
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:02:59
yeah those are buy limit orders (buy when price hits a certain amount) and stop/stop loss orders  (sell when it drops to  a certain process). 
literally every exchange should have it
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:15:13
sorry this is old news. btc is under attack. check  for status. in about 5 hours the block difficultity for bch will rise driving miners back to btc. there's a current imbalance and btc is blocked up because all miners are on bch. just wait a little longer and it will go to normal
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:04:46
Also my account was used to upvoteand I am currently going through and pruning all of the likes/dislikes. They also UPVOTED pro BCH posts and anti btc posts on This is very tedious and seems manually done.

Nobody would spend 28k for something worth barely 8k. BE CAREFUL 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:53:38
When you initiate a transaction you buy at the market price. Unless you're just transferring fiat to your account, then doing the transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:16:17
lmao I'm sorry if this is real, that sucks. But if you honestly were trying to sell your 1 btc (bad idea) and didn't understand your tools well enough to make this big of a mistake, you're either a troll OR you deserved it.
1 btc is a TON of money, if you're fucking around with it and not understanding your own actions then you deserve this. sorry man, it sucks but I hope you learn from it
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:55:45

No i have not, how would I go about that? Also I have already undone the votes they did on my account 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:06:25
as long as your btc is in a wallet you control (own private keys to) then  when the split occurs you'll have coins on both chains.
wait until a wallet supports the new coin to start trading. coinbase you don't own the private keys so be careful 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:40:48

It's not because he spent 10$ in BTC, obviously it's the same as spending 10$ cash.

ok that's what I thought but I was confused. so if I lose all my devices but I still have the 12 words and PIN, how can I set up my wallet again on electrum OR another wallet?
My concern is I know I need my public/private keys to do a sweep into a new wallet, but how do I get that from my 12 word seed?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:10:10
why don't you contact support like it says? lmao
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:12:14
also tagging into this, I have electrum on android also. I moved a few mBTC to it from my exchange wallet as a test and all went well.
I keep reading on here to keep your coins on a wallet where you own the private keys (for the upcoming hardfork). Is electrum safe? I can't find my private keys but I do have the 12 word seed
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:19:17

@_date: 2017-10-22 09:59:22
1) buy what you can. it's a long term investment. buy what you're ok with losing, don't buy more than you're ok with.
2) mining is slow, if you want to invest you can't get enough to make it worth it. fees and inflation are just a part of the process.
3) lmao if an EM event from the sun happens you have bigger problems
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:18:07
I completely understand stop loss orders from before  (and from this video, very educational!)
however I don't understand how a stop loss sell order is different from a sell limit order?
it seems like (if price == X$) then sell. how is stop loss order different from sell limit order?
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:45:38
watch prices and compare charts, make your own opinion. all I'm saying is (not being rude I promise) asking "when should I buy" is a pointless question.
nobody can predict the future. today's high could be tomorrow's low  or vice versa.
best option? buy now and buckle up for the ride :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:31:51
don't lmao. it's literally gambling. there's no formula or methods, just luck.
If you're cool with losing it all then do it. every stupid newbie goes through the "I'm a badass trader" phase. hopefully you lose it all and we can buy your losses. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:15:05
lmao dude use a calculator ffs. if btc goes up by 10% that's awesome, but if you invest 30 euros that's 3 euro profit. this question is stupid, use common sense.
If you want to make large profit off of small gains then obviously you have to invest more.
"is it true if I invest small amount I get small gains?" why are you even asking lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:39:50
lmao its not our job to convince you to stay. do your research and decide for yourself, quit relying on others to make decisions for you. 
If you want out, get out. others will gladly buy your btc :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:36:08
this is a super helpful comment, thanks  :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:17:06
only because people sold btc before the fork to dump into alt coins. once the forks even out alts should drop to where they belong, the toilet
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:54:46
I have no clue about the electricity costs. depends on what hardware you'd be running, and how lucky you are. 
And yeah that's the point :) plus if you're super paranoid you can send your transactions through your own nodes to be 100% sure it's legit.
But yeah, if you're an investor then setting up a node does nothing but benefit you, since  (I assume) you want btc to survive and thrive.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:30:21
take time and read about btc to understand the technology, convince yourself. if you believe in it then invest  :)

@_date: 2017-10-21 02:53:19
as everyone said already. you're better off buying on a dip and holding for a while. better profits that way and you don't have to obsessively check your phone for market prices every 20 seconds xD
there's no guarantees so day trading crypto is literally high stakes gambling. only consistent way to earn (based on btc history) is to buy on dips and hold for dear life
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:46:24
yeah. constantly watching and buying won't help. hodling on average yields more and is stress free. good luck
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:45:20
1) Blockchain has been compromised _several_ times, and it doesn't give you your private keys or seeds without effort (I may be mistaken.) either way, for iOS Mycelium wallet is incredibly powerful and secure and you have complete ownership of your coins. I use it on Android and it's the best and simplest I've come across.
2) That's up to you. I just save up extra cash from my pay checks and buy a little btc whenever I can. no strict goal, just buy what I can when I can. Never invest more than you're willing to lose

I'm unsure about SEPA. I just linked my back account directly (I'm in the usa) by giving my routing and checking numbers.
But yes from my experience and from reading Coinbases process, the verification stage with anything bank related (other than debit card) will take 1-3 days.
After the verification stage transferring money to/from a bank account takes 4 business days at a minimum regardless.

you don't seem to understand, nobody can predict the future. what if you buy low today, but that's tomorrow's high? What if it drops and never reaches where you bought it at originally?
it's easy to be cocky in hindsight looking at the graphs, but nobody can predict the future. if it was as easy as you're thinking everyone would be doing it.
Try if you want just know many people do this and lose a ton of money and then quit. It's literally gambling, nobody can predict the future otherwise we'd all be millionaires xD
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:30:43

no. nodes are servers that have a copy of the entire blockchain and verify transactions. mining is different. running a node won't get you any money it just supports the network.
Also, unless you live in a developing country with practically free electricity there's pretty much no way to break even with mining due to electricity costs and competition. Hodling your coins and buying more will earn more than mining ever will.

it will happen as long as the fee is &gt; 0. it just depends on how long you wanna wait haha

see if the price has soared or crashed :p to see if he killed himself or not

I just did a test with buy and sell limit orders and cancelled. no issues on my end. Maybe try clearing cookies/cache and reboot? try on mobile or a different pc?

I've lived in Hi Chi Minh, Vietnam for the last 2 years. Bitcoin is big here, there's legitimate websites and exchanges and even stores/convienence stores/atms that exclusively use bitcoin. I've met tons of people who have traded/invest in BTC as their entire job. 
I don't understand what they mean by legalize? It already seems legal and very popular.

As the other user said, QR is similar and super easy haha. I suppose it would be possible to load your current public address to the nfc so people can "scan" it that way instead of camera. Idk about the security risks though since NFC is much more vulnerable. As long as there's a way to verify your private key isn't being touched haha

coinbase has instant buy with debit cards but you pay a much higher fee percentage. Up to you if it's worth it
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:13:32
lol ok
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:56:03
ah ok I see. thanks for the clarification :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:41:49
this isn't a place for begging, it's a subreddit for discussing bitcoin. Save and invest in BTC IF you want, but begging is not what this place is for.
please get this shit out of here

it's entirely dependent on the wallet. some wallets are cross compatible but I was just getting my information from Google.
If you have the seeds you can definitely get your keys and then use it in other wallets. But I'm not an expert. If you know better can you explain to me? because id prefer to understand it
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:29:07
I did the exact same thing.. sorry but what do you mean they won't be actual "bitcoins"
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:41:58
yeah I'm not sure, I know the fork happens at a pre-determined block number, we can estimate when the blockchain will hit that number but it's just an estimation. it may be sooner (like with the BTG fork the other day) or later.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:24:09
yeah it happened a day or 2 earlier than predicted since blockchain hit the designated block. I think so far they just took the snapshot of the blockchain from what I've read but I may be wrong
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:43:28
it's usually program dependant. If you create an electrum wallet the seeds won't work with mycelium, etc

I've been wondering about that too. I was going to buy some but they're just bank wire transfers so what guarantees are there?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:43:29
yeah probably. essentially coinbase got  the Gold for your coins. it's entirely up to them if you get them or not sorry. just wait and see
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:47:31
people treat it as an investment. Buy 1 btc and hold it, if it goes up you can sell part of it for profit and continue to hold, etc...
It's a currency yes but lots of people treat it as a long term investment (not unlike gold/silver)

I did the same thing you're trying to do. they'll send 2 transactions to your account (less than a dollar each). you then type into coinbase the value of the 2 transactions to prove it's your account. after that the account is "verified" and you can use it to deposit money to your coinbase/gdax account or withdraw from coinbase to your bank.
The small dollar verifications will be refunded, not credited to your account.
All transfers to and from your bank account will take 4 business days at a minimum.  In my experience it took 6 business days.
If you need instant money you can use visa/debit card but you'll pay way more In fees and there's a 500$ limit.
Banks are slow sorry, there's no way around the wait times. Set it up now so in the future you don't have to rush. You'll still always have to wait the 4 business days though, so if you need access to cash in your exchange instantly, maybe consider wiring money to your gdax account and holding it there. that way when you need it "NOW"  (price dips, etc) you'll have it on hand and don't have to wait 4 days. 
I got screwed on the last dip because I didn't know about the waiting times either. Tried to buy BTC at $3900 and by the time I had the money in my account it soared to $5800 D: just goes to show how quickly the market changes xD haha

by buying... less? duh

don't use coinbase if you don't want high fees. use your own wallet so you can decide the fee you want to put on your transaction
