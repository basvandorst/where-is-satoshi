The integrity of metal over paper isn't in question here. You've implied that splitting up the seed provides a real measure of security. In reality if the seed words on just a single plate of the 3 is stolen/leaked, the keyspace to brute force the full seed has been reduced by:
*100 thousand billion billion billion*
That's the vast majority of it. 99.999...999% (33 digits of 9's) of the keyspace no longer has to be checked by an attacker.

That sounds reasonable, and everyone always says not enough diversification is risky. It's common investment knowledge that gets regurgitated so often that disagreeing with it is heresy.
But constantly reducing the amount invested in your best performers is some backwards ass shit. If you don't give the risky component of your portfolio the opportunity to take off, then you took on a substantial risk for only a fraction of the gain. If you're going to cap gains like that you'd probably be better off just making less risky investments to begin with.

By only making an attacker perform the outer hash 2x instead of the full 3x you call the hashing function, you're actually reducing the number of hashes that have to be generated. For each possible passphrase, they can hash it twice, record it, and use it as input to run the inner hash for each number from step 2.
If there are N possible passphrases, then your outer hash will run 2N times in the worst case, generating N hashes. If there are M possible numeric passphrases to add to the N hashes, then the inner hashing function will have to hash M times for each N (that's N*M inner-hashes). That's [2N outer] + [NM inner] total calls to the hashing function, each of which take exactly the same amount of time. Simplified: 2N+NM = N(2+M) calls.
If you'd simply tacked the number from the inner hash onto your original passphrase, and hashed it three times, you're looking at 3*N*M total hashes.

Except there isn't. You can run the password through multiple rounds, and even use multiple algorithms. In addition, algorithms can be tuned to suit needs. If I wanted to, I could tune an algorithm so that it required 8GB of RAM and took a full minute to check a single password.

If I borrow $10k from the bank, they must be sure to have $1k left over in reserves. Then they create an account for me, and set the balance to $10k. It's not like they transferred this $10k from another account. The money was created from nothing.

Market forces ensure that money flows through the most efficient path. If it’s as safe or safer than sending money through banks, but more efficient and flexible, then it has value and it will grow.

It’s also possible that significant quantities will be lost, burned, or used for reasons we haven’t predicted yet. It’s surprisingly difficult to put a reasonable hard limit on the upside.
So while it’s crazy to say it will hit $30M for sure within our lifetimes, it’s just as crazy to rule it out. We just can’t predict all the variables.

It's worth considering that you don't *have* to use high fees, that just ensures your transaction goes into the next block. If you don't mind waiting a couple blocks, you can send transactions with very low fees by setting a custom fee in most wallets. I never pay more than like $0.30. So this is partially just a wallet problem.
Also Segwit is still being rolled out and coins moved over to Segwit addresses. It makes a significant difference.

The difficulty of mining adjusts based on the available hashpower. The target is for a block to be mined every 10 minutes. If some people stop mining, the difficulty will go down to maintain that rate. So the supply will increase at the same rate.
There's an exception. The difficulty retargeting is based on on the last 2016 blocks. So if significant hashpower left, it could take a while for the difficulty to adjust down, and blocks would be slow temporarily.

Ethereum provides more powerful smart contracts than Bitcoin's scripting support. Several coins provide better anonymity and privacy, etc. If "best" mattered, then why doesn't a shiny new coin take over occasionally?

It kind of does pay dividends, in the form of forks and other airdrops. Bitcoin cash, Stellar Lumen, and Byteball have added up to about 15% in “dividends” just this year.

For one, that's debatable:
[Bitcoin: Money as language &amp; the multi-currency future](
Anyways, it was an analogy. Miners record transactions on the blockchain, much like Webster's documents the words we frequently use and how. The point is, the people using the thing are choosing which thing to use. There's not some authority defining what is correct.


Exactly. The market, not miners.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:36:36
Correct, unless it's a compatible address for a wallet on a forked chain. Then you could accidentally send coins to an inaccessible address on the main chain. That's why everyone was so pissed about the 2x fork: compatible addresses and no replay protection.

If your definition of "full control" is so strict that it only counts things you can't be physically compelled to do, then almost nothing fits that classification. The point is, you have far more control over your Bitcoin than you do with fiat in traditional financial institutions. Yes, they can prosecute you, but they still can't take your money unless you give it to them. With banks they don't have to ask your permission.
Enforcing a ban isn't possible. They can hurt adoption, but under a hostile government it would still be possible to store bitcoin and send transactions. Seems like having full control over your money to me.

One more thing. The fork you're referring to is called Segwit2x, and it's not endorsed by the majority of users or the core development team. This is different from Segwit, which is on the main chain.

I'll bite. But first, the question should be "what **will** bitcoin do better", because really we need Lightning Networks, better wallets, and less volatility before grandma is using it. That's still a fair comparison; the first cars sucked and were incredibly unreliable. 
Here are a couple things off the top of my head that the average person gives a shit about:
1. Worldwide, 2 billion adults are currently unbanked. They don't have enough money to enter the system, and the banks don't care. Bitcoin allows those excluded from the global financial system to participate and profit. It also provides an incorruptible currency where many governments-backed currencies have failed spectacularly.
2. The US dollar is inflationary, which is supposed to encourage spending. While that causes more economic activity, it's not in the average persons best interests to have their value eroded when they try to save money. Bitcoin is deflationary.
3. It's censorship resistant. You have full control over your money. It can't be seized. Your transactions can't be blocked. You know, some countries won't even allow citizens to transfer their wealth out? Even in the USA, the police can and do seize cash (without any evidence of a crime) and make you fight them in court to get it back. This sidesteps shit like that, taking power from banks and governments and giving it back to people.

Focuses almost completely on the economics. A large part of the book barely mentions Bitcoin, as it covers the advantages of Austrian economics and hard money.

Agreed. It’s important to understand their potential biases, but let’s not go overboard and completely discount everything they say.
I think people forget that if the Winklevii weren’t really bullish anymore, they could sell at a healthy profit. They’re staying in because they legitimately believe there’s significant profit potential.

Software engineer here, who crushed formal logic classes. I added some punctuation without changing the text, to break it up and make this clearer for everyone.


this would only mean that all users (be them [A] the ones accepting the fork or [B] the ones not accepting it) will be able to use the wallet without any inconveniences.


The "in case that we will support *it*" means the fork. Proof: The original chain is already supported. You can't add support for something you already support. Therefore "it" implies the 2x fork.
TL;DR: If they add 2x support they will continue to support the original chain.

I agree with the main point, but...

None of your assumptions are accurate.
Centralized blockchains don't provide any benefits over regular databases. They're less efficient, slower, and require trust. Name 1 advantage of a bank creating their own internal blockchain vs using a database.
Volatility is inversely correlated with price. It's trending down as the price increases. 
How are fees insane? Currently you can send huge sums of money across the globe for like $0.30. Many wallets send fees that are too high.
Bitcoin has always been pseudonymous. Lightning networks and other Layer 2 technology will provide anonymity. Fees should also be lower, and transactions instantaneous.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:09:24
You are correct, but it doesn't happen instantly. If a new big miner started now, the 10 minute block time might end up taking only 5 minutes, for example. After a certain number of blocks, the difficulty will adjust so that we're back to 10 minutes. What I meant in my previous reply was, during that adjustment period while blocks are taking less time, more than 1 block could be mined in 10 minutes.
If the way I phrased it is confusing, just ignore me. You seem to understand.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:35:44
That's correct.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:05:39
Yes the complexity of the problem increases, but it's based on how many problems have been solved over a period of time. And more miners means more problems solved per period of time.

Ok, I "upgraded" cars by adding a 2nd engine. Now the car costs more, weighs more, uses more gas, and requires more maintenance. I guess it has more torque, but maybe that's less of a factor than the added weight.
Technical decisions require making trade-offs. Just because a number got bigger doesn't mean things have improved. For something to be an upgrade is has to be an actual improvement.
You can't increase the block size for free. There are serious implications. Don't you think the Core devs would have done it if your genius "*2x == 2x as good == upgrade*" theory made sense?
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:30:32
There’s a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins. The demand is too high for the price to be that low. This doesn’t affect utility, since they’re divisible to 8 decimal places. $0.0025 is roughly 0.00000058 BTC.

Calling a hostile fork an upgrade is intentionally misleading. It's carefully chosen language aimed at supporting a particular agenda. Your insistence on using it really drives home that fact.
If you don't think keeping more nodes running is important, then you don't really understand what makes Bitcoin special. Less nodes means less decentralization. Period. It's the whole network! Decentralization is the whole point! Of course nodes matter!
I don't get the lightning network hate, either. It's pretty ingenious technology. Frankly even if we had the pipe dream of on-chain scaling to infinity without centralization (spoilers: we don't) it would still provide some benefits. But whatever.
If you think the core contributers are the suspicious party when compared to Faketoshi, Roger Ver, Jeff Garzik and friends, then we truly don't have anything else to discuss.
Supporting people who directly associate with known con artists is such an indefensible position, that it's hard to even take you seriously. It makes you seem shady, too.

A 1ms audio skip isn't a big deal, but flipping 1 bit will corrupt an entire wallet irrecoverably. Also, a commercially burned CD is much higher quality than a CD-R.
Edit: Okay guys 1) You're not going to know if it's 1 only bit flip in advance so you should try a brute force 2) Its unlikely it would be just 1 bit, and brute force scales exponentially with the number of bits, quickly becoming impossible and 3) you're totally missing the damn point, which is that storing money on CD-R's is dumb.
