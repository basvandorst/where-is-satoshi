Hi, you're right for the great majority of what you said. But precisely, this expériment targets foreigners and tourists who want to avoid change fees.. Last but not least, the most interesting thing in my opinion are: 
1/ it widens the paiement sphere of bitcoin which is, like you said, not really developped yet ( the french people will better understand that bitcoin has a purchasing power). 
2/it's interesting to see that this expériment is made by a transdev subsidiary compagny, especially when we know that transdev is itself a subsidiary of "la caisse des dépôts et consignations". The CDC, which is a "special public institution", has already demonstrated its interests in blockchain tech and cryptocurrency
3/ it creates activity for Paymium (6 months..... Probably a bit more) that, like point 1/, may participate in the development of this technology.

Interesting idea. Ni doubt in a educational view. But in legal standard, you may face to potentional inquiries. Seilling/ Bying currencies is change activities, which implies legal statut, administrative declaration, regulation supervision, etc... like other banking and financial activities in a hierarchical systeme,.... Be carreful....

EHESS it's a specific french school whitch is open for all... You don't need a administrative registration but just be present at the seminary

If you don't need administrative registration, be aware, a "free auditor" need to ask to the professor the permission... that's might not be a problem.
