But that kind of pain builds character.... oh who am I kidding, I still wake up drenched in sweat.

Just FYI those stats come from Sistrix.com which is a site traffic ESTIMATOR, and does not actually know whether those sites experienced a drop or not. Take it with a grain of salt.

Realistically, major disruptions to the power grid can (locally) shut down the internet, rendering your purchasing power moot.
2 years ago I went 5 days without power due to tornadoes, and I required paper currency to make purchases.
I love bitcoin, but I'm also realistic that it isn't foolproof.

By the time that chart shows them at 51%, they will have already been there for a while. As much mining power as has been dumped into the system over the last 2 weeks, we need something more current.

What those two don't offer is an audience who is willing to talk about the movement. At least not Clark Moody. I don't use bitcoinity so I can't speak to that one.

It's a simple thing to change at any time, before or after you get your investment back.

wakey wakey eggs and bacy.

I completely agree with your overall sentiment, but I think you have their motivations wrong. I don't think they care whether Bitcoin succeeds or fails, they're just scared to death of getting in trouble with the US government.

I use  - 2% Flat Fee - PPLNS - Adjustable Fee... you can pay 0% fee if you want - Also mines Namecoin

I doubt a mining pool would intentionally do that, but they are just computer systems. What if a pool got hacked?

Spare me your superior vision of r/bitcoin and your "oldfag vs newb" mentality. As of this writing there are 50 more Redditors who agree with me than you, and I see no rules in the sidebar telling me this post is invalid.
Don't like it? Change it. Otherwise leave me alone.

As someone who learned of Bitcoin in February, I feel qualified to answer. Mt Gox was presented to me as the authoritative, end-all be-all,  place to exchange Fiat for Bitcoin in the USA.
If there are better alternatives, we need to make that very clear in our websites and literature for new users.

This quote is so bad and wrong. I always downvote it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:19:03
It's not just about polishing turds. The wrong person in charge of PR can make a gold bar look like a turd too.

I recommend you make BitMinter your backup... or primary.
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:12:01
How accurate is that next estimated difficulty? 91%? Holy smokes.
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:43:48
I would downvote you, if it were socially acceptable.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:18:21
Why? I'm using BitMinter and it's been great to me?
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:42:59
Personally I never cared. He just said what all his peers were thinking.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:13:53
Sorry, was needed (at work) and just hit send. PPLNS, merged mining, great stats, attentive operator ( back when the chain split we were back up and mining on the v7 chain immediately ), you get transaction fees, hasn't been down since I've started using them ( 2.5 months ) and you get to set your own pool fees. ( Default is 2%, but you can set it as low as 1% )
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:45:07
Maybe if you didn't start by calling your audience idiots we'd give a shit about your message? Just a thought.
As for the CDs, good for him. If someone feels $47 is worth it to have this package hand delivered with no work involved, then it is worth it. If people think it's ridiculous, then he won't sell any.
Why do you care so much? If you really cared why don't you set up a rival service that sends out these CDs for free?

Bitminter.com has it's shit together. What's the problem?
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:50:58
If that's what the majority wanted then these posts would be downvoted into oblivion. Perhaps you should start a subreddit for folks who get upset when the rest of us want to talk about record highs.

Sadly the only Namecoin wallet I have found is a command line version. The good news is that you are not wasting any processing on Namecoin... It does not take away from Bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:17:46
Correct! The pool I mine with ( bitminter.com ) lets you set your own fee. You could pay 0% if you wanted to, though the default is 2%.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:53:07
I'm currently mining with a 7950 and my electricity is $0.078 per kwh... I turn it off when I want to play a game and it is still making me money. I expect I will continue running it until places like Butterfly Labs starts shipping.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:05:10
Are you new to Bitcoin, or just Mining?
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:10:24
A someone who has already been mining... you're WAY over thinking the role your choice of pool affects your *complete preparation of mining*. Using bitminter.com ( where I am as an example ) would require you to setup an OpenID based account ( easy ) and change 3 lines of your miner software's config ( easy ).
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:05:23
I understand all that now, but what I was saying is that when I was brand new, none of those alternatives were presented in a way that made them look desirable.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:24:25
Based on the comments in that thread, I'd say it has a viable audience.
