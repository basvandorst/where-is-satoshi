It's a meme from years ago, I think it's kinda amusing actually 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:19
I'm really not convinced this isn't just Google translate 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:57:05
If we hit 100k within a year I'll tell you that I'm gonna eat my dick and then make a meme video for reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:58:59
Not sure how many links it will take to convince you, but feel free to read all of these. None of them state that Bitcoin will be banned and the third one even quotes a South Korean government official as saying that they have no plans to directly oversee exchanges. Please stop spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:49:17
This article is just poorly written and misleading. If you look up some articles from other sites, it's clear that Bitcoin futures are being banned, not Bitcoin itself or the exchanges.

No, they would not be annoyed because people still know what product thats referring to and will still either buy it or not based on whether they like it, not based on the name. What Bcash is doing is like if Pepsi came and tried to call itself Coca-Cola but got upset because people kept calling it Pepsi. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:07:13
That only applies within the Bitcoin protocol. BCH is a separate protocol altogether. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:11:32
Roger Ver getting upset about people calling Bitcoin Cash "Bcash" is like the CEO of Coca-Cola getting mad at people for calling it Coke. It doesn't make any fucking sense unless they're specifically trying to keep Bitcoin in the name to confuse and deceive people. And I think any reasonable (non-shill) person can see thats exactly what's happening. Ver all but admitted that he's trying to take over Bitcoin. 
If the majority of people refer to Bitcoin Core when they say Bitcoin, you can't just say "no, I'm Bitcoin." People are going to distinguish between Bitcoin and Bcash just like every other fork and alt coin, which is all that Bcash is.

I can't believe 10% of people said IOTA. I'm invested in IOTA and fully believe in its potential, but RIGHT NOW IOTA is nothing. It's pure speculation. Now come back to me in 5 years... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:27:57
I think 10k is a big sell point for a lot of people and the price has been rising like crazy, which is when we usually see a correction. I think it will be coming soon, how much it will fluctuate is anybody's guess. I think a correction is generally thought to be 10% so if it dips back down below 9k it might be time to buy. And no, I'm not selling. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:14:10
You're really intense but I like it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:30:49
Smh this is not how you HODL
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:34:13
Nobody can say for sure, but over the last year anytime we see a large price increase it has been followed by a correction. This is some of the sharpest growth we've seen and BTC is a roller coaster so who knows. Personally, I have a buy order set at 8500 and I'm HODLING
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:54:50
Boy he better find it, don't want to miss out on those sweet profits! /s
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:19:36
Please tell me you didn't actually put ALL of your money into crypto. I believe in this too which is why I have money in it, but I still acknowledge its a gamble and gambling EVERYTHING is just a terrible idea straight up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:41:34
Same, I think a dip that big is unlikely though, unless its for maybe 30 minutes. We barely broke 6k a month ago and now 8k is cheap. BTC is crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:53:55
We're only a small part of the BTC market but basically yes. You're missing a piece though, which is that if people think it's going to go down they will sell, and THAT will drive the price down. Then people will buy at the low point and it'll skyrocket back up. Rinse and repeat.
Disclaimer: This is of course speculation, all or none of this could actually happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:51:37
Spoiler alert: Yes
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:59:20
And it's trying to step into the spot that has been held by Bitcoin since 2009 which is literally the beginning of time for cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:59:18
All of that is implied with the scalability, but it's not sustainable. BTC has an infinitely better development team behind it and it has plenty of scalability solutions on the way. If you want lower fees and faster transactions, look at my friend ETH. Once Bitcoin launches its scalability updates, BCH will literally just be centralized Bitcoin and nobody wants that. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:45:18
Eh it's 4am I have nothing better to do
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:55:50
Yeah I see what you're saying. Best of luck to you too, to the floor (hopefully) and then back to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:46:17
The centralization comes from the fact that a very small group of people own the vast majority of the currency and could tank it at will for a quick buck. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:46:32
You probably shouldn't take advice from strangers when it comes to this stuff, but I think that's a reasonable idea. There is a possibility that there will not be a dip or that you miss it and if you're okay with that and you believe that the profit you'll gain outweighs that risk then go for it. I'm personally not selling because I don't have a ton of BTC and with how crazy prices have been lately I'm not convinced enough that there will be a dip. But there probably will be. But maybe not... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:00:31
That has nothing to do with how BCH could tank on a moments notice. Those Bitcoins are gone. They're not going back into the market, which sucks but it's not the same thing at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:06:00
I'M A SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE I WILL NOT BE DISRESPECTED LIKE THIS WHAT DID YOU MAKE LAST YEAR????? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:42:26
But the difference is Bitcoin Core was, is, always has been, and in my opinion always will be "Bitcoin." It may sound childish to say but it was here first. Why should it have to be distinguished from the newcomers? The altcoins should have to distinguish themselves from it, not try to be it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:24
If you guys are worried about hourly or daily prices you're in the wrong game
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:30:06
Definitely, if Bitcoin continues to grow in value (which I think it's fair to say we all believe it will) it will be taken more and more seriously. I would be surprised if Amazon isn't accepting Bitcoin 2-5 years from now. I think implementing Lightning and other scaling solutions is important before this happens though. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:23:25
It'll be worth it in the end. Also, congratulations! I hope you're very happy together. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:53:36
But not GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:12:57
It's crazy to think that we're either making our children millionaires or are going to take massive losses in the long run. Idk how long you guys are hodling but I plan on staying a while. Once the last coin is mined, BTC could easily be worth millions or pennies. Personally I've always preferred the moon to the ground.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:22:36
Because most people don't understand it or think it's bullshit and explaining Bitcoin or blockchain technology is not exactly conducive to nightly news. There are plenty of articles online though. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:08:32
I never said BTC is better in every way. Scalability is definitely it's main issue but there is a clear road map laid out with dozens of different solutions and a highly skilled and dedicated development team. In the long term BCH will not have an advantage over BTC and it will still be centralized and controlled by Roger Ver who is shady to put it nicely. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:48:13
Bitcoin price: 3/10
Bitcoin price with rice: 10/10
Thank you for your suggestion. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:21:28
Hence the "our children" part. Or if you don't want kids just enjoy life as we head to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:49:08
Can I ask why you like BCH? I honestly just don't get it. If I understand it correctly it's basically Bitcoin but it with a duct tape scalability solution at the cost of decentralization, which is one of the main points of BTC. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:56:34
I do believe this which is why I'm still HODLing, but part of me does worry that the media hype of BTC might have peaked already and the general public is no longer interested. But who knows in another year we might be sitting at 20k again
