Take a moment to think how much bitcoin has already developed? And think what responsibility the core team has since there is shit ton of money already invested in it. So yeah those updates wont be done in one weekend.

If you want a similar product but in much much more high quality, look for brand named "Denarium" (company is from Finland). Their products are cool and have collectible value as well (if you fancy such). They also put lots of effort to the security features of the coins. Of course products like these have risk that the company have a copy from the private keys but this company has been making these for years and are well-known for being a trustworthy. Of course you can buy the coins totally empty, make your own wallet and glue it (Qr) on the back of the coin.

I have a strong feeling we will see price hit near 5000usd/1BTC by the end of year 2017. This will of course include several dips.

I would highly recommend you dont use such services since biggest and known services are starting to adapt to meet KYC/AML-regulations. If some vendor does not do so (in the next few years), there is high risk it to go down. Also vendors that dont do KYC are pobably one of those shady ones. Its already a gamble with cryptos, dont make a second gamble with vendors since it can cause you more than just paying the taxes...

Every single people who i have heard to say "yeah bitcoin is just a scam" are the ones who does not understand how it functions and/or haven't ever heard of blockchain technology.

Why did they originally even change the pow to favor ASIC? Yes the chain needs a lot of hashing power but is it really more important than decentralized mining with GPUs?

Would be foolish to think that these machines runs by themselves without any costs to the operator...
