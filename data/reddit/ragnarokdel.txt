Inb4 the stolen bitcoins were stolen by someone using a password dump from people who dont bother having different passwords

That wasnt my point. I dont give a shit that a robot of the nsa reads what I say on skype. If you think you're somehow safer for not using skype, you're delusional. Wouldnt it be funny if Skype wasnt in fact monitored by the NSA and it was a massive troll just so terrorists dont bother using it?
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:14:37
If they allowed people to send bitcoins via skype, it could revolutionize cryptos as a whole.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:32:49
you dont, unless you want to be arrested for being a pedophile terrorist crackhead. (It's a joke :o)
@_date: 2014-12-31 05:48:14
because the general public uses skype, not bitcoin, it's more for the free publicity that it would give.

@_date: 2014-12-31 05:51:16
I meant that it would be great visibility and also I said skype because it's a microsoft product. If it was possible for a "babyboomer" to transfer money via skype without having to go out of their way to get a bitcoin core and updating, etc. It would be great. Right now bitcoin requires people to know wtf they're doing to even get started.

they should just move the comma once or twice to the right. trading 0.00384 of a coin to pay for coffee is going to be super retarded.
Either that or somehow "merge" with litecoin to make them "dimes" and doges to make them "pennies".

that's definately not a nutjob I would like to be associated with.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:40:32
I think one of the comment is more on point then the article. People need to stop using bitcoin as a way to be lazy and get rich by holding it and using it as what it's supposed to be, a currency.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:45:24
considering all the scam-coins popping up I tend to disagree with the later.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:10:18
For someone to fraudulently use your credit card, they have to have cloned it... In other words they had your card in their hands or really close to in order to do that. Your hot wallet wouldnt be safer is someone stole your phone and knew your passphrase.
I'm not saying bitcoin is less safe or that it's more safe, I'm saying that either way, the safety relies on the user.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:55:31
well... that turned neckbeard quick.

The integrity of a judge should never be questionable. Now I dont know if it's only her opinion but if it's a shared point of view around the people following this case, that judge needs to lose her job.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:07:47
to be fair, you wouldnt say that if it was actually a fraudulent charge...

paying tax on something you buy is fine as long as there's a sales tax but not every transaction on the blockchain is a sale. In fact most probably arent.

The latest numbers available for steam are 125 000 000+ users
and if you extrapolate how many peak concurrent users they had with what they have now (8.9 vs 12.5 mil today), that brings it to around 176 000 000 users today. Not contradicting or anything, just adding to your comment.
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:41:46

To be fair, Steam is bigger then PSN and Xbox Live combined. Hell you can throw nintendo users in there for good measure too.

And they're going to be the only ones for at least a year. In 2017 we'll probably see some smartphone chips(Apple, Samsung, etc.), 2018 probably AMD/Nvidia jumping on the 10nm  bandwagon and then ASICs.
TSMC plans to finish it's 10nm factory in late 2016, that means that will all the taping, optimizations and what not, we wont be seeing 10nm from TSMC until late 2017. That's for important partners.

limiting yourself to only soccer jerseys limits the likeliness of getting a sale in btc. The big country that has the most btc merchants/atm is Canada  and among the top 10 are the USA, Finland and Australia. Not exactly big soccer countries.
In Canada, There's hockey and then there's summer sports. Notice how I didnt mention ice hockey? That's cause it's a given. The USA has the NFL(US Football)/MLB(baseball)/NBA(basketball)/NHL(ice hockey) and then the MLS (soccer)
