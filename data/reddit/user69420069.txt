Manipulation is lately used like god was used in the past if something unpredicted happens u don’t have to wait long until someone screams manipulation but in the end some moves could also be explained by uncle Rick finding his lost hard wallet from 2009 where he had 100 btc on, selling 50 because he needs more heroin

A currency can not be under or overvalued it is not a company with income sheets and physical stuff attached to it 
A currencys price is mainly moved by
 big banks (market makers) 
Trading Bots
Retail Investors 
Miners 
BTC is not a company or a stock

Looks like bullflag to me also orderbooks are thin on the sell side (looking at Kraken) 
My long is set lets see how it plays out 
Also all red candles on the 4h chart have nearly no volume... are the bulls going for a push here ?? 
Still long term bearish sentiment for the next months as older crypto bear markets lasted for 2 years on average

First of all u can use Bitpanda and deposit with PayPal takes like 5 min to do 
Also u can just deposit a few more bucks on whatever crypto platforms u want to use.
If u want to buy a cup of coffee with your credit card u usually also deposit more the then 3 bux on your bank acc. 
And if you would have deposited on a different day u might have walked away with the product and a extra 7 bux on your acc
