It has gone down for 12 months.. how does that solve the conundrum? The point of the post is to say that if you talked up BTC as an investment last year, you look like a fool this year – and if you invested in BTC once a month, you would still look like a fool.. look at the graph..
I swear this is some gamblers anonymous type logic.

Woah, this is super cool. Thread 5 is awesome 
"1, 2, and 4 exist in the staff forum. 3 was permanently deleted at some point (it must have contained Satoshi's real name and address)."

WSJ, Bloomberg, and many others are regurgitating nasty bad no good poo poo lies that China is banning exchanges. It's just a pack of lies, since any news that's bad for Bitcoin must be a lie. Fuck fake news. No good, stinky poop fake news. One big nasty lie fabricated to hurt US
