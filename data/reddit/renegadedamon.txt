Yeah fair enough. I may give that service a test run though, as I am not American. Thanks.

As a Canadian, I'm glad to say I don't need to deal with this bullshit.

I gotta say this recent downfall actually has be buying into bit coin and mining it (x11 mulitpools) with everything I have.
Bit coin isn't going anywhere, it's the flagship of a people made currency that (if supported enough) can replace the bank and government currencies. If not just to make a little cash on this I'm buying into it with my drinking money to support a cause.
Remember folks, don't use cash on this is you can't afford to lose it. At the very least mine it with multipools, x11 has a crazy mine/exchange rate on BTC atm because of this lil dip.

I bought a hashlett at one point as a test run, the amount of aggravation to get it started was unbearable and took days. They also didn't honor they're "Your mining in 24 hours or your order is free" pledge that was posted on their sub and deleted it after. Once mining I cut my losses and re-sold the miner, however they don't allow more than a max total of withdraws  a day from the site, so it took me quite a long time just to get the coins back into my wallet off the website.
TLDR; This company in my personal experience is nothing but a scam and should be perma banned.
