Someone post the article, it’s a soft paywall.

File complaints with the CFPB, FTC, the banking regulators where Coinbase is based out of, SEC, everyone. Start making legal complaints. He’ll, depending on the amount, take legal action and charge them interest and depreciation on assets.

God you’re fucking retarded. Substitute stock for asset, still requires paying taxes. Seems simple minded people will get rekt by tax man.

Don’t forget to tell her to set aside 20% for tax man. Yes I understand that’s more than long term captains gains tax rate, but better to have a buffer than be wrong.
Say $800 to 11k.
20% is 2k

Do yourself a favor. It’s called google, is it. Google “Taxable Gains on Inherited or Gifted Stocks”, and then go sit in timeout.

Judging Intensifies!!!!

And Trump just said it should be banned. One hand doesn’t like talking with the other.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:08:59
No, you need to do all the leg work.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:31:48
Nope, long term gains still apply. Tax man always gets his cut.

Someone wanting out...

If this is true, can you provide the emails stating this? You should have received an email for every update made to the ticket.
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:34:13
Do you have the email where they said they would pay 0.5? Otherwise, you won't have much leg to stand on.

And gold and silver.

No. They can call customer service and pretend to be you.
@_date: 2019-08-08 11:44:15
Nah fam. You can still use it, but use alpha-numeric and some special case.

Orrrrrr, you could just get a Masters of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Digital Currency either through your course work or Thesis research.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:02:24
Don’t look at it from dollar value, but BTC value.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:13:02
That's what I'm planning to do; MS in Computer Science with thesis research focusing on blockchain/digital currency. Now to win the lottery to pay for it.

I thought GBTC has a premium even higher, closer to 20%.

@_date: 2015-09-07 02:00:54
How may of those people do Bitcoin though? If I was to throw a dart into a dark room with a wall full of random percentages, I'd say 10%.
@_date: 2015-09-07 02:24:12
Hey, I was just throwing a dart into a dark room, that's what it landed on.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:51:16
@_date: 2015-09-07 01:59:36
Let's write one! Could be a topic for Master's Thesis or Dissertation.
@_date: 2015-10-08 00:22:26
Yes and no. You must explicitly state you are invoking your right to remain silent, otherwise your silence can be used against you.

That would require SEC approval
