Saving face is extremely important in China. Most Chinese would never dare to admit defeat publicly and would rather go down with the ship.

You are not alone. I feel like I am in the same position, even though I am not nearly near being able to retire. I always imagined buying a new computer, car or home once I had enough bitcoin accumulated. A lot of good and bad things have happened to me, my familt and my friends since I purchased my first bitcoin. Now that they are actually worth a significant sum of money, I realize that I've become much less obsessed with wealth and that I don't need any of these assets to be happy. True happiness is having wonderful friends, family and being financially independent. If a new car is what you want, get it. If not, chearish what you've already got in life.

This is pretty much how it works yes, but you're still thinking in traditional methods of payment. I think LN can be so much more than a replacement for cash. It is a network exceptionally suitable for micropayments. Why would you ever want to pay a monthly electricity bill if you could just pay a few sats for a kWh (or Wh even) as you need it. Prices could be pegged to demand/supply on a per minute basis. Netflix and Spotify could bill me per episode or per track. My employer could pay me daily for the hours I put in that day. 
That is the power of LN, a decentralized internet of money.
