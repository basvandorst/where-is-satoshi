I know, and I agree. I know that world is not made to be fair. But causing a network outage on Bcash to trigger EDA for lower difficulty is really nasty. It's a "destructive" way of making profit. Don't get me wrong, I think BCH is total piece of shit and hope it dies soon, but still seeing miners real way of thinking is interesting.

ViaBtc gave birth to brainfart called BCH and now they are closing the site. Thanks -.-
p.s. I know they still have mining operational, but they introduced it to their exchange first.

I have no idea what you are talking about, but I guess you writing it here makes you feel better and that's enough :)

Basically he says, which we already knew was true, that spam attacks earlier this year were organised by few mining pools to inflate fees and artificially create urgency for scaling.

Yeah, I bet people in Venezuela are super happy with their paper money.

Does anyone have some technical info on this? Script examples?

This is going to be a big mistake. Just hold.

Give them a bit more time. I'm not saying you are not right, but you have to understand that those services are really under a lot of work load. I would wait up to 3 days for each response.

This is only if you watch for trend line support point. General trend line doesn't touch 3000 anymore at all.

Totally misleading title. It was never reported like that.

IMO, Bitcoin has no marketing plan. Being on the news because of the China bans is great marketing :) There is no such thing as bad marketing, and it's free. Regards to the price, if China bans it, some other country will buy back making it even more distributed because at the moment mayor hodlers are in China. My point being, everything is fine, enjoy the ride.

Sold everything and bought more BTC.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Price is affected heavily by news at the moment.

Very nice article! Really nice summary.

+1 Bad idea.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:47:56
Maybe a better idea would be starting a business and doing something useful. Something, for which people would pay you. This is just begging.

The thing that leaves me confused is ... Roger is already a multimillionaire. Why doesn't he enjoy life or start a company or something creative, yet he is selling this bullsh**it. I guess he is not that stupid to know that this would never work, yet why he keeps wasting his time on BCH. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:00:49
"According to reports ...". That sounds like a really reliable source. Anyways, it was just Coinhako and they already switched to a new bank. Everything is ok.

I really admired Jordan for pulling all the sh**t that he did. After hearing him say that, I'm kinda disappointed. Actually if he played pump and dump game with altcoins it would be the same what he did with penny stocks. The difference is, pumping altcoins and trading on inside information is not illegal in crypto :)

Wow you are correct. They have 0% hashrate now. If they are doing this intentionally to trigger EDA this is even more f**ek up then I thought. Miners don't care about bitcoin or bcash or transactions, it's only profit. As much profit as possible no matter the damage or effect. I'm soooo happy that I cashed out on bch so early.
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:11:16
When he refereed to bitcoin as  ... creating money out of thin air. And how are dollars made? The goverments are the ones that are creating all the made up de and inflation.

I really wonder what would happen if China really banned bitcoin mining. At least we would be free from Bitmain, also I guess nobody would mine Bcash as well. Would be fun.
