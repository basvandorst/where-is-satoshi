That makes sense. Sure. But he never had to actually steal it in the first place...
@_date: 2014-06-28 09:17:15
I would be extremely mad, not thanking you. Done everything I can to report this activity.
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:29:15
Are you kidding me? Shove you  anarchist "our government steals our money", selfish ideas up your hole, buddy. This guy HAS NO RIGHT to touch other people's money. You keep denying what should be obviously done. Make tons of announcements. Once that's done, if you don't move your money your dumb and you deserve to lose it. End of story. It's not some Robin hoods responsibility to decide the fate of your 20k. The police does not steal money. They can't. They would be in trouble on so many levels you made your anarchist little self sound so ignorant. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:48:59
I understand the situation, and thank you for explaining it even more clearly, but the thing is. btcrobinhood is depending on the fact that the person will report it stolen. And IF that happens, he needs to watch EVERY POST on for the next few days. He can easily miss it I think. And I would praise him 100% if he, for example in your example, took the money out of the car and immediately walked it to the police station where itll remain safe. This just seems like a very un-systematic, and un-dependable way of going about business like this  and that btcrobinhood might have been stealing and not giving back. Just seems super shady. He literally ruined someone's day instead of just exposing the exploit more peacefully. Looks like a huge, overdone stunt, that was reckless and unnecessary. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:21:43
Your so full of yourself, I'm not going to read that last 2 paragraphs. ONE INCIDENT. You found ONE INCIDENT where something happend. I'm not even going to bother reading it. I'm not supporting my argument because this isn't fucking debat club, buddy. Basic morals. I never said expose the keys on the announcement. Make a ton of announcements telling those with brainwallet keys to switch em. Easy and simple. And "deserving" to lose may have been the wrong wording. I'm saying that if you don't take security measures to protect your btc, your opening new lines of attack. He wasn't being a good samaritan. Not at all. He didn't bother making a post. He said he steals tons of minuscule amounts that actually do add up (0.1, 0.01 btc) and never gives them to anybody. That achieves nothing. And this man makes other thief more inclined to steal by you praising him. Also, he simply saw a claim and returned it. There is nothing to show that this was his original game plan. Cut the bs man. A crook is a crook. And if you touch my 20k, you will be in big trouble. I don't need no btc robin hood's help. Everyone warns each other, and takes care of their own btc and everybody will be fine. Shove your vigilantism and your anarchistic beliefs up your ass buddy. Only reason you and me are here is because we are protected by our government. Don't judge every police force because of one example. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:19:08
But what if he never found the owner? I'm appalled at how nobody here seems to find the fact that he stole them as a problem....
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:11:43
Exactly what happend to me! Sure, maybe acts like a group of 5 year olds, but they are welcoming and answer questions. I come to try to browse regularly, then this happens. Every time. I'm a rational, active user in any community I'm in. This sort of behavior makes me not want to be here. We want to go mainstream... now imagine seeing on the news that we supported a thief. Just plain dumb.
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:31:13
Ok, but does noticing a wide open door give you the right to run in and steal? And as to your first question, I said already. Make a sticky on simply make a post, spread it to crypto news outlets. Because I care about my coins, I at least keep up with the general news to know if I should be worried.
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:47:34
And what does that achieve? This makes absolutely no sense. There is no guarantee that someone will actually steal it if that person doesn't. Why not just tell the person? Why not report it? What in the actual hell does stealing it then possibly giving it back do? You guys are literally delusional. Imagine doing this in real life. Open your eyes. This guy didn't just take the money then immediately return it to prove a point. He stole it, saw it was reported, then gave it back. He stole 20,000 DOLLARS. OPEN YOUR EYES. IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THIS SITUATION.
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:31:22
Thank you for being rational! Can't stand this people here that don't understand the most basic breach of moral conduct. A crook is a crook. End of story. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:32:51
Fantastic, then the  owner should have noticed if he cared. If he has 20k and hasn't noticed, then he deserves to potentially lose it. Not for some Robin hood to decide his fate. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 22:13:45
Yes, absolutely! But for the most part the community seemed a lot more appealing to newcomers and someone who wants to ride "the next big thing" if that even is/was possible.
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:34:24
Erm, so if someone broke into your house then later came back and returned it AFTER you reported it, you would be happy and call them some savior? I feel like I'm the only one with rational thinking here.
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:32:06
Good bye. Good luck going on throughout your life supporting crooks. It'll turn around and stab you in the back. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:25:16
So why should we continue? Why not make an actual announcement instead of continuing the vicious circle and robbing people?
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:55:30
I was on mobile and really tired so I coulnd't explain much, sorry about that. I recommend looking at multi-pools and decent budget alt-coin mining rigs. The coins are smaller, and newer so difficulty is lower, and more chance to make something. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:32:19
nope. im not. he got really lucky. i dont like the fact that it was SUPPORTED that this guy purposely steals and then thinks he has the right to be admired like some savior.
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:24:46
That's better than simply getting it stolen. But all of you are dodging the 2 most basic problems here. 
 The BTC has/had a chance of not being ever stolen anyway. 
 Why did he have to steal it? Send an announcement, to reddit, to the site, anywhere. If you care enough about your btc you'll follow the announcements and warnings. That's what I do. If you don't care enough to do that, you probably are asking to lose it.
Explain why it's necessary that he stole it? Why not just a warning? Or a "nice threat"? Like... If you don't move these I'll prove I can take them...
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:59:18
No. At the time, he simply robbed this guy. This discussion is over, because your denying a fact. He robbed. I don't care why he did it. He didn't have to. That wasn't even the best way to raise awareness.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:42:18
Haha, no I know, I just didn't want to come off as rude or pretentious. :P Good luck! Feel free to ask with any questions.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:28:39
Thank you for actually answering my request. Now how about I tell you this. You have 20k in bitcoin. You obviously care about it. Why don't we all use online wallets? We know they're unsafe. How? News, websites, reddit, etc. So why not do that? Just post it up everywhere. Theif won't have enough time by the time everyone leaves. And if your dumb enough to have 20k in btc and not listen to a huge security hole in where it's stored /how its stored /it was created then you don't deserve that 20k. And once again. There was a TREMENDOUS chance the theif would of not seen his post, or he would of not posted at all and this guy walks off with 20k.
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:27:02
My exact situation. It seemed like a much easier coin and it was easier to try mining with GPUs. I follow all cryptocurrencies now, but that's just how it seemed months ago. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:20:53
Filthy Peasant.
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:05:22
Because everyone on doesn't want to do any explaining when it just takes a little thought, I'll step in. Mining Bitcoin at this point to actually do it well, takes a pretty large investment. An easier alternative would be to look into alt-coin mining and convert everything to Bitcoin. I'll  leave you to your research now. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 09:25:00
If there have been announcements and they don't listen, leave it at that. This guy keeps a lot of what he steals and he steals it SOMETIMES POSSIBLY with the intention of returning it. Just don't steal it in the first place. What I mean is those crazy guys who never plan on returning it are lost causes and that btc is gone. But this guy, he's right here. We can stop him. But we don't. We encourage him. morons.
@_date: 2014-06-28 09:30:46
your mum must have had some problems raising you. you support crooks. so what the btc would have been stolen? they guys could have moved the money out. if they didnt listn to the announcements then oh well, give them some time then its gone. not this good samaritan shit. the cops dont steal a lot of money. get your little bs out of here. your nerdy ass spends time formatting these little quotes  and paragraphs and shit. whatever man just protect your btc and fuq off
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:18:22
How do they have the moral right to do that? Why is the guy being gilded for that? He just stole his coins! I get the idea and all, but how is the original owner "at debt to him" if the guys purposely stole the btc, then just gave it back. By the way, how did he give it back cause all he did was paste a transaction from the original wallets to the owner's different wallet. What is going on here? The funds were hidden or something, then he uncovered them and sent them? I am so confused...
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:25:14
great... but that has nothing to do with what I'm say... Like I said here...
"That's better than simply getting it stolen. But all of you are dodging the 2 most basic problems here.

 Why did he have to steal it? Send an announcement, to reddit, to the site, anywhere. If you care enough about your btc you'll follow the announcements and warnings. That's what I do. If you don't care enough to do that, you probably are asking to lose it.

Also, sure we depend on somebody not generating the same private key or whatever as we did... But PURPOSELY brute forcing wallets. That's gotta be illegal on some scale. Knowingly taking someone's money has got to be illegal.
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:35:26
It is relevant if it would have been stolen. There wouldn't have been all of this. But let's ignore that.
So because there is a hole in the security we ignore it? It seems this is the only way of fixing it. To make an announcement. Why would you just leave the hole open and let more and more people get robbed? That leaves us with MORE casualties in the end. And that logic just doesn't make sense.
Ok, and what do you do when you see a wallet on the street? You pick it up. Check the name. It has IDENTIFICATION. Try to find the person. Can't do that? Bring it to the police station. Someone who isn't some random hacker off the internet. These are safe people who will guard your wallet and will look for you. These people know to call the cops. Not this. This is completely different. What he did, has pick up the wallet. Walk home. And wait. He happened to hear someone ask about a wallet, and then gave it to them. He does not have the right to take matters into his own hands and dictate what people do with THEIR money.

Although I do agree that Dorian Nakamoto probably isn't Satoshi Nakamoto, couldn't both just be lying? Wouldn't you do that in this situation? And this account could be fake. I'm really not sure though.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:31:05
Like I already said. Put notices everywhere. Reddit, websites, crypto news. Literally EVERYWHERE. And it works. Why don't we all use online wallets for huge amounts? Because we know it's unsafe from the listed methods above. Just apply that. I don't know what kind of morals you have, but no matter what the situation is, if you are not a family member, or a friend with explicit permission, you don't touch my stuff. I would of taken my btc back from this guy and reported him and done all I could. He is a theif. Period. No negotiations here. He did not SHOW a security hole. He exploited it and took money without the knowledge of the rightful owner. Simple. Rules. And. Morals.

Yes, I'm familiar with open source and github. Isn't evey submission reviewed by a team of (should be) highly skilled, careful, and hopefully unbiased team of coders? Clearly less organized and less people than a proper government or company though, so they could plan some sort of scheme possibly?
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:05:33
Wow, that's a lot to work with. Thank you! Some good points in here I didn't think of.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:51:25
50k a day is the plenty isn't it? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:56:32
Perfect, thanks. It really does seem hard. Maybe overtime, but it is a good bit more confusing than credit cards, and even those there are people who don't want to use.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:17:59
Perfect, thank you! The ability of each service and how many transactions per second it can handle really puts some perspective into it.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:14:42
At least u get your full amount that u paid for. And isn't the limit like $30,000 a week? That's pretty high. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:15:37
Ah, alright thanks. I must have misread your comment because I assumed you were hinting at the fact that bitcoin is a "perfect currency." I'll go look now hopefully some good stuff in there.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:57:58
Markets is a good one, it seems like a lot of trust around Bitcoin is based in a couple companies.
What do you mean by the first point?


Kind of makes sense, but wondering if you've got any specifics.
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:35:29
Idk about circle but I'm pretty sure coin base locks in ur transfer  and takes out the same amount of money u agreed to and give u the same amount of bitcoin. If u bought 0.9 btc for 200 bucks, and a week later 0.9 would cost more or less, they still only take 200 and give u the full 0.9.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:40:57
Can you expand on that. What exchange? what's wrong with coinbase? etc
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:51:22
Does that show actual downsides or just stuff people think are downsides that's debunked? I'm looking for actual, real, arguable downsides, there are some to everything. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:48:38
Is there a way to raise your instant buy limits after adding a card? 
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:14:46
At least u get your full amount that u paid for. And isn't the limit like $30,000 a week? That's pretty high.

Yah you have to use the right currency lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:21:17
Does this mean 100% bullshit free betting? No names, addresses, state residence  checks, etc.?
No requirement to bet 3x your original deposit or any other silly games or catches?
Just deposit, bet as much as you like, and withdraw as much as you like when you want?
Thanks in advance.
