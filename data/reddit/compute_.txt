So there's no way for them to track someone down who is using a decentralized network?
That's awful IMO, I know governments  can get in the way but the FBI has helped in so many cases of child porn and it *is a really awful thing* and denying that poses an ethical question.

Let's be real here; I understand your argument, but explain to me this: Certain things are avoidable, and have been for years. Why do we have to change that?

Gotcha, it's like a stock market, you can wait for it to try to increase in value, otherwise selling it is a loss.

Maybe that site is inaccurate, but thanks for sharing, anyways!
Did you program it?

WOW, cool! :) Lemme set up a bitcoin account! :)

Thank you! The folks here are really nice :)

Yeah, I'm a novice to Bitcoin but it seems like the main points of investments are the returns and the monetary value in there, and if we want to be honest as much as we agree with Bitcoin's philosophies it does have some issues there.

I think as the adoption rate of bitcoin increases people might have more reason to join it, as a lot of people say they're advantages.

but there isn't?

Damn, you're nice! :) This is the last time I'll beg for Bitcoin *(promise)*, but this whole thing goes to prove that the community here *is* super cool.
I have a quick question, though: other people here say that they lost bitcoin from last year. Did you encounter the same problem? 
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:03:26
Damnit, I would have liked that bitcoin :P
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:28:32
Yeah! That looks promising!
