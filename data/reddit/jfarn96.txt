I still am wondering why there was a 181 sat/b difference between what I set and what it actually was

The 2x fork never happened, I'm assuming you're referring to segwit. In which case yes, use the segwit chain. Segwit and legacy are still the same coin, only difference is that segwit should have lower fees and is hopefully a part of fixing our scaling solutions

You want to do a limit order, higher or lower is up to you, just pick a number a penny away from the current price if you want it right then and it should fill

Simply hit "Withdraw" on the left side where your BTC total is displayed, then choose "BTC Address". If you don't know already, go back to your blockchain wallet, click request, and copy and paste the address that shows up back to your GDAX destination spot

I'm not arguing for or against buying the dip, I'm pointing out the irony in your post. Yes, most people probably don't know what they're doing, but neither do you or I. Why are you so upset with people using this strategy and being excited when the value goes up??
