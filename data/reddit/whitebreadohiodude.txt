Dollars can’t fork, the majority of miners is the US gobernment

If you own bitcoin you entrust a bevy of miners to verify the next has and keep BTC rolling. Thats what gives it value. But say some miner gains 51% of the mining power then uses that power to control the price.
If you own US dollars you can still redeem them theoretically in US government services.

Everytime a ledger of transactions has to be verified they are combined with the previous cryptographic hash, the essence of bitcoin is that the miners have to guess what the next hash with be. This is an energy intensive process that becomes exponentially more energy intensive as more transactions are added to the ledger.
People have tried to modify the BTC equation to make the process more streamlined and less costly for the consumer. Usually these efforts boil down to a hard fork that doesn’t stick. It does undermine what value bitcoin has as a result of mass adoption. 
Really the solution is a cryptographic currency like Iota or Etherium.  In the meantime I plan on riding the BTC wave and updating my Stop Loss Sale price every few days.

sounds like bitcoin hasn’t achieved parity with conventional fiat currency in terms or liquidity and shouldn’t be treated as such
at this point its more of a tool for speculation- and whats worse.. it has no inherent value

Yeah right

Does anyone know how reliable stop loss selling is in a situation like this? Like if I put a stop sell order in to GDAX will the order trigger near my stop price? 
Also what happens if there is a run on the bank type situation happening with Coinbase? I don’t think the bank is insured by the FDIC is it?

What timeframe are we working with here? Everything becomes worthless eventually
