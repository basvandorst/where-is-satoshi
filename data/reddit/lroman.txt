You can use Bisq to buy directly from a seller.  Private, secure, the way Bitcoin is supposed to be.

That’s the problem with centralised platforms. Be it a bank, twitter or Youtube.. You have to follow their rules.  They decide who they switch off.  
A distributed platform can’t switch people off. An alternative, if you want to be social, could be Mastodon, tho not completely distributed, it’s federated. You can run your own node also. Anyway it wil take time before we will be without centralised institutions.

Well it’s actually one of the 22 ideas workers of the bank had. They are still doing feasibility studies, so no Rabo wallet yet. Title is way too suggestive.

Bitcoin is backed by thousands of machines, energy, software, people and the community as s whole. 
Dollars are backed by corrupt banks and politicians.
