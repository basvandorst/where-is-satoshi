In theory, buying treasuries lowers interest rates, encouraging the government to take on more debt.
Of course, buying $10k in treasuries won't exactly move the market, so it's pretty far fetched that you or I could actually make the government borrow more.
Edit: Forgot about the fed's target interest rate. That makes it pretty much impossible for market forces to change treasury rates.

I give a bank my 1000 BTC to open a savings account. They keep 100 (to comply with the 10% reserve rate) and send 900 to my friend Alice after approving her for a mortgage. Alice pays her 900 to Bob , who built the house. He takes his money and deposits it back into the bank. They keep 90, and lend out the 810. That gets deposited elsewhere, where they keep 81 and lend out another 729.
So on and so forth, until there are a total of 10,000 BTC in deposits but only 1,000 in reserves.

The problem is finding credit-worthy borrowers, not secure lenders.
The mention of "rich friends" above refers to the fact that without a trusted credit rating system, the only people who would be willing to lend you money are your friends, and the only friends who can lend you money are the ones who have money to begin with.
As already mentioned, BTC doesn't change much about the problem of proving to lenders that you are safe to lend to.

They proved HSBC services were used to launder money. They haven't proven that they knew their services were being used to launder money, only that they didn't properly follow banking regulations that may have caught the laundering.

Sorry, I kinda went off topic, let me see if I can rephrase my point more clearly.
My definition of "saving" is doing anything with money that doesn't decrease your net worth. Hoarding and investing are two such things. People who demonize hoarding aren't saying you shouldn't be saving, they're saying you should be investing rather than hoarding.
If you argue that hoarding bitcoin is still a form of investing, that's another debate entirely.

That part's great, and obviously BTC has other great advantages over cash. That doesn't change the fact that your average home PC is not exactly a shining example of good computer security practices, and a BTC wallet doesn't collect interest any faster than a pile of dollar bills.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:28:56


Sorry, no. Hoarding and saving are not the same thing, hoarding is just one thing to do with money you don't spend. The other thing you can do is *invest*, and most people would agree that using capital to create more value is better than using it to speculate on the future value of a non-productive commodity.

The bank can pay me interest. I deposit 1 BTC now, and I get back 1.01 BTC when I withdraw it a year from now. If I don't need to use the money for a year, why wouldn't I want a free 0.01 BTC?

I *send my bitcoin* to the bank's bitcoin address. Just like depositing cash from my leather wallet, my BTC has left my digital wallet and gone into the possession of the bank. The bank doesn't have to "create" any money.

That's a good point, I didn't give the whole story. In theory it is an infinite process, but it isn't a "runaway" cycle.
Let's assume we're in America where we have a ["Reserve Requirement"]( of 10%. In that case, the Bank would be able to lend Bob $900 of Alice's $1000, keeping just $100 in the vault.
Bob would most likely deposit that money into another bank account (at the same bank or a different one, doesn't make a difference). The bank will take Bob's $900 and lend out another $810 to somebody else. They'll deposit their  money, and their bank will lend out another $729, and so on.
The total amount of money "created" in this process is $900 + $810 + $729 +... This is the geometric series $1000*(0.9^1 + 0.9^2 + 0.9^3 + 0.9^4 +...), which has the very finite sum of $9000. Since they probably won't be lending out fractions of pennies (after 109 deposit/loan cycles, the amount the bank will have available to lend will be less than once cent), the total sum will be reduced by a few dollars thanks to rounding errors, but the $9000 is the theoretical maximum.

The value of btc is determined entirely by market forces. It can inflate or deflate wildly as people adopt or drop it.
The fed now does what they can to maintain a ~2% inflation rate. Losing 2% of your cash per year is lame, but at least it's predictable. Can't say that about bitcoin. Besides, if you have enough money that losing 2%/year is a major problem, you're probably going to be invested in something other than cash.

They don't have to post your address on the youtube video. They could post their own address and take a percentage before paying you. Or they could let people load up a bitcoin balance and tie it to +1s, so people could make tips more conveniently, kinda like the bots here on reddit.

An emergency or rainy-day fund is insurance against job loss and other unexpected expenses. This "product" has actual value because it reduces the risk of having to take on high-interest credit card debt, or having to pay for a motel room because you got evicted and don't have the cash on hand for a security deposit on a normal apartment.
An emergency fund usually consists of 6-12 months' of your expenses. If you have more than that you run into the problem of diminishing returns, where having extra insurance does not give you enough ROI to cover the interest or investment returns you're missing out on. That's why having 1% of the entire currency is completely different from having a small amount of savings.

Sorry, I don't understand your question. What do you mean by "it's ok?"
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:19:16
I thought you and were asking for an explanation of where "normal savings" ends and "currency hoarding" begins. I was just trying to explain how to calculate how much cash savings an average person benefits from.
6-12 months' of expenses is the mostly commonly recommended size of an emergency fund because people have tended to find that anything more is not worth the investment returns you miss out on by holding cash. 1% of all bitcoins was the figure cited like 6 comments up, it was just an example of an unnecessarily large amount of cash savings.
I'm not telling people they have to save that much, I'm just saying that's how much savings is generally useful. Obviously individuals will have their own circumstances.

They pay fees to financial institutions whenever somebody uses it (except for ACH transfers I guess, but those take forever and are susceptible to fraudulent charge reversals). Those fees probably cut into profits more than bitcoin fees would.

I'm pretty skeptical that incompetence is so obviously a crime. It might be if you're a bank, or a part of the establish payment processing system (e.g. failing to adhere to PCI standards when processing CC transactions), but  it seems like bitcoin isn't really part of the same legal framework.

That's not how FRB works. Banks can loan more than they have in *reserves*, but they can't loan more than they have in *deposits*. Except for the fed, banks can't create dollars out of thin air.
Here's how FRB works:
Alice gives the bank $1000. In return, she gets a bank statement showing that she can withdraw up to $1000. The bank turns around and lends $800 to Bob, and keeps $200 in their vaults. The bank didn't create any money out of thin air, they just lent out a portion of their reserves. This is enough to make it *seem like* they created money, because Alice thinks she has $1000, and Bob has $800 too, for a total of $1800. (Per financial regulations, the bank can't do anything with that $200, so it doesn't get double counted like Bob's $800.)
You can do exactly the same thing with bitcoin.

This is an aside, but yes, that's why I put in the "when used responsibly" caveat. I don't deny that consumer debt has caused problems, but I think with proper regulation and education, it can be a force for good.
Regarding your main counterpoint, I think we're talking about two slightly different issues. My main point is that deflation turns cash into a fairly attractive investment. This makes people less likely to invest in or lend to businesses, thus slowing economic growth.
As I understand it, your argument is deflation makes equity more useful than debt. You're saying that as long as people switch from bonds to stocks, the economy will keep humming along as usual, right? Please correct me so I don't accidentally put words in your mouth.

Just like with dollars, banks could offer better security and interest. A btc wallet is more analogous to a physical wallet than you think.

No, that's not how fractional reserve lending works. Banks lend many times what they hold onto in cash (or federal reserve credit), but their total loans are still less than their total deposits.

It's not hard, it's just not much easier than it is with dollars. You'll just have to transfer btc to your bank when you make a deposit, and have them transfer some back to you when you want to withdraw.

Sorry, I didn't mean to say that they would be inversely proportional, just that there would be effects other than the growth rate of the economy that would change the value of cash, making the gdp growth and money supply growth rates unequal enough to refute the initial assumption of point.
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:52:58
A company takes your money in exchange for more value later, unless they ~~default~~ go out of business. It acts a lot like debt. 
Even if you still disagree and maintain that equity is fundamentally a different thing, I don't think it detracts from my larger point.
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:14:58
I'll take a stab at what appears to be your main point: Yes, deflation is bad even if there's no deflationary spiral.


Investment dollars need to be available in order for the economy to grow at anything more than a snail's pace. Most large companies wouldn't have been able to grow nearly as quickly as they did if they had to bootstrap themselves entirely on their own profits. Instead, outsiders invested in those companies, allowing them to hire more people and buy more raw materials sooner rather than later, allowing them to grow bigger and sooner. Investment is just somebody else's debt.
There are various companies out there. Some might predict a 5% return on investment, while some might offer 20%. Since cash gives you a -2% ROI, both companies are likely to receive funding. If we all held bitcoin, and that gets you an automatic 10% return, only some of those companies would receive funding. The others will stagnate or even shut down, leading to fewer jobs and a lower overall standard of living for the community.
(Consumer debt is often less productive, but when used responsibly, home mortgages, student loans, and auto financing can make people richer in the long run too. If cash has a built-in investment return, those will charge higher interest rates and become less useful.)
If you think bitcoin will always be an alternate currency, rather than a replacement for major currencies, that's harder to argue against. That almost means it's competing with Paypal, not the U.S. dollar.
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:31:41


That assumes that the cash supply grows exactly as fast as the economy, but that's not so obvious to me. Won't a booming economy also lead people to dump cash in favor of stocks, reducing, rather than increasing the value of a bitcoin? Won't an economy with a growing population require more cash, even if the gdp is stagnant or falling?
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:16:22


The federal government will mostly likely never accept tax payments in bitcoin. Other than that though, yeah there's nothing stopping people from using it. 
I wasn't arguing that people *won't* adopt bitcoin, just that there are macroeconomic reasons we shouldn't want them to.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:32:31
That's not really what I was saying, but yes, that's true too. Anybody with a mortgage and retirement savings at the same time is effectively using debt to finance investment. Hell, anybody with just a mortgage is using debt to finance investment in the house itself.
If your debt charges you 3% interest, and you get 6% returns from investing, you're raking in free money.
