I believe most of the larger sites allow for credit card purchase, though I'm not sure if you would still have to verify ID. I know that No Limit Coin (NLC2), a project I work with creating a fantasy sports platform, recently allowed for direct purchase via MC/Visa though. I know some alts also have allowed you to buy in via PayPal during ICOs but I'm guessing that's not going to be helpful for now.

What is the withdraw problem? Right now the network is completely clogged and YoBit is known for taking wallets offline, similar to how Coinbase and GDAX will have "service interruptions" where you can get on. Give it some time and you'll be able to move it off. YoBit isn't my favorite, but I've had high volumes both to and from it numerous times and they always work out.

Bitcoin means something different to everyone. You still have your Bitcoin and I still have mine. If you don't like it, you change it or use something else. Bitcoin HAS given "money" back to the people, but it's also going to be used and regulated in mainstream circles and a lot of people want and maybe even need that.

Thanks for the reply Kyle!

Thanks for this info. I do use my own wallet too but I like to send purchase through coinbase since I can put memos in the purchases so I can track purchases.

Its like this every big swing. Both Coinbase and GDAX both down. Wondering how Gemini is doing. If they stay up then I'm moving over.

What changed so much that I went from always having instant payments (Steam, Private Internet Access, Overstocked) to now 10+ minutes with nothing. At this point the 15 minute sessions aren't enough. 
*EDIT* Lol @ being downvoted for asking a question.

Hmm.... based on this article it seems like the best way is to simply wait as it "could" result in losing your coins. Maybe I'll just suck it up and wait since I'm not planning on selling them or using them at the moment.

Yeah I did last night, thanks.

The rate you bought at.

I believe it depends on your method of payment, though I could be wrong. I use bank ach transfers as well (basically bill pay) and it takes about a week. Whatever price you purchase at, that's what you are locked in at. If they go up, they don't charge you more and likewise if they drop, you don't get a discount. I've never had an issue with them and everything has always gone very smoothly for me. They have a lot more tools now that allow you to easily track ROI and other statistics. I can't speak to their customer support as I've never run in to any issues but I also haven't cashed any out. I believe they also have a trading platform now that allows for faster buys/sells assuming you have verified money in the account, like BTC-E but I haven't used it.

I started my "buying process" on Nov 27 with coinbase, Mtgox and btce. I verify all of my info the moment I can. As of this post my first purchase with coinbase is still pending, my ccard is waiting to verify with coinbase and mtgox and btce haven't reviewed my info yet. 
So with regards to going the "traditional and trusted" routes, it is quite slow and tedious.

Took a total of 13 days total but I'm now all setup. It was a pain to be verified but not be able to purchase when they hit $500 this past week since the first time you can only have 1 purchase pending at a time.

I'm in the same boat. "Transaction pending" is killing me!

Finally got everything all set up today. Tested sending to my phone's wallet from coinbase app on the phone and it worked like a charm. Pretty stoked.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:16:56
Yeah I understand the reasoning behind it... it was just a pain watching prices drop out and not be able to purchase any since the first time you can only have 1 purchase pending. Everything's all set now and I'm looking forward to getting more.
