What even is happening with Bitcoin?? Why now?
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:26:17
What's the importance of that? (sorry, newbie here)

I was about to cut my losses but will stay put, trusting the prophecy.

Poor bulls

I could say that I'll buy for a relative, but the truth is that I'm the one who probably need this the most!

@_date: 2019-10-07 13:35:11
I want to believe.

What's the connection between Bitcoin and that girl? Why are people on the btcommunity memeing her?
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:53:13
Yeah, but when you need 4 years to get some profits it is not a sign that maybe is not that of a hype train anyways?
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:58:45
Looking forward to it!
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:33:14
That's amazing!

After this [random drop]( out of the blue, I seriously doubting this golden future for Bitcoin. It will not crash and burn, but this instability is slightly worrisome.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:20:28
Baller move.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:34:21
Yeah, that's never happening
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:56:05
Member those days where [Bitcoin]( was about to bull the hell of the market?
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:02:23
Insert "Buy bitcoin" cliche comment.

Governments are banging their heads on both buttons at once.

But objectively, why should business and companies try to limit how people buy stuff with them? 
It just limits the amount of people they can reach
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:33:39
it is... not?
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:06:19
I'm still not believing this yet... the formations are not that similar to begin with.
