Genuine question, what is the benefit of setting up a node? Can I make money with this? I have a Raspberry Pi

The higher the balance the more chance of receiving a fee? Or doesnt it work this way

What do you mean with a decent balance? Do I need to put some BTC inside of it?

This is my new Reddit account, been on Reddit for 4+ years. Trust me what is going on is not normal and it is not just the fork thing. It always was like this and it is just getting worse..

Sigh... seems like you are part of the problem. They think exactly the same of this subreddit...

It is seriously just a terrible environment to be in. I would like to stay subscribed for the 'good' post but there are many more bad posts than good and I think it is ruining both communities to be honest.. Literally at this moment this is on the frontpage: 
WHY would anybody vote this to the frontpage. It is sad really...
