Can’t the miner’s have bank accounts overseas say japan, transfer the mined bitcoins to a Japanese exchange , sell their bitcoins into yen, and then send yen back to china by converting into yuan. This is good for chinese economy yes?

If the governments try to stop bitcoin as hard as they try to stop piracy. I am sure bitcoin value will not drop to 0. I am also sure that it will not reach “moon” . In my opinion , Bitcoin needs to find a way to co-exist with governments/ central banks in order to be truly useful, rather than go against and destroy fiat system etc

They really are. But you can’t deny that is probably how they become the second biggest economy in the world so fast though. We might not all agree with their tactics, but it sure is a great way for a nation and it’s people to prosper

I agree. Why do people keep saying they cannot stop bitcoin? If all the govs decide to ban exchanges / mining. Wouldn’t that stop bitcoin ?

Based on my understanding, chinese nationals can only send 50k usd worth of yuan overseas. What i am suggesting now is sending money to china. From japan exchanges./ korea / usa. Which is entirely possible of course as china is probably the biggest exporter of the world
