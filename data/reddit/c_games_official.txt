If a big bank wants to buy my bitcoin, I am willing to depart with it at 1 billion dollars per coin. Until then, they will not buy all the bitcoin because I will still have mine :)

Usually my bitcoin purchases from cash app are immediately transferrable. however you have to upload your info to cash app (drivers license) and it takes about a day to verify and theres a limit of 2500 daily purchase

Some people might consider this a 'dumb' question but I believe there are no dumb questions in a space like this, so I will try to explain why (there might be other people out there afraid to ask these kinds of questions):
Mining bitcoin is essentially trying to guess a 'magic number' (called a nonce) that together with an un-mined 'block' generates a hash that meets certain criteria. If the criteria is met, the block becomes 'mined' and the miner gets 12.5 BTC as a reward. This criteria auto-adjusts its difficulty based on how many 'guesses' are being generated per second. If all the machines out there mining bitcoin are generating a total of 100 quadrillion guesses per second, and your Android device can only perform 100,000 guesses per second then you can see how its like trying to win the every lottery on the planet simultaneously.
What many folks do is join a mining pool, sort of like an office lottery where if one machine finds the magic number they all split the profits. The only problem is that your share of the pie is proportional to how many guesses your machine is making per second, so again your intrepid little Android device will receive only the smallest dusting of the crumbs. For this reason it is likely no one has bothered to develop any decent mining app for Android.

I visit a fair number of farmers markets and I always toyed with the idea of just setting up a 'Ask Me About Bitcoin' booth where every day people can just walk up and ask questions. In my booth I would have a wallet generator and be willing to sell btc (either manually or with a simple raspi atm). Even walking folks through how to set up a btc wallet on cash app would be a good start.
I think the personal touch or talking to a real human about it would help the every day person.

**Dwight:** Try zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.  
**Jim:** No.  
**Dwight:** Okay, now try zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one.  
**Jim:** Okay, I'm not doing every number.

Good luck bro!

I like the idea of promoting it but I also like the idea of not getting robbed or tortured for my private keys...

I 100% agree with this - if you find yourself using words like 'hashing' and 'algorithm' then you've already lost the lay person. My goto explanation is that its like 'amazon gift card credit' except that amazon cannot control it, you can transfer it, and there is only a finite amount so the value is going to go up.
If all else fails, play on their fears: ask questions like 'what would happen if you put 40 bucks in an atm and the machine ate it. you call the bank and they claim it never happened. what is your recourse?' or 'what if you check your bank balance and you're missing 25% of it with no debits appearing in their ledger?'

I found out the gas station down the street had a bitcoin atm. Last week I went down there on my way to lunch to check it out and maybe deposit 40 bucks, and it turns out the rate is displayed in mBTC. I knew that it was going to be a ripoff but was willing to pay a small premium just for the experience. So when it said 0.08 mBTC per dollar I was like 'ok whatever I dont feel like doing math in the middle of this chevron' and put in my 40 bucks.
Later when I was enjoying my hawaiian bbq lunch, I decided to crunch the numbers and nearly choked on my macaroni salad when I realized I essentially bought 40 bucks of btc at 12,000 per coin!
I have no ragrets since I think btc is shooting well beyond 12k per coin, but still that's a helluva premium to pay for anonymity!

You are certainly correct about that :) Not a good way if you want to ensure 100% anonymity

The BTC ATM near me was selling bitcoin at around 12.5k, at a time that the real price was 8.2k so make sure you pay attention to the spread! They try to confuse you by switching the units (i.e. 'X mBits for 1 dollar' instead of 'X dollars for 1 mBit')

I've always wondered what "difficulty" means when expressed this way. From my understanding, block is 'mined' when block header hash is found that is "less than" an 80-byte number. If the difficulty listed here is represented by that 80-byte number, does that mean the number listed becomes 'lower' as difficulty increases?

That website header is pretty dope, not gonna lie!

I kinda see them rejecting the contract for one of three reasons:
1) The nfl team thinks 'bitcoin - thats nerd money, I'm not doing that.'
2) The nfl team might think if he asks for 10k BTC (\~100mil) over 5 years (round numbers as an example) paid out as 2k BTC each year that they will be massively screwed come year 4 or 5
3) They recognize the possible future value of BTC and think the only way is to pre-purchase the 10k BTC, but who wants to front 100mil and store it over 5 years??
Obviously if he has the talent they will bend over backwards to get him, so whats stopping them really? Maybe he should "under value" himself at the outset if he really thinks BTC will grow in value later.

Great video on an interesting incident. Still a little scary that it happened, but maybe thats because I dont understand the exact nature of the bug (something about integer overflow?). Hopefully we will look back on this and laugh heartily!
