It keeps an equal value of BTC and fiat while making small profits at each turn.

Yeah I've been stuck with a little over 170 L$ for a while now. Fees are why I made the chart in case I need some BTC quickly since I haven't set up any trading accounts yet. I understand how irrelevant this is when you get yours from Bitstamp.

Ripple, brought to you by the NSA. Don't bite, you have to give them all your personal info, which they verify against their juicy DB in real time, just to register so that you might be able to get some XRP. It's a clear state-sponsored scam.

I've been using goxtool on a laptop for a while and wanted to host it instead, to keep it running while being able to access it from anywhere. It's not so much about profit than reducing risk and bad decisions. You can use it without the balancer and it still makes a great tool, much better than clicking around trying to buy or sell in panic.
