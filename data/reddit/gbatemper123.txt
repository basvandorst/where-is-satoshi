Agreed. The only people who fantasize pre-democratized ww2 Japan are old right wingers and crazy nationalists.

You talk like most "hackers"  have no fucking clue about bitcoins.
The owners database was found on his hotmail account. Not only do they have his customers paypal account, but probably their IP's, etc. The police could easily find many users, using the just the IP's by just contacting the ISP with subpoenas. 
Hackforums even has a section where they sell and trade various currencies. Many, practically all vendors on that site take bitcoins too. 
Stop trying to hype shit up. The fact is, people use paypal because it's convenient. Bitcoin isn't it. If your buying malaware and the owner's db was compromised, you should be worried if you paid with bitcoins or paypal, regardless.

Yeah, but the previous redditor talked as if it was easy as building a custom PC desktop. It is much harder, that much I can say.

I have a question
What bank is supported by Expresscoin? It is not mentioned what bank is supported, it just means "Preferred bank". 
Does this mean ANY bank is fine? Citibank, BOA, etc
Also, when I try to put in a order, it says their a fee. I am assuming we add the amount we in bitcoin + the fee amount, and we deposit that amount of money?
PhotoID is not required unless I want to order more then 1000$ per month, correct?

Good looking ones become escorts, not hookers. Most of them are also college educated and don't use backpages.

They can just claim the camera/phone looked like a weapon and destroy it. You could try to stream it to cloud though.

Kids could get their hands on heroin easily...But the majority of them would not touch heroin. Why get heroin, when you could get LSD, Shrooms, MDMA, etc.

Even on the street, the poorest, most uneducated kids know how harmful and addictive heroin can be. Many have seen it firsthand themselves. I don't know any kid who would openly "want" heroin without trying it or wanting to sell it .
