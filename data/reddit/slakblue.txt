Greed always brings everyone down. Is that not why everyone ordered from his company? Everyone wanting to get in on the fast money?  Still want to buy an ASIC block? Their building them in China and they are taking over the world. They are even beating the Jews now at greed.

Eobot just [died]( taking my 6 months of paying in to buy bitcoins, and got my original amount back. This Co. deserves to be sued. He walks away with millions in bitcoin money.

No, I invested $400 to buy it. In 5 weeks it has made only $400, but value of btc is now around $400 so anything I make is just topping. I am planning that it will double in less than 4 weeks, maybe even 3 weeks.

not so fast, On Oct 1,2013  I opted for a jalapeno asic miner for $400
and it has more than doubled in price in returns. Its still churns out as part of a pool.

Check [this chart]( for Nov 15, 16 , the market price stayed the same so you quickly got your funds. On the other hand, if you bought during [Nov 6 - 8]( You probably didnt get your funds so quickly . Coinbase plays the market and a simple look at candlestick charts will tell you when to buy and sell
