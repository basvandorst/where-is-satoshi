You don't go to a bank for pocket change. You go to borrow money to buy expensive thinks like cars and houses. Most people don't have the money or legal expertise to do that in a formal way with people you just talked about. You don't go to banks to borrow 10 dollars.

Define productive.

That's what I'm saying. All the speculating causing huge swings in  the value of BTC, make it hard to use as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:42:04
Don't be so naive. Have you been reading about some of the abilities of the NSA when it comes to using the internet and the data that is sent through it to their advantage. It's really impressive.

Neither is deflation good for economies either.

What country are you a citizen of?
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:33:04
He would literally be the one percent. That's one of the reasons why I think bitcoin is a fad and will fail. The level of wealth distribution in bitcoin makes the USA look like a communist paradise by comparison. A good chunk of all bitcoin that will ever exist are owned by an extremely small group and if bitcoin does actually take off, it will make them gods. They would probably become the richest people in history.

What about $250k for a mortgage on a house? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:30:56
Why do you have such a mean attitude?
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:19:26
They can use their massive supply of bitcoins to control the price, much like OPEC and oil.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:55:42
Do you even know what the term "third world" means, if you did you would know that it would be impossible for the USA to be a third world country.

What would be an example of wasteful spending According to you?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:57:53
What is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:52:20
That's assuming bitcoin will have value in the near future, or it is just a fad. Gold has been considered valuable for thousands of years. Bitcoin on the other hand, only came in to existence in 2009.

What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:25:15
Doesn't that consumption drive the advancements in technology. Where would we be in terms of standard of living if we were to go back to a pre-modern capitalist era. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:54:36
Is their really 50 BTC on their? If their was, did you have a drive data recovery expert examine it to see if the data that was on their could be recovered before opening it? You shouldn't have opened or wrote on the disk if it really had data worth that much on it and had multiple backup copies of it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:49:52
Isn't bitcoin supposed to be used for money to buy things. You can't use bitcoin if it's with that much deflation.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:49:17
You are an idiot. Just because he has an opinion on what bitcoin is doesn't make him evil. It's the bitcoin fanatics like you who are the ones spreading misinformation about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:22:12
Yes, They most likely will.
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:11:43
You bitcoin cultist are so arrogant. You people automatically assume that anybody who criticize bitcoin is wrong and a stupid old person who doesn't understand technology. I'm going to enjoy watching bitcoin collapsing and all you people lose your money.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:34:34
...And created a new oligarchy.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:57:27
Couldn't $20 buy a lot more during that time than now? I believe that was when the USD was pegged to a standard price of gold.
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:05:33
That sounds like a really dark future for most people.
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:28:02
That's why you target for low inflation rates. So people have a good idea of what the value will be in the near future. Where as bitcoin is unpredictable and can have its value move huge percentages up or down in less than a day.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:36:05
Not if the drive is damaged to the point the computer can't communicate with it. At that point you then you need an expert in data recovery to see if the data is salvageable. At this point I'm not sure if the data on there can be saved, since he opened the casing and exposed it to the extremely dirty air. Also touching the drive disk and writing on it won't help either.
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:10:34
You didn't answer his question. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:37:59
Do you have any idea of just how concentrated most of the bitcoins that will exist are already held bely very small group of individuals. What did they do that  gives them right to be that rich.
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:54:25
Its the truth whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:33:34
Like bill gates, warren buffet, Steve jobs?
Or are talking about conspiracy rich people like the Rothschild's?
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:12:44
Wrong! It's about half that.
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:22:14
Just like hyperinflation is bad for currencies. So too is hyper deflation , since both they make it impossible to use as a means of exchanging wealth.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:44:51
So you don't care how this will affect other people now or future generations? Your doing fine, so fuck everybody else?
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:20:48
That's why we leave it to the elite unknown group who control most of all the bitcoins to control our currency ?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:28:49
You are just acting as proof that bitcoin is good for nothing , but money laundering, drugs, tax evasion and crime. If you want bitcoin to become as ubiquitous as the www is now, you are going to have to allow for regulation and paying taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:27:12
How did wow gold fail as a currency?
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:22:40
Underestimating? Do you mean overestimating?
 I just read somewhere a few hours ago that one guy who just bought a lambo with 200 BTC has around a total 500,000 BTC that he got from scamming people. If That is true, then one person controls 1 BTC out of every 42 BTC that will ever exist. That's about 2.5% of all BTC that will ever exist. If bitcoin does end up replacing fiat currencies or even just 1%. That would make him the richest man men ever to exist.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:28:42
Not with that arrogant attitude of yours. You should be glad people with serious money are getting interested.
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:32:00
Why would you spend your money when those same bitcoins that you used to buy a laptop now can buy a car next year. It encourages hoarding and a decrease of spending.
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:34:02
Who are you to judge and tell people what they need and don't need. 
The gold standard was abandoned during the Great Depression  because it didn't allow the government to intervene to fix the economy after it crashed. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:16:23
Doesn't that lead to hoarding and a deflationary spiral. Why spend or invest your money when it will be worth more tomorrow just by letting it sit under you bed .
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:36:46
They don't like it when you speak the truth about the real motives behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:44:23
You can do that for any country if you look close enough.
