I think we need to make a destinction between the people and the order followers. It's one thing for the people to resist, but if the military / police are not on our side then good luck. That's why it's called a police state, that's where all the control really exists.

I see a lot of people “promoting Bitcoin” by throwing up their QR codes on camera (basically just begging for donations). Instead of going that route (lol), I figured maybe I can do my bit to introduce new people to Bitcoin via my indie game (WIP).
In the screenshot you’ll see a cool little “Bitcoin commune”. This is a facility you can build that allows you to trade items, mine blocks and make transactions in the game world.
Just to provide some context, the game is not themed around blockchain like most games out there. The idea is instead to be more subtle and include crypto related activities to help with certain goals. I’ve thought of some interesting applications for Blockchain in the game world. First it’s a way to subvert the corporate government that constantly spies and try to tax various sources of your income. Also there are “Phantoms”(Yokai ghosts) that can infect technology, one game objective is to collect these phantoms and record them onto the blockchain. Doing so allows the player capture/track them as Phantoms are unable to manipulate the blockchain.
There’s a ton of detail I could go into but for now I just wanted to share my plans to include bitcoin related activities in game. If you’re interested in a demo message me and I’ll share a private Discord link.

Well I hope so, I dont have anything on an exchange and in a sad way I hope many people get rekt by exchanges. Unfortunely we need angry people to teach new adopters and learn from their mistakes.

This is the same on language learning apps, lots of chinese girls will message you and try to get you to join forex accounts. I publicly posted about it and tons of guys thanked me because they was about to get scammed lol.
Once I trolled one of them and told them I was psychic. I made a couple lucky guesses about pets they owned and freaked her (maybe him) out. I told them they were cursed unless they stopped trying to scam people.

To bad the same reason banks exist is the same reason people don't hold their keys. Realistically I'm doubtful the masses(even in crypto) will ever learn the lesson.

You completely miss the point. The point is that its one potential less Bitcoin adopter along with all the friends and family who find out they got rekt.
Whether they deserve it or not is irrelevant.

Maybe not 10 years but theres already prospecting missions planned for next year. It's a huge untapped market and lots of lucrative contracts are going out to companies / startups to make it happen. Progress could happen a lot faster than expected, especially if nations compete to be first to market.
Imo just the fact it's out there in large quantities should factor into a 10 year time frame.

Even if they take the wallet they still need the password for it. Also since OP just exposed himself, the best thing to do is to put a decoy in there. Or use one of those USB killers to melt any thief's machine

The richest people alive today(in fiat) most likely also hold the most amount of Bitcoin today. Unfortunately the average Joe is not wise to economics. Even if they bought around $3k they dont have disposal income to buy much. In other words, Bitcoin isn't likely to do much damage to the rich. If anything the wealth gap will grow exponentially if Bitcoins price reaches the moon.
Things have changed a lot since 2013 so you have to be realistic.
