[Jesus Fucking christ](
It is minimal, which is why IM NOT FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.
I benefit from being charged capital gains on my profits, IN FACT I THINK EVERYONE, INCLUDING MYSELF, SHOULD BE CHARGED MORE BECAUSE THE CURRENT RATES ARE FUCKING LOW.
I don't get to write that tax laws though, I'm glad they incentive long term investment and it's just a happy coincidence that my stack's gains will be charged less because I'll be paying Capital gain instead of my gains being taxed as income.
Nobody likes being taxed, the difference between you and me is that I recognize we live in "Big Boy" world, and living in a first world country isn't free.  So stop being a fucking whiner and man the fuck up.

I'm more upset that the education system failed to teach you how to critically think than anything

How fucking stupid are you?

Let's be honest, most people use Crypto as an asset to be traded.  It's really only true believers (of which there are relatively few) who use it as a form of currency.

That's not tax evasion dumbass

The fuck am I avoiding?  Federal tax law on commodities is that short term transactions under a year are taxed as income, and long term transactions are taxed in a bracket based on income and gains amount.
You don't know what you're fucking talking about.

Aka greedy and want to play by different rules

That hurts poor people more than the wealthy, but nice try.

Feel free to move to Somalia!  They don't collect taxes there.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:44:01
Fuckin whiner, you literally do nothing and make a bunch of money. Stop complaining about a minimal tax

So we can keep recycling the shitty over 9000 meme every few days

Don't even try this here, Bitcoin has a crazy fucking anarcho-capitalist following.
I bet half the people here think roads should be privatized.
Edit: Like fucking clockwork

Did Tesla's general counsel leave him before or after he said this?
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:15:57
Sorry I don't think rich fucks who were born into money should be able to sit on their ass all day making money from capital gains and not be taxed on it.  That's how you create an underclass and violent revolution.  Go look up the Russian revolution and find out why people rose up over there and fucked shit up.
