Coinbase is fine, but hackers took out Mt. Gox. No security is absolute and bitcoin is a huge target

The time do do this would have been a few weeks ago, when the price was in the mid 500s.

This site;  mentions various mining programs, but which one is the best one? I'm still running Windows Vista on a 6-year old computer, and I just want to test it out, even if my chances of actually solving anything are low. I already have the wallet and played around with it a bit. I'd be okay with upgrading the video card later, or even adding an asic miner or USB miner if it looks like this will pan out.
Also, where do you sell things for bitcoin? I have a ton of old Warhammer model kits I'm sure someone would want, and ebay absolutely raped me on the prices when I sold a bit of them. Very telling that they ban the sale on bitcoin mining equipment.
Also is there a place where you can trade old computer equipemnt, or goods for bitcoin? I know that there are meetups and people who sell bitcoins for cash through a phone app. Apparently Androids are the best for this, right?
