My guess is that the answer can be found by looking into the process and risks involved in setting up a USD/USDT exchange. Quite frankly I'm amazed Kraken was able to do it. 
Ideally there would be more. But at least we have one exchange that can provide us with real market data that can help see through the fog of speculation and rumors.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:23:00
The price deviates because exchange prices deviate, and USDT facilitates arbitrage between exchanges that support it. 
This explains why the price - during periods when the FUD machine is turned off - often temporarily deviates from par - both above and below. 
The 3 grand in your example isn't completely free - there are transaction costs involved in moving money, and exchanges charge fees. Small, temporary deviations aren't anything to be concerned about, especially on days like today when there are plenty of people speculating and making cheap bets - shorting $300,000 at 99 cents is only about a $3000 risk. 
None of this means Tether is solvent, of course. The people behind Tether might be doing bad things, or they might not. But there's a ton of confusion and unbridled speculation going on right now, and I think the best source of information is the open market for USD/USDT. 
And I think there is a real demand for USDT, and a real and obvious use for it that many people are simply glossing over when they jump on the "it's a scam!" bandwagon. I get it - and I'm not defending Tether itself - the lack of an audit is very troubling. But evidence of their insolvency is lacking - despite a very persistent and dedicated group of people trying to convince us otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:02:13
I'm not sure I understand - Tether has no legal obligation to maintain the peg at Kraken. They have to do it in order to maintain trust that they keep a full reserve. And they should be happy to - people are giving them the opportunity to buy back USDT at less than par. 
Unless you're suggesting that Kraken, owned by an (as far as I know) unrelated company based in San Francisco, is implicated, I don't see how this can be accomplished without real USD. Is there any reason to think that Kraken's USD/USDT market is fraudulent that I'm unaware of?
I'm also not saying that Tether will be able to do it - only that so far, they have. If USDT trades at a significant discount to USD for long - something that has never happened - Tether will have some serious explaining to do. That is because if Tether is running a full reserve, anyone with knowledge of that, especially Tether itself, should buy as many discounted USDTs as they can.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:56:45
A couple of questions to help me better understand your hypothetical, because I'm still not seeing the role of USDT, unless you're suggesting:
(1) Tether/BFX issues USDT. 
(2) Tether/BFX uses that USDT to purchase crypto on other markets that accept USDT.
(3) Tether/BFX hope crypto goes up in value (without the benefit of hindsight, I don't see it as inevitable, even under their scheme - particularly given the timing and amounts involved). 
(4) Tether/BFX sell the crypto purchased with USDT for real USD.
(5) Hope that (3) and (4) cover the fraud in (1). 
Is that right? I think (2) is necessary for your hypothetical because as I mentioned before, if using Bitfinex, USDT really does nothing to facilitate the fraud. It actually makes it easier to detect and identify by putting on a public ledger. But again I'm using hindsight and ignoring Hanlon's razor, so maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss this possibility. 
We'll see.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:27:55
Despite all the FUD, Tethers continue to trade at roughly par ($0.9836 at the moment on Kraken), with over $10 million in volume, and most trading coming in the form of market sell orders - people betting against Tether's solvency. Shorting USDT is a remarkably cheap bet - risking less than $2 for every $100. 
On the other hand - the people putting millions into the buy-side of those orders have little to gain, and everything to lose if the conspiracy theories are true. It only makes sense to take on such risk for such little reward if you know it isn't a risk at all - in other words, if you are Tether, and you know you are running a full reserve, and you're buying back USDT at a discount, earning a small, but easy profit. 
Stepping back, in the absence of knowledge that Tether is running a full reserve, it would make little sense to buy at $0.98. So the reaction of someone like Bitcoin Grandpa shouldn't be to buy USDT. That's Tether's job - they have to maintain the peg despite the FUD. And they can only do it by placing buy orders with real dollars - something that's been done consistently since there's been a market for USD/USDT.
Not sure if this is what OP is implying, but if we're speculating on Tether's solvency, it's the only actual evidence we have to look at right now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:38:17
Kraken exchange. Lots of people are doing it. Low risk, high reward bet if the rumors/conspiracy theories are true. You can short an asset that has no reason to go above $1 for $0.98-$0.99. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:34:16
If that's true, then you've pretty recklessly dismissed the possibility that you're wrong, which you have to acknowledge exists in the absence of evidence supporting some of the more specific claims you've made. You do a disservice to your own argument by overstating it and misrepresenting the evidence you claim supports it. 
Maybe you've done it before, and if I missed it I apologize, but can you admit there's a possibility that you may be wrong? Even that what you're seeing is evidence of some sort of wrongdoing other than the specific wrongdoing you've claimed has occurred?
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:01:26
I think you're assuming a perfect world without transaction costs or regulations. In that case, sure, it makes sense for a firm like Tether to set up a service just like the one you suggested. Why let others use their asset to profit when Tether could do so themselves, presumably at a lower cost? 
The problem is that there is no legal framework for Tether to implement a service like the one you described. 
What non-crypto assets are you referring to in your last paragraph? In comparable examples I can think of, real-world trading of the pegged asset looks pretty similar to USD/USDT trading. The Bulgarian Lev is pegged by its national bank or currency board to the Euro, but has what appears to be similar temporary aberrations. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:41:18
I was speaking of regulatory risk of a US-based company trading a token issued by a non-US regulated entity that is arguably pegged to the USD. 
I wasn't speaking directly to counterparty risk of holding USDT, but obviously there is some risk there, or we wouldn't be discussing it. But Kraken is in a better position to judge and mitigate that risk.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:10:15
Thanks to both. I have to credit this article, which also provides imo a much more sensible and reasoned explanation of what may be going on at Tether:
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:08:42
What's the point of USDT in all of this? Bitfinex doesn't need real USD or USDT to put in fake orders. They're just numbers in an internal database. It seems like USDT would be an unnecessary complication that makes it much easier spot the fraud. Why put fake numbers on a public blockchain when you don't have to? Am I missing something?
This is an interesting theory, and different from the usual conspiracy theory because I don't think it works unless Tether did this independent from Bitfinex - something that is pretty unlikely given their relationship, which is about the only think that's been well-documented in all of this.

It's only not a bet if you absolutely want fiat no matter what.  But you could buy more bitcoin on gox than you can trade them for, obviously.  So someone out there thinks that there's a higher percentage chance that Gox will allow full withdrawal of their bitcoins very soon, and be able to sell them at market value and withdraw the cash (whether at gox or another exchange).  So there's a bet being made ... you're just betting yourself a certain amount of fiat, in exchange for an opportunity with buying bitcoin on gox.
Your Mt. Gox dollars are worth more than other dollars because they can buy bitcoin at a lower price than other dollars can.

Based on this it is not even clear that it was created by a third party.  He could have meant "produced" as in a production of a document.  That is how it is used in the legal sense in discovery - parties "produce" documents to each other, generally pursuant to a request for production.
So he could mean that MtGox created it but that MtGox did not produce it to the public.

You should file a police report in the jurisdiction where Hakim619 made the deposit.  It sounds like a crime was committed.  Whether the local authorities will do anything about it is another story, but it's worth a shot.  But the bank has cameras, and this person came in twice (or hung around for a some time... at least 15 minutes I would assume).  Maybe they have cameras in the parking lot, and if Hakim619 drove to the bank, there may be an image of his license plate.  
It might be fairly easy to catch this individual ... assuming you get some cooperation from the local police and the bank, and I know that is far from certain, but worth a shot imho.  Good luck.

So if we assume that user withdrawal behavior is similar across exchanges (and can we?), then we can compare the proportion of double/multiple withdrawals from Gox addresses to that of other exchanges.  If there is a higher incidence of double/multiple withdrawals from Gox addresses, then TM can be an explanation for the difference.  Basically, we need to control for user behavior.

It doesn't need it, but it would have helped. There are many people who want to invest in Bitcoin, but who aren't ready to use bitcoin and have no need to hold it directly and keep it secure.
An ETF will get those people into the ecosystem. Some of those investors will become users eventually. 
In the last couple months I've had quite a few people ask me how to buy bitcoin. But most of them didn't, largely because the process isn't easy. Not nearly as easy as buying shares in an ETF.  
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:31:02
I have no idea what he wanted, but I think there's a distinction between an individual (or group of individuals acting in concert, for that matter) as *an* authority and one as *the* authority. 
The former - *an* authority - is someone or a group of people whose ideas get more attention and opinions carry more weight based on something they bring to the table, whether it is experience, ideas, contributions, or something else. There's nothing wrong with this so long as we don't give their ideas or opinions *undue* attention or weight.
The latter - *the* authority - is the evil we're trying to avoid, I think.

How is a bunch of miners switching to an alt-coin an attack? Even if they call their alt-coin bitcoin? 
This will be, and indeed is, being resolved by the market. BU is backed by miners. BU begins to make serious threats at imminent hard-fork, and miners' revenue immediately drops 20%. 
Let BU run their own chain - let it fail (or succeed, either one is fine, the former is just far more likely) - and the lesson learned will be that if a group wants to propose a rule change, it had better reach overwhelming consensus or have the ability to reach overwhelming consensus, or else it will wither and die at great expense to any mining cartel that tries to back it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:22:14
Then they are fools. The only power they have is economic - they can't win with better ideas or better code, and that is the only way they could win. 
And their economic power will vanish quickly if they do something stupid. I don't think they will, because they know this, and they know they will become irrelevant the moment they attack.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:02:41
Distributing power is inefficient but it allows time for consensus to form. 
For example, as I'm guessing is well-known, our (U.S.)  President has taken some extreme executive actions related to Immigration. 
But those actions have, so far, been frustrated by the Courts - prominently by Judges appointed by our last two Presidents. 
Every President leaves behind a legacy in the Judicial branch, and many of our last two Presidents' 650 appointees (plus many of the others) will continue to (hopefully) frustrate Trump's most extreme actions. 
In under two years, the people vote again, and can elect Legislators that might pass laws even Judges can't ignore, or laws that undo Executive orders. Congress can undo pretty much any Executive Order. 
Our distribution of power is imperfect but at least we have it. It seems to work well enough to stop anything controversial from happening quickly - except war, unfortunately. 
I'm hopeful that BU is just a part of Bitcoin's decentralization, and that at worst it becomes another altcoin, which is perfectly fine. 
And I hope downward pressure on price will force miners to see that Core's development has done quite a bit to make bitcoin more valuable, and prevent anyone from taking any extreme actions. 
Edit: Probably could have used a better comparison, but my point remains - hopefully the bigger question here is what to do about the no-votes on something that is non-controversial but for some reason not adopted, possibly due to neglect - is there a mechanism in place for something like that? 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:54:57
Thanks - I'll correct to make singular. But I don't think that changes anything. The point is the rule change is controversial, so not all nodes will accept it. BU is free to have their own node, but the second it accepts incompatible blocks, it becomes a different blockchain. Its Genesis block just happens to be the last conforming Bitcoin block it mined. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:10:55
Miners will come and go. Even Bitmain, I'm sure, has investors to answer to, and those investors will not allow their CEO to continue down such a reckless path if they don't see value in the end. 
The same with Coinbase - their board members need to be informed that management is reckless, and needs to be removed. The company has never been well managed - it is where it is because of first-mover advantage, and if its investors want to retain that value, they'll dump management. 
There's just so many ways for market forces to correct this. And this could very well turn out to be a good thing - I'm not sure there's enough demand yet for bigger blocks, and the value in maintaining a strong protocol and efficient code (for lack of better terms) probably outweighs the present value of bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:01:31
That might have made the slowdown more noticeable to different people, but I don't see how it filled the blocks. 
Those using the core wallet with that setting started sending transactions with lower fees than before, so they weren't accepted in blocks as quickly. But other transactions took their place.
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:16:23
I think it's a bit more nuanced than that. It can't always be wrong to look to authority. The fallacy is appealing to authority without basis. Satoshi designed the protocol. What he said isn't dispositive, but it rationally carries significantly more weight based on the fact that he is Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:58:46

@_date: 2017-03-11 00:15:07
It would make it much easier for people to invest who don't have any need (yet) to hold bitcoin, which is just about everybody. 
And quite a few people do need the simplicity and familiarity of an ETF - that extra demand would have been a good thing, as would having more people in the ecosystem.

So as more regulated exchanges like Gemini appear, and more volume shifts to them, a future ETF will be more likely to be approved. That's my understanding, at least. 
Edit: After reading pages 33-35 of the ruling, it appears the SEC thinks that Gemini is insufficiently regulated. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:55:03
In my opinion it's a good time. The pattern is obvious. BU tries some tactic to try to gain consensus for their coin, and it fails every time. They're getting more and more desperate, because they know they can't win the real battle - the battle over ideas, and the battle over code. Their ideas are simplistic and flawed, and their code, from what I hear, sucks.
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:41:08
It seems like it is that, plus that Gemini doesn't offer derivatives, which apparently would subject it to more oversight.

It's also possible that one individual could understand that approval likely would have resulted in a short-term benefit, but that it had little relevance long-term.

And hopefully we all see why financial terrorism - which is what BU's proponents are engaging in with their "suggestions" on what will happen - does not, and cannot work. 
The only reason BU proponents have wealth and power is because the market values bitcoin highly - if they destroy that value (and they know they will if they execute), they destroy their own. One-by-one, they will fall in line with the real consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:11:32
Agreed, though I'd suggest that the fact that they don't choose this method shows that the market would judge their altcoin as worth very little - and like most altcoins that add little value (and BU would be among the bottom of the barrel in this category), it would become worthless pretty quickly. 
Which is why their attack would fail, and why it will not happen either, IMO.
@_date: 2019-03-09 06:12:47

If the fun you had was worth the 2.7% house advantage, then you were perfectly rational :)
But that raises a good point as well - if state actors are involved that want to destroy Bitcoin, that is a different story. They'd be acting rationally, because their desire to destroy Bitcoin is their incentive (much like fun is a rational incentive to gamble)
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:10:30
If more people had, maybe the ETF will be approved. 
If more people move to regulated exchanges, the next ETF, or the one after that, or the one after that, may be approved. 
Edit: After reading pages 33-35 of the ruling, it appears the SEC thinks that Gemini is insufficiently regulated.
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:02:17
I think that's an invalid comparison. It is true that the contracts that form the legal structure of an ETF are complex, but the product is simple. To an investor, an ETF, because of its complex inter-workings, ideally is as simple as buying or selling equity in a company. 
The rule change was not approved largely because the markets that form the spot price for bitcoin are not sufficiently regulated, and thus subject to manipulation outside of the listing exchange's (BATS) control. 
The SEC's opinion is comprehensible. It is logical, albeit a bit too cautious and dismissive of self-regulation and the potential of a market shift to more regulated exchanges if an ETF were approved (chicken and egg type thing). There's a clear roadmap to approval - confidence that the spot price for the underlying asset is not subject to manipulation, likely through a much higher share of volume flowing through more regulated markets.  
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:07:22
I have to think it won't happen. If they are rational, they will know that if they attack, everything they have will become worthless. 
Even if these "big names" act irrationally due to their celebrity or whatever, rational actors won't follow them if it means the destruction of their own wealth. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:19:16
I think Gemini has to offer products that are more regulated - or other companies have to offer those products.

@_date: 2017-03-24 12:17:01
Respectfully, you don't understand how markets work (edit: obviously you do from subsequent posts). What BU is "suggesting" will happen is based on a delusion that there is some sort of consensus around their solution, when most people think it's utter crap. 
And they know this. They know this because while they're trying to bully support, they're watching the value of their investment decline. Because of this, if they are rational, they will stop, because they will see that they were not acting in their best interests.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:01:34

The delays happened during a period where difficulty dropped, so there were fewer blocks solved per day compared to the prior difficulty period. That may have been a contributing factor.

@_date: 2017-03-24 12:43:35
I agree with you on the Whitepaper, and I think the system works when you take into account market forces. 
BU knows they don't have consensus. That is why they're trying (tried) to create the illusion of consensus through what looks like a very poorly planned variant of a Sybil attack. No one bought it, and their work has been exposed as poor. 
Now, they're reacting by using threats, and markets are reacting. They may be willing to put up with some pain in order to see if they can coerce people into their way of thinking. But eventually they will see that it is pointless, all they will accomplish is the destruction of their own wealth, and quit. 
I hope.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:13:45
Maybe they should use that money to hire competent developers rather than hashrate.
I'm having a hard time seeing the issue here. As I understand it, BU is one of hundreds of bitcoin forks in the world that happens to be backed by some wealthy and prominent folks. 
They're threatening to create a new blockchain that mirrors Bitcoin, but with a different rule. 
I don't see how that's different from any altcoin. Value will flow to the better blockchain. If BU wants to create an altcoin, it's free to do so. But unless BU adds value above bitcoin, it will be more profitable to mine bitcoin in the long run. 
I guess the risk is that they can stick it out for a long time, but I have to think the price of bitcoin will force an outcome pretty quickly. At some point they'll be forced to switch their miners back. 
Am I missing something? I guess they could be irrational.

Thanks for judging our intelligence based on your simplified interpretation of what libertarian means. I don't really know what it means exactly and doubt I could define it, but I think I'm one of the not-very-smart ones you describe.
And I don't wish for instant Mad Max. In stark contrast, in the USA at least, there are several quite libertarian communities. They're often behind gates. Sometimes on islands. Mostly in small neighborhoods with many cul-de-sacs. And a homeowners association (or, if you're urban, a condo association). Very few deathmatches, in my experience.
Non-aggression. That's what pretty much every not "very smart" libertarian believes.
To add (because we're a little slow) - being against coerced government != being against governance. I bet we'd have fewer deathmatches.

Like others said - speculation. I would say that the value comes not just from past proof-of-work, but the likelihood of continued proof of work to continue the chain. 
Because the market thinks miners are likely (for at least some period) to continue the minority chain on some of these high-profile altcoins launched using bitcoin's UTXO set as an airdrop, I suppose there's some perceived value there.

It's not boilerplate. There could just as easily be an explicit contractual right to exchange USDT for USD at par, with an exception for anyone on the OFAC list or any other terrorist watch list. 
I'm guessing people don't care whether they can redeem them for USD because they don't intend to - they intend to use them to convert their USD to cryptocurrency, which itself is redeemable on a number of markets for USD. 
Maybe it's just easier for Tether to do it this way, as it functions more like a USD ETF in that it has to hold sufficient assets to maintain the 1:1 peg?

Signaling means nothing, though. What's more likely here is that some miners haven't gotten around to make the change to not signal. 
So, I guess Coinbase still wants to figure out a way to defraud their customers. They just need a little time to do it. After all, they did state their intent to deliberately mislead their customers and sell B2X as if it were Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:56:25
While I agree with most commenters that this is unlikely, if this were the case, the result would be a massive shift in wealth from those trying to hijack bitcoin (B2X) to the rest of us. Or a massive (albiet temporary) destruction of wealth if Coinbase, et al, follow through on their stated intent to defraud, due to the lack of public confidence that would likely follow. 
But for B2X, it's lose-lose. Every scenario for them is lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:29:38
I was shocked to read that at the end. I understand that it is labeled as an opinion piece, and it does not represent DCG's opinion, but still.
I hope more of the firms that initially supported S2X understand this author's reasoning. The NYA, as an attempt to form consensus, failed. I don't think that launching a B2X altcoin was ever the intention of most NYA signatories. 
Given that is the only thing left at this point, most signatories should acknowledge reality and only support B2X to the extent they deem it appropriate. All should reaffirm that B2X is NOT bitcoin, and be sure not to mislead their customers into thinking otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:57:06
First, personal attacks weaken your argument. 
Maybe I'll make it a bit more clear - SHA256 as a hashing algorithm, as it currently stands, may fail bitcoin due to a number of factors that have resulted in centralized production (for now) by a couple of firms that mine for themselves. I didn't mention ASICs at all, so take your strawman elsewhere. 
Your link doesn't contain any research, facts, or evidence. Just argument. 
I'll watch your second link. But it doesn't change my point that bcash isn't real world evidence that big blocks work. I know you didn't make that point, but others have. 
Today is just another piece of evidence that markets can be irrational, especially over short periods of time.
Btw, I edited my last post to say "only increasing [the block size] could destroy [Bitcoin]." Not "would." I don't know what would happen. If anyone were ever bored enough to look back through my post history, you could probably find me saying an increase seemed like a good idea. But then I read more. And asked more questions. And read more. The more credible argument is that a block size increase of any significance would, at this time, do little good with potential for great harm. That may change, and I hope it does. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:16:29
What the hell are you talking about? Where am I speaking for others? I just posted Coinbase's tweet, more to laugh at them as they probably spent the day like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out what to do next. They're clueless.
Just like you. Bitcoin Gold doesn't exist. If and when it does, it will use a different PoW algorithm. Research what you throw your money into - trust me, you'll be better off for it. You sound like someone dissappointed to find out you weren't getting your B2X "dividend." What you don't realize is that in the unlikely event B2X successfully disrupted Bitcoin, all value would have been destroyed.

Apparently not - he said that he would if bitcoin hit $500k within three years, but, realizing that may actually happen, decided to shill for bcash and deem it "bitcoin," knowing bcash will never be worth $500k, all in order to save his own dick.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:07:07
Right - the EDA is a clever way to circumvent that. Though I think it just slows the inevitable. It still makes no sense to use a currency backed by the same hashing algorithm of another, larger, more secure one. It's susceptible to attack at any time, meaning there's no value. BCH is really nothing more than a means to funnel money from naive speculators to Bitmain and their cronies. And this is really nothing new.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:36:23

@_date: 2017-11-01 04:41:25
Here's how I see it. Bitcoin has a non-neglible chance of becoming a worldwide reserve or default currency. While it almost certainly can't scale to include every transaction on its blockchain, it doesn't have to.
If this were to happen, then it may also happen that a number of other currencies coexist for certain markets. Some crypto, some not. Fiat is the system in place for nation states. While most are flat out scams, some altcoins are actually useful and are being used for commerce. They're easily exchangeable to and from bitcoin (far easier than Fiat).
But ultimately, all alternative currencies have either more limited or different uses than bitcoin. Many serve only local areas - notably Fiat, which obviously dominates and will probably, but not certainly, continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
Or bitcoin will become the default unit of account. It will be used for transactions that most require its unique properties compared to competitors. People would hold their savings in bitcoin, but it's unclear how much they would actually transact using it directly. 
I suspect many transactions will be foreign exchange, but there will be a whole host of others. The more it scales, the more demand there will be, I suspect, which is why protecting and securing bitcoin is most important.
I see today's price as speculation that the latter scenario may happen, in which case bitcoin would have to be far more valuable. Just my opinions and guesses  obviously. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:51:58
Well, that does make perfect sense here. Coinbase has proven, time and again, to be one of the worst managed companies in this space. It certainly does make it seem like they are actively trying to alienate everyone.

How is this going to work exactly? Bitcoin.com offers a wallet service. If they intend to offer a bcash wallet, but call it "bitcoin," then people who buy on Coinbase or otherwise might send real bitcoin to their Bitcoin.com wallet. 
Then Bitcoin.com will have to return it to them, explaining that they are not really a bitcoin wallet. And then use that opportunity to try to convert them to the Church of Satoshi? That's the plan?

What you're not understanding is that miners do not determine consensus. The fact that a cartel of mining pool operators decided to signal for something does not mean it had consensus. There never was consensus to double the block size. 
If you want 2MB blocks, build consensus for it. Work with others, develop code that works, test it, and subject it to review. Convince others that it is the best thing for Bitcoin. Anyone is free to do this. The fact that no one has done the work shows how little value increasing the block size would actually have.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:36:49
SHA256 as a hashing algorithm may end up failing Bitcoin, which was known from day one. The block size has not failed it - only increasing it could do that. 
Increasing it is a temporary fix that comes at the cost of centralization. You simply can't deny that with any research, evidence, or facts. 
And no, you can't point at bcash's low fees right now. Bcash's blocks are tiny. Only 3 above 1MB have been mined so far in November. 
Anyone could have predicted that as new money enters bitcoin, some looking to get rich quick would turn to alts. Hell, the same thing happened in 2013. BTC "dominance" "sliding" has nothing to do with the block size and everything to do with people chasing triple-digit gains. 
Sorry, but you've hitched your wagon to the wrong star. Thanks for selling your bitcoins. Even after all this time you claim to have been involved, you're clearly not ready. When you are, you'll be welcome back. No guarantee you'll be able to buy them back at the same price, but we'll see, right?

Exactly - and I think that is snapfractalpop's point. Apple may not have access to your data, but they have the ability to push updates to iPhones.

It did turn out to be the first public acknowledgement of an unfortunate situation. 
I'm not sure it's much more important than that. The lawsuit seemed to serve what I'm guessing was its purpose - which was for Bitfinex to figure out what was going on. 
They retained reputable outside counsel, and I'm guessing they weren't getting a response and so they filed suit to get attention. See paragraphs 54-56 of the complaint - the lawsuit hinged on being able to prove that Wells Fargo intentionally suspended wires, without justification, knowing that it would harm Bitfinex. 
I'm guessing again, but once Bitfinex heard the justification, they dropped the suit. 
This all sounds like Bitfinex was in the dark, not that they're up to something malicious. And hopefully the banking issue blows over. 
I'm guessing again, but you're probably doing this to make money for yourself.

His $100 bills are used to invest in value producing companies, so they indirectly produce value for him. 
But he could also use bitcoin to invest in value producing companies. Yet, those bitcoin may well be converted back to USD before they can be used to create value. Employees and suppliers may still want USD. 
So he may be technically correct that Bitcoin is not really a value producing asset right now - but there's nothing inherent in Bitcoin that makes it impossible.

Why can't you use bitcoins as a currency? I get that you can't use it as a currency for most things right now (unless you're pretty creative). 
But you can use it as a currency within a small, but growing community. It's easier to use bitcoin as a currency in the US than any other currency I can think of. 
And crypto is a possible replacement for fiat. It's not obvious that it will replace it. But was it obvious that digital would replace print in the 90s, decades after digital photography was invented? Probably to some people who saw the advantages, but not to most.

The first is an extremely narrow definition of currency. I can't use British Pounds to buy everyday needs, but that doesn't mean GBP isn't a currency. It just isn't a currency I use.
The second - fungibility - is a characteristic more than a definition. And I think bitcoin has that characteristic, to a certain extent. 
Edit: I think what you mean to say is that bitcoin isn't an especially useful currency. For the most part, I agree, it isn't right now. But that doesn't mean that it isn't a currency, and it doesn't mean that it won't become a useful currency in the future. There's nothing inherently permanent about any type of currency - if something more useful (like, in my opinion, cryptocurrency) comes along, it could compete with and eventually come to dominate traditional currencies.

I don't think it ever had consensus. Miners do not get to determine consensus on their own, period. So I guess it may have seemed that way if you look only at hashrate alone, but that would be a very, very incomplete picture. 
Otherwise, I agree with you. I think that the blocksize can probably be increased. But I leave that up to the experts - the ones who have developed this system. Their focus seems to be that first, bitcoin must always work. Everything else, while not ignored, is secondary. Imo, that's the way it should be.

No, not at all. If B2X can be safely listed, and there's demand for it, then exchanges should be free to do so. 
If any exchange lists it as bitcoin - fraudulently - then yes, they should be liable for any harm caused by their fraud. 
I'm not making a legal threat. But it is my opinion that listing B2X as bitcoin when it is not bitcoin rises to the level of fraud. Fraud is theft by deception, and I don't think trying to stop something that's universally recognized as wrong (theft) in any way detracts from my argument.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:20:11

@_date: 2017-10-25 19:23:17
Bitcoin is the incumbent chain that follows the then-present protocol rules. Those rules can only change if there is such overwhelming consensus in support of any rule-change that, once the change is implemented, the old chain is certain to be abandoned. 
Why is this so hard to understand? Anyone is free to create their own cryptocurrency, even one like "Bitcoin Gold" that uses a snapshot of the blockchain to airdrop coins. 
No one is free to lie to people and defraud them into purchasing, selling, or using some other cryptocurrency - no matter who created it or how it was created - by saying it is bitcoin. 
But that is exactly what ANY company that calls the proposed upcoming minority-supported B2X/S2X/whatever token "Bitcoin" intends to do - lie and defraud. 
I'll be glad to have them out of the community - other people and firms will gladly take their place.

Thanks for stating the obvious. But it would be very, very easy to prove. If Coinbase sold bcash as bitcoin, that would be fraud, and anyone who was deceived by them would be harmed by that fraud. What makes B2X any different? 
Not to be rude, but your statements on intent are incomprehensible. Edit - I think when you say intent you mean scienter. Edit 2 - (it's getting late) more accurately, you're misinterpreting scienter to mean that there is some subjective component, or that one could deceive, but with what they thought were good intentions. But it doesn't work that way. Intent to deceive is the "wrongness" you're looking for - calling B2X bitcoin, when it is not in fact bitcoin, is deceptive. All that would need to be proven is that it was done intentionally, not whether there was some subjective "goodness" behind the intent.
Edit 3 - (really late) still trying to understand your response (no offense intended, as I said, late) - the issue may come down to what is meant by "bitcoin." If B2X is not bitcoin, yet is passed off as such, that is obviously fraud, we can agree. Given the equities (there is no real harm to any exchange to maintain the status quo as to what is bitcoin - the incumbent chain, and the public interest is served by maintaining the status quo), there's a chance (not saying a large one - it is extraordinary relief) that a Court could issue a preliminary (in my state they're called 'temporary,' which is true) injunction maintaining the status quo as to what may be listed as bitcoin.

This is vague, and extremely reckless. Maybe the market will decide that B2X is the most valuable. Perhaps it will have the most accumulated difficulty. It may even garner community support. All of these things might happen. 
But it will all have come because of a protocol rule-change that happened without any semblance of consensus. It is a different currency, with its own rules, and it is not bitcoin. 
The only way it can ever become bitcoin is if there is such overwhelming consensus behind the B2X rule changes that the incumbent chain is abandoned. 
Until then, if you buy/sell/exchange/offer any services with B2X while lying and calling it bitcoin, you are defrauding your customers.

The problem with bcash is that it was pushed by charlatans as a replacement for bitcoin - but as long as you didn't buy their snake oil, it was nothing more than a transfer of wealth from the suckers that bought into it to those that understood that it is just another altcoin.
The same charlatans now proclaim B2X as a replacement for bitcoin (if at first you don't succeed...), but intend to do so maliciously this time to try to force a replacement that no one who has even a basic level of understanding wants. 
They will fail - something they are quite good at. No major exchange plans to list B2X as bitcoin. Relevant holdouts at this point are Xapo, Coinbase, and Bitpay. They will change their tune, or end up in Chapter 7/liquidation in short order.

I think the answer here may be to seek a Preliminary Injunction, enjoining any company from fraudulently listing B2X/S2X (or any other altcoin for that matter) as bitcoin. 
Best to prevent the harm before it can happen than go after the perps later. 
And to be clear - I'm only talking about legal action against people and entities that fraudulently pass off an altcoin as bitcoin - NOT against anyone who wants to create their own currency for any reason. The B2X/S2X folks should be free to do so, they just can't lie and defraud.

I apologize if I wasn't clear, but I think you missed my point. I don't know why Gemini hasn't touched Tether - my guess is the same is yours,  I think - it's too risky from a regulatory standpoint. 
Aside from that, I don't have much of a narrative. As I understand it, the accusation out there is that Bitfinex and possibly other exchanges are using fraudulently issued (that is, not backed by real USD) Tethers to buy Bitcoin and altcoins on their own exchanges. I'm not sure why they would do this, when they could simply create fake internal accounts and do the same thing without exposing themselves on a public blockchain, but I've seen worse. I haven't seen any evidence of this, just speculation. 
That speculation stems from the troubling (for Tether) fact that they recently fired their auditor, and have not proven that they have full reserves. If they don't have full reserves, it's hard to justify a 1:1 peg, as Tether couldn't sustain it.

Yeah and those that realized bcash was doomed to fail exchanged them for bitcoin - transferring wealth from the suckers that bought to those that sold. 
And you'll see who the charlatans are as support for B2X continues to fall - they'll be the only ones left pushing it as the "real" bitcoin (like they did with bcash). They're the ones who sold the S2X idea to the biggest companies as one that would have overwhelming support. But it never did, and responsible firms are moving away. 
Miners follow profit, and some might mine the B2X altcoin just as some mined the bcash altcoin. But any company that claims B2X is bitcoin is lying to their customers, and will be held responsible if their fraudulent actions cause people to lose money. 
I'll be very surprised if any company of note actually does this.

I think the problem is that "price" here is used interchangeably with one specific type of price - exchange rate. The value of a bitcoin is what I can buy with it - its purchasing power.

Over 10 exohash. 
What a wasted investment if firms like Coinbase, Abra, and Gemini defraud people into thinking B2X is bitcoin, and this causes such a loss in confidence that bitcoin loses 90% of its value. Reality is a bitch. Redefine bitcoin - like this - and destroy its value.

Agreed - few people will ever own a full bitcoin.

(1) Having your assets frozen, even if it is done wrongly, is difficult and costly to reverse. It is a big deal. 
(2) Regardless, the prohibitions on donations create a First Amendment issue. The Government is not going to want to risk having a court make such a ruling, and thus is unlikely to go after those that donate to express that they agree with Snowden/whoever and disagree with the government. 
Nevertheless, it could have a chilling effect, today's flood of donations notwithstanding.

Right - and the difference between money and a hen is that money is meant to be used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. 
Obviously no money is ever going to create eggs on its own (unless hens for some reason become a medium of exchange). 
But that doesn't mean that money doesn't have value (obviously), and it doesn't mean that you can't speculate on the future value (purchasing power) of money. Ask George Soros.

It looks like the floodgates are starting to open. Bitcoin is the incumbent chain following the rules in place. The rules change only when there is such overwhelming consensus in support of the rule change that it is certain that only one chain will emerge after the rule change.  
Anyone is free to compete with bitcoin, even by creating a new coin with bitcoin's full transaction history (like bcash or b2x). However, without replay protection, any attempt to fraudulently pass along such a coin as bitcoin is a malicious attack on the network. 
Thanks Bitmex, for developing a rational policy. I hope others follow soon with a similar announcement. S2X can't do any damage if no one uses it.

It's only a matter of time. So far, Coinbase's first-mover advantage has managed to mask what is a very, very poorly managed company. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:26:06
I don't think it turns bitcoin into an inflationary currency. Creating a new altcoin, whether it forks off bitcoin or has its own genesis block, does not increase the supply of bitcoins. 
When bcash forked, it was essentially an altcoin with an airdrop of exactly how many bitcoins I had. After the fork, I had more bitcoins, but only because I traded my bcash for them. The fork didn't create new bitcoins out of thin air - it created an altcoin out of thin air (which happens all the time).

You're inferring that it will not work based on the evidence you've seen. But exchanges fail. People lose their money. Those people will probably, if they're rational, be more diligent in their choice of exchange next time. The market will demand certain standards, and exchanges will meet those standards. 
Free markets are rarely perfect. But they evolve quickly through constant trial and error.

I agree with you that Coinbase will return OPs money so long as there is no illegal activity, but the point of the post is that Coinbase is not providing any response whatsoever. I'm sure OP (given the benefit of the doubt) would be happy to truthfully answer Coinbase's questions - the problem is that Coinbase isn't asking any. 
This is an issue with Coinbase, and it is unacceptable from a customer service standpoint. And while OP will get the money back so long as there was nothing illegal, that does not mean OP will still have a Coinbase account. This is yet another serious issue with Coinbase. They will ban accounts for even the slightest appearance of possible impropriety, without any (apparent) investigation, and usually without any explanation.

Fine, but they both provide services related to bitcoin. Coinbase moreso than Circle. 
In fact, I have no idea why Circle needs to use bitcoin to transfer USD from one Circle user to another. I doubt that they actually do. There's no reason for an entity to use a decentralized ledger to move money internally.

These examples seem more consistent with what would be required for exchanging small amounts. 
But it is hard to blame the ATM owners - compliance is difficult and costly, and many likely chose to go the safe route rather than risk running afoul of the law. 
Ideally, those that follow the law but do not go overboard will push the others out of the market.

It seems like the fundamental difference between Circle and Coinbase is that Coinbase is a bitcoin company, and Circle is a company that uses bitcoin. Circle resembles a bank that uses bitcoin to transfer money. And they're bitcoin-friendly in that they exchange dollars for bitcoin. The author doesn't seem to understand that Circle uses bitcoin's blockchain. Which is the only one really worth using. 
Coinbase, on the other hand, seems more like a company that wants to advance the bitcoin network and provides a wide variety of services that take advantage of bitcoin.

Using cash itself isn't all that invasive, at least not for most transactions (&lt;$10k or anything that seems like structuring).  (edit: to be clear, I'm talking about in the US)
We all use cash every day, relatively anonymously. 
The problem is that bitcoin/fiat exchanges seem to be over-regulated, or at least major companies (Coinbase, Circle) are going way overboard to be on the safe side. 
I would think that the documentation required to exchange USD for XBT at a bitcoin ATM would be the same as that required to exchange USD for EUR at a currency exchange. I'm not sure exactly what that is, but I'm guessing trading $500 for euros at the airport is not as invasive a process.  
@_date: 2015-10-12 05:06:05


I think this is the key - from what I've heard these sites are pretty easy to use. From what I understand you can make a deposit and start playing right away. Compare that to the process involved in obtaining bitcoin. 
But if these become over-regulated to the point where they are not as fun, not as easy to use, or they're overtaxed as a result of revenue raising measures needed to pass a budget, then you could see a bitcoin-accepting competitor gaining some traction. 
But those are all hypothetical, and it would probably take a combination of them. And I agree that has to be balanced by the fact that such a site would still be operating illegally under US law, which at the very least will stunt its growth. To start, marketing would cease, at least in the ubiquitous form we're seeing today. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:56:56
But why do you have to show the user that they have 0 balance? Can't you put the coins in cold storage and notify the user that X amount of coins are in cold storage, and not available for instant withdrawal? 
And is that really your CTO who posted earlier in the thread? Just my humble opinion, but I wouldn't want someone who writes like that speaking on behalf of my company, fwiw.

Maybe, or they just attracted attention. Who knows. My point is trying to game the market may be a fools' errand. Bitcoin has - even after the recent drop - increased a ton and received plenty of attention - there may be a relief rally if this all blows over and some volatility between now and then, but expect to be surprised.
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:25:44
My point is that Coinbase and Circle can comply with regulations without being so intrusive, arbitrarily canceling transactions, and closing accounts for no reason whatsoever.
I agree with Voorhees statement in the link from the other reply, they're doing "more than compliance." I don't agree that they have to do "more than compliance." They need to hire competent legal counsel that can advise them how to comply with regulations without alienating everyone - and before their VC money dries up.
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:30:37
No one disputes that they have to comply with the law. But it is their fault when they don't put in the effort to hire competent legal counsel to advise them of the law, but instead adopt policies that are far more restrictive than required by law in order to feign compliance. Plenty of bitcoin companies do that now. Particularly the two major US-based exchange companies. 
This is bad business, and dangerous. It is bad business because they alienate customers that use their services legally by arbitrarily banning or restricting accounts unnecessarily. 
It is dangerous because while they may appear to be over-cautious, in reality they just do not understand the law, and as a result are prone to violate it while trying to give the appearance of compliance. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:15:53
There are no regulations that require Coinbase (and Circle - they are even worse) to be as invasive and draconian. They chose how to implement AML/KYC, and go farther than any other financial institution, particularly for relatively small accounts. 
Part of it is the increased scrutiny on them for being essentially bitcoin banks, and that certainly isn't fair, but both Coinbase and Circle have chosen to go above and beyond to appease their masters. Either they will grow to the point where they can ease their policies, or more likely competition will end them.

If he is trying to game the market - he might, or he might be formally waiting until the 21st after a test, or both, or neither, who knows - but if he is, he's probably in for a surprise. I don't think the market's that easy to game - at least I hope not.

To be fair, a good number of alts did well at the time. It's impossible to know what countless people are thinking while investing their money. But segwit may certainly have helped, and it may also have helped shed a light on altcoins in general - it wasn't long ago that most were just pointless clones. 
Some like XMR and XCN (what happened there? that seemed like a cool idea) were fertile testing grounds for new features, but not most. Now, it seems like nearly all of the major ones are. And, albeit through centralized exchanges, they're kind of like sidechains it seems.

As a tech pro, explain why you can't safely store the coins, while still making sure the user is aware of their balance, and that they have access to that balance?
Essentially, you're lying to your users about what their balance is. Let's say someone bought some DRK on Cryptsy a while back when it was worth 50x less than what it is now. Then they see the price increase, and remember that they may have some DRK on Cryptsy. If they log in and see 0, they may think they were mistaken. But that's only because you're lying to them about their balance.

I guess (2) is more important - to what extent are the bank's action's voluntary, or are they the result of legal requirements or regulations. It could render (1) moot because if banks aren't free to chose the conditions upon which their banking services are rendered, then it doesn't matter whether Coinbase is able to chose banks. 
Coinbase seems pretty low risk from a bank's standpoint, outside of regulatory risks.
