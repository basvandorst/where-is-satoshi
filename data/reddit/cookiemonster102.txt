If this is an inside job, then where are the coins now?

Different firm?

Sorry my bad, that was a speculative message i read a few days back. It's hard to know fact from rumour lately. We should all wait till tmrw at least to see what two-bit-idiot has to say about Mtgox and bitcoin foundation, if anything. Also perhaps Mark will come forward regarding the movement of coins within Gox (If he's allowed).
I'd watch this space, unless you have lots and lots of coins.

Do we need to file for legal action (class action) in order to retrieve coins held on the exchange. If so, under what charges?

What is the source for this information?

Its not close to Selachii LLP (geographically). They're just both in London.   (I live in London)

I'm going to hold out for a few days I think, wait until the 11th March for the Mtgox hearing and other news. Also hopefully Selachii collaborate with other law firms to collate the case together and hopefully reduce costs. 
However I would urge people to send the questionnaire back to Selachii to help gauge the situation, just don't send coins just yet. 
I agree that lawyers are opportunistic, but they must also compete with other equally opportunistic law firms and so there is a trade off. But due to neo nature of bitcoins; of course this competition is reduced.

What is the alternative? What's happening with OKcoin?

There is hope. Your coins may not be gone. Live to fight another day my friend.
