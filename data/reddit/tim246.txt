Then I understand the jewish bankers fought back... and what happened? Oh yeah, they hanged him from a cross. The let stupid cops do it. I understand the bankers were laughing their heads off while he was hanging. Then the bankers edited a book saying the guy they killed want people to do what the leaders say or they will all go to hell (a lot of sheep (have) bought it like the lenders knew they would). So now, people are proudly killing children in wars because their leaders told them to.

when he covers a huge loss, where do we see the action? Not in bitcoin, right? 
I'm a programmer not a economist futures guy that knows this stuff? That is why I am asking where the action is when they have to cover?

I don't understand? He gets walloped and his cover is taken care of by a function? Also what is LoC? 
Are you saying he gets walloped and it does nothing? Wall street is a scam, sheet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:20:41
Bitcoin is going to get slaughtered. I guess all the traders don't care. They'll just short it and make money (or at least say that). If we had any smarts or guts, we'd just say forget it. They will win again when we let them short it... Bye bye btc.

@_date: 2017-12-04 06:48:36
I'd have to study it. Don't they have to cover their position? Do they not buy a bitcoin (in some way) after they sell the one they borrowed? Do you think Wallstreet is going to push bitcoin way up?
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:32:20
short it with leverage. Get their buddy to short it with huge leverage. Hammer all the stop lose orders. Keep hammering it down, down, down. Smashing the shit out of it.
Why don't you people know this? Again, have you seen the gold market? No one ever answers that? They will slaughter bitcoin. Stop lose orders- bang, bang, bang... let's not let them short bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:03:53

@_date: 2017-12-01 01:17:32
Yes I do. Have you seen the gold market? The kuntz own it. The choose where gold goes. Btc is doomed if we left those kuntz short it.
They'll crush btc and then laughingly crush the next crypto that everybody jumps into. These money creators have been around a while. They know the game better than anyone. Let's not let them short btc. There has got to be a way to stop them? I wish we would do that. They would probably start  war.

I think it will keep going up. Although all the shit coins don't help. What about you, do you think this is the end of cryptos already? I'm still way up. How about you? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:39
Sure. 
Actually $200 will get you interested in it... and you're right to be cautious. Also it has been on a tear so it could correct... but a bitcoin correction is usually followed by a massive up. and it might not correct for a while? 
It's new technology, so no one really knows what it will do (probably keep going up with corrections. It dropped $3000 last week in a day). 
New tech to me means, it could go really high. 
There's not that much supply... of btc that is... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:48
What if someone is leveraged 1000 to 1 and gets his ass handed to him? He has to cover somewhere? Where is the action?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:44
I doubt he is disappointed? Would you be? He probably didn't know if bitcoin would even be noticed. 
In my mind, Satoshi is the only genius in crypto land. Although there seem to be lots of others claiming genius. 
He created something new. That is what genius is. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:00:53
"another dip" they say... They don't know. No one knows. It is new. New thinks can't be gotten at like older things that people study. There's nothing to study. People just chirp. 
People we watch on TV are wrong all the time... but they keep speaking?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:39:28
What happens when they get crushed? What happens if they can't pay their losses because of the leverage? 2008?

Nice car dude. 
Now just start dollar cost averaging back into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:50:24
Actually I'm hoping someone explains to me why I am wrong.... 
but anyways I wish bitcoin people could just keep track of the real bitcoin price (no shorts) and we the people could just stay on track. If Wallstreet wants to play with some fake bitcoin price (charts etc) with their shorts, who cares? Somehow if we could keep track of the real bitcoin price and ignore Wallstreet, that would be awesome.
Maybe what is best for us is to be prepared to get out.. and into another crypto. Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin and I'm not really a fan of the other cryptos... I like ethereum but it has an unlimited supply. I don't want to sell bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:27:46
I don't know how I can be smug as I believe I'm an idiot. Mind you, I think we all are idiots. 
I guess some of us have come to bitcoin via anti-bank, anti-wallstreet studying and some have come to bitcoin via market trading.
Since I found bitcoin via anti-system learning, I certainly believe they are into crushing bitcoin. 
I believe they (Yellen, Demon, Bush, Hillary, Cheney, Hank Paulson, Goldman Sacs, World Bank, IMF, corporations, the list goes on.. controllers of youtube) are not with the people and bitcoin is something they want to ruin and control. I believe they control everything even the news.

@_date: 2017-12-01 16:13:55
They banksters will short btc, push it down hitting sell orders margin calls, further pushing it down. Then the banksters' friends can short it, hammering it even further down, hitting our margin sell orders (i.e. if it hits this number sell), Then the next banksters friend can hammer it with shorts, crushing it further through support after support. The banksters will make a killing crushing it down like they do with gold and bitcoin will drop, hitting all the sell orders and the rest of us with no sell orders will watch it push through all the support lines down... and then the next bankster does a huge short again... 
We should not let them do it. It gives them control of bitcoin. Plus they can leverage btc something like 1000 to 1 further crushing it. We're making it is easy for them. 
I've been on reddit begging people to not let them do it. I hate wall street bankers.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:47:17
It won't be me shitting on our party. Do you think gold is manipulated? 
I'm not shitting on the party. I'm trying to stop wall street from shorting bitcoin. Let's just say no to them. Let's keep the supply as is. If they want to buy then they can buy.

Thanks Tek. What is a BTC block explorer or you said a local wallet will show both? If I make a wallet on the blockchain and send them there, would I see both coins or is local wallet some special thing? I'm on Kraken, if I send my BTC to Kraken will I see both my BCH and BTC or will I be confused as I will be going from my paper wallet to only one wallet on Kraken?

It's not conspiracy lunacy. It takes time to figure it out. I can't explain it here. Check out gold future contracts on youtube. If you think it is lunacy and you can't trust youtube then so be it. These people have CONTROL of the money that includes gold. They're not our dear friends. Banks are known to fund the two sides of the same war. That is evil and also not a conspiracy. They use that word to brainwash you.
Check out the Libor scandal, check out Deutsche Bank and gold, check out zero hedge, check out gold future contracts and the bullion banks, ask yourself why did gold drop as hard as stocks during the 2008/09 financial crisis, check out the documentary "Inside Job." and a ton of other stuff. You want to let Goldman Sacs short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:01:49
that's not it. I love bitcoin and basically hate bitcoin cash but I hate Jimmy Demon more and I know they are going to paper short the hell out of bitcoin. The real buyers won't be able to fight the bankers. You can see how they do it in the gold market. I know people think it is a conspiracy but it isn't a conspiracy just like a bunch of other things that aren't conspiracies (come to think of it). If we go into another crypto, we won't get crushed.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:41:24
they'll just run it down. They won't buy bitcoin (obviously). They'll short bitcoin. After a while, probably right away, a gazillion dollars will go into shorts.
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:37:42
Yes it sounds great. It's billions time... but for me I can only think like this, we can create a scenario that is bullish and happy times for btc. It makes sense but are there any glossing over areas? Things we don't want to look at because we prefer to see it go a specific way? Why doesn't gold rise if arbitrageurs purchase more metal than they sell short? Also in your fourth paragraph first sentence you say: "weeks to months." Do you mean it is bullish for  weeks to months only?

You don't know about the owners? If you knew you wouldn't say don't worry like it is nothing, believe me. Do you think they are either not there or are not able to screw with people? Who are they?

I actually have some bch... but more btc. Quite a night in crypto land tonight. In the face of sounding idiotic, it definitely seems strange beyond the usual with btc going straight down and bch going straight up. I know there have been other bitcoin nights of huge moves... Those are gone and now we have this one. I just looked at it. It's huge. I mean bch has gone from about 300 to 2000 in 2 days.   With bitcoin that would be about 6,000 x 8 = 48,000 btc in 2 days.

I became anti-bank when Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke took trillions from tax payers for their behaviour. I figure if a company screws up, it should not be bailed out. 
I'm against the money creators. It annoys me that we owe them mass amounts of money every year just for creating the money we use. They're like blood suckers on the economy. I'm against the money creators being a private corporation. I believe we should just create the money for ourselves. 
When I see people like Greenspan and Stanley Fischer talking, it seems to me they are chuckling at us and playing games with obfuscation.
Anyways, there's lots of reasons not to like banks... or the regulators... or the politicians like Larry Summers. 
Do you trust them? Here's a 48 second video from the movie "The Inside Job."    
        
Also it seems to me, banks lend countries money which goes to corporations like some oil company and corrupt politicians and when the country can't pay the interest on the debt, the corporations and the banks take over ("well you owe s all this shit now and it is growing...") and the people starve.
I don't think the bank people give two shits if children starve. We can do better then this shitty system. It's not hard. The hard part is getting the owners out of the way... because they have armies like the industrial military complex... and people don't understand what is going on.
I believe they want to crush bitcoin. The controllers of the USD don't like competition which means they aren't very good capitalists. I don't believe they could care less about capitalism or communism... I could go on and on.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:03:25
not joking. Have you seen the naked shorts in the gold market? See, our owners push stuff down, like gold, by purchasing short positions... and since bitcoin is against the bank cartel, they have lots of money. If bitcoin goes up on them, they can just short more, easy for them. They obviously don't buy a bitcoin when they short so they will happily and laughingly butt-f**k us- short, short, short. No problem for them. Just check out "gold futures contracts." Then Jimmy Demon will push bitcoin around like a snot nosed kid. Does anyone know if they will be able to short other coins? Perhaps it is time to fully move into ethereum or bitcoin cash? Either that or we could not hand over the keys to the owners? How about we don't let them short sell us? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:45:16
Banks don't have to cover. They just short more and bust the few buyers (you can see it in the gold market). They'll end up being a few billion USD in actual bitcoin purchases and a few trillion USD in paper shorts. We should probably go into ethereum or bch so as not to get owned by the cartel. The short squeeze doesn't come. Jimmy Demon just buys more eventually busting the real buyers.

If all the btc developers (miners and corporations) are into changing bitcoin to something called SegWit, then who did you lose out too? 
Next time you want to change btc, just say you've discovered some new code that is going to help btc and don't change the name, don't even fork it just do it if it is better.

Yes it does have a long way to go, for sure. It's a fun ride, fun to watch, fun to make money... Anyways creating currency from debt is a bad idea because then it puts people in debt to someone else. 
People would argue and debate and create college courses arguing that there is no other way to create currency other than on top of debt but I don't listen to the so called experts. 
 
Our money is created and leveraged from debt. Also war is good for the economy. These are stupid evil ways to live.  Not to mention our society is a totally paranoid, fearful, anxiety-ridden society.

e0nflux, your points are valid but stop and think outside of your memory. Bitcoin is going down right after Segwit tanked. I agree a health correction is good and is due for bitcoin. I'm not crying. I know how bitcoin works I was around for the first run up three years ago. 
I'm not saying my ideas are set in stone... but I'll try one more time. Segwit just died. The companies lost. Bitcoin is going down steadily. Bitcoin cash is going up steadily. Bitcoin cash is owned by these corporation people. Korea is buying true. I guess that is a fair answer to my point. Here, I'll go check coin market just a sec. Korea is the top buyer at 35%. That's actually good. Pretty severe pump. Bitcoin cash is up 80% at $1731 USD. huge.

Outside of Bitcoin, I have heard from the gold bugs how the American Dollar will crash... By using my own grey matter, I realized that countries like Venezuela and all the other countries where the dollar crashes, they stock up on the American Dollar, not Bitcoin and not gold and silver.
If you think about it and you lived in these countries, you'll realize that you you would buy USD. So the USD is the safe haven, easy to buy, they can use it in a store, and it holds its value. I'm sure that is what people do.
They may buy bitcoin, gold and silver but the main safe haven is for sure the USD. I've never heard anyone say this about the USD, so it is something to factor in.
