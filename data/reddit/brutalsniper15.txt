How can i easily find bitcoin in "the street" :D
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:18:05
Yeah i know I dont have a job so i will need to buy slowly i think that 0,15 btc is good enough to get for 1 year
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:24:37
Im gonna buy btc for those 200 euro i will aslo buy other cryptocoins later.
I want hodl bitcoin maybe i can use it to buy a car or something when i grow up.I want to learn about it and adopt it.
Bitcoin to me is the future.Im interested in bitcoin becouse of the tech.
Bitcoin can do send transactions whitout a middle man (Screw the banks lol)Its also a currency.
If bitcoin goes to 1 euro i wont sell but buy more.Would be pointless to sell.
