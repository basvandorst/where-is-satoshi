Are they really liable for financial advice given by people who aren't specifically employed as financial advisors?
It seems unlikely that would hold up in court since no reasonable person would take financial advice on a 6 figure investment from the IT guy or the Janitor or anyone who isn't a financial investor.
I can see why the guy got sacked, since he lost them the investment and shouldn't have talked to the financial guy about anything, let alone bitcoin, but the client seems oddly skittish.
This is like me walking into a car dealership and having to listen to the IT guy talk about how cars are the spawn of the devil and how everyone should ride bikes or walk, and then deciding not to buy a car because of it.
That just doesn't happen because no sane person takes advice on buying a car from the crazy IT guy, it sounds more like the salesman just used the IT guy as a scapegoat for why he didn't get the sale.
OP's still a moron for talking to the guy about Bitcoin though, there's a time and a place to talk about certain stuff.

Yes, but the article implies that Reddit was somehow responsible for his death, which we weren't in any manner, and that that somehow invalidates our complaints about the current Satoshi scandal which is an example of a [Tu quoque]( fallacy.

Wasn't it determined that Sunil died before the bombings even happened?
So it's not like people caused him to kill himself over the accusations, he was already dead.
Obviously I'm not condoning what happened, but Reddit played as much part in his death as anybody else did, which is none.

When they let you back on the internet, how did that go?
Like, did you wake up to a letter about it or something?
What happened if you tried to buy internet before 2003?

Oh cool, thanks. The FBI = 324 thing seems like a funny way to transfer it.
I guess someone in the FBI has a sense of humour.

I'm a couple weeks into my research and it seems like Bitcoin is inherently unstable. Normal currency works as a guarantee. 
That piece of paper with "one dollar" written on it has no intrinsic value, but is backed by the United States government. You're guaranteed to be able to use it to trade for something of equal value, unless the USA government collapses, which isn't happening anytime soon.
Bitcoin also has no intrinsic value, but isn't backed by anything. Your 1 Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be worth anything tomorrow, or even 10 minutes from now. 
Another thing, is that Bitcoin is inherently unstable. It seems to be possible to compute blocks in a chain, but only release it to the public after your chain surpasses the common chain. At that point your chain becomes the common one. It would only cost $1 billion to recompute the entire current block chain. Easily within the realms any government or company and even possible for the richest individuals. 
Aside from that, someone could be out there computing their own entire chain *right now*, and there doesn't seem to be any precautions in place for that eventuality.
Like I said, I haven't spent months researching this, so if there's solutions to the stuff I mentioned, please inform me.

Then when?
The 1^st address recieved $150m or 144k bitcoins in one transaction just over a month ago in October, and the 3^rd address doesn't display the graph for me.

Address numbers 1 and 3 recieved all their bitcoins in a single transaction?
Is that unusual given it's tens of millions of dollars?
