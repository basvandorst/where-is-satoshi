Very similar to the Bitstamp hack in that respect.  Price was falling days before the hack so people starting depositing coins, giving the hacker more coins.

Probably read the thread you are linking to first.
ACH transfers are working fine, signaling USD reserves are not the issue here.

I don't get why this sub is up in arms over this.
It makes a lot of sense for them to halt trading, especially when a market has no liquidity.  All they did was prevent uneducated traders from buying BCH at increasingly higher prices.

See status page, they have disabled those pairs until January.

Digital currency is not at all insured by FDIC.  For Coinbase, their digital assets are insured by Aon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:12:24
You make it sound like they are benefiing from not opening those pairs yet realistically they are still protecting users.


Why would this be good?  People would lose money by selling way under market value.  Coinbase would still make money in fees - if anything they are losing out by not opening that pair and forgoing the potential profit.

USD is insured by FDIC.  Coinbase's digital currency is insured by Aon, do your homework next time.

What country?


Although they aren't 100% borderless, it is still easier to tip across borders with Changetip.  For example, U.S. banks would require expensive wire transfers to tip to someone in another country.

FWIW, I once got a $5 Starbucks gift card as a gift from a credit card company.  I personally don't go to Starbucks ever, so I went to a site where I could sell it and and ultimately got rid of the card for $3.20 (which is 64% of the initial value).  Idk if I would call this desperate, but I had no use for it otherwise.  
I think there is such an abundance of Starbucks cards that there are plenty of other people like me willing to do the same.

Yeah, but only for the sake of getting it out of the way (no more uncertainty if at least *some* Bitcoin regulations are in place).
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:36:39
Because everyone still views bitcoin as software.  Software has bugs, and people know a currency full of bugs will fail.  That being said, if bitcoinn can prove itself as a protocol that can withstand DDOS attacks and anything else hackers can throw at it, it could easily replace many other forms of transactions.  
Its all a matter of proving that the perceived 'internet money' can't be lost of stolen.  Things like multisig are helping prove the perseverance of bitcoin.

We all know you're posting this because you'd be jealous if anyone picked up 770BTC at $1 a piece while you had to invest $140k.  It'll all work out in the end, but you can't blame Chinese investors for capitalizing on a market that probably won't last much longer (at least in CNY).

There really should be.  There has been a lot of new ideas coming out of the altcoin community, and I'd rather read articles in a journal than rambling posts on BitcoinTalk.

Shit would hit the fan if the withdrawal were for someone at the Bitcoin Foundation.  Not saying I have any evidence for that, but the timing of the withdrawals and the (seemingly meaningless) Two Bit Idiot piece kind of make me think it may be big players who are closely connected.
Maybe Mark's resignation from the Bitcoin Foundation had more to do with the details of the Two Bit Idiot article, and less to do with their insolvency.
idk, food for thought.  It just seems unlikely they'd start preparing for public withdrawals this soon (not much time has passed between their bankruptcy and now).

This 'article' isn't even news.  If you write your congressman, you'll eventually get a response - the letter was likely written by one of Sen. Coburn's aides.  He doesn't give a shit about crypto, he's just pandering to constituents, which is fine.  
Congress would never let this guy testify - what qualifications could he possibly have?  Just a no-name journalist trying to get some recognition, though he seems past his prime.  No need to feed this troll, I simply unfollowed ZDNet.

I had an issue with Overstock + Coinbase a few weeks ago.  I sent the funds to the address, and it never acknowledged.  It automatically refunded me to the email address I gave Overstock.  I don't understand why it didn't work though.  Never had this issue with BitPay.

IF this is true, it reflects very poorly on your company.  As someone who has interviewed for coding/technical positions in companies, I know that there is generally an initial interview where you determine if the person is a good fit and then a technical interview where the person literally codes in front of the people he is interviewing for. You're supposed to present the potential employee with problems and have them solve these problems in front of you.  What company pays $20k a month to someone if they don't even bother to determine the person's technical skills?

How is different from buying Amazon gift cards?
I don't find it hard to believe that they "worked" with Amazon on this.  I would imagine that the extent of the partnership is: "Can we sell Amazon credits for Bitcoin", to which Amazon responds "Of course, just convert the Bitcoins to fiat and send to us."


Just like gift cards, the entire balance goes to Amazon.  No way to get it back.  Also, Amazon generally gives kickbacks to those who sell gift cards for them, so that would be why there is no fee.
@_date: 2016-01-24 22:49:56
Would be nice, but the real issue is fake tickets.  Ticketmaster can't confirm the validity of the tickets, so it is up to the purchaser at the time of the event.  Someone needs to figure out some type of trsutless system to confirm the tickets are valid before realeasing the fudns.  Bitcoin is only better once we can do that - otherwise, it only helps people rip off others.

Were you doing ACH transfers or wire transfers (I assume wire if Kraken).

What exchange(s) did you buy from?  Was your Chase account directly connected to any of them?  Just curious

The problem with the "total wallets" is the fact that it's a [vanity metric](  This means that it won't go down.  A more interesting metric would be active wallets per day/month.  An increase in this metric would indicate real growth.

Considering they owe about $72m, this means they repaid $850,464 of their total debt.  Most likely all of their profits since going live again on 8/10.  So $850,464 over 3 weeks.

TL;DR: Someone is challenging the legality of the New York BitLicense. 
One quote from it: "Defendants do not have the legal authority to define Virtual Currencies and therefore to regulate it without the express mandate from the New York State Legislature."
@_date: 2015-11-22 06:44:26
I agree that the step is worth taking.  It depends on the size of the company (most PIs doing these checks charge $750/person).  
As someone who has gone through and filled out the application, I was just letting you know that this step is the one that was most expensive and time consuming to us.  All other questions on the aplication were fairly straightforward.

I can't speak on behalf of all institutions, but we are set up with both itBit and Gemini to maximize liquidity.  The only thing that Gemini has over itBit is ACH deposits (itBit only offers wire deposits, though they say ACH deposits should be an option by the end of the year).

Yes, also your example doesn't apply. Coinbase is concerned with _online gambling_, and the legality of online gambling varies by jurisdiction.  
A bank absolutely would contact you if your debit card was being used on an illegal online gambling website.
