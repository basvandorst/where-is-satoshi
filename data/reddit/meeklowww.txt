Very good points, well said. I think the hedge part of Bitcoin is one of the most interesting, but least applicable to most people (one day I’ll get that lambo)

**Bitcoin shower thoughts:**
HODLing isn't JUST about waiting for the value to skyrocket.
It's more about waiting for Bitcoin to become mass adopted and becoming more valuable than fiat currency

I see what you’re saying.
I think it’s more so about the liquidity of the physical dollar as opposed to dealing with online currency exchanges and transferring funds. They can go impulsively spend the dollar right now vs having to wait.
Although if, sorry, WHEN, Bitcoin becomes commonly accepted at most retail locations there will be no excuse to not take the BTC

If I had to guess, I’d say a future inverse correlation with Dow/BTC. As the $ keeps inflating ppl will start to look for alternative markets for investment like crypto for more future value.

1. People are afraid to take risks and would rather have short term happiness with the $1.
