@_date: 2019-07-13 01:22:52
I get it. I also know it’s an un-popular opinion around BTC enthusiasts. I value privacy BUT financial transactions need to be transparent otherwise, how would you tax them? 
It wouldn’t take long without taxation for a society to devolve into complete and utter chaos. Could society one day function without taxes and be successful? Sure! But not now and not because of BTC. There is too much disparity between people and countries and governments. 
It’s been my opinion from the start of all this. For crypto to flourish, meaning adoption and legislation, the first thing to go is anonymity. Unfortunately.

@_date: 2019-07-12 22:56:30
Ya, I guess ill never understand people who use these kind of arguments and those that want anonymity. IF you hide money, whether it be USD, CAD, EUROs, BTC, etc...you are a criminal. You are not entitled (in a civilized society) to  hide transactions from the tax authority. You drive on roads, you have a police and fire force, you have courts of law and all the other benefits that come with taxation. Just because you are at the forefront of something big does not absolve you from your responsibilities to pay for the services you use. Coiners pray for regulation so as to legitimize this industry yet they don't want their transactions to be monitored....uh...that will for sure NEVER happen. If you are legit and have nothing to hide, then who cares? If you are hiding something....BTC shouldn't be the mechanism to "save you".  For BTC to survive, it will need to be regulated, viewable and taxable. Otherwise, trump gonna take it down!!! Let's move on!

A tokenized world is a stupid world. What I’m saying is that EVERY coin except BTC is useless.  BTC has very little use as is. If another coin comes out that is trying to be a BTC, well then that coin (LTC as example) shares the little use and thusly devalues both coins. Right now there is only room for one coin. BTC. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:41:33
I see no reason for other coins. The tokenization of the world doesn't make a lot of sense. A digital currency does, in my opinion. You cant use the USD, EUR, GBP argument as a need for different coins,  they are all fiat and the same. Honestly, a token to pay privately? never gonna get adoption. A token to access a supply chain? please. There will be money and digital money until money is replaced by digital money. This tokenization shit is pissing me off and wont last!!!

that is not true. There is noting more efficient about a crypto currency than digital fiat dollars. Nothing. Nano may be more efficient than a bank at processing but not more efficient than dollars are at travelling. I can email money transfer you 100$ in a fraction of a second through my bank or credit card. Period. What are you actually trying to say? You are trying to say (I imagine) that banks are slow and take a percentage of the transaction....true. But is this a problem with money? no! Does crypto solve anything I just mentioned? no, there are still fees and if there aren't today, there will be in the future. Ergo, fiat doesn't need replacing. The tokenization of the world is going to be the undoing of the whole crypto universe. I outright refuse to buy Nano to buy coffee, XRP to transfer my businesses holdings, BTC to save, BAT to surf the net, etc...etc...the world will not do this. Governments will not do this. Who will do this? redditors who think they are ahead of the game. Im not saying this is all for not. Just that we are straying very far from the original satoshi notion of censorship resistant, trustless currency. I don't and never have thought BTC was supposed to replace Fat currency.

BTC only works as a currency if Fiat DIES. Why on earth would I use Bitcoin to buy a coffee when I have a Visa card. Buying coffee with Money is not a problem that needs solving, ergo....we wont get there.  BTC is going to live on as a store of value that rivals gold, real estate, art, etc...it will never survive as a day to day currency. Alts could potentially solve problems and survive but we already have digital money. Crypto money will only outgrow actual money if actual money doesn't exist. Also, I love the BTC community but they are literal libertarians or poor economics students, Fiat will live on as long as no one defaults. None of the major economies will default. They just keep printing money. Someone already thought it through. This system we currently live under will never die. There is nothing wrong with debt as long as it is repaid.

I look at it this way. I live in Canada. I own Canadian money but I also choose to invest in US dollars. Why? because US dollars are better than Canadian dollars. I can trade my Canadian for US and make more money. US dollars are generally better than Canadian dollars. I cant really use American dollars in Canada. I also cant really use Bitcoin in Canada but I choose to invest in BTC because they are better dollars for investing than both CAD and USD. All three  can survive and there is a reason for all of them. Im quite sure none of them will eliminate the others in my life time and Im 40yo.

No it won’t. Wake up. What kinda fool would keep his money in a bear market anyway? You’re going sideways and down for years. Then the tech will be outdated. Virtually none of these companies are valuable and/or able to survive. BTC will be « outgrown » why keep your money in this for years just to watch it dwindle? Because you’re emotionally attached to this as you thought you made a smart move for once in your lives.

@_date: 2018-06-29 00:26:22
I wish you were right (we all do) but you are wrong. It’s not a conspiracy. Venture capitalists that have millions invested and their friends who have millions invested are 100% manipulating the price of BTC. There is a reason to do it. No laws against it and it is and always will happen. It is foolish to think otherwise.

@_date: 2019-10-27 16:55:08
it depends where you live. In Canada, the money you have in the bank is definitely yours and you can definitely do what you want with it as long as it doesn't break any law. The card you use to transact your money does not belong to you. You have the right to spend your money on crypto. You (apparently because it is your banks' policy) do not have the right to use the bank card to pay for it. Very clear distinction. Very normal.

Let me give you the best advice you will ever get on reddit. 
You  bought BTC to make money. You invested 500$. You arent going to make any real money this year or probably not even next year. 500$ of BTC now might get you a nice return in the coming years but not as nice as if you invest 1000$ now or 2000$ now. Youre thinking too hard. Put as much money as you can afford to lose in BTC WHENEVER you have the money. Buy a hardware wallet and transfer your BTC to it. Then hodl. Hodl for years and years to come. 
It doesnt matter if you buy 500$ at 9,876$ or 11,672$. You are waiting until BTC hits hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you decide to look at this day by day or minute by minute you will go mad. Buy and Hodl. Forget about the price entirely it doesnt matter. BTW if you do this right, you'll never cash out.

It’s very simple. The more people like BTC the more expensive it becomes. The more institutions like BTC the more expensive it becomes. The more governments like BTC the more expensive it becomes. It’s very simple. Follow the sentiment everywhere you can, not just Reddit. 
On a side note, I’m getting tired of people crying “manipulation” people are buying and selling. Period! This is a very very simple market to predict. Watch, BTC will continue to rise. People will take profits and the price will retrace a little to a higher low. Then we will rise again to a new ATH as more people realize they like BTC. It’s that simple. 
The beauty about this that everyone likes is that BTC itself CANT be manipulated. The markets can, sure. But, people like BTC whether they know it or not because it cannot be manipulated.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:18:10
No doubt
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:39:49
I understand the scam. Print fake dollars (USDT). Buy BTC on the market with the fake dollars. Drive the price of BTC up (artificially, because of fake dollars). Sell the artificially high BTC for actual USD. Make huge profits. After liquidating your BTC (and creating market crashes) for huge profits, you print more tether and repeat the cycle. There, I understand!
Here is what YOU are missing. BTC will not become worthless. BTC will become cheaper for a very very short period of time. There are still millions upon millions of people who want to buy cheap BTC. There are many use cases. After the market shock of losing billions in tether....BTC will rise to a new ATH. You can take that to the bank, friend. The tether scam will hurt BTC but only for a very short period of time. Like a week......the tether scam....is already factored in to the future of BTC.

@_date: 2019-04-19 00:12:01
this is the way i look at it. BTC wont lose too much value because it hasnt even come close to realizing its/if any potential yet. So it has nowhere to go but up. Investing now will maximize the amount of money you could make off it. There is the contrarian argument that would say that it never will realize its potential and thus crash to 0$. There is the third way of looking at it which you may come to adopt if you spend the next year reading everything pros/cons about BTC. It may replace dollars. Not tomorrow but many, many years from now. If you were to own one of the 21million BTC today and hold for many many years until BTC takes over then you wouldnt have a profit so to speak, you would probably one of the worlds wealthiest people. Who knows what can happen. One thing is for sure, you wont be able to benefit if you dont invest. Dont invest more money than you are willing to lose. THis is not financial advise, it is how I see things. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:41:01
oh Geez, you think the democrats running for office are socialist? I have no intention of starting a fight with you on this topic, friend. But words are very important. I come from a country that is not the US. I can guarantee you without one iota of doubt that you do not have one socialist or anything close to a socialist running for government. America has succeeded in duping the populous into thinking that **social programs** and a **socialist political regime** are the same thing. Or, that one is a slippery slope that leads to the other. Gawd it is sad to think how generations of Americans truly don't understand this!
I am neither a democrat, nor a republican. I actually cant even imagine a political system where you only get to choose one or the other. But, I can assure you, democrats in the US are not socialist. They predominantly look to fund social programs through government tax dollars. Social programs are programs funded by tax dollars that are designed to benefit the population. Ex. If the government decided tomorrow (by legislation) that 20% of the military budget were to be allocated to an infrastructure program instead, Americans would (in essence) receive new roads all across the land improving safety, comfort and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs **for free**. This is a social program. NOT socialism. **Socialism** is defined as **anti-privatization**. There is absolutely no one in the entire history of the United States that has run on an anti-privatization platform in one of the two major parties on a national scale. EVER! We already know that socialism in it's current form does not work. We do know that it costs us less money to help a citizen in need with a social program than it does to simply leave that citizen to the forces of the free market. If the recently un-employed aren't "helped" with social programs, crime rises costing taxpayers money, insurance, medical bills, etc.... If roads aren't maintained via social programs, injuries rise, cars are damaged, shipping is slowed, trade reduces, etc....dont get me started on public education. THIS IS NOT THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM. IT IS THE DEFINITION OF A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING COUNTRY!!! ONE WITH A STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET!! 
I understand your point that if a democrat were to become elected that the debt would rise because they intend to spend more than the repubs. on social programs. Unfortunately this argument is another thing the powers that be have led you to believe that isn't true. It is verifiable. Republicans add more to the deficit and the debt than democrats do. It is statistical, it is factual. Republicans do a fantastic job of cutting taxes (revenue) they don't cut spending....look it up. every modern day republican government has cut taxes while increasing spending (predominantly military). I hope this is clear.

You know you are right. I was wrong. I got caught up in everyone's misuse of the word. Of course, the US economy alone does crash every 10-15 years or so. But, when a maximalist talks about BTC over taking the dollar what they really mean is that economic collapse of the US. This is not certain to happen (was my point). It is likely in the coming decades that fractional reserver banking, soaring debt and debt costs, poor economic and social policies, etc..will collapse the US economy.
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:29:51
Im totally with you and everyone else who has commented so far. I just want to remind everyone that being a Bitcoin maximalist (like me) doesnt mean that BTC will take over the world. It doesnt mean we got it right and everyone else got it wrong. I would simply caution you about going too far. You cannot read the future. There are some points here that I just cant agree with.
a) there are a lot of people who believe that the US financial system is going to crash. They use the word inevitable all the time.  Inevitable means "certain". It is not certain that the US economy will crash. It is likely but it is not inevitable and therefore not inevitable that BTC will replace the dollar. temper your expectatinos. This whole experiment could easily be turned upside down and land you rekt. 
b) debt. Debt is a good thing. The thing about debt is that the financial system in the US is designed purposely to run on debt. Debt is good. Runaway debt is not good but the thing about debt is that as long as payments are being made....no one cares. raising the debt from 12 to 20 trillion will not bankrupt the US as example. 
c) BTC is "run on math" and so "no one can f\*ck with it" This is not true. The reason everyone thinks it is true is because it hasn't happened....yet. It is impossible to know if it is impossible to f\*ck with bitcoin. It will only be difficult until someone smart enough comes along and figures it out.
I could go on all day. I have one point. Bitcoin maximalist should temper their expectations. Continue buying. Continue hodling. They should educate the laymen but above all, they shouldnt go shooting their mouths off as to how smart they are and how dumb everyone else is.
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:09:44
Right, but you are still going on ...(technically). There is absolutely nothing in common between socialism and social policies. When the US buys the asphalt  to pave a road, they buy it from a private company. Not a government owned company. It isn’t government workers that are mixing the asphalt or doing the accounting in the asphalt company. 
The social program that pays for the roads, promotes and encourages private business. Government programs (without corruption) in civilized countries are the best because your government has to intention of making a profit. this is why there is a huge push and it will come to be that you get govt. paid healthcare. 
Socialism means all means of production are public from A-Z. There is not a dem or republican ever that wanted this. And just one more thing. A republican is raising your spending to a record high while cutting the taxes to its lowest point in some time. Every republican administration has done this since the dawn of time. So, republicans are more to blame than dems for the debt. At least the dems create budgets to pay for what they want to spend and they do that by raising taxes but NOT YOUR **TAXES** they raise taxes on the 1% and corporations.

@_date: 2018-11-20 14:42:29
that is your perception. There are others that have their perceptions and those people may be the ones to hold up this economy. I believe you are trying to create some sort of reason as to why this un-reasonable, completely speculative economy exists. That is futile. The point is it is here. Will you profit from it or will you let the opportunity pass you by regardless of whether it may survive or not? There is absolutely no one in this space that isn't gambling. As much as idiot redditors go on about how this is world changing tech...they are still gambling that a) it is world changing tech b) it will be adopted as such c) it will evolve in a positive form. It is worth a gamble for many. It may not be for you and that is fine as well.

@_date: 2018-11-20 21:32:08
you have done it again, friend. You have made a claim that you cannot support with any evidence. I use BTC. You just asserted that no one uses it but you are wrong. As long as someone uses it, there will be a market for it. It may not be attractive enough for you. You may not be skilled enough to trade in this market. You may simply believe that your pay check directly deposited into your account is sufficient and you have no want or need to enter the space. The point is, there is a market, it is growing regardless of a price retraction/crash at the moment. Your arguments, as much as I understand them and where you are coming  from, cannot and do not hold any value in this discussion. None of your claims are factual or even relevant for that matter. If you knew about a certain bug in the code that would cause the tech to fail. If you could hack the chain. If you could perform a 51% attack, etc..etc.. you would have valid claims against BTC. What you are doing is simply offering your perception BUT you are presenting it as fact. That, my friend is worthless because other peoples perceptions are just as correct as yours. You need facts and (no offence) you don't have any that I can see.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:32:03
ill explain like baby: there are people who like BTC and people who don't. People who don't will sell their BTC. When they sell it, it goes to people who buy it. Once all the people who sell it are gone, there will only be people left to buy it. Once the people who like it start buying it, the price will go up because there will be more people buying it and competing for price. At some point there might be news that makes MORE people want to buy it, when that happens....MOON BOI!!!! No-one knows what will happen next but it isn't more complicated than that.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:00:07
wow. really? I don't know. You're probably right on the tech side of things but think about it. Facebook is a game. I enter my email address and start playing. I cancel at anytime. I have nothing to lose. BTC the way we are talking about it is someone's personal finances. I don't think there is any chance anyone in the entire world would dump fiat for BTC entirely in the next 1-2 years. Then just think about a bank. How long before they give up money? a year? not a chance. Still fun times. my boss aint paying me in btc until he has to or he is better off doing it. I don't think that happens in 2020. Not by a long shot. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:01:19
in what sense?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:56:23
I just stole this from a guy off the front page...maybe this will impress you. I want you to know that I checked his FACTS. They are all correct +/- a couple of dollars. 
I am going to try and shed some light on these dark times. Let us go back to the early days... No, I'm not talking 2013 Mt. Gox bear market, I am talking 2011. Due to this recent crash, and the massive amounts of negative sentiment I have seen on this sub (although, their have been some positive ones), I decided to try and lift peoples spirits. I know I will be met with opposition, but this is just a viewpoint from a single viewer. Take it for what it's worth.
In 2011, the price of bitcoin crossed 1 dollar, and peaked at roughly 1.09, then dropped down to roughly .68 cents. A crash of roughly 37%, no biggie, right?
Later in 2011, the price of bitcoin crossed 10 dollars, and peaked at roughly 29.60, then dropped again to roughly 2.05. A crash of 93%, something a bit more drastic.
In April of 2013, the price of bitcoin crossed 100 dollars, and peaked at roughly 230, then dropped to roughly 66 dollars. A crash of 71%, a little less than the crash before, but still a pretty steep drop.
This is where the territory gets more familiar...
In November of 2013, the price of bitcoin crossed 1000 dollars, and peaked at roughly 1100, then dropped to roughly 180 dollars, a crash of 83%. This is where the modern day reddit legends earned their metal and stuck through the precarious bear market/winter/death of bitcoin.
Now, with all of those numbers said and done... How has this cycle of bitcoin been any different than the previous ones I just listed?
It crossed 10,000 in November of 2017, only to drop down to what we see today. At the writing of this post, I used the 19600 high and a 4500 low (which is obviously still subject to change, and yes I know we have seen 4100). With the 19660 and the 4500, this is a crash of 77% from the previous ATH.
This is no different than before. Sure, in 2013 there was Gox, sure in 2011 there were only undergrounders who knew about it, sure in 2017 you have the whales, the institutions, CSW, Ver, Tether and anything else you want to label as the cause of this. The cycles have repeated, not exactly the same as the last, but this is not the death of bitcoin.
Sure, it may crash to sub 3k, and I wouldn't be surprised if it does, but this isn't the end.

I don't know...this guy uses BTC. Apparently there is at least one person outside of exchanges that uses BTC.
Is there something you truly don't understand about the conversation you yourself started? BTC exists. There is a market for it. The tech is growing. I think we all understand that you aren't impressed enough with it but maybe you should stop saying things that simply aren't true. I read all your other comments. You present your argument poorly, you offer perceptions as facts. You are wrong about literally everything. Your argument is weak and juvenile. Simply put....grow up and stop blaming the wold for your inability to comprehend a situation. There are many reasons to own BTC and no, you don't need to approve of any of them. Good luck to you, bro.

Right back atcha jak-off. 
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:50:58
I’m not sure you really thought this all the way through. I don’t care where you live. If it’s industrialized, you cannot survive without your government. Public goods, public interest is paid for in the national currency the government collects in taxes. You can’t stop using government money. You’ll need to to pay taxes and / or public goods. How do you resolve that?
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:53:26
your argument seemed clear to me. Don't support the government by using their currency. Band together and crush "them" by using BTC. 
the argument was prefaced on the fact that a Chinese gov't could crush BTC if they wanted...and you were clearly arguing the opposite. 
My argument was that it would be very possible for just one government to crush BTC. If two or three banded together....it probably wouldn't take very long to do it all it. I have yet to hear a good counter to that.
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:20:24
Yes. It’s not going to happen the way you think.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:37:52
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:43:23
right. not American. still you don't really have a point and I still don't have a counter argument as to how BTC can stop governments that want it gone. which was the point of all this.
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:38:33
I just don’t understand how people get into trouble. Don’t you all just buy and sell or hold on Coinbase? How do you all get in so much trouble? If you guys are buying and selling in the 10’s and 100’s of thousands of actually money on the internet then you deserve all the pain you’re going through. You are putting real money on the internet into an unregulated market. If you are putting more money than you are willing to lose...you’re better off just setting it on fire. The internet owes you nothing and never will. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 17:03:19
What this guy said!  
Also, you are using a form of logic specifically tailored to your specific wants.  Demand for BTC will not automatically rise because the new supply per day is halved. We could stop mining tonight. It doesn’t mean demand will go up as a result. It’s only likely to happen. Not bound to happen.
@_date: 2019-09-07 12:48:40
You should have figured that out after your first squiggly line.
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:02:15
sorry but you aren't necessarily correct.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:15:44
Than to give up their entire economy? No that’s not true. This is a good point op raises that I have never seen an answer too. If a major economy was to be threatened and be on the brink of losing authority, they could invest 10s of billions to save 10s of trillions and retain power. 
I don’t think there is a way to stop that.

Apologies. I get it now. You are saying there is a clandestine force at work controlling the FED and that you weren't referring to govt at all. I get it now. My argument is still valid though. The USD is government money in that it is the legal tender of the land. Your government at anytime can legislate the USD out of existence but it doesn't because it is their/your money.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:21:41
I could ask you the exact same question, no? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:14:32
Right. Don’t put 10’s of thousands of dollars on coinbase. You’re welcome for the tip.

I'm giving my "investment" 5 years from Jan 2018. The price wont bother me until then. If I'm seeing steady profit, Ill keep going. If Im seeing steady decline, Ill probably sell. 
As long as you aren't gambling with more money than you are prepared to lose...you can keep going.

VERY squiggly trends indeed 
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:58:31
we've all been saying it. Sentiment is the  reason why this market moves. There is no doubt in my mind that the immaturity of those two morons and their public display of bullshit caused many to jump ship. It isn't THE reason but it was a catalyst and they should both be dragged out into the street and shot (figuratively). I will throw a little party when SV and ABC are done for good. Idiots. Egomaniac idiots!!
