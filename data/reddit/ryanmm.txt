Its not fair to make the assumption that BTC is just going to keep appreciating in value.

Combined fees between Mt.Gox and Coinbase are around $12
Net from the transaction at those prices is $104, so the margin is around 10% for just clicking a few buttons

What is most troubling are the increasing number of "good luck collecting taxes, assholes at the IRS" posts. These are many of the same people who will decry corporations who take advantage of tax loopholes and yell about "criminal" bankers and banks.
The weird irony of demanding justice and compensation for stolen bitcoins while singing the praises of an unregulated, untraceable ecosystem seems lost on some people.

@_date: 2014-04-01 20:22:43
This is really stupid. Bitcoin being currency has nothing to do with laundering money. You can launder money with anything. Real estate, casino chips, clothes ... literally anything worth money can be used in money laundering. The fact that Bitcoin does not have "legal tender status" doesn't mean anything when he is exchanging it for money with "legal tender status". He is grasping at straws here. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:08:11

Oh cool, thanks for the info. I'm not really going to buy a new video card for my work machine, I just figured that it just sits here, and I don't pay for the electricity, so why not leave it doing something productive.

Why would I buy anything with bitcoins? 
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:43:43
The damn lag time getting money in to mtgox is a serious problem. I would have bought hard at the 15/14/ and now $13 range, but will probably have to wait till like Thursday of next week to see any of the money I deposited yesterday.
Once you're in the market, its easy to sell, but the week or so wait to buy is just ruining things. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 10:56:23
It took like 5 days for dwolla to get my money, and now its a waiting game for me money to get from dwolla to mtgox.... frustrating to watch prices go from $15 to $28 waiting for money to transfer
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:37:43
Why spend money that will appreciate in value at a high rate? I would rather spend dollars.
@_date: 2011-06-10 16:27:17
Its definitely a possibility. With no dollars flowing into the the service, offers would dry up, pushing the market down. 
I had to wait close to 4 days to get money into the market, with delays like that, it will never be a serious market. 
@_date: 2011-06-16 16:06:18
so there is disincentive to spend bitcoins, and to sell goods for them? 
@_date: 2011-06-14 15:41:19
I feel bad for this guy, but keeping $500,000 in a relatively new, speculative currency is probably not the best idea.

@_date: 2013-04-24 16:49:37
People keep tossing that word around, but I am kind of skeptical. A lot of times we see these "DDOS attacks" after a big run up in price. How are we sure its just not Mt.Gox not being able to handle volume, whenever there is a big price jump, there will be many people taking profits (selling).
I really have no idea what is going on. When I see people cheering and yelling "new paradigm" when the price jumps up, and  "DDOS!, We're under attack" when it falls, it just seems like some weird rationalizing...
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:15:38
They can (and should) be taxed. The problem exists with the people using and profiting from Bitcoin. From reading this sub there is a heavy "taxes = bad" vibe, coupled with a strange notion that because Bitcoins are some decentralized, quasi-currency they somehow transcend the law. 
That being said, many of the people here have made such a (relatively) small amount on Bitcoins, that it is not an issue. 
That being said, I am awaiting the big front page post from some (theoretical) dude who dumped $70k in his bank account from Bitcoins earnings, didnt report it, and gets audited. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:18:45
You're not saving tho, you are buying bitcoins in the hopes that their value will increase. This is no different than buying into the stock market.  
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:32:34
How are you sure the manipulation wasn't pushing the price up, and now this is just the price leveling out?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:08:26
Investigate them for what?
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:40:48
Doesn't this make the exchanges analogous to the banks everyone around here hates? If what you said is true, Mt. Gox and other exchanges are telling people what they can, and can not do with their bitcoins, and if all coins go thru the exchanges eventually than ... banks.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:20:37
You get the coins at their price when they receive the money If a transfer is delayed for some reason there is no guaranteed spot price.

Its all well and good unless you mad a substantial amount and deposited it in a bank. Banks report any deposit over a certain amount. 
Mark my words we will get some sob story on this sub about some dude who made $100k then got audited. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:07:30
The issue isn't so much the DDOS, but the panic selling. Trading Bitcoins for speculation right now is almost like trading in emotional stock. There are no real "technicals" that justify these price swings in any direction.
Its very easy to see all the emotions at play just reading this sub-reddit. Chastising people who sell their coins ("weak-hands"), people crying bloody murder about bubbles, gloating about all the money they made, or crying about the money they lost. All examples of a market based purely on emotion. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:10:36
I've made some money playing this market, but its really hard to give good trading advice based on how volatile the market is. The best advice is to not read this subreddit, or at least dont act on it. People calling out "weak hands" and posting "hold spartans" pictures are only doing so because they have a financial stake at risk. 
Like I said before, trading BTC is like buying and selling emotion. There are no hard technicals behind the price, and for most of the people participating in the market, Mt.Gox is like "my first stock market".
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:02:39
Its funny to watch all this play out. People are very gung-ho about "the people's currency" until it starts to become clear why central control and regulations are put into place. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:51:02
Its not a currency, its a commodity. It's easy, just substitute the word "gold" or "silver" for "bitcoin". 
@_date: 2013-05-30 21:13:43
I agree with the article in that this is the ideal outcome of bitcoin. It should be noted however that bitcoin doesn't solve the real problem, which is greed. 
If bitcoin "becomes money", there will just be the equivalent of bitcoin banks, and bitcoin finance institutions, and bitcoin credit cards. I know right now it seems like that is not really feasible and bitcoin might be set up to avoid such scenarios, but trust me, when there is money to be made, people will find a way. 
You can already see the beginnings of this today. Mt.Gox has a very very large amount of control over the Bitcoin economy. Since the rapid increase in price earlier this year, there has been a large and noticeable influx of capital into not just bitcoins, but into companies whose sole purpose it is to make money off the bitcoin economy itself. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:32:39
I'm with you 100%. Its just back to my original point that BTC is extremely volatile. Preaching the "safety" of buying and holding BTC is kind of dangerous.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:38:36
You could be right, I really have no idea. 
I just know that in times of big price run ups and corrections Mt.Gox has had big lags (5-10 minutes). It just makes sense to me that during a crazy sell off their problems are multiplied exponentially.
I also know that this community, while great, is insanely defensive. People around here are very quick to cry fowl when something doesn't go their way. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:43:18
Volatile means the price changes, it doesn't necessarily mean up and down.
If there is even a 1% chance you are correct, that means that spending bitcoins rather than holding them as an investment is a really bad idea. Buying things in USD vs. Bitcoins is far more appealing. As long as the price goes up at a fairly quick rate, its role as an alternative currency (vs. an investment vehicle) is really weak.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:12:54
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:22:36
So you didn't read the article I take it?
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:52:02
You are correct in that by buying something and holding it, you are indeed saving it. Buying Magic cards, Comic books, and memorabilia is also saving in this sense. 
I am saying that it is very very risky saving. The original comment I replied to implied to buying bitcoins was a safe store of value and made people savvy consumers .
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:12:47
What is very normal?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:45:39

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:30:27
It wouldn't take hackers to do this. All it would take is a decent amount of money and some trading knowledge. Mt.Gox operates like "my first stock market". 
The bitcoin market is one that operates mainly on emotion. Nothing technical has really happened in the bitcoin world to justify such an insane explosion in value. There are people who see this, and know they can take advantage of it, simple as that.
P.S. I agree with the sentiment of some of the other commenters. Today wasn't a DDOS or some kind of attack. Bitcoin markets just couldn't keep up with the volume of stuff that was happening, and this isnt the first time its happened (never really on this scale tho).

@_date: 2013-04-24 16:56:34
Yes. That is the danger of markets like these. It would not take much money to mess with the market. That, coupled with the extremely over-emotional nature of the BTC market, it would not be hard to swing the price one way or another. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:15:22

Banks are still required to acquire the $1b to purchase the BTC. You have just added three steps to the process (USD&gt;BTC, Sending BTC, BTC&gt;USD). Right now there are fees associated with all three of those activities.
This scenario would also require some form of transparency and oversight as there would be significant taxes associated with the repatriation of that large an amount of money. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:41
:( nice move bro :(
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:26:09
Getting rid of taxes is not a good thing. I realize it sucks to have some of your money taken out of your paycheck, but its necessary for things to work in a manner we are used to.
To be clear, my statement is in reference to the idea that you alluded to about getting rid of all taxes. I am well aware of government waste and some of the more unfair taxes, those aren't really part of the discussion.
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:20:16
Ok, he is not asking how bitcoin should be used. He is asking this:
How much would this chain of transactions cost (assuming the price of bitcoin stays constant) -
$1mil  USD &gt; 
Mt Gox (presumably through Dwolla) &gt; 
Purchase $1mil worth of BTC &gt; transfer $1mil of BTC to PersonB &gt; PersonB sells $1mil worth of BTC for USD &gt; 
PersonB transfers $1mil USD from MTGox to their Bank (presumably through Dwolla
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:46:31
"I'm all in" "trust me" okkkk
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:34:16
That's what I am saying, for many people who are involved in the BTC market, this is very much "my first stock market" (which I dont mean as an insult). 
People who have been messing around and mining BTC years ago, now find them worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. These people might not know the first thing about how a market works, especially capital gains. 
I didn't mean for my comment to imply someone was intentionally trying to cheat the system, just that my guess is that many people trading BTC have no real knowledge of that system. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:53:55
"DDOS" is officially the most misused term on this subreddit
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:40:51

@_date: 2013-04-24 17:55:59
You are correct on all fronts. 
The reason that phrase bothers me, is that it signifies a very weak, immature market. What it says to me is that the people who really believe in bitcoin are going to be the ones burned the worst. When the seasoned traders and investors really start to enter the market, they will have the money and knowledge to toss around the "true believers".

This is where the problem lies. Paypal doesnt charge those fees (which are pretty reasonable) just because it hates you, it charges them to keep their business running. I will be curious to see how BitInstant (and other BTC services) can grow and not charge more fees. Volume alone will not scale their revenue enough to grow a business.

If you lose, you still get a trivial amount of BTC back in your wallet to signify the loss. That has not happened.

@_date: 2013-03-05 17:54:21
Like I said tho, anticipating a crash is a disincentive for merchants. If they are a converting the BTC to USD anyway, it's just far easier and less risky to get paid in USD. 
With BTC this volatile you can make a good argument that paying in BTC is similar (definitely not the same) to paying someone is shares of stock. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:50:08
noooooo i used the BTCs to make money, THEN I spend the money! 
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:00:15
You might be correct. The only evidence I have to the contrary is that I was speaking to a friend of mine (who is a very high level investor in the tech sector) about Apple becoming a payment processor, and he said that the payment processing business is quickly becoming a zero margin business.
Thats all anecdotal, but he knows his stuff so I trust him. With Paypal, you are also paying for piece of mind (in a sense). There have been several instances where I've dealt with scammy and/or stupid people, and you need to get your money back. Without some kind of guarantee, I dont think I would ever trust paying with BTC to anyone but super reputable merchants.

Wouldn't it be a bitch to do via Bitcoin as well? Both parties would have to have Mt.Gox accounts that are verified in order to cash in and out. That could take weeks. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:01:47
I really do hate that term. Chastising people for selling is kind of childish. It really demonstrates my point about this market being way too emotion-based. You realize you need people buying AND selling to create a market right?
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:40:02
if your instantly converting BTC &gt; USD, why even use BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:05:15
What about the technology caused the price to rise? The technology has been essentially the same since bitcoin started.
The price rose, and fell, due to speculation. If you really believe in the future of BTC, it doesn't matter what the price is. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:29:41
I am not an expert, but the way I think about it is "digital gold". The way it is traded is very similar to gold.
Thats not to say people dont trade currency, but I think this acts a little different, in that Bitcoins are measure in USD (or Euros or whatever). 
I think it doesn't really matter as much tho, because if you made significant capital gains trading currency you would still have to report that.

It's bad for merchants because, as someone who has bitcoins, I would much rather spend $400 on something than spend 10 BTC that could be worth $500 tomorrow. 
If you think there is going to be a crash, than the opposite is true. A vendor would much rather take the $400 USD than the 10 BTC that could be worth far less in the coming weeks.

What you describe is a currency.  
The point is that the volatility in the price of BTC is a disincentive to use it as means to send money.  
The last year is a pretty decent example of this. People who paid for things in BTC rather than USD when the price was far lower are worse off than they would have been if they had just paid in USD. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:17:48

Awesome!! When I bought bitcoins I had no idea they sold phones, tablets and PCs that revolutionized their respective industries. When you get a chance, share with us the financial data where bitcoin continually exceeded expectations and posted record profits. 
I just can't believe bitcoin has build up such a multifaceted global empire with unparalleled brand recognition in only a few months!! It took Apple almost 10 years!!
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:43:15
In the technical sense of the word, you are correct. Buying packs of playing cards hoping they will increase in value is also saving.
In the financial sense of the word, I would not consider an extraordinarily volatile  investment "saving". 
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:23:15
It's pretty funny you bring this up. In my own experience, and many many others that I have read, their "customer support" is terrible and callous. From what I've gathered, their attitude on most issues seems to be "too bad", even when the error is on their end.

Mt.Gox keeps going back and forth on whether or not they are being "attacked" or just can't handle traffic. 
If I were running Mt.Gox and traffic crashed my exchange, I would 100% tell people I was under a heavy DDOS.

I dont think this can ever happen. The reason Paypal is so popular is because of the protection that it provides for fraud.

There would be nothing to stop me from just selling 100 of the same E-Ticket to a concert all over StubHub and eBay and just disappearing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:42:24
See I wouldn't call that a DDOS, because I don't think the intention is to really crash the Mt.Gox. I think it is most likely trading bots applying the same type of trading algorithms used in normal stock exchanges, Mt. Gox just cant keep up.
