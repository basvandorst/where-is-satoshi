Awesome. Thanks for sharing this.

It is hard to understand this because you're typing in broken english, but I *did* understand what you are saying.
To say that a question that somebody else asks is nonsense, just because you know the answer? That, I don't understand. Your logic is nonsense.

"What are you actually *DOING*?"
Haha. Thank you. This video rules.

We're there, guys lol

I hope you aren't being sarcastic but I approve either way ��

I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or you're high.
Also, the map that your link brought me to doesn't seem to have a legend. I don't know what the shaded areas represent. I have a feeling that it has to do with bitcoin but isn't relevant to the question.

How is it a nonsense question to ask if there is any realistic way to estimate how many individuals own bitcoin? 
The "volume of bitcoin usage" and the amount of individuals that own bitcoin aren't necessarily the same thing. My question was very clear.
For a self-proclaimed bitcoin "Yoda", you sure are uninformative.

Wouldn't that be nice
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:52:56
Interesting 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:05:25
Same. The map had no legend when I tried to see what he's talking about.

Said comment is an adequate answer to the question it responds to.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:18:09
The opener of his comment gave me the impression that bitcoins potential of a "fiat killer" was the main concern.
People are recognizing bitcoin's trend of increasing in value, while their fiat currencies decrease in value. This creates incentive for people to hold bitcoin instead of fiat.
People wanting to hold bitcoin instead of fiat increases the demand, and thus the rate of bitcoins increase in value, while simultaneously decreasing the demand for fiat, which in turn increases the rate of its inflation. The increase in inflation further decreases faith in fiat, leading to further dumping of said fiat. It is a slippery slope.
To no fault of any particular entity that I know of, at the moment, bitcoin's existence has become detrimental to the value (and in turn, the existence) of *all* fiat currencies. 
It's impossible to predict whether trends will continue or bitcoin will be stopped. If trends continue the way they have, fiat doesn't appear to stand a chance.
That's the message that I was trying to convey.

You're not supposed to say that.

I'm not sure what you think that u/AdamJensensCoat asked, but you're asking me to clarify things that I never claimed to know in the first place.
Q: How could bitcoin be a fiat killer?
A: Speculative attack
Now you're calling me "diminutive" and telling me that my response is "obtuse". Whatever, man.
