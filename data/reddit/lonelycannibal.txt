Let me know when he authors a book about ["the real Mohammed"]( or makes a lot of Muslims uncomfortable, for that matter.
Edit: Also, let me know when he calls out the Quran as being [""preposterous," "fanciful," "obviously contrived," "riddled with the most basic errors," "simply ridiculous," and "absurd to the point of comedy.""]( as he describes the New Testament.
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:55:59


This is not about whether I agree with the New Testament, or any other religious tome.
You asked me to "Cite one direct statement he has said about Christianity, which he doesn't also extend to Islam."
To my knowledge, Reza Aslan has not penned any criticism of the Quran that is on par with his criticism of the New Testament.
That may be because the Quran is the inspired message of the One True Prophet, but I rather suspect it's more likely that Reza Aslan is too timid to examine his own beliefs with the rigor to which he subjects others'.

I disagree.
In the first case, it would be disengenuous to say, "Firm fined 2 weeks' profits" when an individual is being fined. The headline should rightly say, "So-and-so fined 6 month's profits".
The "weeks of profit" metric is intended to show how easy it is for the corporation as a whole to continue operating unaffected by the fine. Which it does.

Yes indeed, I feel qualified to state, based on seeing his media blitz to promote the book, that:
1. His public persona is sufficiently repellant to ward me away from his writing.
2. If his statements regarding the content of the book are honest, then he is subjecting Christianity to scrutiny that he withholds from Islam.
I suppose as a corollary to number 2, I should say that if his statements regarding the content of the book are dishonest, then he is also intellectually dishonest either way.

Yeah, I've seen that clip...
As much as I dislike Fox News, repeatedly answering "I am an expert!" does not qualify as answering a question, much less "demolishing" the host.
He also [misrepresented his credentials]( (his PhD is in sociology, not "the history of religions", and he pays his bills as an associate professor of creative writing, not a "scholar of religion... who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades".
That interview is him baiting Fox News (who is, admittedly, notoriously biased against Islam) for PR. That Fox New responded predictably is, well, predictable... but if your strategy is "I'll go on Fox News so I can look good by comparison", what does that say about you?
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:46:38


No, trying to frame his refusal to answer a simple question as religious persecution just qualifies for the "self promoting shill" portion of my description.
The reason he is "intellectually dishonest" is that he subjects the Christian faith to heavier scrutiny than his own religion.

My mistake, I thought you were referring to the CNN interview, which I've not seen, only scanned a transcript of.
Since you seem to be a most devoted defender of Reza Aslan, I will assume you are completely unbiased and objective.
It couldn't possibly be that you are simply replying because you enjoy provoking a response from me... like a troll would.
I do admit complete ignorance of his book (other than his own descriptions of it). I then explained (with sufficient clarity for anyone who's not the leader of the Reza Aslan fan club, apparently) why I don't plan to waste my time reading critiques of Christianity penned by a Muslim who also happens to be a shrill shill.
You'll just have to deal with that, or come stand outside my window at night and read the book at the top of your lungs. No interest in communicating with you further.
You are now tagged as "President of the Reza Aslan Fan Club".
Edit: As for  I was saying that a brief verbal nod that Christ was crucified does not count as an equal criticism to an entire book, anymore than a buried retraction in a newspaper balances out a front-page headline. You seem incapable of admitting that you are incorrect, though, so disregard that point- after all, I'm already done talking to you.

I never claimed he wasn't qualified. He's qualified to write a book about whatever he likes. It's a free country- anyone is qualified to write a book about any subject they wish.
Here's the thing-
If you're going to make your entire argument, "I am *an expert*, ma'am!", you'd damn well better make sure your credentials are impeccable.
Instead, Aslan misrepresented his qualifications in a very self-serving fashion, to such an extent that rather than belabor it, I will just encourage any interested readers to [read the article I linked above.](
In closing, I repeat my observation that he never answered her question, which he could have done by saying something in the vein of, "I feel that Christianity merits study regardless of my own beliefs."

I agree; the inherent value notion is nonsense.
Other than electrical conductivity and malleability/extrudability (for metalworking), I don't see any inherent value in gold that is absent from dirt. On the other hand, you can't grow crops in gold, so it's kind of a toss-up. ;)
The main characteristic of gold that has allowed it to be used as a currency is its scarcity. In that respect, Bitcoin is its equal- each are finite.

@_date: 2013-09-21 21:03:10


No, but taking pains to maintain the secrecy of your actions does ensure they don't qualify as civil disobedience.
If you have issues with my definition of civil disobedience, take it up with Henry David Thoreau. I'm just quoting from the horse's mouth.


"I, anonymous internet user, actively profess my refusal to obey certain laws!" So brave. I'm sure that's what Thoreau had in mind.

I have already explained why you're wrong. If you need further refutation, just read [the essay]( that coined the phrase "civil disobedience", the same essay that inspired Gandhi and MLK Jr.

If only boldness imbued truth, you might have said something of merit.
In fact, the essay wherein civil disobedience was defined does say the exact thing you claim it doesn't, "Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison."
You are free to disagree with it, and you are also free to craft your own school of thought reflecting your disagreement, but it is disingenuous to let your armchair philosophy masquerade as Henry David Thoreau's.
Apparently 4 people dislike what I'm saying enough to downvote every reply I make here, but it remains true that you're not engaged in civil disobedience when you order weed in your bedroom. You're also not engaged in civil disobedience when you smoke weed in the privacy of your own home. This is true whether or not the activities I just mentioned are legal in your jurisdiction.
@_date: 2013-09-21 22:58:59
The act is secret in the sense that it's not public knowledge.

"Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison", as I already paraphrased earlier.
Thoreau doesn't explicitly say that hiding behind peer-to-peer networks to disobey the law in secret is not civil disobedience. I wonder why.
However, he does say, "If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose."
The only way to present that alternative is to rebel openly.
