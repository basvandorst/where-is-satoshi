Looks like the one sending this message hates his/her job.

I'm gonna consider this as not sarcastic and say thank you, krespRowlands!

India is a self-proclaimed "secular" country. There is still no clarity here on crypto, but it's more or less considered illegal.

I think it'll be interesting if someone does.
Imagine for BCH and BSV:
'Why not? Because the founders don't like each other'
@_date: 2019-03-20 10:54:15
Someone should make this for all cryptos.
@_date: 2019-03-20 13:02:50
Yeah. I'm lost as well.
@_date: 2018-10-09 07:56:59
Why not both?
As in, I certainly agree that it is a revolution in technology but it started off as a form of investment. It does play a role similar to stocks in the market although I know it shouldn't.

You mean anus?
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:02:34
Yeah. I was making a joke there. Ignore that.


That's my point. That's why it would be interesting. People answering shit they don't know.

That tweet can actually be used again.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:12:39
My bad. Yeah, it is bigoted
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:48:42
How is it not?
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:04:11
It sucks how bitcoin is always related to some criminal activity :(
@_date: 2018-11-01 06:34:46
Oh. Could you provide a source or a link on it?
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:30:13
Isn't that racist?
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:48:28
In other words, keep hodling!
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:28:53
Wow that's awesome. I think we should have this for normal websites as well
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:35:10
Shit. Sorry

Saudi maybe. UAE isn't a "tyrannical" country. I have personally stayed there a few years and I know that country is quite open to society and latest technologies. In fact, most of Middle East is welcoming crypto and blockchain into their countries
@_date: 2019-01-30 05:58:19
That really does sound like a great idea. Someone should start making something like it soon
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:25:53
Well, that's a trading axiom. 
What matters more is when you buy and when you sell
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:01:43
Just because it has Islamic in the name, doesn't mean it's bad.
@_date: 2019-01-28 09:13:20
Oh no :(
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:54:48
I know what you mean. 
Even I feel things went too fast in 2017, making 2018 a kind of a confused year (something in between both extremes). 2019 should probably be a break for Crypto Markets so that other companies and governments actually leveraging crypto can do their work in peace.
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:24:30
The instability is killing me, yet exciting 
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:08:16
3 years is a long time...
