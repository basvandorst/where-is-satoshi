That section doesn't prohibit the federal government from making paper money, it prohibits states making things like JerseyBucks or Vermont Green Mountain Backs.

I wonder how much of this is a legitimate opposition to Bitcoin and how much is an easy way to write articles that get people fired up, resulting in more ad views.

I think you left out the part of the story where everyone around started applauding you.

A century and a half of Supreme Court decisions would disagree.

What you describe could work but I don't think it would have the effect you'd like. You have 1 bitcoin, you send it through a scrambler and into the target address. From that address, you send the coin to a scrambler and back into the target address. Repeat however many times you like. The chain will show whatever amount of bitcoins coming into that account, one by one.
The problem is that it would also show the money leaving the account, so as soon as you say "Ha, someone must have paid the ransom, they must really want to keep it a secret!" they'd have plausible deniability and could say "You can't prove you didn't just pay yourself the ransom; there's no evidence it was me and therefore no evidence I have anything to hide."

...and they all moved away from me on the Group W bench.
