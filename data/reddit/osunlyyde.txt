You're not seriously suggesting to put your savings in the most volatile currency in the world are you?

You guys all assume that people don't think ahead, but the whole point of Bitcoin is that we already know there will be no more than 21million in circulation, that's what influences the price today. Not how much is created per day.

Just got this article in my inbox and thought it was a pretty interesting question. Almost no one is using it for payments currently, and I don't see that changing any time soon. My bet is on digital gold.

Okay I'm going to stop here because your replies have no content at all.

No most bitcoin doesn't get spent on anything other than other altcoins or fiat currencies because people won't pay with a valuta of constantly increasing value

Hello, thank you for making an exception. It's true that it is very difficult to find these people and even more rare to get a filled out survey back. I wouldn't have posted this request here if we hadn't already tried many other methods, so my apologies for that. We already approached and for example.
So thanks again!

Well maybe that's an exaggeration, but definitely the vast majority are either instutuinal investments or people who bought some bitcoin as investment but don't know much about it.

Great analysis. Easy to understand and very sound argumentation. I definitely recommend watching the whole video.

Ah I assume you're talking about the email address and the anonymity? 
For those who want the results and do submit their email address, the results of the survey will be scrambled and disconnected from their email addresses according to the university's research guidelines! So their email addresses will be stored separately to receive the results, but will have no connection to the answers they have given.

Oh, my bad! Let's just say it's short for a university level research, haha.

Thats very weird because each of those transactions have like 30x more volume than the eventual total supply of Bitcoin...

"I wanted to force the fucking Trezor to cough up my PIN."
That made me laugh. That peace of mind was definitely worth 30k.

Something weird is going on. There were a few trades that traded more volume than total BTC supply, plus my blockfolio app shows I went from 400 euros to 1323 BILLION EUROS...
