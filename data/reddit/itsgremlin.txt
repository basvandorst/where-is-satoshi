I made a cold storage tutorial 2 years ago. Still holds: 
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:00:51
After I decrypt the key, I use mycelium on android to send the coins and yes, as you mention, that step is potentially vulnerable. This risk can be mitigated by storing coins in multiple paper wallets. I use the same BIP38 password for all as I decrypt it offline. I would say the risk you take here is worth not doing all the steps you suggest above to remove all risk.

While I agree with you that faith would falter for a bit, another crypto is certain to take the reigns and gain the greatest network effect in the long run. This one will be the one that proves most useful. The problem is that Bitcoin is one of many and the Bitcoin that I bought into way back when is more closely matched by Bitcoin Cash at this time. I've been a strong proponent of increasing the block size for years. Those who stifled this increase will be the ones to blame for BTC's demise.

When you get no answers, you know your question is a great one. (no sarcasm).

Since it's a fixed time they have to spend on withdrawals then it makes sense to charge a fixed fee and not a percentage. Maybe you can get hold of this Greg fucker and convince him to reduce the fee for you to something more resonable for the time he spends manually organising the withdrawal.

Good luck remembering yours :) Now you have to remember a set of arbitrary rules along with other nouns. I don't think this is for everyone though and this is why people lose bitcoins using brainwallets. I've given my BIP38 password to my wife and if I die, she won't have a problem gaining access to them. It's very easy to remember and doesn't have to be very long at all to keep my bitcoins secure. Also, people can only attempt to crack my password (which it's not worth trying to break anyway) if they find my paper wallets.

You don't need to remember multiple BIP38 passwords. Only one.
My point is that if you are going to use a random 12 word password you don't need to use BIP38!! This has enough entropy to be used as a seed. You don't seem to be getting this.
I'm not suggesting that users rely solely on their memory, only that they understand when it's useful to use the BIP38 protocol and when it is not.

You can post the public address. People use that to send coins to you. If you post the private key then people can use that to send coins away from your address. Make sure you never give anyone your private key. The public address will start with a 1.

"Except the bank can only lend out money that it actually has in its reserves."
“Where does money come from?  In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood. The principal way in which they are created is through commercial banks making loans: whenever a bank makes a loan, it creates a deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money." - 
What do you think the word 'fractional' means in fractional reserve lending? They only need to have a fraction of the money they lend out (i.e. create).

It depends on what happens. China reverse their stance, this happens. Another minor country's gov starts stealing their people's money, this happens. Nothing much happens, the price will increase but much more slowly. The last two bubbles were initiated by an exposure of Bitcoin to a new community (Cyprus, China), this will be where you see large bubbles happen.

With Bitcoin on the block, property isn't what it used to be. Security will mature no doubt, but you should reconsider how you view property. The very essence of Bitcoin is lost when you niggle over who owns what. The blockchain now tells you who controls what. What was once under my control is no longer. I shared that control with the world and someone decided to use it to take the control away from me and into their own hands.

Bitcoin is the first decentralised digital currency. This means that there is no one person or group controlling the supply of bitcoin or its distribution. Bitcoins can be sent direct from person to person through the internet without having to go through a bank. This means that anyone can join the Bitcoin network and use it to send as much or as little bitcoins as they like with significantly reduced fees, no cross border limitations, and no unexpected blocks or delays on transactions.

I like to single out the banks and hope that the state can side with the people on this one. If it were up to the banks alone, there would be no game to be played as Bitcoin requires an on ramp mechanism and if the banks collude to pull this away, growth will be much slower (not saying it still won't happen).

Services like bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com can be saved and then loaded offline. If fact, this is how you should be using them. So along with all the BIP38 addresses you create (paper and usb stick), you save the html pages with them... this way, even if the software changes, you always have a way to decrypt your addresses. Also, you should again always use these html pages offline to decrypt your paper wallets before you take money from them. You don't use your phone or a webwallet for this. The reason is so that your BIP38 password is never exposed online and can never be hacked.
EDIT: when I say offline, I mean on a computer that has not and will not touch the internet to be perfectly safe. If you just switch your wifi off, key and screen loggers can still upload information when you reconnect.

I've not converted any fiat back to bitcoin yet in the UK but looking at getting my money over from South Africa, I came across this company: 
For example, I would deposit ZAR (South African Rands) into their bank account in the UK and they would do the conversion to GBP at a rate that is probably better than any bank. If you move more money they give you a better rate. I've not used them but it's where I would start when I bring the money over (ZAR is slipping).

I'm pretty certain you are correct and that it's probably fine with extremely high probability, but there's that tiny chance that something has changed since everyone was happy with it (updates etc, which would include changing the hash) and I don't want to risk my entire life savings on this. I'd rather be absolutely 100% safe and generate the private keys myself. It's really not that hard.

When Bitcoin gets to the stage where multisig wallet providers send you those emails when they detect a large amount going to an unrecognized address (an outlier payment), you might actually like these sort of emails to confirm you have actually initiated the payment.

Lets assume the input space is 100 large. You pick random numbers from this space trying to guess a single number within. You never pick the same number. In the beginning your chance of picking the right one is 1/100 half way through it's 1/50 and if you managed to fail on the first 99 then it goes up to 1/1 or 100% to get it on the last pick. Now instead of 100, the input space is extremely large so that this odds increasing applies only so slightly that it's not of any practical use to say they increase.

Yes, word lists have high entropy if you assume that all characters come from the full unicode set, but if you assume someone is using a list of words the entropy is actually quite low. Even if you assume that they are using alphabet characters, this reduces entropy a lot.

On their front page: "Your account details at mcxNOW are not exposed to multiple underpaid and/or undereducated persons. But if you forget your password or lose your google authenticator you may face delays up to 3 months to recover it and a fee of $100.
To avoid this all you have to do is backup your password and google authenticator secret key so that you can always recover it yourself if there is a problem. If you are the type of person who routinely forgets their password or are too stupid to read messages like this one please do not use mcxNOW."

Nothing needs activation, all addresses in the entire address space (almost infinite) can hold bitcoins it's just a matter of generating the private key and seeing which public key it maps to.
To 'watch only' you only need to supply the public key. I have 9 watch only addresses in my mycelium wallet with the BTC that I'm saving split among them. You only need the private key to take the coins out of your paper wallet. The private key should never touch the internet until you take all the coins out.
I made a short tutorial because I'm paranoid about these things.  I found this the best way to make sure that no hacker or physical theif can ever take your coins.
@_date: 2014-12-19 10:06:15
Oh, I'm sorry, you weren't being a dick then... you just didn't know.
Currently the place I use to go long or short is on Bitfinex. Just send bitcoins and then use them as collateral to borrow either dollars to go long or bitcoins to go short and use the margin trading tab to execute this borrowing and trading automatically for you.
Just a word of warning... it's an extremely risky time to be shorting bitcoin, you stand to lose all of it. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.
When you've sent your bitcoins to Bitfinex you'll realise that Bitcoin actually has some decent use cases (where else can you trade without a broker) and you might not be so quick to short it.

"As to whether transferring bitcoins to another party would be subject to Goods and Services Tax (GST), the answer was also a one-word “Yes”."

It's more effective if big miners do it. Can't they use statistics to find out if you are messing with them and give you the boot?

If you aren't profitable anymore because this is happening on a scale larger than yourself, then switch away for a bit and attack them again later when they do pose a threat.

That analogy is inapt: 
Copper, silver and gold all have certain properties which make them fit for the purpose of being money: "the name coinage metals is used to highlight the special physio-chemical properties that make this series of metals uniquely well suited for monetary purposes. These properties include ease of identification, resistance to tarnish, extreme difficulty in counterfeiting, durability, fungibility and a reliable store of value unmatched by any other metals known."
Their value is therefore only limited by their scarcity.
Contrast this to the world of cryptocurrencies where one is born every minute and and their value only depends on the network of people that use and trust them. I won't go into why this makes Bitcoin far superior and highly likely to out compete all other currencies but you can read this article if you are interested:

Just because the seller is getting the money doesn't mean that a localised bank run can't happen. If some local currency is losing value and all those people are buying bitcoins to hedge, the seller might be sitting somewhere else and it doesn't matter if the money is going into those other bank accounts.

This is only true when you think in fiat. When more use bitcoins, this problem vanishes. I agree with you about the hackers and rent seekers but people will build more secure options and rent seekers must compete in the free and hopefully minimally regulated market.

@_date: 2014-01-05 01:45:12
No. All transactions get broadcast to the network so without a small mining PC you would be able to see if the network got this broadcast (blockchain.info). The chance of your small mining PC solving the proof of work problem for the block containing your transaction is practically 0 so you can't keep the transaction fee here either (

@_date: 2014-04-28 17:34:55
I think it's easier to generate the private key yourself than try to understand someone else's complex javascript code. A private key is just 64 hex numbers so you can get one by rolling a 16 sided dice 64 times. This is without using a computer! Or if you have 16 16 sided dice you can roll them all 4 times. If you check my post,  there's an easy way to convert 100 6 sided die rolls to a private key using a standard linux command (which I don't need to check is trustworthy because it's a standard). No, I'm not Richard Stallman ;D

I'm extremely glad someone else is bringing this up. I wrote an email to Blockstream about this potential issue 5 days ago but have not received a reply yet:
"I very much support the concept of sidechains because they strengthen
the value proposition of Bitcoin, but isn't there a long term problem
here? If people move their bitcoins off into sidechains because they
are functionally better, and the Bitcoin block reward reduces to a
point where it's majority fees supporting Bitcoin miners, won't there
be a drop in security of the Bitcoin network because miners lose their
incentives? If the fee structure in Bitcoin changes to a market
structure and there is less and less demand for making transactions on
the Bitcoin network, won't the prices for these transactions rise
creating a positive feedback look which creates even less demand for
the network and an exodus of bitcoins into the most popular secure
If this is the case, is there a way of making the sidechain/Bitcoin
relationship symmetric such that chains can get their coins pegged
from an arbitrary chain and not only from the Bitcoin blockchain.
Forgive me if this is already how it works. I've not looked too
heavily into the details. This apparent long term issue with the
sidechain setup (should their relationship to other chains and Bitcoin
be different) has just occurred to me."

"And why were they wiping their arses with paper money?"
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:57:00
Surely you can fit the difficulty increase with an exponential function and work this out? So the first one paid for itself and now a second one? Is that including electricity expenses? If so, that's good going.
What I'm interested in is replacing my heaters (oil based electric heaters) with miners. What is you opinion on this? Is this viable? Does your miner produce heat like a heater? You see, I already use electricity for the heater, why not mine with it at the same time? If I have the miner connected to a themostat that, say, switches it off and on every 3 minutes, what is the load/boot time of the miner and how long will it be mining for in the three minutes that it's on?
So many questions. I only want to get into this if it can replace my heaters.

Yes, that's correct. They could. The network effect is strong though and the people working hard to grow the network have a stake in it's success. If another alt wants to take bitcoin's place, their supporters will need to work harder or it will need to have far superior qualities to counter the network effect.

So, petertodd said this to me but I didn't quite understand the last bit, have you considered these things?: 
"if they're honest then yes, you really do earn slightly more at ghash.io, and decreased cognitive costs are a real issue"
"p2pool has huge costs to run in practice for real miners - just setting it up sucks up time for instance, and it's design means that those with lower latency than others get an unfair advantage"
"so basically the thing is a pool will never orphan themselves, which means given a x% orphan rate, the pool with 50% hashing power has x/2% higher revenue"

Hello Jimmy
If the bitcoin community are helping you out, why don't you reciprocate and leave your donations in BTC. I understand that you need to pay staff etc but both the Bitcoin community and you (potentially) stand to gain more by holding for a while. Instead of using coinbase to hold your bitcoin, look into making a paper wallet and asking people to send bitcoin there.

If you are only paying £7 over the exchange rate on big exchanges to buy locally, that's only 2%, which is an insanely good price to buy locally. The reason that Bitcoins aren't cheaper here in the UK is because the banks aren't allowing businesses to set up accounts for the Bitcoin related businesses. Hopefully this changes over time.

Not really... more bitcoins for supporting Bitcoin (as you say). It takes out one giant whale and makes all the tiny whales twice as big. This is distributing coins because they will be split to small holders too.


You are correct here: stupid people will be stupid, but there will be some that change their opinions because of this.




I agree with both of these, but some of the population doesn't and seeing alt coins market caps diminish might be good for all these stupid people.

This sounds like a good idea. It would at least help with this problem... "I assume blockchain.info sends first tx to 1st half connected peers (about 500) and second tx to 2nd half connected peers (about 500) at the same time. Then merchant bitcoin-qt see 0-confirm tx with 50% likelihood and reject the one going to yourselves with a fee. Obviously, half miners have your tx with a fee, but this tx is almost sure to be included to the blockchain as the 2nd half of miners with no fee transaction are not likely to include it to blockchain quickly".

This request is related to this thread: 
What about a site with two groups of users. The rich and the poor. The site requires that the poor upload to their profiles a story about their community as well as pictures showing their struggles. There should be some way that this is not easily made up (the hard part of this site). Then the rich donate can donate to whoever they please. The rich can create a profile to show others how much they have donated, or they don't even need to register but can just send to the address registered by the poor. There should be detailed information on the site which show the exact steps that the poor can create and secure their bitcoin wallet and information about how they can exchange those bitcoins for their local currency.

Can you code? If you can, search google and find the Bitstamp price since the start of it's existance. Then create a moving window with width of your choosing. Move the window along and calculate the standard deviation. This will give you standard deviation over time. You could fit a function to that plot but you should just be able to use your eyes to estimate where you think the volatility will come to your acceptable level.

don't use brainwallets (unless you have a very good reason to)... if they are secure, they are hard to remember and if they are easy to remember they are not secure. I advocate BIP38 with a single password over multiple wallets that you never use to decrypt your wallet online with.

Let's say you have 20 participants and you want to give them each $10CAD. You buy $200CAD of bitcoin with your university's money, then at the time they do the experiment, you give them $10CAD worth of bitcoin. You suffer the fluctuation risk yourself here so if bitcoin goes up in value you make a bit of bitcoin yourself and if bitcoin goes down in value you lose a bit of bitcoin yourself (in this case you have to supplement with your own bitcoin). Uni pays $200CAD, participants get $10CAD at the time of experiment in bitcoin. I recommend using Mycelium wallet. Paying in your currency is as easy as pie.

Everything is fine but this statement:


Currently this is not the case as the wealthy, together with the state, bend laws to create cleptocracies which siphon wealth from the lower and middle classes. While they have technically 'produced' this wealth in the form of money printing or lobbying to gain monopolies, they have not acquired this wealth in a level playing field and in a manner proportional to the benefits they gave their trading parties while taking it off them.
The presence of a corruptible state seemed to be lacking in your comment. Besides this, sure, free market, the wealthy should have what they deserve.

What is wrong with forcing blocks to have a fixed size while propagating by adding filler data? Any blocks which aren't the required fixed size are dropped by other miners. This way the miners will have incentive to make blocks that are full of transactions. In a similar way to how the difficulty scales, this fixed block size should scale depending on the number of transactions that are left in the unconfirmed pool. After a certain number of confirmations (say 50), the blocks which have filler data in them are trimmed to exclude this filler (I'm not sure if this breaks the chain of hashes or if this can be worked out somehow). This reduces the overall size of the blockchain. I'm sure this idea has flaws that I'm unaware of so please let me know.

Bitcoin is currently used first as a speculative investment, second as a store of wealth and third as a medium of exchange. People not already transacting with Bitcoin will need to acquire some to use the Bitcoin rails. They will probably want to get more than they use for everyday transactions as getting in and out of the Bitcoin paradigm is costly. This should negate this increase in velocity you are concerned about as the demand for bitcoins will surpass the volume used to transact.

Bitcoin is vastly different from gold because of its use as a medium of exchange. Sure you can use gold, but there are huge problems with doing so (it's impractical and easily counterfeited). These vanish with Bitcoin. I'm not sold on golds future because of this. In fact, I wouldn't touch gold. As soon as people realise that gold is no longer required, the flood of value from gold to Bitcoin could be staggeringly fast.
The current volatility is a real problem, I agree. 
Your friends would be fine. You could pre-warn them if the trend becomes obvious. Only those that didn't heed your advice will suffer.

You're right, I think we need Bitcoin going first before we make code that ties our shoelaces. If Bitcoin can't uphold faith from the majority in its value proposition in the face of a competitor, I see this as being quite bad for the crypto space in general as people will be unsure that their value store isn't just going to migrate to the next fashion in currency. This is why I abhor your attempt at creating a competitor, crowdfunding for it and then pumping it through marketing. Are you aware how Stephan Tual constantly spams various groups like this one (at my university):  ? Instead you could be contributing you skills towards Bitcoin dev, making it stick for sure and then once it's mainstream, going onto the things that provide other functionality. Do you know that scalability is a problem that need quite a bit of work on? Maybe you don't understand what's at stake here. If people lose faith in the value store of Bitcoin, any crypto is less likely to achive mainstream adoption and any new functionality you provide has less chance to pervade society. Is Bitcoin too limited for you? Are there not ways to build the functionality you desire on top of it or inside a sidechain (which may have it's own issues)?  
Are you able to mention similar toolkits that compare in functionality and rank them in order of popularity?

If you believe in bitcoin w.r.t. it's global adoption (i.e. an increase in value long term), then why not keep a BTC account that customers pay into when they buy things. This way you don't have to pay someone like bitpay their 1%. Of course, you take the risk for these purchases now if BTC drops in value but I would say that it's worthwhile especially if you hold them long term. Now you don't have a problem refunding your customer the same BTC they paid for the item.

- Bitcoin, created circa 2009 as opensource software, was the first solution to allow consensus across a distributed public ledger (Bitcoin network).
- Bitcoin's first application has emerged as the transfer of raw value (bitcoins), where an account of ownership is stored at all nodes on the Bitcoin network and no third party is required to effect a transfer.
- Metcalfe's law applies to the Bitcoin network, i.e. the value of the network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. The more people using Bitcoin, the more useful it becomes. 
- bitcoins have value because the supply is limited (there will only ever be 21 million) and to transact on the Bitcoin network, you need to obtain bitcoin 'bandwidth'.
- Bitcoin works on a private/public key pair system, where the space of these keys is practically infinite. The private key is picked at random, the public key is generated from the private key in a one way manner, and the bitcoins are stored at the location of the public key (or address).
- A user on the Bitcoin network uses their private key to send bitcoins from their address to another address, and once transferred, these bitcoins can only be sent away from that address using the private key associated with it.

All exchanges are linked via arbitrageurs. When there is profit to be made because the prices go out of sync, they step in and take it. This keeps the prices in sync. All exchanges! People selling on local bitcoins might buy their bitcoins from an exchange. When Bob buys locally, the seller might rebuy from the exchange affecting the price on that exchange. Because of this new buy, an arbitrageur might then sell on that exchange and buy on another affecting the price on both. There is no one price. This is why sites like bitcoin average exist.

Someone took litecoin and put a dog on it. It's ahead of peercoin now and bihind litecoin with a market cap of $92M currently. It's got mad community support and they are pulling out all stops to make sure it's the go-to crypto-currency for tipping on popular social media platforms such as twitter, youtube and facebook. This is where I expect the common person comes into real (not media) contact with crypto and begins to use it. It's not about the technology this time, it's with the effort people are going to to take this to the moon. If you send your BTC to Cryptsy right now, there might be time for you to catch 300 satoshi as it breaks (don't buy before). If 300 breaks, I expect 400 very soon after. Good luck :)

Hopefully this post addresses all of your concerns relating to BIP38: 
a) yes, you can use the validation tab and check that the public address is found.
b) I suggest using your spare always offline computer to do that (get the private key from the encrypted key) so that you don't have to reveal you password to mycelium, this way you can use the same password for all your wallets. Never use the wallet again and send all the coins out once you've used the private key.
c) answered in b)
d) don't trust anything with large quantities of bitcoin... generate the keys offline youself using dice.
e) in your head, if you use the same one for all your wallets you don't have to remember a lot. you can share it with people you trust a LOT.
This is less convenient and more security. If you want convenience just take small amount from your secure location and use whatever wallet you like. Make sure you enable 2FA on your email and anywhere else you get the option.

The only reason I have bitcoins is because of Bitcoin's fixed supply. If Vitalik did in fact say this: "My view is that no one cares about supply (how many people even know how many US dollars there are in circulation?). People do care about price, so stabilising price is more important, and that requires having the supply be adjustable based on price via some metric.", then he's far less intelligent than people suppose him to be. If people want less volatility they are free to make use of something like Coinapult's locks feature.

Confirmations depend on when blocks following the one containing your transaction (the first confirmation) get added to the blockchain so the speed of this depends on how much compute resources are mining and in fact is tweaked by shifting the mining difficulty so that confirmations occur every 10 minutes on average.

The point is so that you can print paper wallets and keep these encrypted keys without worrying about someone finding them. This allows you to make multiple backups. Don't forget your password though otherwise you will lose your coins. You can use the decrypted WIF to spend the coins using something like mycelium and when you do it's advised that you spend all the coins. Here's my tutorial for doing this properly and safely:

@_date: 2014-11-27 11:56:12
Maybe this helps? I spent a lot of time looking into this and came up with the following solution which I believe to be extremely solid (if not unbreakable).
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:36:31
I'm no expert either, I'm going by the advice mentioned in the link on the post: "Two reasons. First of all, this option requires that you roll the die 99 times, but you do not get meaningful additional protection by rolling more than 62 times. Why roll more times if you don't have to? Second, I use the "high entropy seed" method to generate multiple private keys from the same die rolls. Using the Base 6 option would require rolling 99 times for every private key."
I think you max out the entropy with 99 rolls. Even if you didn't though, you want something physical that you can roll to make things more random. The dice doesn't have characters on it.
Yes you can enter in the numbers into the sites but then you are trusting their code now instead of a standard unix command.
I didn't even look to see what they do actually, I don't want to decipher what they do, I want to make it 100% hack proof. If I thought I knew what they did with their code, and it was easy to alter it in a way that the subspace of private keys generated was dramatically reduced without me spotting it then I can get fooled. Also, a third party might edit the code before it gets to me. I have to trust that the author wrote it. That's a lot of things to trust. With my way, I don't need any trust.

Well I do think that in Bitcoin that it's your responsibility to secure your private keys. I think that it's fine for people to take bitcoins away from you if you very obviously leave them in public reach, but if people are actively trying to take bitcoins that people are in some way trying to secure, then those people can still be considered thieves. It's still logical to think that you deserve your bitcoins to be taken if you can't secure them with the tools that are available to you and think that people that are actively trying to take them away are thieves. Bitcoin allows you the tools to secure your bitcoins in a way not possible with regular assets, to the extent that thieves, no matter how hard they try, cannot take you belongings. If you don't use these tools, then things can get stolen from you the way they do in the physical world.

Why is the IRS taxing Bitcoin retroactively?
People say the IRS ruling is OK because you can also claim losses BUT the IRS are taxing Bitcoin gains retroactively. Bitcoiners and miners who have made massive gains have also taken massive risks and had Bitcoin failed, could have wound up losing their entire investment. Do you think they could claim losses then!? Of course not. Other people who have taken a risk on other unrecognised things that died a horrible death can't claim losses on those. So by applying their property tax retroactively the IRS unfairly acquire high risk gains while saving themselves from dealing with high risk losses (on failed things not Bitcoin). What gives them the right to do this? Why did they not apply their tax ruling from the current date? Why should the Bitcoiners in the US not refuse to pay taxes retroactively and agree to pay taxes on any gains from now?

I think it's a huge problem. Maybe you don't have any keyloggers or malware on you computer and so you have been lucky. It's like being mugged... in a country that has a high crime rate, the chances that you are actually mugged aren't that high, but you don't like living there because of it.
I'm super concerned about having my bitcoins stolen since I've bought quite a lot (since end Nov 2013 :P). I posted on how to secure them without worry. 
I like to think of it as GOD mode for bitcoin. No hacker or house thief is getting through that.
I welcome any new inventions that reduce this problem and make it easier for newcomers to buy without fear of theft.
EDIT: never had any bitcoins stolen myself.
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:43:51
Exactly. It's very secure... If I recall, someone posted an encrypted key telling people that the password was only 4 characters long and it had about 5 bitcoins in it... no one found it to be worthwhile to try and crack it. Mining was calculated to be much more efficient use of processing power.
My technique is to use the same password on all my BIP38 encrypted keys, but never use a computer connected to the internet to decrypt them so the password never touches the internet and you don't have to remember loads of passwords.

Once you scan in your private key you should take all the money out of that address because it's not considered cold anymore. Maybe it has sent them. Check in the receive funds tab. Blockchain.info sums up the amount in all your addresses so maybe that's why you think nothing has happened.

@_date: 2014-10-15 11:01:53
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:44:35
Yes, you are right. In all likelihood, if you show the public address from the visible private key like a regular paper wallet looks, then they would just check the public address see that it's empty and figure that this wallet unused. Maybe, to further protect yourself (if you don't want to use BIP38... which is more secure), you could move some money into that public address, and then some time later take it out so that it looks just like a spent paper wallet and it's not suspiciously empty. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:13:23
Yes, I agree that there is no evidence they did not reach out but I'm sure they would have told us if they had contacted the IRS and were receiving no replies some time ago.

If the legislation goes through, is blocking all NY based IP's an option for companies like Coinbase? Obviously this isn't fair for the people in NY, but then the companies can continue their operations unaffected by this and the people of NY will hopefully start a ruckus. I guess there is the issue of VPN and TOR but people all over the world surely can't be affected by the rules made by one individual!?

Hi Hazek
I've sent my latest deposit to the account details I had previously (UNICREDIT BANKA)! I got no email to inform me of the bank change and did not check the deposit information on the last transfer :(
Are you still in control of the other bank account to accept my money there? What do I do now? I sent my money on the 19th of August. It would have usually been credited to my account by now.

The best thing about this is that if they don't get found, you don't lose your money!
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:56:51
It will be a bank like bitcoind3 suggests, but not exactly like he thinks. It will more like a multisig wallet, probably 2 of 3 where you have 2 keys so the bank can't take your money or do fractional reserve. If you lose one key, you can still get your money back should the bank remain trustworthy. If you lose both you are screwed. Under normal use, you will use a single key and maybe a 2FA password. This bank will run the same outlier detection algorithms which temporarily block suspicious transactions and maybe send a text message to your phone to confirm that it was indeed you that authorized the payment. You can always force it through with your second key. There will be a way to extract your funds to another provider should the service shut down that exists separate from the bank service.
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:50:53
Maybe I'm not registered then... sorry for the confusion... I think it's lame that the password reset doesn't tell me this though.

@_date: 2014-12-11 13:47:36
While I agree with you in general, it's not really your place to tell people how to use their money. Because the ChangeTip platform is fee free when tipping, it means that tips no matter how small can add up for people.

Or if you are really paranoid and don't trust their code at all,  (ideas borrowed from moral_agent's tutorial).
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:28:47
In this case it seems to be the Mt Gox issues. I bought at $680.
Adoption will take time (if it happens) and this adoption is helped by companies like coinbase and bitpay who pay merchants back in their local currency so that they don't have to take bets on bitcoin. This is cheaper for them than accpeting credit cards. To get this local currency, coinbase and bitpay are selling these bitcoins on the exchange, but it's likely that anyone paying in bitcoin is buying back what they spend on the exchanges too. As bitcoin merchant numbers increase, people will realise that they can use bitcoins to purchase and that these bitcoins don't get erroded away by govenmental money printing.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:55:18
I'm from the UK and I've only ever used Bitstamp (with excellent service I might add). What other exchanges do Americans use to buy and sell BTC besides Gox?

I'll buy it when it can tie my shoelaces. Bitcoin is proven and has a growing network. Ethereum is a lot of talk and money raising without any tangible product (as yet). When I see something working I might consider buying into it. Until then, it's just a scam to me.

there is one exception to this... if you use some software to move a fraction of your coins from a cold storage address... most of it can be lost to the change address... so when you do paper wallets, make sure you always move all that is in the paper wallet. again, start with small paper wallets.

It's silly to make comparisons between countries. An exponential function is at work here. It's had it's time to build in the other countries. In a simple scenario where numbers double in a certain time period (it's not like this, it's a stochastic process), and one country has one infected and the other 200, then the progression will be 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 16 (oh!, that's so low!) while in the other country it will be 200 -&gt; 400 -&gt; 800 -&gt; 1600 -&gt; 3200 over the same time period.

Well as we get more adoption, a hard for requires that all types of entities that interact with the Bitcoin network (e.g. payment processes) switch over at the right time, otherwise the payments they receive will only exist on the discarded branch of the fork. This is why hard forking Bitcoin will only get more troublesome as time goes on.

Fair enough, just expect people to enquire why they can only buy a $100 good when it cost them $120 to buy the bitcoins... IMHO, this is very bad for general bitcoin adoption because the masses will feel very ripped off.

Wrong. If you have a good brainwallet password, you have to write it down... once you do that anyone who finds it can take your bitcoins. If you encrypt paper wallets with BIP38 then the password you store in your head can be much shorter and anyone who finds any one of the multiple copies of the paper wallet or cold storage device you leave places, cannot take them.

I had a discussion with a few devs earlier today asking about this. I was asking about a solution and basically advocating the same thing. I'm not even a miner and I get this... how are there so many people that think that miners should donate to support the network? Economic principles dictate this will never happen. Miners need an incentive that is built into the framework or built by others who are willing to commit their time.

Sure it does, buying a bitcoin means you get the ability to send 1 bitcoin on the Bitcoin network. If you are a big institution that wants cheaper transfers to other institutions who also use Bitcoin, then you need 'Bitcoin bandwidth' to facilitate this.

What? This is the silliest thing I've read all day.
If the price is low or there are too many miners they are maybe making a small profit or a small loss and they are forced to sell their coins creating more supply. If the price is high or there are too few miners they are maybe they can keep some of their coins because they are making a profit and there is less supply.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:36:34
Yes, keeping your bitcoins on a centralised exchange is a bit fucked too, I must admit. Luckily I had none there.

A BTC clone of whatever they can make will spring up in no time and it will have all the UI benefits (plus more because of the dedicated community) and more transaction benefits (lower fees, no waiting for merchants, no chargebacks etc).

You are correct, that is a good way to go about things. On the contrary:  ... Just be careful with other peoples money, it can land you in a lot of trouble if you get hacked. With Bitcoin, you need to learn A LOT and even then, holding peoples money isn't a good idea. That's why I don't do it.

The worthless part was a joke, but fiat does actually lose value in a world where people are paying more and more for bitcoin. To simplify the situation, let's imagine that there exists only dollars and bitcoins, that the dollar isn't getting printed anymore and that bitcoins aren't being mined anymore. Let's assume that there are 1000 dollars and 1000 bitcoins in circulation and that bitcoin is worth 1 dollar to begin with. Let's say that the total 'value' in the system is 2000 (1 value unit = 1 dollar = 1 bitcoin). Some time passes and for whatever reason (gov can't take your money is the best one), people have traded dollars for bitcoins such that the price per bitcoin is now 2 dollars. The total 'value' in the system hasn't changed and is still 2000. Now bitcoins make up more of the 'value' in the system (2/3 * 2000, or 4/3 value units per bitcoin) and dollars make up less of the 'value' in the system (1/3 * 2000, or 2/3 value units per dollar). Bread that cost you 1 value unit when the price of bitcoin was 1 dollar, would still cost you 1 value unit now which would be either 3/4 bitcoins or 3/2 = 1.5 dollars. The dollars didn't go anywhere... they just exchanged hands when people traded bitcoin for dollars. But they are worth less, since they can buy you less bread in this simplified system.

Intentionally hacking is the same as lifting someone wallet from their pocket or breaking and entering and stealing someone's things out of their house or stealing someone's car. This is more akin to theft and I think criminal law should be applied in these instances. This is different from taking someones things that they have left in the public domain.

You should send all the coins out of the paper wallet to your main blockchain.info address and dispose of the paper wallet. You can do this with the mycelium app on android as TogetherAs1 suggests... this is what I do.

@ W.r.t. this type of thing and future regulations: would it be worth building a collective of bitcoiners, say called the BAR (bitcoiners against regulations), where, whenever a new controversial regulation comes out, an email is sent to all parties and a vote cast (simple poll). If the vote is more than 50% against, then information about who and where to complain to can be given out and people can act en mass. 
I feel like a more organised approach to this might work better than an incoherent appeal when a new regulation/arrest/prosecution comes out. Does something like this exist already?

Reading that link I come across this: "I assume blockchain.info sends first tx to 1st half connected peers (about 500) and second tx to 2nd half connected peers (about 500) at the same time. Then merchant bitcoin-qt see 0-confirm tx with 50% likelihood and reject the one going to yourselves with a fee. Obviously, half miners have your tx with a fee, but this tx is almost sure to be included to the blockchain as the 2nd half of miners with no fee transaction are not likely to include it to blockchain quickly", referring to some double spend utility that existed on blockchain.info for a while. With this logic, the seller would get defrauded 50% on average no?
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:51:01
Looks like we do agree. Did you note the OP? It wasn't complaining solely about the distribution.

Not really, I make it very clear when I give them the bitcoins that I have the ability to take them away at any point because I know the secret key (a bit about how bitcoins works) and that if they don't transfer it to a new address themselves in a few days, then they haven't taken the effort to earn the money.

You are mistaken. There is a good reason. Circle act like a bank. They need you to prove your identity before you can extract your money. This protects you and stops hackers pretending to be you from taking your money. It's just as well you weren't storing the coins yourself otherwise they'd all be gone. I guess some people really do need third parties. You should be happy you can still get your coins back.

What he's saying is that if the regulations didn't give people such hassle when buying a coffee... "This decision is going to have every cryptography nerd in the world working on coinjoin and stealth addresses."... then people wouldn't have to resort to actively avoiding taxes because paying them is such a nightmare. If they had been made more sensibly so that taxes were only due on large gains (when transacting), more people would be siding with the law. Don't pretend that people don't already try to dodge taxes. The more difficult you make taxes for them (especially people who didn't even have to fill out tax returns before), then the more people are going to decide to dodge them.
I don't think he's advocating that this should happen, only that the govenment is making it very tempting for people with such a bent to make it happen by forcing their hand.

This is why it won't be done (at least from a rational actor)... because people will just switch to the next crypto, and then they'd have to do it again, and then people would switch to the next crypto and eventually the choice of crypto and the design on new cryptos would stop this from happening.

Memorizing is ok, but a little too taxing for me (you might have a better memory :). Piece of paper is not ok as now a mere physical theft will allow your bitcoins to be taken. Another advantage of the BIP38 is in case of death someone else doesn't need to remember the 12 words I need to and also cannot use those alone to take the funds, they need to be connected with the paper wallets... this is possible with the BIP38 encryption system as you can just ask your family member to remember your password for you (or maybe write it down somewhere - if no one knows who you are asking or even suspects that you have asked anyone) (it doesn't need to be that long because BIP38) and when you die you can ask for the paper wallets to be given to them.

Do you think miners would accept a mod to the core that filled up blocks to a community decided limit (1MB atm) with trash data so that they all propagated the same speed, and then, when enough blocks were added after that, the trash was pruned out of the blockchain? This way they would not be incentivised to limit the block size and would fill it with transactions. Good solution? Even if so, would the miners accept this?

Theoretically, the odds increase because the size of the input space is finite and the inputs are not repeated (at least I don't think they are). Practically, the size of the input space is so extremely large which means the odds increase so slightly it's almost like they don't increase.

None of those statements are me suggesting that people keep their passwords solely in memory. This is an advantage of using the BIP38 protocol that gets negated when people suggest that users of it have overly complex passwords.
I see you like to argue but I don't have time for this. Maybe that's why you are a mod. Please educate yourself about BIP38 and don't make silly suggestions in future. Just because you can do something the long or complicated way, doesn't mean you need to recommend this to others. If you told others that using a short password was sufficient, then they could take that advice and apply their own logic. To me it looks like you are regurgitating information that you found somewhere else in the forum but on a topic you seem to know little about. Maybe you were thinking to yourself... 'Let's just say use the strongest password you can come up with here, that will make me look responsible"

it's quite risky, but you can use Bitfinex to borrow fiat using your bitcoin as collateral, buy bitcoin and then hope to sell it for more later and end up with a profit in fiat which you can then convert to bitcoin. If you do try and trade on margin... make sure you know that you may lose your bitcoins (or some of them) if the price of bitcoin falls and you go long.

Am I right is saying that if a bit is a microbit then this would equate to 1 cent when BTC is at $10000? If so, this hardly seems useful until BTC is at about $100000 - $1000000 (but considering the rate fiat devalues, it may prove useful in the next 40 or so years).

The 'employees' (startups, coders, etc) of Bitcoin are right now working very hard to grow the payment network. When you speculate on Bitcoin you buy some in the hope that the network grows. When/if it fully matures, yes, there won't be any more 'investing in Bitcoin'. It will have it's value and everyone will use it because it has far less friction than any fiat. There are only 21 million to use though and if others want in on Bitcoin's bandwidth then they need to buy some at some point, raising the price.

Sure, let's do bits instead of microbits... then we need to change millibits to kilobits and bitcoins to megabits. That's all good with me. Satoshis would then be centibits.
Edit: People would already understand this because they (hopefully) understand how bytes, kilobytes and megabytes work. The notation would be very similar to data storage but we could replace the regular B (for bytes) with whatever people settle on for the ASCII symbol for bits (e.g. Ƀ (bits), KɃ (kilobits) and MɃ (megabits)). For Satoshis, is there a unicode S with a line through it like the Ƀ? We could use CɃ but that loses the name of the great creator.

Nono:  go to bulk wallet, print out 20 wallets and put 1000 bits on each (~$6 for all 20). Get people to download wallet apps to their mobiles (mycelium is easiest for loading funds) and claim the contents of the paper wallet. Mycelium is also extremely easy to use to load these wallets... will take you about 5 minutes.
Yeah, don't show anyone a paper wallet with a private key on it :)
If you are worried about people just throwing them away, make some backups and tell people that if they don't remove the funds in 1 month you will move it back to a wallet that you control. This highlights the fact that two people can have control of the same funds for some time and that this situation isn't ideal.

Even if you put some rolls into these sites you can't be sure that they aren't converting them to private keys that occupy a reduced subspace of all possible private keys.

I don't have any formal education in economics so please excuse me if my nomenclature is not correct. Maybe you can define your meanings of wealth and value so we can have a discussion. The logic still applies to a system in which the 'value' in the system is increasing, the numbers just change slightly.

Wow, your maths is bad. You can't say your $10 doubles during the easing while your $90 halves!
If you actually carry this out with the right maths you will see that you are better off converting to bitcoin.
I would pick the 2000 scenario... in that one you have $90 and $20 in btc. If you really prefer converting you wealth back to the original state where there is only 1000 around then you have the equiv of $45 and only $10 in btc.

Free will exists? I'm not so sure. I find it incredible that you manage to rationalize the 'evil is the by-product of free will' argument.

Bitstamp is fine. Try to limit the time your money remains there. Send money, buy coins, withdraw coins to your choice of storage.
I've set up my cold storage like this: 
Make sure you practise with small amounts whether you use this way or other ways of storing your money. Assume anything done online is only as secure as your computer. Assume that you have a keylogger installed sending back keystrokes to some hacker at all times. Enable 2FA on all services, especially your email.

I guess you assume then that these people would have still donated to you if you were not accepting bitcoin. I'm sure you are aware what immediately selling the bitcoin you recive does to the price of bitcoin. People send you bitcoins, and in return the price drops slightly. This obviously assumes that people aren't replacing their BTC when they donate.

Think of transaction history as a massive graph. If you were to 'mix' your coins locally you might generate a lot of new addresses and move them though those. This would come up as a sub-graph, disjoint from the Bitcoin transaction history graph except for an attachment to the whole graph with the address/es where the coins came into your sub-graph.
When a mixer operates, they creates nodes on the transaction history graph that take payments from multiple addresses and send them out to multiple addresses. This is also a sub-graph but the connections to the whole network come from all the people taking part in the mixing and then again when those people spend their coins after mixing. The more people used the more difficult it is to match the inputs with the outputs in this sub-graph.
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:41:19
This is pretty tight: 
The password doesn't need to be that long and you can use the same one on all the wallets if you decrypt them offline. I made 20 wallets and I've spent some of them enough times that that single password, I will never forget.

Ok then Mr. Wise, who gains from this increased productivity? There is not problem as such with an expanding money supply, it's who benefits first from it.

The easiest way is if you roll a 16 sided die 64 times (or 16, 4 times together). This gives you a length 64 hex number which is a valid private key (see  Then you can take that and use services like bitcoinpaperwalet to do the work of converting that to a public key and a BIP38 encrypted private key. You can also use their validate services to make sure you get back to the same private key you generated. I like to use both bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet so that I can make sure that my private key is not stored in memory and a lie fed back to me in the validate service. See my guide for the detailed steps:    If you use 16 sided dice you can skip all the linux related steps. You still need an offline PC that will stay offline to be 100% safe and for this I think linux is the best option.

This is why I think the decision for Dogecoin to continue with small inflation is great, because it shares the costs between the holders and the users. With bitcoin, it will be the users (the ones that make transactions), not the holders (the ones using it to store value) that take a hit.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:23:03
I'm not entirely sure how the protocol works, so if you want to know why you will have to do some digging yourself. All I know is that SHA256 is an extremely fast operation and decoding a BIP38 address takes at least 5 seconds on my old Dell. I think it's got something to do with the amount of memory it uses, but I could be wrong. 
I forgot to mention that I like to use multiple BIP38 addresses all with the same password, and because I never decrypt them online I don't have to worry about my password begin taken and I don't have to remember multiple passwords (dangerous). Also, make this password unique from all your previous passwords. There is also a chance that you want to write it down once somewhere and store it in a saftey deposit box somewhere, just in case you are in an accident and die or you forget it because of some event (I've not done this yet, but have told my wife the password multiple times just in case). 
Most important thing is start with small amounts... I made like 20 addresses, then moved 0.01 BTC into the first and made sure I could move that into the second from the first... then I added another 0.09 BTC and made sure I could move that to the third... when I was confident everything worked like I expected, I put a lot in.

That's a very nice chart. The only problem I have with the word bit is that people will transition from using millibits to bits (the latter being smaller than the former). The name bits suggests a 1000X increase in value not a 1000X decrease. If we want to use 'bits' then I suggest that we start calling what we now call millibits, kilobits.

@_date: 2014-04-03 11:00:53
Argument 1 and 3 are pretty much the same argument. Time will tell if BTC gets the majority acceptance. For point 2, I can store BIP38 encrypted paper wallets anywhere in my house and even with physical access, no one can take them. As far as gold holding it's value with a new player on the block (BTC), I'm not so sure this will actually happen. What might happen is that people start to trust BTC more because of it's advantages and the value stored in gold slowly (or quite quickly) makes its way into BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-20 10:23:34
I agree, but most people won't and once that happens, bitcoin banks that can lend will essentially create more bitcoin, devaluing yours.

Hi, the whole idea though is not trusting html code. You may be an honest actor but how can I be sure who's modified your file since you created it. You may also not be an honest actor (not saying you are). For example, if I type in my dice rolls into your website, how can I be sure that your site isn't generating private keys from a small subspace compared with the whole space of keys available. Without reviewing the complicated javascript, it's possible (not saying it is doing that). Then later, you, or the malicious actor that modified your html before I got hold of it, searches that small subspace of keys because you/they know how it was generated. I only use bitaddress.org to get back to the private key that was generated in linux because I can be sure it is using a different space in memory, I don't really care if the code base is the same. The worry with using your validate tab to do this is that your program could be storing the private key I inputted and feeding it back to me during the validate such that I do not suspect anything.
As for the number of die rolls, you might be correct, but following the logic that it takes 64 rolls for a D16 to obtain maximum entropy for the private key, I don't see how a smaller number of rolls of a D6 could accomplish this. Could you explain this further?

I think you are wrong :) An ETF is just going to be a way to speculate on the future success of bitcoins without worrying about securing them yourself.  More importantly, it allows stock brokers to legally buy bitcoins held by the ETF for their clients. When shares are bought in the ETF, bitcoins will be purchased to replace them. Here is some information on sidechains:

This is a common misconception. The bitcoins that he bought would be from the people that were willing to sell them for the lowest price. This raises the price.

Thanks for clearing this up for me. As long as it's consistent. I'm not from the US.
I guess the IRS are opening themselves to all the losses people make on investing in alts that don't succeed then. This means that if all the people that made money of these alt scams avoid taxation and all the people that made losses claim them, then the IRS are running a net negative EV from what their tax would have been without the presence of cryptos.

Satoshi Aug. 27, 2010: As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
* boring grey in colour
* not a good conductor of electricity
* not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
* not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property:
* can be transported over a communications channel
If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.

Yes you could sell the bitcoin that you purchased for $10 for $20 after the supply increase. I agree with that part. But that's $20/$2000. Then you have to look at your remaining $90 in the same reference frame i.e. $90/$2000. Networth = $45 + $20 = $65 is total horseshit. Either you pick the $2000 reference frame and your networth is $20 + $90 = $110/$2000 or you choose to think about what your money and bitcoin was worth in the original $1000 reference frame and your net worth is $10 + $45 = $55/$1000. Notice how the ratio of your net worth to the total supply is constant in both scenarios. Good luck filling in those tax returns! :D

Bitstamp is great. Just don't use instant order. Place limit orders yourself. For example, if you want to sell bitcoins and the current best buy price is $700 then you can put a limit order in for $650 and you will eat through the buy order book until you have no more money on your order.

The Bitcoin network has spread and continues to spread. Merchants gain many advantages from using Bitcoin as a payment option. When you buy bitcoins you buy the ability to use the Bitcoin network to trade with others who already use bitcoins. The network effect says that for each additional user, the usefulness of the network for all the other users increases (think internet). The network effect causes exponential growth failing a quick death. The fastest part of the exponential growth can be seen when something goes from being used on the fringe to becoming mainstream. We aren't there yet. If Bitcoin goes to being used in the mainstream it will likely increase in value by 100-1000x. If it doesn't go mainstream or something similar beats it to this end, it will likely go to 0. It is already however quite entrenched. The people that are invested in it are working hard to grow it.

2) People will quote prices in smaller denominations. These shoes cost 2 milliBits.

If you had an iPhone and were an avid bitcion supporter and Apple just pulled the last app you can make payments with, you would probably jump at the chance to smash your phone in return for an android phone. The people that don't want to pay tax are being retarded. Most bitcoiners feel that the tax applied should be at the level of foreign currency. The amount of money laundering and drug trade is negligible compared to the amount that happend in the current system on money/banking (see HSBC money laundering). The fact that bitcoin in it's past has stood rock solid in a den of theives is a definite plus and shows how unbreakable the system is.

We know you like Bitcoin and rightly so, but I think you fail to realise just how much Shapeshift.io helps Bitcoin guarantee its highlander position. Any shitcoin can be paid into a bitcoin accepting address using Shapeshift.io... This is massive. This means that shitcoin users are voluntarily selling their shitcoin to buy bitcoins before they purchase something, and they probably think this is a great thing. Why should merchants or merchant services go through the effort of incorporating shitcoins if this beautiful functionality exists, all made possible by Shapeshift.io. If the merchant hodls then this is good for Bitcoin but not for the shitcoin. I think you should be backing them. They are the best thing I've seen around here for a while.
Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with Shapeshift.io
EDIT: I agree that they shouldn't be supporting this obvious scam, but they have now looked into it and have stopped supporting it. What more can you ask?

Ok, assuming can actually play the market like this (which I doubt), he has 1 BTC the price of BTC is $600, he buys something for $600, then the next day or whatever time in the future, if he can buy the 1 BTC back cheaper he will only pay &lt; $600 for it. So he essentially keeps his 1 BTC and pays &lt; $600 for a $600 item... is this really escaping you?

Oh, that's not my reason for using dice and sha256sum (standard linux command). I wanted to generate the WIF myself so that I can make sure I get back to it from the validate tab. This way I can be sure that the software didn't disregard the input I was giving it and generate a key from a limited subspace. It shouldn't be doing this and doubt that it is, I just want to make 100% sure I've generated the WIF myself without relying or looking through source code. This is why I use a different program (bitaddress.org to validate and bitcoinpaperwallet to generate a BIP38 encrypted key) to validate. That way I can be sure that I'm not being tricked by the software since they don't communicate (with extremely high probability).
I do have to trust that sha256sum isn't compromised but I have much more faith in that since it's not Bitcoin specific.

1) Are you talking about mining centralisation? Do you have data to back this up?

It seems to me like 'economic growth' is a catch all phrase that takes an extremely complicated situation and tries to describe it with one word. I very much doubt your version of 'economic growth' is the same as another's. You need to define your terms before you argue with them. I'll say again, what do YOU mean by economic growth? Of course fractional reserve banking devalues currency... when you make more money, the rest is devalued.

This is the correct answer... this is not a problem. IMO Changetip should warn people if their balances get over a certain amount and ask them to withdraw it or tip it forward. This would be decent of them. It would also add to their income as it comes through withdrawals.
Changetip should provide some security advice in the email and a list of wallets that people could use instead of using them as a wallet.

"Our brains are originally not good at this." - I hope you're not including me in this assumption.
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:29:27
Because it should be easy to remember a BIP38 password. It's not a seed for a private key like a brain wallet and therefore is not vulnerable to brute force attacks if weakish. Some on reddit posted a public key encrypted with a 4 letter password and it wasn't broken. The whole point to BIP38 is so you don't need to write your password down which makes you vulnerable to attack again. If it's 12 random words you might as well be trying to remember a brain wallet and good luck with keeping that in your head for any length of time.

Why is the IRS taxing Bitcoin retroactively?
People say the IRS ruling is OK because you can also claim losses BUT the IRS are taxing Bitcoin gains retroactively. Bitcoiners and miners who have made massive gains have also taken massive risks and had Bitcoin failed, could have wound up losing their entire investment. Do you think they could claim losses then!? Of course not. Other people who have taken a risk on other unrecognised things that died a horrible death can't claim losses on those. So by applying their property tax retroactively the IRS unfairly acquire high risk gains while saving themselves from dealing with high risk losses (on failed things not Bitcoin). What gives them the right to do this? Why did they not apply their tax ruling from the current date? Why should the Bitcoiners in the US not refuse to pay taxes retroactively and agree to pay taxes on any gains from now?

"When a mining pool receives a new block from a competitor, it needs to perform a few actions: download the full block, validate its transactions and define a new block to mine on. During this - albeit short -interval, so as not to waste hashing power, they start mining a new block. Only the coinbase transaction is included, so the previous block does not invalidate theirs with a duplicate transaction."

"The price increase helps miners even more than the rest of us." - this is a joke. In the late stages of Bitcoin miners will rely on transaction fees and not on block rewards.


"allow users to process these transactions between themselves and ultimately incur fees of which a fraction is released to miners any time a channel is opened or closed"
exactly, miners could get far more from on chain transactions.
You tell me then, Blockstream's investors... how are they looking to get a return on their investment?

If you think this you don't understand how mining works.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:21:59
Quantity does not imply lack of quality.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:26:48
By taking the miner's transaction fees with their second layer solution.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:12:09
Now only the block size limit to worry about.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:10:58
You're very slightly dumber now.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:24:36
Sounds like you have no idea what off chain means.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:11:44
Maybe you have an alternate definition of 'off chain'. Perhaps you'd like to clarify.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:05:36
Awesome guide for newcomers. Now they can make sure their transactions get through with no problems. Bitcoin is so awesome.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:26:16
Exchange with no 2FA is basically suicide.
You can make a paper wallet offline or use a hardware device like ledger.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:49:15
Do you mean the BCH that is more like the original vision of Bitcoin than onemeggreg coin?
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:09:14
Except the limit was meant as a temp spam filter.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:01:25
You're playing with fire. Good luck.

@_date: 2017-08-16 16:55:45
The only thing that was forced on Bitcoin was segwit. It had 30% miner support before the majority agreed on segwit WITH 2X. Note the caps.
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:33:55
Some people are stupid though.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:40:54
Bitcoin Unlimited had just under 50% miner support at this time. Not enough to fork, sure, but notably more than segwit without the HF blocksize increase 2X added.
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:29:22
It probably saved you money.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:02:24
You are stretching logic with that one. You need to think harder about the differences.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:38:49
I do prefer rbtc because it provides freedom of speech. It's working out fine so far. I managed to grab the majority of my new Bitcoin Cash at $200.
With their control the protocol layer, they have a huge advantage over competitors. Sure, others can compete but they will have a disadvantage. Bitcoin has a leech on it now.
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:30:32
That's the plan.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:51:28
You should try to rephrase to make more sense. I honestly can't understand anything you've said.

@_date: 2017-08-02 15:10:34
Technically correct.


@_date: 2017-08-16 17:47:43
It's quite appropriate to note the support behind Bitcoin Unlimited. They both have similar visions with different ways to get there. Namely, not stifling the block size in the short term to 1MB. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:17:31

Thanks! I'll look into it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:42:15
What are the arguments of the devs against the increase in blocksize? Can a fork with a different name really be expected to be adopted? If it does, does it's name change to Bitcoin now?
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:20:43
I'm surprised to be reading it tbh. Your comment that is. How can it still exist?
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:28:52
Interesting... it does seem that just increasing the size of the blocks when their size is insufficient is a good approach.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:47:54
So if this fork does win... will it be the new Bitcoin and there won't be a need for the BitcoinXT name?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:32:52
Looking good to me:

The real Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:39:18
What is the point of working on a fork that is unlikely to receive mainstream attention? Does he hope to prove that the increased blocksize works so that it can be incorporated into Bitcoin later maybe? How can this experiment be valid if it's not receiving mainstream use?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:08:01
But can you spend them? That is the question.

@_date: 2016-02-16 08:10:58
You are correct. The only way transactions will have $100 fees is if there is enough demand for the Bitcoin rails. Fortunately, there are a myriad of other options for people to move their value around. Value on Bitcoin will just flow to the best of those. There will never be $100 fees because that will break Bitcoin's network effect and demand for its use.

Because anyone can make a frontend, there will be many made and they will compete with each other. The whole p2p network will be prone to network effects that influence all the frontends and anyone who wants to run a node by themselves. i.e. all the stores aren't independent.

You mean to say dinosaurs were real!?
@_date: 2015-11-29 13:08:34
And this saves space in the blocks and reduces their fees? (me trying to understand the benefits)
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:32:26
How do you resolve the issue of some miners with a smaller maximum block size discarding solutions from other miners with larger block tolerances?
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:29:22
Well, I could only see one major downside (making double spends far easier) so I was looking for some upsides. So far, I'm of the opinion that this downside far outweighs the upsides (even provided here). Now users can be confident that they can double spend because they don't have to transmit their second spend simultaneously. This forces everyone else using Bitcoin as a payment system to wait for 1 confirmation even for relatively small purchases, breaking the general usability. Any scammer can use that 'cancel' button on their wallet to take advantage of merchants that accept 0 confirmations.

Running a private blockchain is like having a company wiki, a company facebook, a company linkedin, a company twitter, and a company email service where you can only get emails from other employees. All useful and easily controlled/secured, but not anywhere nearly as useful as the global options of each of these. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:38:54


This is incorrect, there is a way to prevent this from happening. I'm trying to find it. Can't remember the technical details.
Segwit would be fine if the blocksize limit was allowed to increase in the short term. Forcing users off chain right now is a bad idea. Segwit as a HF would be great.
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:51:24
Loong on Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:40:48

@_date: 2015-11-12 02:10:00
I'm guessing most and not even cryptographically secured.
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:02:24
But what incentive is there to move tokens back to the blockchain if there are wallets and POS services that accept all sidechain tokens and bitcoins? Doesn't that make sidechains more dangerous than big players? as the tokens are still in control of the users (a good thing) but the Bitcoin mining incentives are reduced.
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:25:07
Then your problem is with how reddit works. How do you suggest changing the way reddit works? Should there be a way to oust subreddit creators? Bear in mind that the people who run reddit can't police all subreddits and get involved in the politics of each. This would have to be automated in some way. Very interested in suggestions. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:47:19
Thanks, I wasn't aware of that. Seems he has given his opinion quite recently then.
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:42:32
But why would they need to? If their token's value is pegged to that of 1 bitcoin then surely people would be happy trading in these in place of or alongside bitcoins? You just stated that this would need to happen without saying why (my question to you).

Sounds reasonable to me. What does reddit say about it? Why not post an askreddit? Or to the reddit mods? Maybe they have a good argument against this. I can't think of one right now. I've not modded before so I feel inexperienced to comment on if this would work or not.
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:55:36
I'm playing by his rules because this is his forum. If you don't like it there is which is gathering a lot of new subscribers. It's not ideal, but it is what it is. I was hoping to get some reasonable arguments but, so far, the single one given was not very compelling.

Theory is that if it goes mainstream then the sheer number of transactions can cover mining. Incidentally, this is why I think the blocks should be getting larger.

@_date: 2015-11-12 19:30:50
What says... also, it's possible that these transactions don't need to happen on chain (Coinbase) in first world countries (see comment), but it would be nice if fees remain small for parts of the world where these networks do not reach. There seems to be a difference between centralised services offering to do off chain transactions and sidechains where the value doesn't need to return to the Bitcoin network (or does it?).
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:56:23

@_date: 2015-03-05 11:00:17
They made a good choice.
@_date: 2015-11-15 14:29:53
Why not?, people will sell things on OB because it'll be cheaper than selling on ebay.
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:18:12
I'm guessing he means that it [the exchange service] feeds in and out of their wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:11:23
They need more, obviously.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:52:59
I'm informed. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:16:01
Thanks, it was mostly just to learn myself in a somewhat lazy fashion :)

Your joke never fails to amuse me.
@_date: 2015-11-13 13:21:18
Are you suggesting that miners would have to keep testing different block sizes on the network to see the probability of acceptance? Right now, I'm guessing that the miners wouldn't want to put any transactions in (as some do now) just so they can be sure they the block gets accepted. This is bad :) It would be the sweet spot. At the hackathon I attended there were some people working on some code to try and prevent this from happening without having to modify Bitcoin core: 
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:23:39
interesting... why is it a thing? reminds me of that 1M pixel site.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:24:16
I care. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:43:55
Yes, that also didn't make much sense to me.
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:40:48
I've added a business... wasn't too difficult. 
EDIT: I'm English... that means it was fucking easy.
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:42:55
has anyone been able to withdraw from their service since the hack?
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:45:20
Ok, maybe you are right. It's a pity then that all pro BU posts are immediately removed.
@_date: 2015-03-29 14:54:57
You are correct. Watch this:

There are enough BU nodes to support the full Bitcoin userbase. Node count can be sybil'ed

Thanks for this reasoned response. What is your opinion of 'The Highlander' section in this piece:  ?
Alt coins built for anonymity have their place for sure but it seems hard to compete with the network effect of Bitcoin. Would it no be prudent to assume that either Bitcoin will fail or that it's value will go 'to the moon' because of the competitive aspect of currencies?


This seems very reasonable. Which BIP most corresponds to this strategy? If it's elastic in an automated way now that depends on certain factors (I assume this is your suggestion) then the algorithm on how to do this needs to be made now. Isn't getting consensus on a complex automated algorithm far more difficult than picking a reasonable fixed scaling regiment? 
Your points about off chain arrangements (Coinbase, micropayments, etc) are valid, but market players would need world dominance or to be colluding together to keep transaction off chain for as long as possible. This only works when people aren't worried about tying their assets up with a third party. As soon as they want control again, they will return them to the blockchain. Sidechains seem of a different nature. If the value of those tokens in pegged to 1 bitcoin, then people would not be incentivised to return their tokens to the Bitcoin network and will result in a loss of income for Bitcoin miners. Are there any ways you know of where transactions in a sidechain help the Bitcoin miners? 
IMO the blocksize should be kept at a level such that the fees per Bitcoin transaction are kept to a size that an everyday user of bitcoin would be happy to pay. $2c is fine, $20c isn't. Are you able to suggest an automatic way of scaling the block size such that low fees (but not too low i.e. $0.05c) can remain?
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:19:29
Mining nodes. FTFY.

@_date: 2017-05-11 05:50:06
Great argument.

How to get consensus without discussion? Idiot.

How do you know how many users support the 1 MB limit and the core devs?

My average is $500, I'm not sad. Was a bargain at the time and will surely be a bargain in a year's time.
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:46:00
I think that when there is a queue on the space in blocks that starts to affect the price of bitcoin adversely, miners will very quickly change their minds about the block size and will hop over to another implementation which has bigger blocks. A fork in this 'downtime' would be much better than a fork later. That's why I was hoping that the block size changes could be forked earlier.
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:52:49
Maybe don't go for Blockchain.info right now, they are having problems. Mycelium is a great android app.
Here are some vids I've favorited on youtube:

I'm waiting for OpenBazaar. Sellers here should know how to hold bitcoin.

Different views is an understatement. It's perfectly reasonable to dismiss someones opinion based on some wacko views they hold.

Good point.

What is MikeCoin?
@_date: 2015-11-03 09:40:36
I also think that looks like crap.
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:53:45
The easiest way is for the blocksize limit to be bigger.

Don't mind me... I was being an arsehole :P
@_date: 2015-11-29 12:56:06
Is there not a way to do this while keeping the rest of the transaction the same (i.e. only change the mining fee)?
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:06:53
I assume that this is precisely the reason he writes against Bitcoin. He may grok it, but still be speaking against it to further his political career and not get laughed out of his position.

What year are you living in? This happened already.

I asked them to accept and gave them their first donation (not much either). I'm glad you found this and posted it independently! I meant to do it but hadn't gotten around it it. What's the use of Bitcoin outlasting us :P
Here's a cool video for anyone wondering what they are up to.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:11:49
Or you could convince them to run BU. It's far more likely to activate in the short term (not against segwit).
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:28:20
Makes sense, but from an end user perspective, it complicates things quite a bit. Now they have to know about the difference between the two types and be cautious when accepting RBF transactions, instead of just knowing that they can accept 0-conf transactions with some small probability of the sender double spending on them.
@_date: 2015-03-21 20:32:30
Thanks for this... the only laugh I had all day.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:18:09

hmm, seems the haven't even credited me their bullshit BTC-B... what thieves. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:42:03
Took all my bitcoins out early this morning. It's a real shame, I really liked their product and was a huge advocate about a year ago. All they had to do was keep it functional... how hard is that? I'm also getting error messages all the time and bitcoin public addresses that are valid aren't recognised sometimes by their system.

so I was just lucky to have my holdings in an alt?
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:13:24
If the price grew consistently... would you buy a lot? Hmm, I wonder what that would do to the price if everyone did it?
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:40:32
Watch them ban Bitcoin after all are sold:p
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:19:32
Watch this for a bit:   Just under the price is the buy order book on that exchange. Just above it is the sell order book. Every time someone buys for what someone has said they'd sell for (green number in the bottom right) the price moves up. Every time someone sells for what someone has said they'd buy for (red number in the bottom right) the price moves up. So... supply and demand determine price. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:29:49

OpenBazaar takes over from ebay.
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:15:52
Cryptsy are so bad that I once reached a large negative balance trading there because they allowed me to trade for more than the BTC I had and the alt dropped so much in value. Fuck Cryptsy. I've stayed away from them ever since.

@_date: 2013-12-18 13:04:14
Maybe they are extremely clever and knew this would happen, allowing Chinese people to buy cheap coins before the surge and then sell first before the news spreads to the western world, thus taking money from westerners. We shouldn't pity the Chinese people, they scored big over this bubble.

Why is there a 1% trading charge, more than twice the most expensive exchanges?
"Please check your details carefully. Once the profile is established it can only be changed by a system administrator at ICE3X. Profle updates incur a processing fee of R50.", why do you need to pay to update your details?

People in the US don't know how lucky they are to have something like coinbase. Us in the UK have to buy bitcoins from others at a markup.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:45:06
I've lost 0.9 BTC on this site... first time trading, wanted to buy some altcoins, cryptsy let me buy twice the amount I should and then it was infeasible to trade them back (it would have been at a loss). I waited for things to get sorted out. They never did. Now if I trade back to restore my negative balances I end up with a total balance that is negative :( I won't be using them again.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:58:55
If you are in the UK, Bittylicious is another option if you don't want to meet up with people.
