Good intro video for people that are new to the space and can't fathom why bitcoin is sitting at current levels. 
Most comments in the video are common across most Cryptocurrencies - Blockchains are going to change the way we do things, and the current financial players are going to have to change if they are going to survive. 
The point I make to my friends is why leave your $1000 in a bank account right now and get the 2% interest, while inflation is running at around 2.5 - 3%... You are actively losing money every day it sits there. Sure crypto goes up and down, but in the long term, that $1000 is going to be better served in a crypto than a savings account.

This is a great thing! Bitcoin is build support around the $16000 level, this means that when we surge higher, on any pullback, it will take a lot of FUD to break through this level. 
These quiet periods are what you want to see! Continual increase in price means that when the correction comes, it is going to be a lot more violent.

So dude, you're not Scandinavian I'm guessing, and I am guessing that you have never left the Western Hemisphere. 
The Nordics are among the freest to conduct business, have been for a long time and will continue to be, because we share the same Germanic work ethic that is common to the economic systems of Germany, The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, the USA etc, that being that nothing is achieved if we don't all work. 
We were see it as being different is that if we all work together and help each other, we all get ahead. American Capitalism is "winner takes all", "its me against you", "if you get ahead, its only at my expense". 
We are not socialist, we are capitalist countries with a welfare state or "safety net" to ensure that people that the bare minimums to progress in life - education, health, basic work conditions etc are provided by the state and then business can supplement these services or provide alternative ones. 
The economy and the tax base grows, because all market participants have a minimum level of security - I can buy that new television today, because if i fall over at work and break my leg, I know that I can go to the hospital, collect workers insurance and continue to meet my mortgage repayments until I am back at work. 
You say we have been taking "some socialist measures" in recent times - can you name one independent business that a government has seized without reimbursement or paying a fair market price and then distributed to the working class? Cause that is socialism.  I think you will struggle to find one, as since the 1990's, the Nordics, like the English, the Germans, the Australians etc have been selling previous government owned industries to private companies. 
Our system is far more stable than the American model - how long can your government continue to subsidise large corporations and the rich and expect the poor and middle class to pay? When the next financial crisis comes along and you already have 25 trillion dollars of debt, and your tax base is built mainly on taxing the bottom of the income pyramid, where are the funds going to come from to bail the banks and corporations out from?
Americans in particular have a very different definition of "Socialism" than the rest of the world. A safety net/welfare state is not socialism, it is a fair economic base for all.

Can't own property... is it cause he is a foreigner? I know in Denmark you can't buy a property if you aren't going to live in it for a percentage of the year - primarily to stop people buying summer houses on our beaches that they use for 2 weeks a year in summer.

You have the same right to accumulate wealth, assets and savings in Scandinavia as you do in the US, the UK, Australia etc. You have total control over these assets, and the government has no say in what you invest in. 
The difference is, rather than big tax breaks for investors as they are "Job creators", or the belief in "trickle down" economics as common in the Anglosphere, the Scandinavian economies are built on a belief that every person is equal, and every person should pay an amount of tax to reflect their ability to pay. 
The system also ensures that if you ever need assistance, that there is a safety net to make sure that you can still afford the bare essentials of life. 
So this guy could have sold his house, his car, his share portfolio, his summer house etc and put it in bitcoin. 
He does not that he is not quite a bitcoin billionaire (in Swedish Kronor, 8 kronor to the USD) so I would assume his life savings were actually quite substantial.

I understand what you are saying but the act that the commonwealth bank has broken is "the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act (Cth) 2006"
The act was passed in a post 9/11 world where Governments used terrorism as a way to crack down on black money and tax avoidance. 
So as I said, I understand what you are getting at, but technically if one person deposited into an account and that money was funnelled to ISIS etc then the title is correct. Given that a number of charges have been  laid in the last year or so for funding terrorism groups, it may be that Austrac has evidence that shows that these machines were used as part of their investigation for these charges.

So far it has hit 3630 on Bitfinex.. then rebounded strongly, but is finding resistance around 3750. I am sure by the time you wake up it will either be hundreds of dollars higher or lower haha

I wouldn't really call it fast compared to earlier this week, or how quickly the price rose about 12 hours ago!
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:02:14
well it may do - if all three chains survive.
But, the recent price hikes have been caused by greater aware of blockchain technology and investors piling in for capital gain. 
An investor is not passionate about bitcoin or bitcoin cash or ether, 
 hell they probably don't even care if blockchain disappears tomorrow, all they are looking for is buy low sell high. To them the idea of getting another coin "free" in november is not a plus, it is uncertainty in the market that is limiting future gains in bitcoin price. 
The price may skyrocket in november depending on what happens with the hard fork, but for all these new people they just want to make money now. They can take their profits from recent weeks/months, put that money in other assets and come back in November. 
I feel this is why the price has moved sideways and then downwards in recent days.

Hey, for fundamental analysis I like to look at RSI (relative strength index) and MACD as well as looking at the Order Book. 
Fundamental analysis is hard and is far from a perfect art, and everyone will argue that they can make sense of something different. It really is about you looking at different indicators together and for you to spot a pattern that you think can tell you where the market is going. 
For me, RSI is an indicator of sentiment in the market. If i see it ticking up, or below 30, then theory would say that prices should rise shortly as the asset is oversold. 
On the MACD indicator, I have found in recent weeks that the Blue line is a leading indicator and if it starts to rise, that the price quite often does as well. 
I use the order book to understand how many orders are placed for buy and sell within the range the asset is currently at. If you can see that no one is buying at this price, and there are a lot of people wanting to sell, the price should go down. 
But you also have to look at things like resistance levels. Over the last few days, the price went just below 4000 USD and then within a few minutes bounced back up to or above 4000 - this was a resistance level. Today when it finally broke through this barrier and there wasn't much support, it lost around $160 dollars within an hour down to around $3830. As I type this, 3850 appears to be a resistance barrier, but is also being tested. 
It really is just about spotting patterns and trading accordingly. There are some great resources on youtube, look for Bitcoin financial analysis. Nugget news does a good job explaining trends in a simple manner, or else  allows people to publish their own interpretations that you can read. Some of these guys are spot on, some of them have used the solar eclipse to tell you that Bitcoin will die, so just be careful. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:17:06
Hey man, apart from all the other advice I have bought most of my coins from mycelium local trader. There are a few guys in there selling at decent rates without any market up etc. 
There are a few guys in there that I trust to cardless cash to and they have never done me wrong. I have the coins within 2 mins of sending the cash... 
Looks for sellers with lots of successful sales... Hopefully you are in Sydney or Melbourne or else this may not be an option. 
Otherwise if you are cool getting verified and sending ID etc just do btc markets 
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:34:45
Horrible news. The government will make it so hard to open accounts and transfer back to cash. They will want to know where ever cent comes from and goes... Ah bitcoin increased and you transferred back the profit to your bank account?

I am hoping that the Americans come online, see the cheap coins and buy in again. Then I have to wait til around 3am local time when the Japanese, Koreans and Chinese wake up and buy back in and spike the price. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:16:23
Wait for the bottom and buy - depends on what support line it breaks next, if it goes below 3800, i think we could quickly get back to 3500 - 3600 based on the lower trading levels in recent days. All this segwit2x talk in recent days seems to be slowly reducing the sentiment around bitcoin. 
I think most of the cash is sitting out on the sidelines looking for clear signals as to which the next movement is, and in the mean time, people are putting money in ether. 
Could be that it hits 3840 etc and everyone piles back in and buys it back up to around 4000
EDIT: Posted this elsewhere but for context, Bitcoin Cash is down around 20% against USD and around 26% against ether on Bitfinex right now. So no reason for panic selling of bitcoin right now
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:05:00
Ethereum has actually had some largely positive news on further adaption etc in recent weeks but it was just eclipsed by the Bitcoin price rise. I would say that since Bitcoin has now paused/decreased, people are looking for other assets to invest in and are actually taking this positive news into account.

Haha welcome to Australia... A country with a government that is deliberately sabotaging its own future by stopping new technologies from growing to protect current interest groups. Look at our internet policies! Australia isn't even in the top 50 internet speeds in the world. 
This government is driven by interest groups, and on this occasion it is our 4 big banks (the most profitable banks in the world). The government will protect them by saying that terrorists might use bitcoin so it needs to be regulated. 
This is the same country that is pushing to make encryption illegal and asking telecommunications companies to block websites that they don't like. 
This government doesn't look at future opportunities, it wants to keep things just the way they are and keep their corporate overlords happy.

I don't think this is a racist comment at all. 
When you live in Europe, you can spot different nationalities from 100 metres away - it is something that you learn as a youngster without ever being told. 
Different Europeans have different face structures, different body types, different hair styles, wear the same brands etc. Trends hit different countries at different speeds - it is still the case the some of the eastern states can still have a conservative older fashion sense compared to say a Dutch or Scandi person. 
Thats not racist - its just being in tune with the different looks and cultural choices different Europeans make.

The two senators mentioned in the article had a lot of say about bitcoin in the last week or so, but it is just their suggestion. They don't have the ability to make it policy, plus the reserve bank of Australia is totally independent, senators can't make it change its investment decisions.

Isnt the whole thing about bitcoin that everyone becomes their own bank? That the limit of 21 million coins means that we can't have a system where we just create new currency when we need to socialise the losses made by the banks when things like the GFC happen?
So bad behaviour by the banks, such as this article, just shows why alot of us are here and the obstacles we need to overcome if Bitcoin is going to reach its full potential.
Plus CBA is one of the least crypto friendly banks, froze users accounts when they were trying to use their own money to buy from exchanges, won't process credit card payments all while testing blockchain technology in the background.

I have posted this on both subs but it seems that they have a common theme in a lot of their top posts which have always made me suspect paid content.
The most common post seems to be "I was in the bitcoin since 2011, and I remember all the great ideas and the feeling of being part of something new and was going to change the world. I know get this feeling from this sub, and its great to be back where new ideas are accepted and I just want to say thanks". 
The exact wording changes but the sentiment of each sentence stays the same. It also seems that 2011 is an important date to show that they have been around from near the start, cause they seem reluctant to change that part of the script.

Nah that is the new rule, but I did make a mistake on one point, OP says he paid 16k for the car, but I was responding to where he said he had the bitcoin for 1300 bucks so I was thinking 2 Bitcoins were less than the 10k threshold for personal use 
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:47:17
Can't spell frequently on their home page (frekvently)... I would tread carefully 
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:31:17
That is why I hired a specialised crypto accountant to help me with the tax. 
OP just has to say that he bought bitcoin because he believes in the future it will be a replacement for fiat and enjoys using it to pay for things. As long as he sticks to this story, the ATO can't actually do much about it, because crypto is a deflationary asset, there is an implied price increase that will occur as bitcoin becomes more and more rare. 
If OP says that be bought Bitcoin at 1400 because he thought it was going to explode, and then decided to sell some for profit - then the ATO has him. 
It really is just a question of intent, and it is very hard for the ATO to prove anything else if OP sticks to that story. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:37:51

I have set up a hedge account, where i can deposit Bitcoin into which a guaranteed Fiat currency value. 
So example - you transfer in 1 bitcoin and when you transfered it to the hedge, it was worth 3900 USD. The 3900 is guaranteed, regardless of what happens to the price of bitcoin, your USD balance remains, but you bitcoin balance fluctates. 
So I put in 1 coin, but because the price as dropped so much, I still have 3900 USD in the account, but I now have 1.15 bitcoin. 
It works well in an environment of falling prices, but if the price of bitcoin skyrockets, there is the risk that you could lose coins.

Not trying to rewrite history here, but i was actually horribly smashed on Wednesday night when I posted this, I do believe in my drunken state that I meant to write 3600 USD, as about the same time I transferred all my bitcoin into a hedge account as I thought things were looking pretty grim... From memory when I wrote it, I think it was around 3900...
ah well, I have accumulated more bitcoin by using the hedge account so I can't complain about the drop... But yeah, should pay more attention to numbers and stop making predictions after early oktoberfest parties.

So I put in 1 coin, but because the price as dropped so much, I still have 3900 USD in the account, but I now have 1.15 bitcoin. 
It works well in an environment of falling prices, but if the price of bitcoin skyrockets, there is the risk that you could lose coins.

Not trying to rewrite history here, but i was actually horribly smashed on Wednesday night when I posted this, I do believe in my drunken state that I meant to write 3600 USD, as about the same time I transferred all my bitcoin into a hedge account as I thought things were looking pretty grim... From memory when I wrote it, I think it was around 3900...
ah well, I have accumulated more bitcoin by using the hedge account so I can't complain about the drop... But yeah, should pay more attention to numbers and stop making predictions after early oktoberfest parties.

Isn't this more a symptom of the portuguese governments inability to meet its budget deficit obligations to as part of EMU?
Southern Europeans seem to pay for everything in cash and as such, avoid paying debt. 
Now I may be saying this as a northern european who pays tax on everything and see absolutely no issue with this as I can see on the streets the difference tax dollars makes to our society, but I think more tax income would be great for portugal. 
Pay down some of that debt, invest in infrastructure, help some of the poorer citizens. 
Now with my bitcoin hat on, meh, you can get around these laws. Every portuguese will soon have a bitcoin wallet and bitcoin will be zipping around tax.

Hey I know small steps - but could you add Bitcoin as a currency on your store? You have SGD HKD etc, I think it would just help raise the profile and awareness of the fact you accept bitcoin.

May be chinese citizens trying to get in while they can... If you already have an exchange account before the ban, you should be able to get around any great firewall of china restrictions. 
If you don't, then it will probably become much harder to set up a trading account etc.

Cheques? I honestly don't think we even have them anymore in Australia... Everything has been moved to electronic... How bloody weird. I can honestly say I have not had cash in my wallet for years. I pay for everything with my mobile phone.
Why have Americans stuck to cheques and cash? Is it that they don't have a uniformed system like eftpos and netbanking and that banks are fragmented?
The final step will be later this year when we move towards instant payments between people based on bank account numbers, mobile numbers or emails. There will never be a reason to have to wait for cash to hit your account regardless of what bank you are with.

Never heard of it... May not actually be Australians trading. Japanese are very high investors in AUD due to the interest rate differential that has existed between Australia and Japan for the last 20 years or so. It could be that the Japanese investors have AUD assets that they are using as the investment vehicle. 
The AUD is also the world's 5th largest traded fiat currency so could be the carry trade.

Ombudsman comes from the Danish/Scandinavian word - Ombudsman haha. Ombudsman are now found the world over. 
Not sure if this is a Danish myth, but Denmark , Sweden and Norway were the first countries to have such an "office" that you could complain to when you had been unfairly affected by a government decision. 
The modern Scandinavian word does come from the Icelandic word Umboðsmaður or representative..

Yeah understand where you are coming from. 
I will let you know if any of my mates come back with suggestions. One was suggesting that there is internal talk within one of the larger banks about opening an exchange of sorts, so I'll see if he can tell me where that is at.

I have put some feelers out as I know many a banker/financier to see if they know anything and will post again if I find any options. 
A year ago I would have said just tell some white lies and say that you were operating a consultancy working with businesses looking for understand cryptocurrencies but with bitcoin at its current value you will quickly trigger the anti money laundering software built into banking financial systems and they will question where these funds are coming from. 
Also the fact that you have bitcoin in your registered business name makes it hard to say that you are operating an eBay business etc, plus the ATO is cracking down on these types of businesses this year due to the legislation to collect gst on more internet sales. 
I actually can't understand what the banks issue with you operating a bitcoin business is... If you don't have a business credit card or an overdraft and your business goes belly up then they have not suffered a financial loss. 
Do you have an accountant friend? I am trying to think what the effect would be of opening a business account such as MJ trading pty Ltd trading as bitcoin babe? Or even a sole trader account simply in your name but with a registered abn /sole trader tfn attached... 
Maybe if we can't find you a bank perhaps registering as one of these other business ownership structures and associated accounts could help you kick it off...

Sorry... Was typing on the mobile and must have failed to reread what I typed. 
A potential customer came to branch to open an account and found his name had been blacklisted. Investigations would later show his best friend had stolen his identity and opened fraudulent accounts.

I'm well versed in the politics around the budget, the GFC and the stimulus package.
I take your point that deficits are borrowing from the future but also note that estimates were that it was estimated by the IMF and OECD that if the stimulus package hadn't been implemented, unemployment could have hit 10%, similar to levels it hit in the UK and the US.
this level of unemployment stole savings from unemployed workers straight away and threatened a jump in people not making repayments on loans (home loans, personal loans etc) potentially placing more stress on the already vulnerable banks at that stage if default rates had of climbed significantly.
Also more unemployed people means more welfare spending as well as decreased tax income, so I would have to look back through notes but it was estimated at the time that under the liberal plan not to implement stimulus would have pushed us into recession and deficit.
So it's easy to use catch phrases, but we will pay the debt off and kept people in jobs, in their houses and kept the financial system afloat.

And your understanding of socialism seems real fucked up, especially considering your meant to be from Czechia.. Once again I guess it's just shit you are reading online and don't actually understand shit about the Scandinavian countries - they have higher levels of private ownership than even the US, they just do it with a guaranteed safety net to try and keep society fairer

Hey again, 
I commented on your previous thread. Unfortunately didn't find any banks willing to open accounts. 
But, as someone with previous bank experience, Banks used to flag when you had committed an act that they felt meant they would no longer bank with you. This one bank, one of Australia's largest implemented a massive system upgrade to recognize when your ID had been used before and deny services at the very start of the process. They were very pro-active with sharing this information and I almost guarantee they feed into IDmatrix. 
During the course of my work, there was a situation where a best friend had stolen the identity of a potential customer and was not aware of the situation until they tried to open a new bank account with their partner. His name and ID had been flagged in our system as "Do not bank". 
Now to remove this was a massive stuff around. It was stat decs, police reports etc and the bank finally removed the flag. I would say in your situation, you are going to have to push IDmatrix to release who was the actual bank that put the flag on your account and then lobby them to remove this flag. IDmatrix will say that they are only an information sharing provider, and that they do not verify the information provided by their customers. 
I am sure that your lawyer will provide superior advice, but I am sure with a combination of the Privacy Act and the competition and consumer act that you should be able to argue that by adding what is in effect "an incorrect fraud flag" on your identity, they have limited your access to basic consumer facilities.
