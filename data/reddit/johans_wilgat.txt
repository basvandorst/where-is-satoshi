This was also asked of Satoshi way back on the mail archive cryptography forum:


Satoshi's Response


What this signifies is that though Bitcoin can be used loosely as a payment protocol, it's main purpose is to serve as a currency. Other systems can/will probably be built around the Bitcoin protocol that are willing to take a small part of the risk in order to deliver instant verifications. Bank-like entities, those that store coins on other person's behalf can locally clear funds if they are trusted. Ripple is seen as also potentially filling this niche.
From a different perspective, digital services can easily shield themselves from this risk even if the payment is double-spent, since they can revoke the service soon afterword with very little loss.
Bitcoin is not optimal (though lets not forget it's pretty damn good regardless) for small, instant clearing of transactions between two anonymous persons where one party could quickly revoke the transaction and run off with the goods in 10mins, but the fact that you can clear a $200,000 USD transaction using Bitcoin with a 0.5 cent fee in as soon 10 minutes is certainly nothing to scoff at.

History of repeated boom and bust is an optimistic signal. Once Bitcoin entered the headlines, it never left, and it continues to snowball in popularity with retail investors and media attention the longer it stays relevant. Throughout regulatory pressures, technical difficulties, and many more corrections than the ones highlighted above, the cryptocurrency has remained at the forefront of the Blockchain revolution.
Bitcoin bubbles are not intuitive. They do not drop all at once, and they do not drop when one might expect.
Historically, Bitcoin has “gone parabolic” three times and crashed down each time.

Bitcoin’s fate is tied to more than its believers, however, and the multi-year struggle that occurred post-2013 demonstrates that the path back upwards isn’t always straight. With its whales creating waves whenever they like, miners searching for other ways to profit, and a new futures market, Bitcoin’s outlook remains anything but transparent.

America's most desirable places to live is accepting bitcoin (Bitcoin just hit an all-time high — here's how you buy and sell it) as payment, a growing trend in the real estate market.

Far from Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, the listing in Middletown, often ranked one of the best places (MONEY Magazine Names Middletown One of Best Places to Live in Northeast Region) to live in the US, shows just how far cryptocurrency and bitcoin have reached into the national conversation.
The listing is far from the only one in the
to accept bitcoin.
Over the last six months, an increasing number of real estate listings have begun accepting or requesting cryptocurrency for payment. There have even been some that only accept bitcoin as payment.
Bitcoin Real Estate, a website specializing in real estate listings that accept cryptocurrency, told Mercury News in late January that it has nearly 400 homes listed on its website.

It will also direct you to resources that will help you store and use your first pieces of digital currency.
What is Bitcoin in a nutshell
Small wonder that Bitcoin emerged in 2008 just after Occupy Wall Street accused big banks of misusing borrowers’ money, duping clients, rigging the system, and charging boggling fees. Bitcoin pioneers wanted to put the seller in charge, eliminate the middleman, cancel interest fees, and make transactions transparent, to hack corruption and cut fees. They created a decentralized system, where you could control your funds and know what was going on.
Bitcoin has come far in a relatively short time. All over the world, companies, from REEDS Jewelers, a large jewelry chain in the US, to a private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, accept its currency. Billion dollar businesses such as Dell, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft do, too.
