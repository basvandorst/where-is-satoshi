Of course it costs money. And I literally cannot think of a better use for taxes than universal healthcare. In modern society, healthcare should be a basic right for everyone, like access to water, food and shelter. You talk about "medical usage" like someone chooses to get cancer, as if sickness is somehow their fault. Does someone deserve to go bankrupt because they get sick? Is that really the kind of society you want to live in?

This meme says more to me about current US healthcare than it does about Bitcoin. To someone used to the US health system, the joke is about the dollar being replaced by Bitcoin in the future. To anyone else, what sticks out first is that it's apparently completely acceptable to charge people for medical attention, and also to inform them as they're waking up from a coma. Obviously the latter is done to get to the dollar/Bitcoin joke in frame, but it sticks out so badly to a non-US resident that it ruins the intended gag for me.

Could you provide a source on that 20k Australian bail-in thing? Our bank accounts are government guaranteed up to a few hundred thousand dollars, so this seems rather at odds with that.

Is quantum computing likely to disrupt this (and encryption in general)?

Young people less risk averse than old people, more news at 11.

This works for the Australian property market too.

Only in San Francisco do you find a little girls' coffee stand that takes bitcoin and uses QR codes. Love it!
