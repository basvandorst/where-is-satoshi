You were a staunch advocate of bitcoin itself until an exchange lost your coins?  You realise this has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with sloppy security.  If you didn't know your private key, you didn't own the coins. I'll probably get downvoted it being an asshole, but I'm ok with that because I'm telling you what you need to know.  Your account was hacked. Bitcoin is fine.

@_date: 2014-04-25 13:58:30
I agree.  One thing I would add to the sequence mentioning coins being stored on your computer or mobile device is "or even on a piece of paper."  As it is now it sounds like the coins are physically stored in these places, and I think people's first criticism due to media publicity over the last year is that those things are hackable.  Perhaps the quick mention of a paper wallet would pique people's curiosity while showing them that "bitcoins" aren't physically stored anywhere in the conventional sense. . .

You're right, OP.  Your private key is what's really in cold storage.  The public key (as mentioned) can be checked by scanning the blockchain at any time.  Blockchain.info is a good place to search it.  You'll see what your coins are up to without you.  Hopefully nothing!
You can generate new addresses offline at bitaddress.org.  You can then send coins to there from anywhere.  You will notice that not only do your coins/addresses not go anywhere when you unplug your ethernet, it never needed to be plugged in in the first place!

Yes.  Go to bitaddress.org and click generate.  The more secure the environment is where you run this site (eg, offline, or offline in a fresh linux install, etc) the more secure the key pairs are.
After you click generate you'll get a public and private key pair.  The public key is where you want to send your coins.  The private key you keep on paper, secret, until you want to redeem the coins.

Blockchain.info acquired Clarkmoody's RTBTC trading platform.  They paid for the acquisition entirely in bitcoins and have now launched zeroblock.com, an aggregated bitcoin trading platform where users will be able to access all the popular bitcoin exchanges from one place, securely, with a solidly built and presented trading interface.
That's what I got from it, and a visit to zeroblock seems to corroborate that.

a) Fiat in Gox
b) BTC sitting in an exchange?
No fucking way.  I got in the game about a year ago, by no means early, and I never went anywhere near gox.  At no point did I have crypto sitting in an exchange for more than a day, and I've been in cold storage for 3 months.  You're telling me *early* adopters still haven't figured this out?

We see a protocol on par with HTTP and SMTP, perhaps much, much greater.
All the signs are there that this is big, and it's something we can afford now.  The more you read the more you will see it.  It's no coincidence that those who are most bullish on bitcoin have the most intimate understanding of it, and vice versa. 
The best way to answer your question is not to ask others, but to read about the facts.  Most of us aren't convinced by the enthusiasm of others, but by the facts themselves.  Read about the protocol, read the whitepaper, listen to speakers like Andreas Antonopoulos.  These are the things that convince me.

You sound like you're going to make it without your coins getting stolen.  I've read some of the horror stories on here and they've made me as paranoid as you.  It's not my current crypto I'm trying to protect, it's the future value from future folks who will be a lot better at finding it than the current ones!
Anyway, one good piece of advice I've seen is to make some sloppy wallets on purpose.  You can make wallets using methods you deem insecure, and leave them around your computer/house with small amounts of BTC on them.  These are like sensor wallets: the canaries in the coalmine.  If they stay full you know you're being careful enough.  If any of them empty out, then you get some clue to where the vulnerabilities are.
Paper wallet generated in linux is one of the most secure storage forms used at the moment though.  I like to go a step further and photoshop my private keys onto documents that have nothing to do with bitcoin, but where they'll blend into the background.  That way if someone finds the documents they still won't know what they're looking at.

I don't buy this for three reasons:
1) Not all mixing is laundering.  
2) Bitcoins aren't considered currency in most of the world.
3) You can run your mixer anywhere you want, so why would you base it in a place it was actually banned?
If there is one thing I've learned in this subreddit over the last year and a half, it's that law enforcement and legislation pertaining thereto around the globe is *nowhere near* versed enough in the bitcoin protocol and the dynamics of cryptocurrency to shut down coin mixing services.  
Can you point me to a source for your claim?  And I don't mean one mixer shutting down, I mean for the statement "most of the coin tumblers shut down" because it's a "high-severity offence in any jurisdiction where you'd want to live."

Mt Gox did *not* have a good run.  They've been a pile of shit covered in red flags for almost a year.  If you can't see the difference between BTCe and MtGox, and it seems like you can't, then you should indeed steer clear of both.  For the rest of us who know how to move our coins right after we buy them, and are smart enough to cash out in our home country, BTCe is just fine as it stands.

@_date: 2014-02-26 15:03:03
Of course.  This is true for *all* exchanges.  Read the last sentence of my post, I already mentioned it.  Limiting exposure is a far cry from boycotting an exchange, which is what it seems like OP wants.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:32:02
Just spitballing here, but maybe once they're small enough, people will start to give up. Once there are 180000 wallets with one BTC each in them, and enough people get paid for goods and services with that money, it will become like regular cash in that I don't care if a bill I used was stolen from a bank ten steps ago. At a certain point one just realizes all money has blood on and we move on. Who knows,  it's all just speculation. 
It could also be for safer storage. The difficulty vs reward goes through the roof trying to crack multiple smaller wallets. 
EDIT: there are some great answers in this thread already  in regard to the last sentence.  Many small wallets facilitates withdrawals. . . TL;DR: *Actually* good news?
Or it could be that this is part of the process of rehabilitating the exchange, although why is beyond me. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:20:16
I agree, instead of 20 upvotes going to a claim that's clearly bullshit.  It's the blind leading the blind over here.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:44:54
actionsketch's answer was complete, but I'm going to elaborate.  If you swept the cold storage key and *then* sent half of it, your wallet would actually send the full .2 balance to the recipient.  Think of it as a bill.  You have a .2 BTC bill, that's all that's in your wallet.  If you want to spend it, you need someone else to break it for you.  After the .2 gets sent, it gets broken.  .1 stays with your intended recipient, and .1 is returned to you, to a *change address*.  It's credited in your wallet client, but you won't see the physical address it's in, which will be different from the originating key you swept.  So it doesn't disappear, it's still yours, but it's just not where it started.
TL;DR: You send .1 of a .2 BTC wallet: .2 gets sent, .1 returned to you as change into a new address your client controls.

What you're referring to is a brute-force attack, which any hacker would know is futile against SHA256.  The compounded security I was referring to applies for more realistic methods like social engineering as well.  If you have hundreds of wallets they should be secured in different ways.  ie, if you have them all in one safety deposit box, it doesn't really matter that there's more than one of them, or which algorithm was used to generate them.

I've been buying all through the crash. I feel for those who lost, but it doesn't blind me to the amazing buying opportunity we have here.  I don't see the gox crash as a blow to bitcoin.  I see 
a) the event was predictable (I'm not referring to the mechanism of it, which is another conversation, but the price movement: it's following the pattern)
b) but the magnitude as surprising
I was expecting the crash, as stated above.  We would've found a cause for one one way or another, but we found a really good one.
All this is to say, I thought it would go down, but not *this* much, which meant I could afford to buy more than I was originally going to buy, so even though I thought I was done buying months ago, I wasn't.
Now I'm strapped in and ready to go up.  If we went down even more, I'd buy again.

I'm just telling you how the bitcoin protocol works.  I have no idea which cases you're referring to, nor am I going to try to diagnose what happened.  Unless you believe that the protocol doesn't execute the same way every time, or that there's a bug in it, then you should research those cases yourself to make sure you don't make whatever mistake they did. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:51:14
I would generate a new key pair using something like bitaddress.org. Then move the coins to that new public address. At this point they are safe in an address that's never been on either device. You can then import the privkey to whichever device you want the coins on. Once that's done, send the remainder to wherever you want them. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:06:21

You're saying everyone who doesn't know about bitcoin is stupid?  Because the parent comment is just saying most people don't know Satoshi started bitcoin.
That's all the quote in question implies.  The reporter said "I want to talk to him about bitcoin, this is Satoshi Nakamoto." and the cop reacted like the guy was a masked celebrity.  
It smells of bullshit to high heaven.  Not even everyone in this subreddit would've reacted like that before this happened, and we're far from a random sample.

We know who Mark Karpeles is, and it isn't stopping him from potentially fucking goxxers.  Put your pitchfork away, OP, you're barking up the wrong tree.  People trust BTCe because they have a solid track record, continue to innovate, and keep us abreast of what's going on.  This may not always be the way, but it's like that now.  Gox had red flags for over a year.  Lots of them.  Shit was obvious.  BTCe doesn't have nearly as many.  When a perfect exchange comes, you can use that.  As for now, I will say every litecoin I've ever bought came from BTCe.  And I'm all in LTC.
That said, even if I'd ever bought anything from Gox it wouldn't have stayed there for more than a few minutes after I bought it.  Cold storage - anything else is pissing your coins away.

The exchange will store your cash and your bitcoins for you, but on their servers.  There it is vulnerable to theft because those servers are accessible by the internet.  If you want to be super safe, transfer your bitcoins from your exchange to your personal wallet, which you can encrypt and keep on your hard drive, or better yet on a USB stick or on a piece of paper, where no one can get it.  Then you can transfer it back to the exchange if you want to trade it.  But yes, the exchange will give you an address to send coins to if you have your own, and your wallet will give you one to receive to, to get them from the exchange.  You can change those addresses as often as you want, and you should, for security.

@_date: 2013-04-15 15:40:54
You must be new here. . .
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:31:06
Dude, MtGox is riddled with issues, why would you go with them when you have a choice?  Go with LibertyBit, it's reliable, fast, and they accept email money transfers long with the other standard methods.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:37:44
Oh god, this argument again.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:39:29
Are you a wizard?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:02:03
Cool story, bro.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:51:59
Hey, if it worked for the Goxbots. . .
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:56:03
The flip side of the b'coin, as it were.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:30:33
Agreed, it is the smallest unit.  
^^No ^^disrespect ^^to ^^Satoshi.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:59:54
Totally.  That's why I sold.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:35:55
I get what you're trying to say, but all he did was post some screenshots. The analysis is up to you.  
If you don't like the message you're getting, it's your problem. Judging by your upvotes my opinion is unpopular, but that's cool.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:45:48
PLZZZ SEEED FCUKERS!
That is what you sound like.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:55:00
Fair enough, but why 5 days?  
The level of confidence of some users on here only discredits their advice.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:35:37
Family: interested.
Coworker: invested.
This is going well.

@_date: 2013-04-13 17:09:23
Dude wtf.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:12:07
Future here - you were wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:30:26
I bought at 180, sold at 242, but then got caught in some bull traps on the way down before realising the "you are here" graphs were correct.  I lost some money but still believe in bitcoin so haven't gone anywhere.  It's now doing what I expect it to so I'm waiting awhile.  Sitting in Litecoin in the meantime in anticipation trading opening on Mt Gox.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:57:09
Gox's trading engine is looping the prices.  The API feeds bitcoinity, hence a nice sawtooth pattern.  Ever seen the movie SPEED?  You're the bomber watching the looping video before he knows it's looping.  My guess is you're gonna pull the trigger when you find out what you're looking at.
But it's too late!  Keanu already saved the girl!
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:00:13
Right now it's 0.00000001, also known as a Satoshi.
The more you know.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:34:35
Thanks, I think you were actually how I found it.  I'm just getting started and it seems like they're filling a niche for a nice consolidated platform for Canadians.  You're right about the depth. . .  I'm very new at this, would it be stupid to use Liberty bit to get some coins into my wallet and then go trade them at a place with more depth once I decide to sell if I have trouble filling that order with them?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:27:06
Your head. It's very hard.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:59:43
My advice is don't do that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:00:51
This is funny to read 11 hours later.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:24:21
Been using Libertybit for a week now, can vouch for fantastic and reliable service.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:53:32
Twist: OP is Satoshi.  
OP is a sentient supercomputer.

You should send the money to whatever exchange you want to trade on, at which point you can trade it in for bitcoins. The wallet is useful if you're not prepared to trade any time soon, then you can transfer your bitcoins there and store them off the exchange's server until you're ready to trade (at which point you can re-transfer them).  
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:39:38
I see you've never heard of mt Gox
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:58:17
If it's so predictable, why are you in here talking to us and not out sailing your yacht with the millions of bitcoins you sold at $260?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:06:02
Coming in here seven hours later and seeing you downvoted for being absolutely right is. . .comical.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:32:10
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:24:47
hmm. . . you mean unpredictability?
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:04:23
Well I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:05:26
My girlfriend just sold 14 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:29:54
chargebacks, scams, anonymity - all the advantages of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:57:23
Definitely up.  Huge disparity between them and other exchanges at the moment, . . . this is interesting.  Trading at $130 US right now
EDIT: Reddit, where you get downvoted for quoting a trading price.
