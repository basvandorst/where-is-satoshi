Sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Which part of what do you hate?
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:46:38
How would you plausibly do that?

*and your passport...*

Oh, sure. It's fine, I'm sure many people weren't actually aware that there were even a such thing as Bitcoin ICOs.

The premine allowed for the ICO, which means that Vitalik and others can work full time on scaling Ethereum. Here are a few ways Ethereum can be scaled:
* Sharding
* Lighting will be easier to implement
* There is no fixed block size limit, only the gas limit which can be raised slightly each block.
So no, it looks like Ethereum is doing pretty fucking well with scaling.

Litecoin is a nice attempt to "reboot" bitcoin, deleting the history, changing the block time, etc. I like Litecoin and it certainly has it's place in the crypto space. It just doesn't have any new technology. Bcash is the same in many respects. It changed parameters, just like Litecoin, but it didn't erase history. It doesn't have the adoption of Bitcoin, the cleanness of Litecoin, or the technology of Ethereum. It really doesn't have a lot going for it, but hey, it put an end to *The Bitcoin Scaling War*.

Why so much hate on Ethereum and Dash? Litecoin and Bcash are similar (and might be considered "bad") because they're basically Bitcoin with a few parameter tweaks. Bcash shares blockchain with Bitcoin, Litecoin doesn't.
Dash and Ethereum, however, have features which Bitcoin doesn't and are completely different things. How many ICOs do you see on Bitcoin? Significantly fewer than on Ethereum because Ethereum has an architecture and feature set that's very ideal for ICOs. 
How many people do you see using Ethereum on a day to day basis? Not nearly as many as Bitcoin because Ethereum is hard to understand, hard to use, and hard to set up. I haven't come across a good Ethereum mobile wallet yet. However, with Bitcoin there are plenty of wallets, because it's a simpler protocol and it's been around for longer.
So please stop ranking them in a 1-dimensional Good-Bad scheme. Thank you.

I deliberately wrote "How many" instead of "Do you see any", thinking of that one :-D

No. Computing cost gas, gas cost ether. Spam attacks will be expensive.

*Most* ICOs are scams. Some are legit ways to fund development. Regardless, Ethereum can do many things. Many cryptos could benefit from being Ethereum based. Some decided to go with Ethereum (think Golem). That means that the Ethereum team can focus on scaling the chain, researching things like PoS, etc, while the Golem team can focus on Golem. Ethereum's main purpose is not store of value, value is just a necessity for it to function.

Bitcoin was getting SegWit too.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:48:23
Might as well do an ICO too, right? I'm buying!

Put me down for 10,000,000 testnet ether worth of FKC!
