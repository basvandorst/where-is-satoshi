Bank holidays? So that's how they're going to shut down bitcoin. They'll take more bank holidays so we can't buy coin.

More importantly; when do fiat withdrawals stop?
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:29:26
Agreed, it's a pain for ATM's and exchanges like Coinjar (they'll need to revisit their business model). However, it's good for businesses accepting bitcoin, in fact it may have benefits for non-exchange business accepting as is attempting to explain.

Also I suggest you visit  if you're looking for the best deal on Australian exchanges. btcmarkets.net is very good and rates lowest today.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:50:58
It really depends if you're trading or just acquiring. bitstamp is a proper exchange, so you can place a specific order price and wait for the market to dip/rise and catch your order with the market volatility. With coinjar you would need to sit and watch it all day if you want a particular price.
btcmarkets.net achieves the same, however it needs more liquidity. As stated before keep checking 
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:50:54

btcmarkets.net. It's a real exchange. You can do limit orders, rather than accepting the Coinjar "fair for them" rate. Fee is now 0.85%, which I'm pretty sure is the lowest.

It could be bait to get you to deposit! By the time your deposit clears the price will be back up.

Your exchange rates are not very competitive. I'll stick to using my ING direct PayPass, which gives an extra 2% cash back.

Yes, this is one of many correct interpretations. It will all depend on each individual use case. The same way a trader is treated differently to a investor under the tax system in many countries.
Sometimes bitcoin may just be a ledger, for example colored coins.

Here's another paradox. If you're a BTC trader and you do more than 75k of sales you need to account for GST as it's an enterprise. But, if you add GST onto your BTC sales there is no longer an prospect of profit due to the GST (as you can't compete against personal sellers), therefore without the prospect of profit you can't claim to be an enterprise, which means you can't register for the GST.
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:24:50
I placed a few orders for $10k, strangely they executed at $553.67.

@_date: 2014-06-09 00:31:14
I'll assume you're right. Merchants already ask for ID for larger card purchases, they'll do the same with bitcoin.
In any event, don't you think systems will evolve to mitigate this problem (e.g. merchants may only trust ecosystem payments that could offer KYC such as Coinbase/Circle/coinkite etc)?
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:47:41
Yes, you would have to trust the producer. It's dangerous to use such storage anyway, there can't be a backup mechanism. However, tangible bitcoin may be useful from a legal perspective, hence the interest if it's possible.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:40:58
I'd suggest go via btcmarkets.net and slowly acquire using limit orders, however you will need to be patient as liquidity isn't huge (i.e. it may take a few weeks).
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:30:53
These rulings are overall positive. The personal use CGT asset ruling is fantastic. Just purchase your BTC from btcmarkets.net or an offshore exchange and you won't pay double GST!

@_date: 2014-03-01 22:43:33
The other possible false assumption. That the BTC available were ever fully backed, perhaps for every cash deposit in excess of BTC stock (or trade) they just added new virtual 'stock'.
This is why I now avoid some sites that sell you virtual stock, either you have the bitcoin or you don't. An example  Any delays are dangerous what if the price quadruples and sends them bankrupt.
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:17:14

Yes, I agree.  However, GST may apply to the fees. They should add a new currency pair BTC-GST/AUD for use by business wanting to clear their BTC inclusive of GST. I don't see retail customers buying from this pair as the price will include GST, but someone will turn it into an opportunity.

Verification does take a while. I think they use a third-party. 
They're very professional, but like most exchanges they take time to respond to support questions. In terms of expectations, please remember, you only pay around $2 to trade on 1BTC, which doesn't leave them with a huge support budget after all the other exchange costs.
You will eventually get verified, just be patient.

You're right, I can't even read my own rant. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:01:10
Yes. btcmarkets.net is the only real BTC market in Australia (at least that I can find). Unlike other sites, you can leave a lower priced order in the market and wait (hope) for some volatility to get a better price.
The UI and order matching need some improvement (i.e. match all orders), but otherwise it's great if you're patient due to lower liquidity.

I can see Carrier Pigeons working to a small degree, but how do I send a chicken across the country, let alone the world! The tx fee (freight) would be huge. 
Next time, please use better examples which are more compatible with the capabilities of bitcoin. OK, I see an issue with dividing carrier pigeons, but we could make them equal to 1 satoshi.

Does this mean that bitstamp price wouldn't be reflecting the true market demand?  Or,if there is less cash in bitstamp, sellers wanting to convert to fiat have to keep lowering the price?
Should I convert my remaining fiat on bitstamp, or do we have further to go down. Any ideas?

If these banks pass negative interest rates on to their customers, will European based BTC exchanges pass this on to traders holding fiat balances?
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:21:14
I seriously blame Coinjar, et al. Here's why:
CASE 1: Cash Deposits
1. Deposit money via cash
2. Doesn't go in, customer goes back to teller recheck the code.
**RESULT**: It costs the bank money as over-the-counter transactions are expensive.
CASE 2: EFT
1. Transfer Money nab-&gt;nab
2. Exchange deposit doesn't go in quickly as promised by Exchange (15 mins)
3. Exchange blames nab for delay in support forum (The exchange is special and have magical bullshit three day delay on deposits.)
4. Call bank, they assure me funds have cleared
**RESULT**: Complaints damage nab brand, complaints cost money.
CASE 3: Customer account compromised.
1. GreenID worked
2. nab account cleaned out
3. Exchange blames bank for shitty security and tells them to deal with the loss.
**RESULT**: Bank loses money. Bad business.

When (if?) bitcoins go mainstream, I’d suspect we’d end up with ‘coin banks’ that hold bitcoin for users. Most transactions won’t even touch the protocol directly, banks will just do settlement transactions on the blockchain. The ‘coin banks’ will even do instant payment confirmation, chargebacks and all the other things consumers demand (and unknowingly pay for). Sure, techies will be able to deal directly with the blockchain, until some regulations prohibit direct access, unless of course you have government issued license to deal directly in crypto related payment protocols. But then again they will most likely allow direct access to prevent the development of new black-market alt. coins. 
It may be one crazy cycle, but we could be back where we started and just as with gold, we may end up with third-party storage 'banks' to solve all the real world problems.

We have really only found people using bitcoin for legal activities in Australia, such as investment. 
Do they really think crims are going to do TT transactions to buy bitcoin?
Meanwhile this system  is constantly exploited in Australia to evade taxes and purchase drugs a thousand of times over. Just ask any tradie, restaurant or your local drug dealer.

It all depends when, where and how much you want to buy:
btcmarkets.net ask $650 ($656.50 @ 1%).
coinjar ask $661 ($674.22 @ 2%).
So btcmarkets.net is cheaper at the moment if you want to buy up to 1.5 BTC

Same problem. Try breaking it into smaller chunks (it worked for me). I think it fills slowly as new BTC comes into their hot wallet.
Also, this always seems to happen just before the market rises dramatically, i.e. less BTC supply coming into the exchange. I hope history repeats. (EDIT: 13 hrs later: I got that one wrong with a 10% drop)

It would have been interesting to see the response if it was deemed money. Aussies love their CGT tax discounts, just look at property. Bitcoin CGT rules are even better.

If you have a lot, you need to start looking at an offline wallet with paper backup (e.g. Armory, etc). They'll be fine, you can always test the private keys by a "Sign Message" and check the blockchain address online to confirm your coins are safe.
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:27:00
At cost? Who are you clearing with? 
These services are useful for expats needing to pay bills from overseas (i.e. rates etc). However, the costs don't make sense for locals, who could clear their coins on local exchanges and pay from their own accounts.

When you have enough fiat and BTC, you can dump on one exchange and buy back on another.

I gave up with Coinjar for the same reason. It's very random in terms of deposit times and I lost many buying opportunities. I suggest you try btcmarkets.net, it is also worth keeping an eye on  for any new entrants.

I still like credit cards for ecommerce and I don't care if my local café accepts bitcoin or if I can buy ecommerce online with bitcoin. Paying by card still has many advantages for me as a consumer as the dispute mechanism is unbeatable (for now).
However, I do get ripped off every time I travel overseas on my credit card for non-prepaid expenses - i.e.  rental cars, restaurants, taxis, museums, additional accommodation expenses, etc. Tourist cities/areas should get on-board and reap the benefits - less card fraud and extra sales for the early adopters.

The ATO and NY DFS should have talked to each other. Can they both be correct?
The proposed [NY DFS  BitLicense]( : *"Virtual Currency means any type of digital unit that is used as a* **medium of exchange**"   
The [ATO TD2014/25]( : *"The evidence available to the Commissioner informs the view that the current levels of use and acceptance of bitcoin within the community is far short of what may be regarded as sufficient or necessary to satisfy the test in Moss,* **nor is it a generally accepted medium of exchange** *as per Travelex. 29 Accordingly, bitcoin does not satisfy the ordinary meaning of money."*

nab TT to bitstamp works well. The funds are almost always cleared sometime between 21:00-24:00AEST at bitstamp.net, assuming you meet the 14:45  NAB deadline. 
I've been transferring to bitstamp in AUD and allowing bitstamp to do the conversion. The AUD/USD rate has been $0.01 below the spot, a few cents better than the NAB rate and even better than OzForex on some days depending on timing.
Sweet spot is around $AUD2500, otherwise look at using Coinjar. Breakeven (compared to Coinjar) is just above $1000. This takes into account the NAB $AUD22 fee and bitstamp $USD15 fee. Also $AUD8-AUD9 sometimes vanishes along the way from time-to-time.
