Let's call things with their real names. It was not a security argument, it was 100% politics. You can follow ostrich policy if you wish, of course.


Ok, it's a good opportunity to stop the convo because we have different points of view on this problem.

Please, read section 4.1 of  before doing such claims. Bitcoin (nor any other blockchain based coin) cannot survive a QC attack directed to its PoW. Obviously, Bitcoin won't adopt quantum PoW because ordinary miners won't get such hardware in time.


Maybe there is another, more recent, version of  which completely analyses scalability limits of LN but the copy I have doesn't analyse frequency of channel updates (which require to do on-chain transactions) depending on different conditions. It seems to me that the blockchain becomes a serious bottleneck in LN design, for an unknown reason the authors omitted this part in my copy.

Your assessment looks very optimictic. Block size drama clearly showed that Bitcoin is very unflexible when it comes to adding new features, especially if they affect business of some core devs. I don't want to fire a political discussion, but a discussion about *new* Bitcoin features will bring a lot of politics for sure. I'll just claim that we won't see the feature required by LN (or by another similar technique) added into Bitcoin until core devs have side business which will be affected by it.

You are wrong, I suggest to read the whole paper, not just skim over a part of it. If you are not confortable with the level of math used in the paper you can check
