Restaurants in major tech cities, university dining halls/bookstores. Get it bitcoin in places where potential early adopters are and give it visibility. It also needs a value proposition for them to buy in (as someone without bitcoins, they wouldn't want to buy bitcoins and then spend with them unless there's a discount or something else enticing them to start using it)

I've been trying to look into this recently... As best I can tell, your coins as you originally bought them have unrealized gains until you sell them on an exchange. It doesn't matter that the USD never hits your bank account, the process of buying and selling on an exchange realizes the gains that have occurred and adds to your taxable income. Similarly, if you purchase something with BTC directly, you are realizing your gains when the purchase is made and would owe a capital gains tax on top of anything that you purchase and any applicable sales taxes. For favorable tax status, hold coins for at least one year--long term capital gains are taxed less than short term (which should be taxed the same as normal income) 
If anyone has more concrete information about this or if I have said anything incorrect, please let us know

I've been wondering how I should store bitcoins, understanding that my current method was probably not safe but that I didn't risk losing much because I didn't have a hefty position, (and now I have next to nothing).

I would argue that the population that is willing to spend BTC now is not very large at all, but if merchants start accepting it as a payment method this population would grow in a viral fashion as people start seeing others using this "made up" money to actually buy things. This happens quickest when the risk is taken out of the merchant's hands

I came here to say this. Carry a little but in a wallet on your phone and be prepared to spend it if they do accept it. Then just purchase more coins to replace what you spent in order to maintain your position in Bitcoin.

if you're seriously looking into mining, shoot me a PM. It's far too late for ordering mining equipment now, but a share in a mining operation that ordered equipment a while ago is still a possibility. I have some shares in a mining operation and I'm considering selling part of my stake to spread my risk out a little more (all your eggs in one basket isn't a great idea when it comes to high-risk ventures) 
edit: in regards to your question about GPU, it only makes sense if you're not paying for electricity costs. GPUs are too inefficient to make money at this point, as there are specialty mining rigs that can do far more work with far less energy than you could hope to do with a GPU. However if you're not paying for electricity, you might as well join a mining pool and keep your GPU running. you won't make much (probably not even worth the effort to set it up if you're looking at present values of BTC), but it may be something years from now. or it could be zero. that's the game that we play here
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:25:34
it's pretty clear that you don't have to share it with anyone if you don't want to. and by sharing it, more people find out about bitcoin in an easy-to-use manner and not just in the headlines they hear on cnn. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:05:57
I think it's important to consider the risks of each, and not consider one as a sacred standard that will definitely be a better store of value. We don't know what the future will bring, and it's naive to act like we do.
Bitcoin could be shut down by the feds. As much as we say that it will not, my opinion is that it simply does not have the purchasing power to survive if the American government were to prohibit banks from accepting transfers from exchanges, or a similar scenario. Even if there are ways to get money out (purchasing gift cards, transactions directly with merchants who accept btc, etc), the value of bitcoin would take a huge hit in the process, and it may not be able to recover from an event like that. 
Conversely, the dollar value has been diminishing for years and it doesn't show signs that it will ever stop, at least in the near future and probably within our lifetimes. We are seeing broad socioeconomic signs that at least suggests that we could be moving towards revolution (discontentment among social classes, unpopular government that doesn't respond to the needs of the people, governmental financial problems, etc.)--and while I think it's crazy to expect it to happen, I'd posit that it's equally crazy to not consider that it *could happen*. Any doubts over the long-term stability of the dollar make investments in that currency quite risky. 
Right now there's far more weight on the bitcoin risk side of the scale, but that's why people use it as a high-risk investment and  aren't (or at least definitely shouldn't be) betting the farm on it. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 13:04:24
This. so much
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:08:14
I don't think this should be seen as a time to criticize the people who don't get bitcoin, it should be seen as a time to educate them on its merits. You did a good job at explaining how its similar to the dollar, but you didn't do much to explain why its different (non-inflationary, lower transfer fees, etc.) and why people should want to use it instead
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:48:30
But the prices are lower in countries with nationalized healthcare, are they not? (Assuming you're speaking from the POV of America, I could be mistaken. But the US clearly has the most hyper-inflated bills and does not have nationalized health care). 
And you say that the money could otherwise be used to make society more wealthy--what better way is there to make society wealthy than ensuring that they are healthy enough to be able to work and create wealth? Other than perhaps education. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 17:51:24
I think the idea of a free exchange is amazing, but is it realistic to hope that it can scale from the demand that such a platform will surely? I'd imagine that would require some hefty servers and support to keep it going. It would definitely be a game changer if you could figure out how to monetize it successfully

Edit: not saying that I disagree with the financials of what you're saying though. The ROI could well be higher by investing in BTC instead of paying extra to the loans. But there is a risk to it, and there's more to the equation than the numbers say by themselves

You might want to consider the risk/reward of cashing out now versus hanging on for a bit. It's only $1.25, so it's not going to affect your life that much if you cash out now. But consider the alternative. The price of bitcoin can be quite volatile (with large booms and bubbles happening in June 2011, and more recently in April 2013), and amounts that were trivial at one point can end up making you a lot more money in the long run. I was given 1 BTC for essentially nothing in 2012 when the exchange rate was somewhere around $10. I held onto it, and a few months later I noticed that the value of my gift had increased tenfold. I cashed out partially at ~160, and ended up using that to buy more as the bubble burst. I've since invested in a share of a mining operation, which will hopefully earn me back some monies soon (although whether or not it will become a profitable investment is yet to be seen. many people say it won't. But in order to make money, you usually have to take a risk, so I'm okay with my past decision)
Now there is a caveat to this. Bitcoin isn't necessarily going to succeed, you need to do your part to help it. If the people with the bitcoins hoard them, there's no reason for the rest of the world to want to use them. We're still very early in the adoption cycle, so do your part to help awareness of the currency. Take a look at [coinmap.org]( to see if you can spend any bitcoin nearby. If you can, try to support businesses that accept bitcoin. If it's not on the map, ask businesses if they accept it when you're there. It saves them money on credit card processing, and sometimes they pass that on to you. Tell your friends about it, and use it if you need to send money among yourselves and don't worry about PayPal's fees. Do your part to spread the coin, and help us all win. 
**TLDR: Don't be so eager to cash out. Spread the coin.**

I've tried a couple different exchanges and Coinbase has been by the the most user-friendly of them (queue Coinbase is not an exchange comments). There are definitely some places they can improve upon, but it makes it a lot easier for the average person to get involved in bitcoin than any competitor I'm aware of. 
So yes, some people do just love Coinbase the same way that they could love Google or any other company, and a lot of that may be justified by the user experience that they deliver
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:41:39
So the first time you sell the coins, you'll only owe long term capital gains on the profit that you made. If you make additional trades afterwards, those profits will be counted as short term capital gains, which are taxed at the same rate as normal income.

This raises an interesting questions about reallocating away from assets that see strong jumps in prices. I invested some a couple months ago and saw the value of that investment appreciate significantly, such that it was no longer a small portion of my investment portfolio. I was torn with whether to keep it all in bitcoin or to diversify my risk. 
I decided to keep it all in BTC, and here's why:
* I made this knowing that it was a high risk investment, and that all of the money could be gone. I see the possible upside to be large enough so that I'm okay with the risk associated with holding bitcoin. 
* It can be very difficult to try to time the market, especially with the crashes. You see a bubble forming and you realize it will come down, but you don't know when it will happen, or even if it will come down lower than you are at at a given time. A lot of prime selloff points may look like buying opportunities at the time. 
* The risk associated with bitcoin hasn't changed with the price increase. In fact, in light of the Senate hearings, I would say that the risk has *decreased* while the price is rising. While the volatility was increasing, the long term likelihood of success also increased, which is much more important if you're thinking long-term.
* The media attention following the last bubble made large improvements to the fundamentals and infrastructure surrounding the currency. I'd expect to see this happen again after the frenzy regarding exchange rate calms down. This also impacts long term success and solidifies bitcoin's position as  cryptocurrency. 
* I haven't held them long enough to achieve favorable tax status. I would rather be taxed at long-term capital gains rates than at ordinary income rates. This can't happen if I sell it all off.
* I'm young, and I have a lot of time ahead of me so that I can earn back any losses in a high-risk investment. Conversely, this also means that a small percentage of my portfolio is not very much

He's looking for someone to create an easy to use wallet for something like this.

He's talking about the poster above's handle being a throwaway.

Just my theory though)

The nominal value of one BTC isn't really important. It's incredibly divisible (so you don't have to buy one, as many people noted) and the dollar amount that you assign to it is really self constructed. It seemed pricey to me when I found out about it at ~$6... and I'm really wishing that I bought in then now that I know what the future is like. Just invest however much you would like to based on the fiat value, and realize that that amount can grow a ton or it can plummet to almost nothing. The amount of BTC you have is meaningless by itself

No, but a concerted effort to make it impossible to put money in or take money out would probably result in a huge loss of confidence in the overall liklihood of bitcoin's success.
