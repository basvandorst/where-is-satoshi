They're sort of fake. The ceo of one of the exchanges even explained that here. The numbers are highly inflated due to feeless trading. Bots selling and buying back and forth between themselves.

No. But people don't want to hear that the Chinese simply don't care about Bitcoin other than trading. Everyone has to love Bitcoin and if not --&gt; downvote.

Because they don't care about news about Bitcoin. They just (ab)use it to trade and make profit. They are not interested in anything else that has to do with it.

People don't like to hear this so they simply downvote it. The downvote system gets completely abused in this sub. It's crazy.

Obviously there are WAY more cases that weren't reported. Don't be so naive. 
To the downvoters: Feel free to explain why you are downvoting my comment.

Bigger pumps, bigger dumps.

You just lost the few people that were on your side. 
I'm 100% sure you behaved badly.

Wtf are you talking about? I don't trade, i am not mad and i don't care what the Chinese do. I can't even figure out how you managed to come up with this after reading my post. 
If anything it seems like you are the one who is butt hurt by what i typed. Why else would you reply like that?
