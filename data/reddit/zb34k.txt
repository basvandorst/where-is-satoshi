Thanks that would be great.  Or even links to food sources of information would be helpful!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:01:06
Buy on localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:43:44
Interesting link but it still doesn't address the question of pow vs pos
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:32:46
The cost of the energy is also a big concern.  Would be far more efficient to use POS and reward the holders rather than all this dead weight electricity cost.

I've ordered a ledger nano s but it hasn't arrived yet.  Also want to use the USB to store private keys of cryptos not supported by ledger, such as neo.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:32:57
Thanks.  That first bit made sense, the second part about sending 0.5 btc back to myself confused me though .
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:55:57
That ain't too bad been hearing of ppl paying like 80 dollars
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:10:35
Didn't ask you.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:58:01
Never heard of cex but they sound like scammers
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:07:29
Thanks.  If the wallet software got hacked and u were using a ledger you'd still be ok eh given u need to click those buttons on the ledger to perform a transaction
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:25:03
Those fees are shocking tbh.  Don't see how bitcoin is the future of international payments 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:18:12
What's that?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:21:43
What advantages does it have over alt coins?  Apart from it's brand I can't see any.  There are coins out there that can do what bitcoin does but better.  Imo there are other coins out there that have much more potential than bitcoin.  Bitcoin only represents value as people are willing to pay high prices for it - the same as any currency.  Other coins actually have value as they do something useful.  Some also pay dividends which also gives them value.

Thanks.  I thought bitcoin cash was supposed to deal with the 1mb block size limit? See:
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:38:54
Thanks for your help.  Increasing fees aren't good for the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:55:41
What determines the byte size of the transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:22:25
I thought his writing was great.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:24:01
Thanks for that.  So basically a new block is created every ten mins, but because of the increasing number of bitcoin transactions, there's no guarantee that your transaction will be included in that block which will result in a delayed processing time?
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:22:50
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:29:29
Can u explain what that means in noob language?
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:07:04
What's segwit? Bitcoin noob here
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:35:11
Can you explain further please? That didn't answer my question.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:49:05
Yeah but lots of other coins are way cheaper
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:53:57
Fuck off my thread if you're going to be an immature idiot
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:36:38
What are mixers and the off chain lightning network? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:37:10
Can you elaborate ?
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:34:43
Aren't block size increase and segregated witness the same thing ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:16:05
Thanks for the detailed explanation 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:07:48
Tbh the tech sucks compared to other coins
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:18:50
What's the point tho a keylogger would still get your private key when u had to enter it to do a transaction ?
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:21:17
Really how does it help?  Don't have much harddrive space left on my laptop 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:57:35
U post this on every thread about fees
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:14:54
Most assets are valued based on the present value of their future income.  Bitcoin produces no income.  There a cheaper coins on the market that can already do what bitcoin can do.  Maybe people will start to realise this and question it as a store of value at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:44:39
Not intending on it, just trying to keep my coins safe in the event my computer gets compromised 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:07:38
Ah that makes sense.  So transaction fees won't increase for buyers and processing time should stay at around ten minutes?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:59:19
Why were u selling at 8k? That's below market price
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:37:05
What do you mean by the resiliency of the bitcoin process? I've ordered a ledger but it won't arrive for a month as production is backlogged.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:42:22
What app is that that u are trading through ?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:41:14
Thanks that just deals with the coinomi wallet though 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:37:13
Currency was deflationary when backed by gold given gold is a finite resource
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:07:33
Until there is no more left to mine.  Quite similar to bitcoin really given bitcoin's supply will gradually decrease until 2120 or whenever it is when the 21 millionth will have been mined.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:32:32
No clue but the currency should be deflationary as gold mining reduces to
The extent the economy expands faster than the money supply?
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:12:23
It seems to me that the markup always goes to trusted party on localbitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:18:23
You can.  But if u don't have any trades someone will just pay a slightly higher price to someone who does.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:17:17
i don't know much about ripple, does
It facilitate the transfer of fiat currency? Or must you convert to ripple first - if so there will be a cost in that.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:14:17
That can't be true otherwise both parties could continuously transfer for a risk free return
