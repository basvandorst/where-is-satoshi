Use a bitcoin fee accelerator most are free and some cost like $5. They prioritize your transaction over others and include it.

The abandon option is greyed out, any ideas?

I’m in the same shoes, sent bitcoin from core to Coinbase with a 1.5sat/b fee and it’s been over 2 weeks and nothing. I was told the memepool clears after 2 weeks but this is not true and I think at this point you just have to wait for it to get cleared.

Bitcoin is open source so if you feel you can benefit the code in some way you can submit your feedback and it could possible get implemented

Not true I’m been waiting over 2 weeks for an unconfirmed transaction

Do you know if there’s a way to stop a transaction broadcasting in bitcoin core or is it just a waiting game for it to get returned because I don’t think my 1.5aat/b will get confirmed anytime soon lol

Fundamentals aren't always the biggest selling point, sometimes its how you market it. Take beats, apple, some designer brands, not the best products but people love it because they're willing to pay for it.

This will not be effective, using your laptops and computers aren’t even effective you need specialised ASIC chips to mine BTC nowadays.

“Basically, there are governments/institutions that can force you to provide information about users of your platform and at the same time you are not allowed to inform the public about just that. A warrant canary turns that game around by saying "If I don't say something, then it happened", in this case, "when my warrant canary disappeared, it happened". It is unclear whether governments can force you to "keep saying something".”

Tomorrow could be a couple more thousand or less, no one knows. However, I do predict the morning it will be low then midday it will spike if you want evidence I have none just my guess, but it is as good as the next person.

Do you not think bitcoin should be accessible to everyone?
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:16:30
And now in OSRS they made they accessible to everyone (like bitcoin should be) and they’re worth nothing so
