There wasn't a bank run in 2009, banks just stopped lending to other financial institutions thus drying up liquidity in the financial system. The Fed steps in as the lender of last resort to other banks, but they are only lending money over night, so I would argue that if "everyone" really did go to withdraw their funds from banks at once, there is nothing that The Fed or the FDIC could do to prevent bank failures. That is the nature of fractional reserve banking.

ASIC stands for "Application Specific Integrated Circuit. It is a piece of hardware that is used to "mine" Bitcoins. Bitcoins are created at a specific rate (that declines over time) and given to people who hash the information in order to verify ownership and record transactions to that there is no double spending.

Regulation does not prevent Ponzi's and it does not protect depositors in the US banking system. What b103 says about bank runs *is* true. The FDIC insures deposits of up to $250k however it only has the funds to cover about 1.35% of insured deposits. So if everyone did decide to make a run on the banks and withdraw their funds, not even the FDIC could save our banks from going under. Read up on fractional reserve banking for a more complete picture.
Also, check the FDIC website for the designated reserve ratio:
