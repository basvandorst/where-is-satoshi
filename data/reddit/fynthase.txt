I've been wondering the same thing for a while.  The fact that BTC Market Cap (~$12B) is less than the cost of a 51% attack (~$2B) is troublesome.

It'd be nice if you had prices on your website

What's a scenario where someone would need to use this?

Thanks, get it now!

Thanks for the suggestion; hopefully something will come of it.

Yes, however actually implementing something like this is very difficult, especially with the low-volume of tweets coming in pertaining to Bitcoin

Thank you, did the calculations before bothering to click here.

~5 Billion.  
First I took the most efficient miner ( which costs $3999 for 1344000000000 hashes per second.  The whole Bitcoin network operates at 3407547000000000000 hashes per second (  Set up a proportion (1344000000000 /3407547000000000000=3999/x) and solver for x where x is the total cost of the network then divided by two.

good point

It is, thanks

According to  total network hashrate is 3.407,547 Thash/second.  Is this wrong?
