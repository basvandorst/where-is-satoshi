That being said, localbitcoin transactions are usually done in cafes and hotel lobbies, not "dark alleys." They are by and large very pleasant experiences with interesting people
Seriously, it might be a novelty and fun, but having to do that in the modern age is laughable and impractible.  Just as online banking is better than using a high street branch. Actually its much much much more convenient,  I think most people will agree.  Multisig still requires 3rd party trust.  Proof of reserves might work, but to understand it is so complicated that the average joe is never going to bother.  If average joe isn't going to bother bitcoin can't grow much.

multi sig/ proof of reserve still does not prevent an exchange from pulling the plug (maliciously or otherwise), just because they won't be able to run off with your coins, doesn't mean you won't loose them.   Whatever happens we have to trust them, and so far their record is no better than the banks, but at least the banks are regulated, you can get your money back.  (and regulating bitcoin isn't something I want, it defeats the purpose of cryptographic trust)

You can't turn fiat to bitcoin safely online
You can't turn bitcoin to fiat safely online
You will never be able to do either saftely online.
You can do both in person reaonably safely, but in that situation you might as well keep the cash you are exchanging for, its more annonymous and fungible.
