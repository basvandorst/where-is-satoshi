Look, I agree that Capitalism is the natural state of the world. I'm just saying that Marx didn't explicitly outline any pragmatically sustainable guidelines in his works so we really can't blame people for using the 10 tenants listed in the Manifesto. That being said, this should prove that how much of a joke Communism is.

Let's yooooo! Break resistance haha

Marx fails to state any superior tenents ever again. So this is by far, his best shot at a pragmatic agenda

You started comparing 0.1 in terms of USD denomination. You then proceed to make 80M the numerator, in I'm guessing fiat. Given this syllogism I feel like it's pretty clear you are attempting to denominate in fiat. I see the point you are making, in which if the world operates under some sort of BTC (21M) capped system. But let's just take the 80 Trillion (GDP of Earth) and use that as max capacity. This case would mean that you would own about 0.000000004761905 of the total system. Denominated in USD would be about $380,952. All I'm saying is even 1 BTC = 1 MIL, still brings the market cap over 20 Trillion. But who knows, I do think this socialist indoctrination could lead to some hyper inflation right before the fall of fiat (which seems to be the natural hail marry), I guess 80M a Coin is within the realm of possibilities.

I think there is a good chance of it. Social Security is poised to collapse eventually and not to mention collective debt as well. But it wouldn't matter since the denomination would always be the 21M BTC anyways

21,000,000 \* 80,000,000 = 1.68E15! Def not a realistic market cap my guy.
