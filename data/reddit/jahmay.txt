What was his account doing that was weird?
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:37:31
Sure thing. It’ll be something simple. 2560x1080. Black background with just the bitcoin logo and the words on the bottom. I’m not much of a designer at all though. lol.

Listening to his podcast today he mentions he doesn't have bitcoin [

Sell me 1
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:47:36
Great listen!
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:21:40
Listening to his podcast today he mentions he doesn't have bitcoin [
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:33:43
I listen to every one of his podcasts. He thinks it's going to zero.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:33:39
Because I don't think he's ever made an accurate prediction.
@_date: 2019-06-02 00:12:27
I just use a google extension to always be able to see it.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:54:51
That's going to be worth a small fortune some day. lol

Made him a millionaire over night.

Peter Schiff is a really smart guy, but man he does not understand Bitcoin as much as he thinks he does.
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:00:58
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:10:25
He talked a little bit about that today [
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:48:31
In 6 years yeah.

@_date: 2019-06-16 07:50:21
In the hour long debate he says he missed the train on btc bubble and wouldn’t jump in now because that’s how bubbles end. When doubters give in. 
He’s mentioned before that IF he had bitcoin he would be pushing for it, but dude really hates it.

What's the fees? The one near me didn't say and I think it was like $3 even though I only put $20.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:21:23
Have you read that book?
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:23:04
Where can I see the market cap of gold in real time?
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:23:49
1% of my net worth? Heck yeah I can afford to put $3 in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-09 05:15:24
I like to lose money like a man.
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:36:23
Where’s the other one?
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:36:18
I believe bitcoin will be mined until 2140, long after we’re gone. Then the miners will still get paid in transfer fees.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:36:35
This pie taste better.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:37:19

Sorry I'm not a very good designer and I tried moving the images around to fill the space but couldn't get it to work right. I grabbed the code/equations from the whitepaper and the quality isn't that great.
If you want to try for yourself here is the photoshop file: [

I can remove it for you. What resolution is your screen? I made these for a 21:9 monitor 2560x1080.

We are all Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:08:29
The code and equations in the image are all the ones from the white paper. Any ideas of other ones you think I could add?
