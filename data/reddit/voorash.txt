I have been actively reading bitcointalk for a while but when I finally decided to register it was not possible as registration says it is disabled every time I try.  I just assumed that had something to do with the issues they had a little while ago and so I haven't kept trying for the moment.

Best I can do at the moment is to say I have been selling books for my publishing company blackserpenterotica.com for years on amazon apple and other stores.  The website for that company points to my new store.  Other than that I am sure I will gain trust over time.  Reddit was suggested to me by someone on kboards in the author forum.

I am not sure if it is scammy to buy when you are nsf because the card is listed as backup which to me means that bank account is primary but the card is an acceptable means for buying bitcoin.  I use the instant buy on coinbase occasionally and I always have money in my bank account to cover it but I would not have assumed I was doing anything wrong if I let it come off my card instead.

Hopefully that won't be a problem.  Didn't really occur to me at the time.

I have to agree about the making bitcoin more prominent on your site.  We sell erotica which you would think would be an easy sell but I recently made bitcoin front and center on the website

Because no one needs my address to buy ebooks.  In fairness I don't ask my customers for their identities either.
