Because housing is impervious to bubbles and depreciation over time. Ever see an old house in detroit? Not trying to say bitcoin is like an old shitty house. I think it's great. I think cryptos are the future. All i'm trying to say is that there doesn't have to be only 1 crypto currency, I don't think that there should be a single coin to rule them all.

That's actually a good point. But damn, a lotta people getting those doge painted model Ts. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:08:36
Didn't they say that about bitcoin too?
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:36:50
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:14:18
The model T was also the first. Do you drive one?
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:52:45
redditor for 5 hours, pretty much sums it up.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:21:57
Would you drive it to work everyday? I'm trying to say that both bitcoin and dogecoin have their own uses. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:51:09
Everything you've been saying. Maybe I'm just expecting hate, it's what I'm used to... Such abused.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:01:55
I don't think dogecoin will be 800 bucks per. BUT, I have a shit ton more dogecoin than I do BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:30:25
how is it any worse? 
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:14:32
Go on...
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:42:56
Kind of. Like I said, I support both. Either way, doge is shakin' things up.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:03:10
Remember shibe, kill them with kindness :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:25:38
And I do the same with doge. You do you, I do me. Just can't understand the hate, as if dogecoin is hurtful to bitcoin. Any success of any crypto only serves to strengthen bitcoin and further legitimize crypto currency.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:08:26
More than a few times I've seen dogecoin's daily volume move more than BTC and LTC. That's outside of reddit.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:05:50
That's awesome, hope you guys keep it up. We just have ourselves a little bit of friendly comPAWtition.

I saw on my way to work that the highway in Darrington has been closed down. Damn, I had no idea.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:37:06
OK, that's fair. Neither did the chevy corvette.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:22:15
I know this. I've seen the chart, granted we're maybe talkin bobsled time here.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:11:12
Much yoda, So Shibe +1337 doge
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:13:16
They actually announced they aren't changing anything. That is to say there was never a hard cap.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:10:21
does it matter? 
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:18:43
I'd tip you, but it's frowned upon up in here.
@_date: 2014-02-03 08:10:25
I was only playing, just a trolling shibe here. But doesn't the fact that ripples are non-minable concern you at all? I hear them being called scam coins.
@_date: 2014-02-03 07:18:41
regarding  I hear you saying buy doge.
