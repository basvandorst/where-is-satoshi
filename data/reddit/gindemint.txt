Nope, current Congressman.

Not really. The DEA has the authority to reschedule drugs without congressional approval; in fact, it's easier for them to than Congress. You're also failing to address the fact that he *has* done everything in his power to change the law.

It's almost like the parties differ internally on many issues!

And a remarkable record in the private sector! He founded two Internet-based companies that earned him hundreds of millions, which he then used to start philanthropic ventures.

He sponsored the legislation to change the law, has attracted co-sponsors, has visited DC's dispensary to show support for medical marijuana, and he made the DEA official look like an idiot. I don't know what else you think a single, relatively junior, congressman can do.

Holy shit that movie is just as weird as it seemed when I was a kid.

I don't think you understand what happens in law school. In Evidence, you learn the Rules of Evidence. In Civil Procedure, you learn the Rules of Civil Procedure. You don't learn the professor's view on capital gains or gay marriage.

I'm very sorry that your legal education was so bad.

...because that's the law. Presumably he covered limitations imposed on the commerce clause in Lopez and other cases, since limitations on the commerce power have been established since the early 90's. I mean, my ConLaw professor *brought the SCOTUS suit* against the ACA, but he still had to talk about the expansive nature of the clauses you listed because that's the law. 
If he didn't, then you might just have an unusually shitty professor.

Do you actually buy the idea that Ted Cruz isn't a creature of the establishment? He went to Princeton and Harvard Law, and his wife works at GS. Come on.

The US had tons of taxes before 1913. They weren't income taxes, but there were huge tariffs, alcohol taxes, property taxes...

I've read each of these stories, thanks. I accept that Ted Cruz is incredibly intelligent. Everyone agrees that he is brilliant. I completely disagree that he's the kind of 10th amendment conservative described above.

He (well, his ghost writer) stole many think tank excerpts, word for word. Did Rand Paul do it himself? Almost certainly not. But his book still has tons of plagiarized material.
