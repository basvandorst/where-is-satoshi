Gold, Silver &amp; BTC is what i store my savings in since 2013.
We'll see how it turns out, i reckon much better than a FIAT "savings" account!
Well done uncle!
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:13:32
Shit article.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:13:45
Thank you for this summary, i really appreciate this; a tl;dr for the sub.
Happy new year!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:57:52
Great to hear.
My mother told me about Bitcoin in the german news and major features in TV lately, really looks like mass media coverage is taking off  :)
That level of growth (the all-time bitcoin price chart is ridiculous right now!) can't be sustained, sure, but most of us are used to seeing the bounces up &amp; down now, i think.
Cheers, hodl!

There are LOTS  of BTC going to somewhere in Iowa (i presume from the location given by fiatleak.com), could this be related to this...?
Never seen that before, this adress seems to have bought nearly 400 bitcoins in tthe last ten minutes alone...
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:07:36
It's optional, so you won't have a problem.
Adds an extra layer of security, just make sure you remember the passphrase if you encrypt your wallet! 
I lost a few bits some time ago this way, i use non-encrypted, offline-generated bitaddress.org paper wallets; cold enough for me.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:13:38
You're welcome.
Yes, one can never be too cautious :o)
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:24:56
Uhh, i mostly go with the recommendations in the bitcoin core wallet; they tell you a fee and the time it's about to take.
Mycelium uses quite a high fee so its fast, maybe you should ask in r/bitcoin here-
it would be a nice sticky post also, since this should be helpful to a lot of users
(and i can't give a reasonable answer).
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:00:07
Import both keys in Mycelium by just scanning your QR codes, done.
I always do so and send it on to my wallet on my PC, takes literally just a few mins.
I also use this method to sweep my exchange wallet when i bought some, don't like my coins in hot wallets either.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:09:24
You're welcome, and yeah, you can never play it too safe IMO.
I use Mycelium for a few years now, never had an issue.
Lets you view your balance in a paper wallet without importing the private key also, love this feature :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:02:48
Learned this myself only 2 weeks ago, using Mycelium for years.
I imported my paper wallets and can check their actual worth without having the private key on my phone ( you still can _send_ money to them, though).

Hot storage always is risky, move them to a paper wallet if you want to store them.
I keep a small amount on my bitcoin core wallet on my PC to use, rest is in very cold storage.
If you are using a windows machine, maybe a Trezor is the better option for you.

Yeah, after having your palms scanned and giving out all kind of info about yourself.
Wow, freedom.
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:20:11
Surely they can since they have different names.
linuxwallet.dat and wallet.dat, same folder. 
As said, i usually replace the newly created blank wallet after install with my old wallet by renaming it to wallet.dat &amp; overwrite the blank one.
Running the client, i then save the wallet under a different name.
Has worked this way for at least 3 Updates...
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:05:55
come on! now we know, at least there's three of us :o)
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:20:46
Since when?
I been renaming it since at least 2013.
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:42:21
Yes i do, the new one gets created in the same data directory folder the old one is in.
I usually copy my (different-named) wallet.dat file into that folder before running Core for the first time after updating, worked fine so far...
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:41:23
Deleted everything and tried again-
it's working.
You can change the name of the wallet.dat to whatever.dat when you save it, no problems here either.
Thanks for your help, everyone!
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:34:27
The price manipulation is done at the stock markets, nothing physical there.
Doesn't matter if the subject you trade is gold, bitcoins or food, the process is the same.
At least i assume thats what you mean...?
As far as i am concerned, i put my savings in both precious metals &amp; cryptocurrency-
they may control the price to some extent, but they can't get hold of it
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:12:38
Never heard about it.
Take at least 3 upvotes @_date: 2015-06-27 09:12:13

had to forward the port in my UFW also, forgot that i activated it some time ago.
Running wild now :o)
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:08:46

I really like the previous version &amp; i'm looking forward to the new one.

you leave me speechless.
thanx mate!
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:07:53
Unfortunately, Bitcoin price is rigged as well.
It's traded on stock markets like precious metals, yet more easy to manipulate cause of its tiny market cap, which a single player could buy.
Fractional reserve banking &amp; interest rates will have to die first before we can make a new start.
So, let's crack on, shall we?
That's what i like about bitcoins the most: every single transaction is my personal stab to the heart of our financial system.

so you're right, after some fuckups, in 2011 they changed a lot of things &amp; meanwhile are certified by some german authorities even- wow.

I made a photo of the QR code to post it here, of course i had to try if it works to scan the .jpeg from the screen-
it worked, problem solved.
It looks like the greyish print on that "sleek black" cards is a bit of an unlucky combination...hope this will work with different clients, i sure won't be using this wallet often if i have to type in the keys by hand...
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:53:43

@_date: 2014-12-23 14:10:51
IMO the tx volume just shows how much bots and daytraders wanna make a fast buck, they don't care about bitcoin. 
just selling and buying; rigging the price as they do @ wall street with every other asset; and thats much easier with btc cause of the tiny market cap (ONE big single player could easily buy all coins available!)
we see rising volumes &amp; falling prices, ever wonder why?
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:07:28
Paul "the paperbear" Prichard sometimes orders bullion down under, and he's willing to accept BTC- check his [blog]( he's also on ebay. He's a very enthusiastic silver bug and one cool guy, bought lots of SBSS and some classic bullion like maples, phillis etc. from him.
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:13:42
u serious? lol
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:29:35
best and safest exchange IMO, using 2FA, encrypting their mail to you via PGP(!), very fast- i really like to use them.
they even got certified by german finance experts; working together with Fidor bank who explicitly allow and encourage bitcoin use- well done.
try it &amp; check for yourself, i'm using it for over a year now &amp; will stay with them. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:48:34
Looking at those vertical drops in the price charts, it looks to me like those wallstreet gamblers do the same to bitcoin they do with every other asset.
This really doesn´t look like normal and started about the time the first stocks were set up, i think.
How come the market reacts histerically to "bad" news and doesn´t care about good news actually? this used to be very different, for weeks now we see the price going sideways despite the fact BTC is doing really well...
that´s a rigged game somehow.
"Stock prices are not influenced by news" is the most stupid thing i recently heard, btw. Where has this professor been the last few decades, behind the door? LMAO

Make sure the phone you use is bought with cash also and it's IMEI doesn't point to you; and pay cash for the prepaid card!
Otherwise you're not anonymous- it's rather hard to not give away any detail that could reveal your identiy...educate yourself about that with the silk road bust in mind.
People there were very confident in their anonymity using TOR, tails, Proxys, VPNs etc. but got caught anyway; and there were some bright minds among them; so, itś not at all easy. Take care!

hey, bought exactly this one 2 months ago!
ordered via amazon, it was €35, worth every penny for it's easy to handle, has amazing power and is a really fun thing to play with in your living room :o)
tested it outside last week, even while its windy it stays stable (and it's very fast, you can even do flips and rolls!)
there's battery packs with 500mAH for it so you can fly 12mins. at least.
So, if you haven't got a Xmas present for your kids yet, here you go!
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:35:03
Since there is loads of information about BTC &amp; you probably dunno where to start, i'd recommend you play around with a few cents in Bitcoin to figure out how it works in real life.
Get a wallet like [Mycelium](  ,
do a youtube search and watch how to use it; there are many good vids out there.
Setup a [changetip]( account, collect the bits you just earned, and practice ;o)
start u up 3 internets @_date: 2014-05-18 12:36:57
man, did u read the date?!
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:54:26
so what would you call them?
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:29:17
Probier mal Mycelium aus; selbst aufm platten Land hab ich in 30km Umkreis 3 oder 4 Leute, die kaufen und verkaufen (sieht man unter "Bitcoins kaufen und verkaufen"", auch wenn man noch keinen eigenen Account hat).
Geniales Programm, nutze ich seit ca. 7 Monaten und bin mehr als zufrieden.
@_date: 2014-09-25 08:26:51

This is actually good news ;o)
Also, they' re aware of PGP und actually USE IT to encrypt E-mail communication, something my bank has'nt even heard of^^
Along with 2FA, Yubikey &amp;mTAN via registered phone it feels rather good buying my coinz there, they really seem to make an effort &amp; stay up to date concerning security and technology.
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:21:18

@_date: 2014-05-14 11:17:31
well done, deserves my first tip. so here's my 50 cents ;o) @_date: 2014-08-11 06:47:26
Stick to fiat money &amp; banks if u want interest.
Luckily BTC doesn't work this way, that's why it's the better monetary system.
That's one of the major problems about fractional reserve banking; everyone wants to "watch their money grow" without having to work for it.
Look at it as if it was gold: its getting more wealthy every day while fiat keeps losing its worth, so you don't need interest rates anyway :o)
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:58:22
Great to see!
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:14:53
sorry for your loss mate.
maybe consider switching to linux mint, windows is always a security risk and that "antivirus" crap won't help anything.
give it a try, i did a year ago after 16yrs of using windows and i really love it.
I'm running Bitcoin core on it, also, works splendid.
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:02:52

I just can't believe they really demand this; imagine some older woman in front of her screen learning about BTC the first time, checking your tax report...
another reason to hodl.

@_date: 2014-12-25 20:32:08
they surely are, and if you're comfortable sharing your online banking username/password-combination with anyone, go ahead.
given that the majority of users runs vulnerable windows machines &amp; don't care too much about security, that's pushing your luck, i think.
@_date: 2014-09-25 08:15:16
Bought two cryptocards two months ago and gave one to my buddy, loaded with a few cents to show him how it works &amp; get him interested.
I think the idea promoting BTC this way is great; i like your thoughts on most people hodling, that's part of the problem.
I'll print a nice paper wallet and give it to a female friend of mine now-
better than using your coins to buy silly gadgets...
@_date: 2014-08-12 07:05:32

As a gold bug also owning bitcoins, it´s interesting to see how one group keeps bashing the other, most of them showing very little knowledge of gold (as in here) or bitcoins (several gold forums i am on).
I do believe in both, for it´s a way to keep my government from robbing my hard-earned money. Sure both assets do have some disadvantages, but i still prefer them to all other sort of storing my wealth.
Open your mind people, gold has been a form of money since thousands of years; also keep in mind none of your fancy smartphones would work without gold, not to mention silver...
i just hope the greedy stock market riggers will not be able to play the same game with Bitcoin, swaps, derivatives and the like are "financial instruments of mass destruction", thats the only thing Buffet says i agree to^^
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:03:17
I blame 99% of miners for only caring about profit.
Shove the problems to the community and developers while all you care about is your "investment".
That´s the major flaw in the bitcoin system; people´s greed for money money money- look how mining has changed, big players investing BIG money to get their piece of the cake.
I just can´t imagine anyone of them gives a fuck about Bitcoin itself as long as they earn lots of cash; the people building those huge mining sites often don´t even know what it is, they just dump their money into the next hype.
Sad to see this, but that´s how it looks to me

I did a trade with a dude from spain half a year ago via bitcoin.de, all went smoothly.
Buy yourself a Yubikey for correct 2FA and check it out, they work hand in hand with Fidor bank, a bitcoin friendly partner, and do a pretty good job so far.
Educate yourself about storage, i strongly recommend using paper wallets! I use those to store larger amounts and have bitcoin core &amp; mycelium running to manage them.
What do i think about /changetip? works great! 300bits Also, if you're a windows user, consider switching to Linux :o)

thanks for claryfing! take another internet @_date: 2015-01-09 11:47:27
that's why i left them &amp; opened a fidor account in 2013.
for all my btc related transactions, i use that account, my "normal" banking is with Deutsche Kreditbank.
check it out, you can try using Fidor while keeping your Sparkasse account for all non-btc related banking.
btw: i bought some btc 3 weeks ago, took less than 10min. from start to finish!
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:36:08
upgraded two weeks ago and had the same issue.
had to uninstall the old version to get it to work, it's running fine since then
(rooted android), so try that maybe.
best of luck!
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:50:53
rebooting the phone won't help much, i had to erase all traces of the previous version, not just reinstall the new one.
so if you used mycelium before with the older version, you might try that; again, good luck
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:42:55
did anyone actually WATCH the vid?
brilliant analysis of bitcoin IMO, Mr. Adams really gets it, i second him in every point...thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:04:58
after all the alerts goin on over the last weeks, how can one still keep his coins in a hot wallet at this shitty site?
this will happen again and again, people don't want to learn, so pay the price.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:44:22
thanks for your feedback, good to know.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:10:09
thanks for the info!
@_date: 2016-03-13 18:55:24
Sadly, it reminds me of being old, having experienced it over 30yrs ago...man, time flies
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:40:04
i can't agree with everything you said, yet i have to admit you make some good points, sir.
i will watch that vid again later, i think.
@_date: 2015-01-10 11:27:15
thanks for the info, missed it
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:23:03
Yeah, finally an exchange that lets you convert BTC into shit.
"It's not a currency, it's used for buying drugs online &amp; for money laundering, but we'll take it anyway"
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:53:43
This was great, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:48:21
Yes, Xapo looks nice indeed.
The only thing bothering me is, i don't need a bitcoin debit card after this one payment- so what is the minimum time before i can stop using it (one month, 1 year?) 
1 € monthly fee doesn't kill me, but i feel it's unnecessary, for i don't have any use for the card later, you know?
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:14:08
Oh my god, they killed Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:13:21
Indeed, so sad it's the only (!) payment option in 2017 when it comes to PDC live streaming.
They use streamamg.com as a host, not a very popular choice, it seems.
Thank you for your answer anyway!
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:19:16
Just head to the playstore and check "My apps &amp; games", you are given the option to update there.
I also tried to update via Mycelium's "about" page, won't work :o)
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:26:59
You'd have spotted my T-Shirt before making eye contact.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:27:49
Hey Bitcoiners,
i want to subscribe to the PDCs Darts streaming service und unfortunately, their only payment option is via credit card.
I just looked into this comparison by weusecoins; however i would like to ask here as well:
have any of you used Bitcoin debit cards, what are your experiences?
Shady stuff or serious, established business?
@_date: 2016-06-03 08:26:56
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:46:04
Didn't know people care about this.
Seem to care less about spreading their data using Facebook and Whatsapp, but hey, here you go:
@_date: 2016-06-13 08:12:30
Congrats for hodling!
My average is ~500€, so patience finally paid...cu in 3 years^^
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:57:24
I just upgraded my "blockchain drive" from 500 to 1000GB, never saw a better offer (250GB SSD = 60€)!
Get em while they last!
@_date: 2016-11-11 10:15:01
Thanks for sharing this!
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:24:50
Just checked, over 100 GB space required for the blockchain now; when i set up my system, it was less than 70GB...
It's on my old 500GB harddisk, only used for Bitcoin core, so i don't care and like  that i can give sth back to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:56:26
Was around 6 when i first paid attention...
just saw price pass $927, now that's a end-of-the-year-rallye
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:16:45
Great job!
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:39:14
I was clearly ahead of my time^^
I am 44, so one of the old fucks round here...
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:18:26
often it does, as do most assets.
dunno why, don't really care for i hodl and don't trade
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:40:37
I hardly saw them 1 minute, had no chance to explain anything-
they were busy playing :o)
I told their mom all she needs to know; the older daughter is about to get her first smartphone maybe, so she could buy one with her own money and have her Bitcoins in a wallet like Mycelium...
i honestly am excited to see what will happen.
She is a very clever girl, so, no worries...
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:41:26
People=trading bots
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:36:58
Because the shills want it to be this way.
They let gold &amp; silver prices plummet today, also
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:24:20
Stating that "fraud in cashless payments is at an all-time high", for 7.90€/month you can insure yourself, if your login/account data of your online bank account or your credit card data gets stolen, you will be reimbursed.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:54:56
Thanks for this mate, r/bitcoin TL;DR
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:24:03
Smart man, great talk.
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:31:47
Anyone here using a SSD with his node?
I wasn't sure about it and deciced to run bitcoin core on a second, "old school" drive.
I'd like to know if there are any issues that showed up after, say, two years or so; concerning the lot of read/write cycles and performance..?
If it wasn't about the blockchain, i honestly would never again buy something else than a solid state drive- it's sooo much better, it's marvellous.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:50:29
Did so last year, i gave a 20€-Wallet to both daughters of a friend of mine as a gift in September last year.
Just checked, they own around 250€ each now. Nice gift, right?
@_date: 2015-07-05 19:09:44
@_date: 2015-08-05 10:53:53
I'm afraid quite a few people will actually do this, driven by the fearmongering stories everywhere...good luck with that, you're right :-/
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:31:18
Had some issues with the previous release, could not backup my wallet because the touchscreen wouldn't respond in the menu where you have to enter the seed.
Strange bug, gonna check out this version; maybe its ok now.
Thanks for constantly updating, improving &amp; informing, great work!
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:45:59
Oh, 
there's actually nice people in here :o)
Enjoy a coffee &amp; a donut whilst setting them up EDIT: hey where's the coffee...? + 1 coffee @_date: 2015-07-14 07:49:09
Paypal or CC only^^
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:59:43
Piece of propaganda shit.
Yeah, invest in stocks and bonds, that's a brilliant idea.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:09:44
so are precious metals, so what?
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:15:40
If you use Android devices with a Google account, you already are part of it; Google stores all your logins for you- on its servers.
Convenient, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:04:02
What a brilliant idea.
Take the gambling that causes the whole system to break down &amp; apply it to cryptocurrencys, also.
Greed knows no boundaries.
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:47:31
Stopped reading after "Your fingerprint is your password"-
terrible idea, totallly unsafe as anyone can duplicate your prints even w/o physical access.
Watch how two guys reconstructed working fingerprints just from a hi-res photo:
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:25:34
Hey scammer!
Good luck in ripping more people off here.
I'm still waiting for the Yotaphone i paid you 0.65 btc for some months ago:
You got something to say to clear this up?
Obviously, you didn't when i mailed you multiple times to ask what's going on.
Anyone else here got ripped off by this guy?
Was really nice first, we talked in here &amp; on skype; as soon as he got the money he fucked off and didn't react to anything.
This was why i contacted him:
Seeing a thief collecting tips from nice people here hurts me, please avoid this guy!
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:02:39
If you had actually read what he wrote, you'd have noticed that the majority of Germans speaks english pretty well, Mr. "SwagPokerz"...we just like to used OUR language, not yours.
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:19:17
Please upgrade folks, just did it and the whole procedure took less than 5min...
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:30:38
Since it's your life savings, and noone here knows where the bitcoin price will go: have you considered splitting the risk and money and buying half gold, half BTC?
Sure they will rip me apart for this suggestion, but i think 14k are a bit too much to put it all in one pot.
Just like bitcoins, gold (once you have it in your hand physically) is anonymous and out of reach for banks &amp; government.
Sure, we don't know where the price goes, either, but crashing economys and unstable markets usually lead to increasing precious metal price, so i won' t worry about that.
I'm all for bitcoin, don't get me wrong, but there's plenty more ways of fucking up your financial situation when it comes to securing your money.
Educate yourself about creating offline paper wallets and DO NOT use Electrum, Mycelium or any wallets from exchanges unless you're tech savvy and know what you are doing...
best of luck, hope all works out well for you!
@_date: 2015-07-22 06:52:07
Yeah, and NONE of your electronics work without silver and gold.
Your smartphone, your laptop, your flatscreen, all depend on precious metals used in their circuit boards.- end of story.
@_date: 2015-07-14 07:51:55
Trailer looks promising, waiting for a bitcoin paid streaming option.
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:59:46
Brilliant article, thanks a lot for it.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:50:20
I just stated that none of your tech would work without silver &amp; gold; for those who keep on bragging how superior cryptocurrencies are.
I didn't tell you to carry anything around in your pocket, did i?
The crypto world would be a little different without computers i think-
*Every* single electronic device you use requires gold; if we had a better alternative, don't you think we would have been using that already..?
I hold my savings in both gold and bitcoin and totally agree that BTC are much easier to spend, but i wouldn't want my granny (never touched a computer/smartphone) to fiddle with pw-protected paper wallets or start learning how to use a computer from scratch.
Take the gold you bought anonymously with cash, put in in your cellar &amp; forget about it.
Noone will know if you don't tell anyone- seems much more convenient to me.
So there's up- and downsides to every savings medium, i try to combine them and hope for the current financial system to implode soon :-)
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:10:13
dogecoin, really?
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:12:57
The GUI also seems to load  &amp; respond faster. Nice.
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:47:58
When i bought my SSD about a year ago, i read lots about life expectancy/performance issues.
Lots of read/write operations may cause problems after some time it said quite often,well, for noone really has years of experience with SSDs, i'm quite cautious believing in such statements.
Many people tell you to deactivate indexing/timestamp options, stating it may wear off the structure of the filesystem...just wanted to hear sth from someone who actually uses a SSD for storing the blockchain.
Maybe i shouldn't worry so much, two standard drives quit working over the last couple of years also- time will tell, i guess.
 
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:13:25
Thanks a lot, upgrading today.
@_date: 2016-02-11 08:37:48
Unfortunately, our vision of money doesn't include Paypal.
So sad.
@_date: 2015-07-21 07:18:16
lol, shills desperately flooding every board with this crap-
won't help.
people are fleeing from fiat money 
[austria doubled its gold sales this month](
besides, bashing gold here and bitcoins on those gold forums always works; people keep fighting each other instead of those who control it all...
@_date: 2015-07-06 09:02:45
good point.
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:26:20
Thanks for letting us know.
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:54:02
Read your headline and decided to check it out.
Opened the link, scanned the QR code in Mycelium and was watching the unlocked vid 5 seconds later.
0.16€ transferred so easy, great concept
@_date: 2016-09-22 15:20:04
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:35:36
yeah, using a public wireless hotspot for online banking looks like a good idea to me.
@_date: 2015-04-26 08:38:17
yeah, that story reminded me of some folks here telling me "The FBI doesn't clock people with wrenches" when i posted this: [lol](
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:42:12
thanks for the info, let's spend some coinz!
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:46:30
yeah, and don't forget to never use google, youtube or any app on any mobile device...tz
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:37:49
Nice artwork!
@_date: 2015-11-30 10:50:20
Thats when i bought one.
No fucks given, still here.
Using it and hodling since.
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:40:36
lol, quite catchy hook
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:27:27
lol! great
@_date: 2015-10-08 09:51:41
That's because 90% of people browse the web on mobiles now.
To be fair, a page should not be only optimized for mobile devices, but have different versioons for all screens; guess that's just laziness.
I really hate it, also; sigh.
@_date: 2015-10-09 14:33:48
thanks for providing the necessary code lines mate
@_date: 2015-02-14 09:12:07
that's bots trading, rigging the price.
i will never understand why people use this as an indicator for a flourishing market.
transactions were that high when we crashed to 170€ a few days ago also, remember that?
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:17:00
[always the same procedure](
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:55:56
It only took me 7mins. for the whole buying process last time with bitcoin.de, and that was before real-time trading.
20mins. sure is fast, but real time means sth different
@_date: 2016-07-28 09:10:40
Good coverage, serious journalism.
"Crypto valley" sounds cool, let's make that happen!
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:57:34
Got that mail as well, all i need right now is Fidor topping up my account with some Fiat :o)
