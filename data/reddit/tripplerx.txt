Wtf are you talking about? At what point did I question whether this sub is dedicated to Bitcoin or not? This sub is dedicated to Bitcoin project, but you are severely over-estimating its influence on it.

Wtf are you talking about? I didn't say if discussion of bitcoin was banned from the internet. I'm merely talking about this subreddit, r/Bitcoin, which has a very small and insignificant effect on the overall bitcoin discussions online. This subreddit is nothing compared to the overall bitcoin scene in the world.

If tomorrow r/Bitcoin was banned, the price of bitcoin would change by like $0.001
Do you think the whales in Wall Street who pump and dump $20M on bitcoin just for fun, or the Chinese goverment, or global banks, or crypto exchanges who deal with tens of millions of dollars daily, give  *a single fuck* about a subreddit and whether their mods are rude or not?
In this subreddit, we are less than a drop of water in an ocean.

Oh sorry, I didn't realize you were a troll. Sorry for wasting my time.

 want to thank my good friend, Satoshi Bitcoin.

What the fuck have you smoked?
I invoice legitimate US businesses from my own registered EU business and I get paid in crypto. Because it's instant and it has no fees for either party. Neither side is doing for illegal purposes, we even pay taxes on it.


No. That's what VISA and Mastercard are doing already. If people were happy about it, they wouldn't be against it and used crypto.


How the fuck are you accusing everyone using crypto with doing illegal stuff? Everyone I work with is using crypto for legal transactions and it has massively cut our losses in transaction fees and times. Exactly the reason bitcoin was invented.
Do you know people are also using VISA, Mastercard, or bank transfers to buy and sell illegal stuff too? Do you believe every "conventional" transaction is for legal purposes?
have you even, for once in your life, made a purchase or sale using crypto? Are you such an idiot that you can't think of a way to use crypto in a legal setting, while majority of crypto transactions are already for perfectly legal reasons?
Damn, you infuriate me. I want to touch your butt 123.

That's not how "creating an algorithm" works.
They need to have a mathematical breakthrough before they can start guessing private keys. Building a computer, for whatever reason, is not the difficult part. Mathematically cracking the encryption algorithm is the difficult part, and it's not been done even for regular computers yet.
Quantum computers can speed up existing or theoretical algorithms, some more than others. But they can't randomly create algorithms to crack un-crackable problems.
