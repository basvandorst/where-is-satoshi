You are without a card but you are not out of options.  Change banks.  Simple.

Way more.  This is just sales I’d imagine he mined also netting probably double that .

Your option is prob 2nd or 3rd best.  Only other option is charity /airdrop / some type of altruistic motive .  As said there should be only one option n that’s to give the people who owned the btc they’re btc back on a ratio equal to they’re share of total

No.  Governmental control of bitcoin? Lol
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:19:06
Nothing should control bitcoin.  Un is basically controlled by politicians and swayed by a few elite countries .  Bitcoin should not submit to political corruption.

Seems obvious it should be distributed back to the people who got paid 400$ per for the btc they lost.

You’re still looking at this in a selfish way rather than a fair way imo.  Settling for second best case in this scenario would be an even bigger travesty to those people than what they’ve already been thru.   
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:16:15
You sound very naive

Was saying being born in a place with running world puts you in the top 2/3 of the world alone.
