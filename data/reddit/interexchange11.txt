There is absolutely no analogy to be made there. The ADA cases involved circumstances where laws had been passed requiring establishments to permit those with disabilities to enter and use the facility. 
What this attorney is doing is representing clients who have been defrauded by businesses and people. In one case, for example, the Cryptsy exchange, its founder/CEO, and related parties were sued because they allegedly stole more than $8.3 million of BTC from investors and traders just like you and me. They used part of the money to pay cash for a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, FL, and to otherwise lead a lavish lifstyle (not that the use of the money really matters here).
If you were one of the victims would you not contact an attorney to help you? 
How could anyone possibly view this as similar to enforcing a federal statute that's designed to permit disabled people to have access to, use and enjoyment of establishments like those who aren't disabled?

You may be tired of it, but it's not going away. Yes, there will be changes, and I hope they are significant, but don't delude yourself into thinking it's all going away.

FYI, MG is in the process of being acquired by Ant Financial, China's largest fintech company. And it appears that Ant Financial is possibly going to integrate Ripple and XRP for use with cross-border transactions.

I'm saying you should look into it. Read the docs and press releases on the Ripple website to see what they're up to, and read Joel Katz's comments on XRPChat for detailed information on every topic related to Ripple and XRP. He is Ripple's Chief Cryptographer, was involved with Bitcoin early on, and is able to be objective with regard to Ripple and XRP's challenges. That says a lot to me about a person's credibility.

All you do open the app on your phone. It doesn't get any easier than that. And I can assure you utilizing the exchange API's to automatically import your trades and Cointracking's calculation of taxes its infinitely easier that doing that stuff manually.

Great work. There's another product called Cointracking ( that is very sophisticated. Tracks all trades and related tax information. I cannot recommend it enough.

No, not anyone can purchase these options. LedgerX is a regulated entity, and only those who quality as an “eligible contract participant” as defined in section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) can participate. More:

The ban would appear to be only temporary. The Chinese government's rationale, as I understand it, is that the closure mandate was issued because none of the Chinese exchanges have obtained licenses to required to operate as an exchange under Chinese law. Once exchanges apply for and obtain licenses to operate, they will then be able to reopen.

What metrics are you looking at that make you think a drop to $1400 is plausible?

Bad idea. Don't spend them, save them for many, many years. They are a store of value.

If one person, or a small group of people, can have this sort of impact on entire multi-billion marketplace, then Bitcoin is not decentralized. The tech may be, but the market is not.

In a few years he'll wake up and realize that ham sandwich he sold for $4.95 netted him $500. Which is exactly why bitcoin is unlikely to used as digital cash and more likely to be used as digital gold.

I've never had an issue with Coinbase. My suspicion is that many of the folks having an issue with Coinbase are playing in a gray area or simply don't understand compliance requirements.
