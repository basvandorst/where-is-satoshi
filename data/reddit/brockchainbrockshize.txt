ETC was a small price to pay to keep out of jail for underwriting a boiler room. That's why he makes these laughable efforts to post rationalize his behavior. He still doesn't understand that his credibility will never recover, for the rest of his life.

Likely on the advice of his attorneys. He knows the SEC hammer is about to come down.

Your butthurt bagholder argument would still be stupid, even if it was factually accurate, which it obviously isn't. So lol all you want. You are a moron.

Anyone else have a bullshit non-answer that proves Ethereum has no innovations that can be transferred to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:43:44
Yes it does.

One more chance to actually answer his question: What. will. Bitcoin. use. from. Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:00:33
Oh thank you Vitalik for being so a smug. I'm excited to watch Proof of Stake be your undoing.

They agreed sho quickry because teh founders of da DAO were arr promoting a boirer room scam. When da Ethers became arr gone, they knew that the stakehorder would eventuarry seek rawsuits and courd subpeona to revear who was bankrorring massive campaign pumping DAO. Rorring back da brockchain is da onry way to avoid big regar probrems unress they manage to stear back da Ethers first.

It might be because he shit talks Bitcoin whenever it's politically expedient, makes stupid decisions and tries to spin them as features, puts his name on every boiler room scheme and took a big exit of the top of the pump that he announced afterwards. Go read sometime, it's a page out of 1984. Bitcoiners never came close to the levels of doublethink exhibited.

You're in the matrix bub. Casper has no history. It doesn't exist.
Merrily merrily merrily Merrilly, Blue pill all the way.

Reprehensible as always.

So me saying that I'm not part of a cult is *cult like thinking*. I think we've reached the range of your mental abilities.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:02:55
Now that you mention it serious brain power and serious funding hasn't been applied to cold fusion yet either.
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:39:08
More Orwellian thinking on your part. I'm not part of the Bitcoin community. I'm a former Ethertarian.
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:40:58

Armstrong should tell his investors that he's allergic to money. I'm sure they'll understand.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:16:58
No, not at all. should please step down for the good of bitcoin. Just don't give the power to Brian because he's proven over and over that he's not smart. That's all I ask Reddit.
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:47:13
I don't like censorship either, but if bad luck Brian takes over the main information channel then bitcoin is doomed. Reddit please, Brian has the Midas touch if Midas' touch turned things to shit.

Hmmm... it's odd not to tell your wife, that could be a problem.
