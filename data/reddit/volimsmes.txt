I am noob in bitcoins and I would invest but all the hacking makes me not. I also don't trust myself to keep them in my cold wallets. Bitstamp claims the vast majority (how much is that supposed to be) is suppose to be in cold storage. If I keep coins on their site that means the vast majority are 100% covered by them and they are as safe in my cold wallet?

If someone gets in control on ur email he also gets control of dropbox so I don't think that is good storage. It also depends on those 2 services exist forever. There is also problem if you want ur family to get bitcoins after you die.

My problem is not checking value of coins, my problem is being paranoied my security setup is bad and somehow someone my steal it. I have encrypted backup copy of seed at few of my friends but I cannot be 100% somewhere years down their kids my find seed and maybe type it into copmuter or photograph it and then maybe they or hacker could try to brute force passphrase. I am not sure if this is really something that is likely enought to do some kind of other protection or is it just my ocd thoughts and I shouldn't react to them. You see the problem now?

Have you seen any caclulation on how many guesses could normal computer with gpu make and how many to computer cluster hackers/ recovery services use? I've read numbers from few tousand guesses/second to billions (for normal computer) and I am not sure what is right. If that is true hacker computer could hack probably any passphrase or a tleast will be able in future.

Thats my worry with passphrase. It still protects against thieves who won't brute force it and if its good enough passphrase they might not succeed.

Thanks for help. Sorry, didnt want to make you angry, just trouble with communicating in foreign language. 
I'll do similar to what u suggest.
Just curius, do you think simple additional passphrases like 10 random charachters are likely to be brute forced? I think I've read its hard to make more them couple thousand guesses per second with normal computer. Still there is no really downside to make longer passphrase.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:06:46
If someone saw my seed I stored at my friends, how likely he would be able to brute force the additional passphrase that I encrypted the seed with.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:41:12
How about if I used additional passphrase that is offered in trezor/nano s, how strong do you think it should be. Is haystack password checker accurate, should I look more into massive hacking array time or standard attack times?
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:20:20
Its to weak to just store it without passphrase. Problem is passphrae can be brute-forced, I se that as big weakness to bip39. Brute force should be extremly hard but I don't know if there casn be anything made with regards to this. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:19:24
You need to consider passphrase can be brute forced.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:58:32
Ok we are still just guessing here. I wonder why doesn't someone with knowladge just calculate how many guesses can avrage computer make and how many could computer hacker use nowdays make and so we can make passphrases goodenought to protect against this. Answers most like and I guess are not enough but thats all even people who should know this stuff offer. I dont really know why, is it really that hard to calculate?
So by what you are saying 25th word is uselles against bruteforce by recovery services/hacker?
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:08:54
I think many people would use simple dicitonary word as thats even guideline from Trezor/Ledger so it would be worth to check simple dicinary words. Someone has to do math how many guesses could best hacker make now and in few years but noone is really willing to do it I found just rought guesses.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:52:56
I want to understand how good is additional passphrase protection against brute force as I cannot be 100% that my recovery seed won't be stolen or seen at one point in future. Is there any good information online complicated brute-forcing would be?
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:32:14
How many guesses can be made per second if you would try to brute force additional passphrase (25th word)?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:08:54
You could give paper to recovery services or you could just post it in some digital form somewhere where it could get stolen and then brute-forced. It's unlikely but if you have huge percent of your net worth its right to consider every possible point of losing your coins. 
What is ESCDSA?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:58:52
they do
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:10:57
I've got info from other people normal computer with gpu could make approximatly 20k guesses per second. I am puzzled now is it tens of tousands or is it billions.
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:07:24
It can be, it just depends how long would it take.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:39:41
That is to complicated for me. How many guesses pre second of passphrase can be made in u know seed words, I can't find calculated answer only guesses?
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:28:04
How easy is to brute force additonalpassphrase that you can set with ledger/trezor?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:46:34
I do use passphrase. I have trouble with ocd and I always think about every option, it hard to determine what kind of security is rational and what is ocd.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:42:30
I am just curios if it seems possible. Probably reallly hard but it seems like a non zero chance.
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:52:14
You mean that you could see words on paper that would be under paper with recovery seeds when writting words. What about if you had them in wallet and they were next to some other paper you need to give to someone.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:00:18
it good to have backup
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:48:33
I was thinking what if paper with seed would be in conctact after writting.
