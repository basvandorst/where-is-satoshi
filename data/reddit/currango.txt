We are still at a very early stage here. Give it time and there will be:
1. More security
2. More awareness
3. More places to spend BTC
4. A more in depth BTC protocol with many "features" added
All these things take time, but don't worry.... time is passing and all these techs are being worked on as we speak.

Thousands **[of Bitcoins]** that don't need to be exchanged into USD.
Am I doing this right ?

Best reards.

I wouldn't really call anyone actually using BTC right now an "average consumer".
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:24:42
Bitcoin cannot die, it's immortal.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:05:41
Yes. 
What does "average consumer" mean?
To me, it breaks down like this: 
Old people(over 60)- probably not adopting BTC yet...at least not on any scale larger than what the grandson has introduced them to.
Middle age(30-60)- Starting to get into BTC but most are scared because of all the bad news ...
Younglings(15-30)- These are the people who have the least money to spend and are the most engaged. 
This is just my opinion and age groups and everything is really made up, but this is how I see our bitcoin community right now.
People who are actually USING BTC right now are tech savy, and have a better idea of how/when/where to use their coins.


I took this as sarcastic.
All I'm trying to say is, people who are using BTC right now actively, are likely able to navigate and produce their own private keys with instruction as provided by .

Just remember, it's not "virtual" currency. It's real.
It's a crypto-currency.

I believe they also accept Australian dollars.

Maybe they stole from cold storage?

Please show us this magical place where you can have a "less than zero" balance in your bitcoin wallet.

If you're looking to buy BTC easily try this.
You can use your bank card.

I love reading the news that reddit comes up with but when I have to skip past a bunch of douches arguing about whether a comma or a period should be used to separate 100's from 1000's ... it's annoying. Who the fuck cares about that shit when we're talking about bitcoins ?

Ah I see you are mistaking a "negative balance" with fees that are paid after the fact. The fact that you can pay the mining fees after you've transfered the bitcoins, with the bitcoins from the transaction (because you have none left in the sending wallet) doesn't mean you have a negative balance. It just means that the transaction was paid for by the receiving wallet.
It's not like you can send 10BTC from a wallet that has 0BTC and "just have a negative balance of 10BTC" ... it doesn't work like that.

You should talk to the ~~guy~~ [u/newretro]( who's about to cash out his 21,000+ bitcoins for $12 million.

It needs to be re-fuckulated.
