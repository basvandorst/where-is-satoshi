Ahh I see and that makes sense to be able to verify how many coins in existence for sure, is there anything like mimblewimble that is being planned in the respect of making say tax authorities and government regulators life’s harder in the sense of giving BTC the kind of privacy mimblewimble could but without the problems it clearly creates?.

@_date: 2019-11-19 06:58:29
Ahh I see that’s interesting so Bitcoin doesn’t really need to be that private on chain as LN gives BTC privacy as it’s second layer.
The only issue I see there is LN is only for smaller transactions is there anyways coming for on chain larger transactions?, or will those privacy issues on chain be remedied at some point.

These people know the clocks ticking there are no more weapons they can use to stave of disaster so they’ve entered self protection mode.
We should stop caring about banks central banks and banksters, Bitcoin doesn’t need a crash or a depression it never did what it needs is solid belief in its system and a solid following and that way it’s price will gradually rise in a safe manner not only in a safe manner but with solid value and that’s what these people truly fear.

No that 70% is divided between different mining pools these stupid 51% attack arguments were dead along time ago.
Ummmm as for Silk Road the FBI would have had to have access to the private key for the wallet or wallets the Bitcoins were kept in, you simply cannot get a wallets Bitcoins without the private key that’s not a seizure.
Blacklisting wallets makes no difference it’s permission-less go blacklist my wallet I will just transfer my funds at will where ever I choose.

@_date: 2019-11-21 18:37:59
I’m yet to be convinced that the Bitcoin network can’t be attacked!.
I get what the guys saying but the network is financially driven if the BTC price makes mining profitable the network is secure but when the price drops and mining is less profitable miners switch off their machines.
What happens when or if the price goes to say $1000 dollars? I know the difficulty adjusts but the networks hash power would be way lower in fact it may be so much lower that an attack is far easier to achieve.
Ultimately how low can the price go and still have a network that’s ultimately secure.
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:51:17
No exchange would delist BTC but I’d bet you the exchange can be ordered to shut down because now the regulators see BTC as none compliant with their regulation, LOL isn’t often smart.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:46:29
I think crypto coins can certainly be made ultimately private but the problem of regulation it thus, if they can’t regulate it they’ll do everything they can to see it value crumple over time.
I don’t think BTC is in that stable but Monero and others are.
@_date: 2019-11-17 11:16:20
Thank that’s made things a little more understandable it seems very cleaver in what it can do.
@_date: 2019-11-30 13:50:27
So by devices they mean mobile phone wallets or hardware wallets?, why would that matter anyway I mean taking a wallet is one thing getting the coins stored on it is another surely it’s irrelevant unless the criminal or person is willing to give up the pass codes or private key?.
And when they say 10 transactions prior are we talking about so called tainted coins?.
I can’t see how they can make this work.
@_date: 2019-11-03 01:49:36
Sounds like i will just make multiple transactions then for the limit amount they propose.
I mean that’s what they’re saying right I can only spent $2000 dollars, if an items $10,000 dollars can’t I just use a$2000 dollar payment 5 times?
I don’t get how you can ban or enforce this limit?.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:37:20
And what can the authorities do exactly?.
That’s right nothing because it’s permission less.
Because you’re backward read and learn.
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:21:45
Seems Bitcoin needs to be completely private as they’ll keep bringing in these laws because they know people can be traced and until all transactions are untraceable they can effect it.
They wouldn’t bother if they couldn’t enforce their stupid and often backward laws IMO.
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:38:42
Urrr if you’ve been into Monero before they fixed its privacy issues you are on record for all time and still can be traced years later, it is only the people since those updates that have the full anonymity you’ll be one that’s hasn’t that’s just the way things work being over confident about security.
@_date: 2019-11-28 05:29:55
Well What ever you call it true privacy may come at a cost like Monero is finding out.
Plus the BTC price has risen faster or been more stable with mainstream players, but the true facts are normal people only buy in when the price rises to a degree they have FOMO otherwise they don’t care and anything that stops prices rising isn’t good for adoption.
Another double edged sword.
@_date: 2019-11-17 11:18:38
Thanks for the info I will read all the link has to offer at least this subject is becoming clearer now.
@_date: 2019-11-27 23:18:13
Well that’s the irony of the double edged sword IMO it won’t work or should i say be sold to a public at large in large enough volumes to work without centralisation.
@_date: 2019-11-30 13:55:26
They’re talking about payment made with BTC not the mining of the coins, they like the Chinese are hard like protectionists when it comes to state issued currency, personally I think they’re outdated in their views.
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:37:43
Oh I see basically it’s the amount left to spend in your wallet the unspent amount or the balance is that correct.

I looked at Grin it seemed more complicated in the respect of the no addresses but clearly is private.

The US already does manipulate Gold prices because most gold bought isn’t physical it is a paper IOU meaning that the supply is always greater than demand which equates to the Gold price being kept in a certain price band.
And here is why they do this let’s say there was no paper gold contracts and all gold had to be audited you’d soon find out the system was false and you’re being cheated, you’d clearly see they’re manipulating supply by depressing it because if they didn’t the gold price would go up and up and more and more people would buy in through FOMO as prices increase higher and higher and gold prices would also moon.
That’s what Bitcoin Fiat futures contracts did for the Bitcoin price when settled in fiat and not Bitcoins its a cleaver way of keeping demand under control and manipulating price lower.
So both Gold and the Bitcoin prices are routinely manipulated down otherwise price increases and FOMO will see  astronomical increases which drain fiat out of the traditional banking systems weakening those systems further as their liquidity drains away and giving them less money to lend to the public.
BTC can moon tomorrow but it won’t because of this central manipulation the same as gold, even your peter Schiffs of this world know Golds manipulated as much as BTC but ass holes never admit the real truths.

@_date: 2019-11-19 06:06:14
From what you’ve said seems like having less privacy in some ways and a les complicated system may well be better in the long term.
@_date: 2019-11-12 06:00:03
Yeah I understand that but that is maybe a little bit of a hassle to most people, but if you’re not running a full node and you purchase BTC and convert to Monero for use on the dark web what’s the odds of you being traced or for that matter if a weed purchase is all that’s being bought what’s the odds of the authorities having the inclination to go to those lengths and hassles.
Wouldn’t Monero without a full node be suitable in those circumstances?.
Also if full nodes are the only option for ultimately the best security when, if, or how with they be incorporated into traditional wallets without the hassles and set ups?.
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:17:30
That’s interesting thanks, what’s your opinion on Monero for buying things of the dark web compared to coin joining?, would you say it’s secure enough to hide your identity of is it over hyped in the department as I’m presuming it must be an easier way of making payment if you aren’t running a full node and want a less hassle experience?.

You’d not be that smart would you if you and your mates hatched some plan to defraud your company of a mass of Bitcoins?, seriously who do you think they look at first when fraud is committed I would think it’s the staff from that company.
If you get caught you’ll end up in prison, you are basically saying BTC can’t work because it can be stolen or hacked, but I know if I had you in front of me as say a suspect in a major BTC theft and I said cough up the private key or password to the wallet where the stolen BTC are or I throw the key away you’ll cough up the key and or the password.
How do you think the FBI get all the BTC from dark market perpetrators? Yeah that’s right they make them comply with more lenient sentences.
Hardly a theory why BTC can’t work as a currency of tradable asset.
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:15:41
Anyone who thinks people won’t buy BTC eventually is a fool even the no coiners will buy when the real price rises come and that’s moon territory when BTC won’t ever look back and miners will always be profitable.

I personally think all these models are over thought out and there is no need.

After reading this and always being a believer that futures certainly killed Bitcoins FOMO trajectory and still has a firm grip on subduing prices I then wondered if a large BTC wallet holder could manipulate the BTC price so as to ruin the futures market?.
If that was possible surely futures would become less attractive and BTC could get back to a market of increasing price and participation through new buyers.
@_date: 2019-11-04 17:18:29

Chinese officials will and are gradually shooting themselves in the foot because even traceable crypto payments like Bitcoin can’t and have not been banned as they’re not ban-able in their entirety from any country.
But one issue these control freaks don’t get is that Bitcoin will adapt to their regulation it will become more private as developers work to make it harder to disrupt.
Or maybe an alternative privacy coin could come along that no one can track trace or tax then what are they going to do.
When their central bank issued coins are hacked and stolen on a regular basis then China will see the real reason they can’t beat Bitcoin so let’s just wait and be patient, as they say all comes to he who waits.
I personally would consider a central bank issued digital currency would be an easier target to steal than bitcoins and if their project fails because of lack of trust and security the BTC price will moon.
@_date: 2019-11-06 00:27:13
Thanks I will have a read of that.
@_date: 2019-11-10 07:52:16
Yeah I suppose Monero would be better for those purposes, but I don’t know about US laws but what I do know is this any police enforcement agency plays the game on a risk to reward basis they’re after the king pin behind the dark market site and then the dealers who deal on there,  the public buyers IMO aren’t the main targets.
Tracing BTC is possible yes no doubts but once these coins have had  more of a link to identity washed away from them by coin joining all of a sudden you’ll find these agencies are way less likely to pursue these avenues as it simply takes up to much resources and ultimately may lead to a dead end.
I live in the UK and no way could the authorities charge me with buying weed of a dark market unless they were sure 100% it or the payment came from me, any error in this charging chain through lack of identity knowledge means they couldn’t convict you in court (PROOF must be solid) coin joining takes that away IMO 100% or close to it depending on how many times you coin join.
Also buying weed of dark markets is often better for society than buying from street dealers firstly you have better choice of the different strains and the simplicity of having it delivered to your door is to me ultimately private.
You don’t have to meet any criminal elements to get your personal use stash and in my opinion it’s better in general for society.
I don’t know what the sentence is for buying say weed on a dark market compared to buying and using it of a street dealer but at the end of the day very few people who use for personal use get convicted now as it’s not seen as the crime it was.
You wanna smoke go for it fuck what some ass hat you’ve never met dictates.
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:58:14

I wondered when the likes of the privacy coins would be de listed because of KYC ect and i can’t personally say what it means for the success of those coins.
I know BTC has privacy implementations in the pipeline but I can’t comment on what it may mean for BTC also.
All I can say is that  does the likes of BAKKT have to then delist BTC because regulators now think it’s against their rules if privacy is added, who knows.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:58:45
Actually it’s 70% of BTC mining is concentrated in China but you’re confused into believing China controls BTC as neither do the Chinese government neither the individual mining pools.
And you can see wallets and their  contents on the Blockchain but you cannot confiscate them nor can the government if you’d like to show proof of a wallets contents that has been seized that would be a start, if not your analogy of seizures end here.
As for inflating the supply there has been no inflation as the block reward is released every 10 mins to the mining pool who succeeds in claiming that reward, hows about you show proof of this inflation?.
Oh and Bitcoins already proved to be a solution to a problem, come and seize my bitcoins!, but I assure you your bank account contents can be confiscated as banks can use your funds to support their business without your agreement.
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:09:17
This is true I think the Chinese people in general wouldn’t choose to live under such tyrannical rule if they had a choice so I’d have thought BTC has big uses for the Chinese over their captors so to speak.

@_date: 2019-11-24 08:53:29
Bitcoins price is about buyers and sellers.
Supply versus demand.
Hodling cuts supply that’s available if demand is greater than supply the price will rise.
Be under no illusion if the price drops dramatically you are seeing more BTC flooding into the market as someone’s selling this can be temporary pull back until those BTC are consumed by buyers, or if buyers aren’t there it can cause prices to stagnate for a while.
Let’s say the price does indeed go to a level that a lot of holders are comfy selling at (higher price) and there are buyers at those prices the price won’t drop, and the price wouldn’t of gone that high in the first place without those buyers buying all the way up.
There will of course be pullbacks all the way up because the market has to take up the slack BTC that’s sold.
IMO only a fool would say BTC cannot reach $100k or more because look how much it’s already worth today which is pretty insane if you give it some though.
Plus when you look at fundamentals it only gets better long term.
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:01:32
You think central bank digital currencies cure what problem exactly?.
You can digitally use a debit card without the need for any kind of token as it’s simply an accounting procedure that debits your account there is no money involved.
Or do you mean to use a central bank digital currency for inter banking transactions to replace swift?, if you do it’s already available it’s called RIPPLE.
I can’t think of any reason a central bank digital currency (so called) has any future if it can be inflated and there’s also the point about security, it would be a far easier target for hacks IMO.
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:11:47
No one said there aren’t online scams what I said if you read it again is that it’s the victim who originally tries to enrich themselves through greed which becomes their downfall, in regards to crypto currency scams there are rules.
Own your own coins and own your owns keys in an offline environment, I could teach a kid these rules it that simple.
What you don’t do is let someone sucker you into investing money with the promise of monthly investment returns where you neither own your own coins or keys because that’s a Ponzi scheme but People’s greed suckers them in.
It doesn’t matter how many online scams exist if you follow basic rules and as I said greed is always what parts a sucker from their money and that’s how scammers get their victims.
So no I don’t need to wake up.
@_date: 2019-11-24 10:13:29
They can’t Ban Bitcoin but they can make it so you can only interact in person, meaning you can only sell for cash and only buy for cash.
They could shut down all mining facilities also but they’re relocate elsewhere, personally they should anyway and do away with this uncertainty.
Communism is self protectionism you do what they say when they say if you don’t you’re thrown in prison, tortured, or killed, most human right abuses and loses of freedom occur under these sick regimes.
BAN and BANNING are their most used tools in their corrupt systems.

That is true but if they class it as a form of payment they will not back in anyway that’s not good for BTC and it’s not good for them if BTC is used elsewhere around the world.
I would consider their remarks typical of a communist regime.
@_date: 2019-11-28 06:00:51
If Bisq is so successful how come we’re still hearing the Chinese authorities harping on about banning things, I mean what’s it matter if they close this exchange or that exchange if decentralised platforms like Bisq take up that slack and clearly a mobile app is the easiest to use.
My guess is because we a still hearing these banning calls these decentralised exchange apps can’t be being used to mass effect.
When I see the Chinese authorities with their hands up surrendering to the fact BTC is unstoppable in the trading sense I will believe the likes of Bisq truly work until then it seems very niche IMO.

Banks don’t mind lending to joe because if joe doesn’t make his payments like in 2008/2009 they’ll sell the debts to large companies like Black rock investments that will repossesses joes home that way joe loses the banks gain and big investment firms also gain.
Joe is indebted through one fault of his own that is joes clueless how financial products and marketing work, 
Financial products are targeted at the joes of the world yet most joes are clueless as to how they work that’s not joes fault it’s a fault of the system IMO.

I’m not getting the reasoning behind this move.
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:48:44
A digital currency or token created by a government who’s central banks can’t handle money properly would be no different to the fiat money supply they have no choice in inflating there is nothing worth while about inflation.
Secondly unless those  government crypto coin have ultimate security protecting it from hacks it may be a far better target for criminals than decentralised tokens like Bitcoins  which in all essence wouldn’t be such a crowd pleaser with the masses.
Best thing is let them create what ever they chose because it will do BTC more favours in the long term than not simply because they can’t cure any real problems as they’re centrally controlled and manipulated at will.
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:10:01

Though call that one but don’t let debt drag you down as realistically it’s only paper and IOUs, health and family are more important.
My advise file for Bankruptcy and start a fresh if possible if your debts are dragging you down.
Or set up a regular payment and reduce it over a longer period, communicating with the people you are in debt with will make your debts easier to handle I’m sure you tried these solutions.
Bitcoins not easy money it’s just another gamble that may or may not pay off, but one thing if you want BTC own it and your keys and buy it off a reputable site with regulation that will protect you in many ways.
Good luck.

Get your point but liquidity will only come from institutions that’s why grey scale and the like are plugging Bitcoin to their clients, people wonder often why liquidity is important and simply put it legitimises the asset, sadly IMO those buyers are put off by many factors that work against bitcoin.
Your point about decentralisation is correct I don’t believe satoshi Nakamoto would condone the state of bitcoin as the markets reliant on centralised players and wallet holders arguably mining is also close to centralisation.
But could or can bitcoin work without centralised entities I believe not as there weren’t enough takers (that’s probably because it’s to complicated overall and  people are reluctant to support decentralisation) we will see in time whether It can survive long term the jury for not IMO is out.

Haha who said there wasn’t  buyers still short sellers make the price ups and downs more undesirable. It’s a game to get other investors to sell their stock so prices go down further and the short sellers win.

In Bitcoin the ghosts manipulate prices lower when no ones interested or buying for the simple reason of getting or tempting new buyers into the market, a never ending cycle of manipulation up and manipulation down.

Short sellers,

I have spoke with others from the US it is a very unfair system but I’m from the UK and we’ve got free medical care which is one good thing about here but the UK is debt ridden I assure you.
We are living in a world of consumption and wanting what others have because we may feel it makes are lives more for filling but spending is often a short term fix for other things we have missing in our lives.
That’s why Bitcoin is a draw because you often are rewarded long term for saving and not spending which is a good thing.

BTC futures do suppress the price but it’s easier for these contracts to do that at the moment because there isn’t demand outstripping BTCs 21 million supply to the point that the BTC price is naturally climbing higher through supply and demand.
If or when we end up in a situation again of more of a mass adoption the price will be dictated by rarity of the supply not cash settled futures contracts.
If someone wants a Bitcoin in a wallet that strips supply, if someone wants a piece of paper saying they own one that doesn’t and I can’t see people not wanting the physical kind over paper long term.

If you link a website to an address I would have thought it would be easier to find and target, just look at Grin when they said it’s transactions can’t be traced yet traced they were.

Any countries and that’s most of them that have a shadow economy has one because of failings in the current systems used IE the system is usually unfair and one sided on the side of the wealthier.
I personally am surprised that there are many people in these countries that are still keeping cash in the banking system make no bones about it these governments and banks are corrupt to the core and only the people will lose money long term.
It is about time people woke up and used Bitcoin for the purpose it was created, don’t blame anyone but yourselves when the day of reckoning comes and it is coming.
Europe is a wasteland of debt even large economies like Germany are flatlining because no one has faith in the system, so lower ranking economies like ITALY, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, and many more have never gotten over 2008/2009 it is just smoke and mirrors and the public keep falling for their bullshit.

They’ll keep Banning for sure right through 2020 and beyond but it will only impact centralised services.
In other words the decentralised side and anyone who holds BTC and their own keys can sit back as Banning won’t effect that side.

Once they realise they can’t Ban it they’ll kneel before it.

Warren Buffet once said the biggest factor in him making his fortune was simply when he was born and where he was born, that’s it.

I see so what you’re saying is it’s the merchants fault for using a system that is allowing for zero confirmations to be taken advantage of.
So really the merchant shouldn’t be accepting these kinds of wallet transactions unless they’re going to wait for the 6 confirmations needed to make sure they really receive the money.
And that the easier way would be for merchants to just use LN and nothing else unless they are going to wait for the confirmations.
And basically this guy is plugging Bcash because it has faster confirmation times, am I about there now?.

When you have so many exchanges that are within government regulatory grasp they’ll force whatever laws they like on them.
Personally I don’t think governments want to destroy Bitcoin what they want is it in a box through tax and regulation.
If they wanted to destroy it they could probably hit the acceptance side through retail and the likes as option one.
Option 2 if that didn’t work take away on and off ramps globally that’s the killer as no one can buy in or cash out.

Taxes on crypto are to game the power back to the government and make it less likely for the public to want to participate leaving them stuck in the broken system we have now.
Forked coins aren’t the real issue imo taxes on spending is the real issue as it makes BTC less attractive as a means of payment.
What I don’t believe is the tax authorities are good enough or big enough to enforce all the rules they’ve brought in they are relying on the public reporting all these tax liabilities and I think if BTC becomes big over time I think they’ll drop taxes on purchases because the work involved tracing and tracking payment would be colossal.
I would also imagine there are loads of people that do not and will not declare or pay taxes and I think crypto is going to be a minefield for authorities as regards taxes and collecting them.
Don’t point a big finger at yourself by admitting you use it or own it make them work.

Most of the tech stuff is over my head but I was led to believe by another Redditor that the use of satellites like this will help if not stop countries like China from the BANNING mentality they have because the satellites aren’t controllable by them.
Is this correct or in someways correct?.

And as I said there is a list a mile long of banks that make this institution look like a fair ground stall, in fact if it went Bankrupt tomorrow it would be swollen up by the banks that are truly Goliath’s.
Who cares what they say they’re irrelevant in the grand scheme of banks.

I think you’ll find some of them that have been deleted mention or promote shit coin offerings I think it’s something today with a regulatory clause of some financial conduct crap written into American Law.

I don’t mean it that way but I believe it’s up to the public in the USA to make sure ass holes like this don’t have jobs of power, harder said than done I know but that is the reality.

You used to be able to clear your wallet funds in one go on coinbase not those cunts set a daily withdraw which leave a small amount in the wallet making you have more than one attempt to clear the balance to Zero.
Bet the fuckers have done this so there’s always a small amount of BTC in most wallets.

Finally we are getting rid of some crypto shit coins but then a twat like this produces another SCAM coin.

So can I buy say half a Bitcoin without needing to give my details.
As I was considering using it for buying of BTC if it’s anonymous?.

HSBC has 3900 worldwide as I said a shitty little bank.

So we are moving towards being unstoppable IYO, as it’s news like this that reignites my personal faith in the system.
I want Banning banished from BTC ��.

Supply and demand, if the demand is there then yes if the demand isn’t outstripping known supply probably not.
Plan Bs stock to flow sounds good but it doesn’t factor in demand and without constant demand BTC will not moon.
Also as in 2017/2018 BTCs price is monitored by governments and if like in 2017/2018 it starts to overheat they’ll do what ever is needed to bring it back down or depress it the futures contracts they green lighted back then burst the bubble.
BTC will have a long haul ride getting to 100k but IMO I think over the next 5 years it will be around that 100k figure.

Banks and central banks should have to prove capital reserves in gold like they did before.
Bail outs like this and previous ones could go on forever with printed money in one form or another.
It’s wrong in every sense of the word to not let failed businesses go Bankrupt and these are failed businesses.

So you are  basically saying if you’re an American no matter what you owe them in  tax you’d have to pay? If so you’d be better leaving on mass.
How if I have dual nationality say I have the tax free aspect in on country so can the other country demand I pay tax I think not.

Yes I’ve seen the snow but I’ve sorted the issue now, I uninstalled the apps and re installed them seems to have cured the problems.
But I know my USB is good and my devices, there was an update I installed also just as I turned on my computer maybe bug fixes in that worked.
