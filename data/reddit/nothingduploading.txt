i personally don't use web wallets.
jaxx is good unless you have a large amount. if you want something a little safer use electrum.org
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:50:01
its not infinitely divisible.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:43:59
how would that work?
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:58:22
Bitcoin going down the tubes in 2018. More and more people are realizing its a useless currency.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:20:43
LN is garbage. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:21:36
fuck this core shill.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:33:39
^ exactly. you know its true and you simply ban people for speaking the truth.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:37:52
fuck that. I paid a $375 fee the other day.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:13:49
Naah. maybe 100k in 3 years. 500k in 5-10.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:28:37
i've used coinbase since the beginning. lately the past 6 months or so I've had more problems with them. I was trading on GDAX for a bit and about once a month they would freeze my account for no reason.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:08:18
oh. so now we'll have spammers promtoing their channels. :P
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:29:10
exactly. which is why its definitely a bubble at this point. it has no purpose. its basically the pet rock now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:55:52
you don't control your coins if you don't control the keys.
if you don't want to hassle with a hardware wallet at least download jaxx.io or electrum.org wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:44:08
They also list Bitcoin price too. Must be shilling for core as well.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:38:46
it is a big deal and will continue to be.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:42:51
naaah man river phoenix's brother looks more like him.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:38:29
Everyone bites your head off when you bring up the fees. I even see these new comers talk about how their fee was "only $10". ROFL.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:37:44
haha. true.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:55:20
i think its just too many people. the system only supports 4 transactions per second.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:28:48
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:40:08
i agree. it'll hover here for awhile. fees have ruined bitcoin.

Only old people use ML.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:35:25
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:02:44
have to wait buddy -- what wallet did you use that let you send a .17 cent fee in today's fee market?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:00:42
you had an $18 fee.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:14:35
none of that garbage will materialize.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:10:01
Can we get a way to get these forked coins out?
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:07:46
i think you're fine. does your balance show you spent it? With jaxx you can reset the cache and these issues usually clear up.
I would file a support ticket and ask them if there's anyway to reset your balance.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:53:06
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:49:13
the ideology is why i got into this. the world has never seen a free market until now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:11:57
you just send it back to coinbase if you want to cash out.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:30:08
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:05:02
hmmmmm.....is the transaction on any other block explorers?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:56:37
what news?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:07:53
don't worry. Lighting Network will make the fees be only $1.25B
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:03:26
I paid a $375 fee the other day on a two year old wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:19:17
What bill?
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:16:19
There is no regulation in a free market.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:43:31
coinbase asks for employer verification now? jesus christ.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:53:32


Looks interesting but they don't have a product yet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:34:34
if bitcoin paid a dividend that would be better.

@_date: 2018-01-11 04:54:21
oh that? That $2 Billion was the fee I paid today to transfer $50 to a buddy. Sorry about that guys. When will high fee problem be fixed? Is anyone working on it?
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:04:29
3 months? I bought when it was &lt; $4.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:25:45
no thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:00:33
What did they think after you explained how it costs $54 to send $10 to someone?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:41:44
This is how the machines will enslave us.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:10:34
nope. visa does 10k/second
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:26:15
how do you know its unspendable?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:08:31
korean exchanges getting raided. i'd say that's pretty big news.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:22:27
Probably not.

that was a dumb move. hordl.

uh oh. somoene is at my door...

a lot of people are going to get fucked when it drops 60% and takes 3 years to recover.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:01:35
sure and a fork could also increase the number of coins. i dont' spend time worrying about it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:24:25
jaxx wallet calculated that fee based on current fee rates. I think it was 1200s/b and i had a lot of transactions in the wallet since I run a business with it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:33:59
What is CBOE?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:11:36

Lots of reasons to stay anonymous now a days.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:24:46


I just tried to send someone $10 and the fee was $54. ROFL.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:45:54
nope, not without a blockchain the size of montana.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:53:03
how so?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:58:34
Craigslist already added it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:58:55
I think we're around 16M coins. But the true number is less than that due to burned or lost coins. The mining difficult adjusts to how ever many miners there are currently on the network.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:16:27
I see.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:26:15
What will you eat if true?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:55:01
does she know what wallet she used? If it was a couple of years ago it might have a seed phrase. She would need that unless she has the private keys backed up somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:52
it is when you paid $4 each. Who's the wuss now?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:18:12
I see.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:06
well i sent $2400 of BTC and got $800 worth of ZEC. Thank you shitty currencies!
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:47:32
well their ux is a hell of a lot better.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:35:44
what is a 2fa fee??
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:06:15
Costs $54 to send $10. ROFL. I'm shocked at how many people don't understand how that's a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:32:56
making stock or crypto trades.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:42:01

What's "the Gig economy"? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:17:20
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:35:28
nope. sent $2k btc to my exchange wallet. Fee was $375.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:15
not unless you want to lose them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:25
i know. i've been a hodlr since 2011.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:00:49
CNBC is the same way now too. Every week day I watch it and they mention it at least once an hour in a 2-3 minutes piece.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:59:11
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:59:13
can is yes. to me. says the coins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:48
The sentiment would be that its not safe investment and there would be a sell off.

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:01:56
lol. 99% of "good" domains go for no more than $2,500 these days. Unless you have a generic keyword there's no way that domain is worth even $500.

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:47
coinbase has goxed this weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:03:13
afaik its like gambling on sports. you bet what the price will be sometime in the future. if you're right you win if youre wrong you lose money.

@_date: 2017-12-28 05:39:38
what were you trading?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:59:55
Just sent $10 with LTC and it cost me 31 cents. That is still high in my opinion but its better than $54. lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:38:35
its awesome if you want to start day trading (or night trading) while working full time.

@_date: 2017-12-30 19:08:55
yeah. i have a significant amount of btc and am saddened that all it is now is a speculative investment with people shilling this Lightning Network garbage as if it'll save everything. It won't even be bitcoin after that horseshit goes into effect.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:34
lol. half? then no way.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:34:38


I bet 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:57:09
why you want to do that?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:26:27
I was wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:00:24
They are saying that because Bitcoin was a way to buy drugs on The Silk Road.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:56
Yes, that's nothing. I paid $375 fee two days ago to send money to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:27:52
Hey, thanks! Good luck to you too!

@_date: 2017-12-02 20:06:21
do not take a picture. that's your social security number brother.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:11:48
jaxx is a piece of shit wallet i guess.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:17
they all need that. use wex.nz if you want to trade anonymously.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:09:06
jaxx using minimal fee selection.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:03:08
The fact that it costs $54 to send $10 to someone.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:28:59
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:13:57
I'm confused because I sent $2100 and the amount that showed up is $ 2,040.74....so that makes me think the fee was $60 or so.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:25
I remember when it went from $4 to $9. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:42:32
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:35:37
if you don't spend it then all you have are tulips.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:03:36
i moved everything out of coinbase and gdax a week ago when I first started noticing problems. Exact same shit happened to gox. I got out in time but many did not.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:59:56
sounds like mtgox all over again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:30:05
this lightning network doesn't get you away from paying btc fees. You have to eventually pay it if you want control.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:58:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:49
I didn't send it. I canceled the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:32
on wex it went from 16500 to 13000.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:40:15
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:32:01
just a bad news day. it'll be back tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:20:07
Bitcoin surpassed humans years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:05:58
download electrum.org wallet and enter the seed phrase into the setup wizard when you install it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:32:04

@_date: 2017-12-28 08:00:04
Lightning Network is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:03:02
nope. i think the "life changing" amount of money opportunity is gone, unless you own multiple coins and it eventually gets to $1M per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:30:52
I paid $375 in fees and it took about 2 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:18:31
I'm guessing new they are more than that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:42:42
50,002.01 USD
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:11:37
i set jaxx to use a minimal fee.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:57:41
relax. you're trying to use their service at the worst possible time. its like trying to shop on black friday. forget about it.
You've filed the tickets. Call them next week.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:46
How much is a lambo?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:06:37
Haha. All these newbs who don't even know why bitcoin was created in the first place. They are fine "hodling" their shit because they never have any intention of spending it. Tulips baby, all tulips.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:07:56
source? I have a hard time beliving bitcoin has captured 3% of the gold market.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:16:16
what's the worst that could happen?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:18:38
fake news
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:04:21
Bitcoin goes against the entire system.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:53:40
agree ocean big money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:49
$54 in my case.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:05:33
almost everyone does.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:04:33
its at 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:21:06
Fortune tellers?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:51:15
nothing happened because their site crashed. nobody can trade it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:23:26
meh. worst thing that will happen is they start suing people, much like file sharing trolls did.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:02
don't re-use your password there. they get hacked once a year or so.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:30:54
Huffpost just a bunch of sjw's who don't know shit from shinola.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:49
how is it over at voat.org? i too am dissatisifed with the toxicyt level of reddit in general.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:47:33
not when it costs $18 to send $10. i think we're officially in tulip mania. i never thought i'd say this. thanks blockstream and all you other corporate fuckers who have ruined bitcoin and open source as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:48
there's been a $3500 swing the past two days.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:52:25
I'm not surprised they are ignoring you. You should like a real pain in the ass. They get 100k new accounts a day this week. I think they have like 40 employees.

I didn't put my life savings into this shit 4 years ago. It just so happens that now it is my life savings.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:18
he's an idiot for not keeping a copy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:53:33
Nope. nobody gives a shit about bitcoin. All I hear from people are "Hey man, you're into sidywatikas, right? I want to buy some." Nobody even knows wtf a sidywatika is. They just know it's gone up 1000% percent this year.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:05:00
no. miners still get the fees for the blocks
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:15:12
same rules apply: HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:35:27
Good thing you backed up your seedphrase so you can just restore the wallet. You did write down your seedphrase, right?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:36:49
time to pull out
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:34:37
PST? Do you have a link to the trading site?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:46:25
do people still torrent?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:26:32
I wish. I turned $200 into $1000 day trading.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:48:46
$60 fee with segwit? Fuck that shit. That's no better.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:46:26
I day trade now, wex never hit coinbase price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:54:42
use a different currency. this one is broken.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:34:17
I bought at $4. Should I sell?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:52:03
uh oh.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:17:25
Depends on the amount. If you're just buying a cup of coffee you don't need to wait for a confirmation. If you're buying a house I would wait for 6.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:57:13
if she still has the old computer just search the entire disk for a wallet.dat file. Then ask someone else how you would restore the private keys from it once you know the wallet name.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:45:10
shitstream has pivoted the community from a currency to a store of value.

someone places a sell for a shit ton of coins above market price. The price won't move above that point until everyone eats away at the wall. Then the price usually skyrockets.

i'm too lazy to find it. it was on cnbc either today or yesterday. I believe it was today. They showed live how to buy and sell bitcoin from coinbase and the sell failed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:35:16
that's what they said about mtgox too.

this is crypto. you can always get fucked somehow. I'm terrified now I don't trust much of anything anymore. There are too many complicated ways to lose your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:36:03
not going to use a real shit coin. what about LTC or ETH?

@_date: 2017-11-24 00:23:14
i thought you bought 1btc.
you would take `selling price * selling amount - buying price * buying amount = profit or loss`
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:22:34
basic functionality is not working properly. that's exactly what happened to gox a week or two before it went down for good.
watch cnbc video from today where coinbase failed miserably on live tv. this is only the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:38:45
right. so its fucking useless now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:45:28
If you can't spend it all you have are tulips.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:31:55

sell value - buy value = profit or loss

Didn't work for me either. I uploaded a photograph of my DL.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:26:00
yes. i couldn't withdraw either. i had to withdraw to coinbase then withdraw to btc address from there.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:48:04
naah man. i bought at 7500.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:54:42
it would increase disk usage. and some fear that only cloud operations would be able to store the blockchain in the future, making it more centralized than decentralized.

As long as you have your seedphrase backedup you're fine. The phone could get stolen and you could still recover.
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:16:09
Andreas Antanopolous has a good talk about this. From several years ago. The idea is they would make more off the transactions fees by that time then any sort of reward.

You can use it for a lot of things. But its not going to be 100% accepted everywhere for a very long time.

Everyone here was talking about it as an investment. I've been on reddit 8 years by the way.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:30:28
which wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:02:47
well ya gotta backup the seed regardless. how would you store it w/o doing that?
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:55:50
There should be significantly more transactions by that time so miners will survive off the transaction fees alone.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:32:52
oh well. i ain't touching my bitcoin then.

@_date: 2017-10-31 02:58:54
actually, i'm not sure that wallet you're using has anythijng to do with blockchain.info. The logo looks similar. Do you have a seed phrase? If so try to open your wallet in electrum.
