sorry idk, in the software i use, you can only choose 5 different priority settings, and I used the cheapest
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:35:17

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:27:34
I havent read the whole text, but why do you have the idea that they robbed him?

@_date: 2017-12-27 01:24:14
cause its an exchange? you can also exchange euros to dollars or pounds to dollars, because thats what an exchange is meant for lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:03:24
the fees are only that high when someone pays them, and no one will pay 1000 dollars, so they never hit 1000 dollars

dude if you don't understand Bitcoins (and jeah, you don't understand anything if you compare Bitcoins with a Ponzi scheme... (wikipedia would help)) then please don't spread your shit here. Come back when you have some serious arguments.

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:04:15
what has this to do with Bitcoins? And I absolutely dont feel pity for him, because its completly normal that the police would take FUCKING 90k IN CASH!! whats the reason to have the 90k IN CASH??
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:45:22
and why? are there some objective reasons for this?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:10:58
