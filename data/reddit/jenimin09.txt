Smart contracts were important because they could radically reduce “mental and computational transaction costs.” In other words, traditional contracting makes certain kinds of agreements expensive, sometimes prohibitively so. By lowering transaction costs, smart contracts could make entire categories of human interactions much easier to accomplish, and enable others for the very first time. It is by this metric that smart contracts should be judged, not the impossible feat of achieving true “trustlessness.” I know a few project that I trust like SciDex, their aim is to secure, standardize and simplify exchange of datasets. Now their advantage is that the Marketspace will be built side by side with design partners to ensure the ability of frictionless data exchange.

Thanks for sharing, you were right about smart contracts being private, indeed they are still extremely primitive and regular businesses cant use them at all. There are few projects I'm interested in like SciDex, they have just partnered with Origin Protocol. They are creating a new contract that will be readable by human and machine, will be on the blockchain and can be used by normal businesses.

Smart contracts are still extremely primitive and regular businesses cant use them at all. So mass adoption wont happen really any time soon. I know of a project called SciDex and they are creating a new contract that will be readable by human and machine, will be on the blockchain and can be used by normal businesses. It is very useful for me as someone who works in the real estate business who would not prefer a traditional way of doing transactions.

Thanks for sharing this article. Everything is oversimplified, nice work. A project I'm interested in called SciDex  has developed an Ethereum-powered protocol that introduces the element of adaptability to the Ricardian Smart Contract. Therefore, this protocol is known as the Ricardian Adaptive Smart Contract or the RASC protocol.

 High profile security breaches on platforms like Ethereum cause companies to wonder “about whether blockchain smart contracts have, in the language of hackers, created too great a surface area for attack.  Smart contracts are still extremely primitive and regular businesses cant use them at all. So mass adoption wont happen really any time soon. I've read an article about a project called SciDex, they're creating a new contract that will be readable by human and machine, will be on the blockchain and can be used by normal businesses.

I’ve been looking for a lot of ico information online. Your comment was very helpful. Im currently following SciDex, they are helping scientists to share data which is very important for example in my profession. Hope their project succeeds.
