this is exactly what happened. 36% is being seen as a, "well at least its not all of it" number. 
anyone who thinks there were not internal/corporate accounts trading (with stolen balances) is a complete and utter moron.

so , if socialized losses are indeed the path that you are taking then I can also assume that your announcements will include complete transparency in terms of how much money lost belonged to internal accounts vs customer accounts.. yes? 
I'd hate to see innocent users whom were not even "hacked" eat a loss with some internal company account(s).

and I'd really suggest you give people direct answers about the money lost and maybe they'll stop inferring. It's been over 24hrs.
You, specifically, are doing a great job here -- your company getting direct answers to customers who have thousands and thousands of dollars in possible losses? not so much. the longer this goes and more inferring will be done. 
there's only one way to stop it and you guys are the only people capable of doing so.

this. it's like a slot machine that advertises a 95% payout... you're basically agreeing that 5 cents of every dollar you put into it will never be seen again. yet people pull the handle again and again.
the amount of posts in here that are "happy" with it being "just 36%" is crazy. let it sink in for a week and then hand me 100% of your money, i'll get reckless with it and maybe you'll see 64% of it at a yet to be determined date. oh, i'll also throw in a free git cloned shitcoin that i created to make money out of thin air. you'll be whole one day, pinky promise. 
these scams will continue until people wake the fuck up.

wow... what a joke. people should absolutely NOT blindly accept a 36% socialized loss without demanding that they show 100% transparency with internal account balances that were being traded.
YOU ARE POTENTIALLY SHARING A LOSS WITH THEIR OWN MONEY.

cool, lets get a list of all assets for the public to see and make that decision then :)
if I were a lawyer, the verbiage of "segregated wallets" that bfx used everywhere would be argued heavily against their "equal creditor" argument. 
If a storage facility went up in flames and 36% of the place was not recoverable, do the rest of the space owners auction off their belongings to make the others whole or do the 64% just go in with their key and retrieve their belongings?

and ... it's fair why? because they told you it's fair? because it's better than 100%? 
they 10000% had internal account money stolen. you're cool with lumping that money into the "losses" and sharing it? you do realize that you're taking them on their word about all of this? 
demanding transparency and receiving it "is fair". if you're not interested in that then I don't know what to tell you.
