What exactly does this have to do with using an exchange to buy and sell, this looks like a cloud mining service??

Is this is the same place that wheels you out in a wheelchair if you eat their triple bypass burger?
@_date: 2019-09-16 21:55:33
LOL! Awesome. We used to have one of these in Arizona, but the place got so much shit from local med pros that they ended up closing it down, sadly it turned into a check into cash place. The owner dressed up like a doctor and the nurses (waitress) wore this “sexy” nurse outfits, if you finished the triple bypass burger all the nurses wheeled you out to your car.
