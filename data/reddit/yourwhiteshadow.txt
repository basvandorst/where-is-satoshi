Meh. One of the things I liked about the matrix was the community. You could tell if a certain release was clean based on comments. Of course I could set up my own newznab but I'd rather not.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:59:01
I agree. People here are forgetting that the reason they believed in buying BTC was because they thought it could go somewhere. It'd be somewhat hypocritical to cash back out to fiat that will lose its value. Why not increase the BTC economy by spending your BTC or even selling your stuff to people for BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:11:34
You still have your 40+ bitcoins. You didn't lost anything. You didn't get robbed of anything. Go spend your bitcoins. Its a currency. Not a commodity.

While I completely agree with your sentiment, I also think an alternative plan would be to GPU mine. ROI on some cheap 5xxx and 6xxx series cards is like 1 month at current difficulties, you could even get some 7950s or 7970s mine for 2-3 months, break even or make a little, and then sell the cards for profit.

not necessarily. you give the miners too much credit. have you seen some of the retarded posts on r/bitcoin? there's a reason i've limited my time on r/bitcoin. 1/4 of posts are if people should invest, another 1/4 are if ASICs are worth it, another 1/4 is how to mine with GPU, and the rest are some combination of wallet problems or some other.

@_date: 2013-04-08 00:08:22
I had emailed a really "hipster" ice cream shop to see if they would, but apparently its too complicated for them. They already use "Square" so I figured it wouldn't be too much to ask them about Bitcoin, but alas, they don't want to make things too difficult. You can't ask a big business to figure out something like Bitcoin by themselves. Instead maybe point them in the direction of Bitpay?

dude, i don't know what you're looking at, but i'm seeing $170 right now. there was a rebound, then a dip, now a rebound. leave the chart alone if you're in it for the long run. if you wanted to make a quick buck you can do that now, or short your losses.

Because the more hashing power you have the higher the chanced of finding a block. Its the same reason people don't solo mine with just a GPU.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:18:22
I honestly have no idea why people are having so much trouble. I just made a deposit today, money was in account in like 3 minutes. How big was your deposit? I'd like to get to the bottom of this as you're not the first or last I'm guessing.

one thing i would suggest is making a wallet using bitcoin-qt or something, saving the wallet.dat and encryption keys, zipping them up, and sending them to that person after asking them to install the wallet.

no it won't. you can run your cards in 1x lanes with risers and still get the same hash rate pretty much.

my letter to the editor:
Dear Editor,
While Bitcoin faces numerous challenges in the wake of recent speculation and frenzy, the most difficult roadblock hindering Bitcoin to leading us to financial stability is a lack of understanding of new technologies. Its the lack of understanding coupled with a fear of something that challenges the status quo which makes us blind to changes that are potentially positive for the world.
Unfortunately, Mr Cohen fails to realize that even though Moore's law can remain undisputed, it will not change the fact that Bitcoins will only be generated at a guaranteed rate. The difficulty of mining a bitcoin changes in correlation to how quickly the previous 2016 blocks were mined. Hence, the year 2040 is a very accurate estimate for the date we should have reached the limit of mined bitcoins, 21 million. This renders Mr Cohen's point that Bitcoins will hold no value as moot.
All of this is not to take away from Mr. Cohen's accute observation that governments will play a large role in the future of Bitcoins and that there aren't other problems facing Bitcoin such as hoarding, adoption, and speculation.

It happens every damn week. Its been happening since December. Its been happening even while the price was going up. But the price going up doesn't cause panic buying. But lag, causes panic selling. Feel bad for all the newblood selling below $120. As I've been saying, what was so catastrophic that caused Bitcoins value to change? Any news, the US hasn't banned it, no one has found a way to "hack" it, nothing changed.

I feel like once newzbin died there was a huge void to be filled, matrix filled it well, but nothing has been the same since matrix went down. Wish there was a way to get the scene back to the way it was. A mix of TOR and BTC might be the remedy. Things got way too simple for the average user.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:42:20

i pay $10/month right now, and that's a little inflated since i'm too lazy to switch to a better deal. don't want to have to put in a new pass into 4-5 of my computers. again, i think .1-.15 BTC would be very reasonable.
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:49:48
this is very interesting, and yet another reason i see bitcoin prevailing. people forget that developing countries, like india, had such a hard time getting land lines set up for the past 10 years. literally no one would use their land line because it would take 2-3 months on average to get one, instead people roamed around with 2, sometimes 3 cell phones. some of our old ways of doing things are just too inefficient...
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:32:49
Your Mhash/s doesn't depend on the mining pool, just to clarify in case you were wondering. It depends on your own hardware. I'm mining with 300 Mhash/s on slush's as well for about 16 hours a day M-F, and 8 hours a day on the weekends and getting about .15 BTC a week.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:11:37
I was going to buy through Bitfloor, but alas every Bank of America closes at 4:30 pm in the city I live in (I'm still acclimating since my recent move), and so I wasn't able to deposit via LocalTill.
So then I decided to give Bitinstant a shot. Not only do you pay Bitinstant a fee, but then you pay Moneygram a fee. In retrospect, I should have paid the fee when I could have bought at $108/BTC... speed matters.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:08:50
Gold is already plumetting. And there are so many things that can make it plummet in the future like unobtanium. And such is investing.
May I ask if you even spent a single satoshi or gave a single satoshi to anyone? Did you even move your coins from the exchange to your wallet? You weren't vested in the currency, just your greed. Bitcoin will live on. $10k is nothing compared to those who lost homes.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:49:19
I upvoted. If you're here to make money before knowing what exactly Bitcoins is, then gtfo. These are the people that are going to cause the panic crash if there is one, and these are the ones that panic sell.
These types of questions are straight up annoying, even more so than the people who ask which exchange to use, or how to get money into an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:40:10
LOL. this is definitely official now.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:59:15
yes. i just bought a 7850 for $160 AR, sold bioshock and tomb raider for $50, and and have already mined .25 BTC, which sells for about $30 right now. power might have cost me $5 as i only mined ~16 hours a day during weekdays, and 8 hours a day on the weekend. at worst its a heavily discounted GPU.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:37:41
OP, are you talking about your mining rig, or your computer with your wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:56:45
Moreover, by simply using bitcoins to make purchases over the Silk Road and thereby TOR, they probably already have a far deeper understanding of the technology than most of the speculators.

@_date: 2013-04-05 14:07:28
wow. i bought a radeon 7850 for $110 after rebates and selling the games 2 weeks ago. already mined 0.2 BTC worth about $26 right now. i was going to buy the GPU anyways and play bioshock infinite. so if you're in the market for a new graphics card that you'd use to play games its most definitely worth it. but you have a month tops before the avalon ASICs come out, and lord knows when the BFL ASICs will come out. if you get a card before the end of the week, or even early next week, it may still be worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 02:48:57
you just gave me a great idea. i'm going to leave an envelope that says $5 on it, and just leave it. load up an address with $5 worth of bitcoins. raise awareness...
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:37:35
yeah. if you already have money at mt gox just buy from there. also, if things start to crash or you want to cash out fast, mt gox. also depends on how many coins you've got, if you want to buy or sell more than 20-25 BTC, gox.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:15:12
There were plenty of redditors crying for people to spread out amongst the exchanges. But no, some people would rather way 1-2 weeks to get verified at Gox and to jump onto the gravy train, than go use an exchange like Bitfloor which would have allowed them to get their coins a week or two earlier. They didn't familiarize themselves with the other exchanges. Ironic, that in the 1-2 weeks they waited to get verified, they could have gotten their coins cheaper from Bitfloor if they bought 2 weeks ago. Congrats to all the people who refused to buy from anyone but Gox.

@_date: 2013-04-04 18:31:25
theoretically the value of bitcoins will always keep miners around who will mine not only for the blocks, but when they are all nearly completed mine for the fees. also, the difficulty can adjust if lots of miners drop out so that those who are left can keep the blockchain going.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:27:43
did you pay with cash or check?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:41:17
I just deposited today. The amount you deposit is unique. You'll have your money in your bitfloor account in about 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:58:16
I honestly don't think it was the traffic from people who are interested. I think it was pure market manipulation. OK, so Mt. Gox is down, let's check out Bitfloor or Reddit to see what's going on? Oh Bitfloor is down? Bitcointalk is down, wtf? OMG SELL.
There weren't even viable rumors going on. The most obvious and best explanation at the time was DDoS/trading Bot attack. So what does any logical person do? Hold. But some people sold the house, including everything and the kitchen sink. So they sold.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:17:03
yeah, you're not the first person. sadly, someone else experienced this later in the day. though i can confirm that i made a deposit to bitfloor this morning around 10-11 am.

your order was filled using two separate ask bids. so you bought 917 Euros worth of BTC but from 2 sellers.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:50:04
because you think short term. if you're in it, you should be in it for the long run. i bought hours before the DDoS and then the "crash", i bought at the peak at bitfloor at $145/BTC, about $400 worth. i was shaking during the "crash" but calmed myself down thinking yeah, w/e i'm in it for the long run. better get in now before we reach the new floor of $200.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:37:06
fair enough. but my plan is to be my own bank. hold my main wallet on my macbook, i'm planning to get sushi on thursday and pay in BTC, so i'll load up my android with just enough to pay for sushi and maybe some change. leave the change, no point in incurring the transfer fee twice. sure, there is one transfer fee too much, but i'll pay it for my security.

@_date: 2013-04-04 21:11:52
honestly, i thought about it for a while a week or two ago. was thinking about the jalapeño, then the price of a BTC approached $100 last week or so, and I started thinking maybe I should just get a single. This week I thought, ok, either I drop some cash into BTCs or I buy a single, but they haven't delivered, and I've already made a ROI by buying BTC that I'm going to hold onto.
In the mean time, I did purchase a 7850 to mine with. Paid $180 for the card - $20 rebate - $50 for selling bioshock and tomb raider - $26 for the 0.2 BTC I've already mined. Let's say BTC dies tomorrow, I got a graphics card I can still sell for $130-140 maybe. I probably couldn't sell the BFL jalapeño or single for 1/10 of what its worth. Until Avalon ships batch  GPU mining is still a huge market. You've got about a month to grab a GPU and mine the hell out of it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:35:55
Finally, someone else sharing the same sentiment as I do. But no, people must have thought Gox got hacked yesterday. I'm betting 75% of the people who got verified in the last 2 weeks were just leaving their coins on exchanges. Very few people truly understood what bitcoin was about.
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:14:27

OP, seems like you're blaming BTC for your own shortcomings of not being able to stand up for yourself. If you had yelled thief or something he would have left and looked guilty in a police report. All you had to do was report it.

I understand that. But at the same time, if your pool is too small you may never find a block. 5-10 guys running GPUs is probably not going to be worth it for them. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:06:29
in a sense, I'm glad those speculators are gone. what was so fundamental about bitcoin that changed? sha256 encryption exists, bitcoin is still legal, nothing changed, except a DDoS attack. lol. gg speculators.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:05:26
A provider, and not a reseller, who accepts bitcoins is much more likely to non DMCA compliant. It makes a big difference.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:59:02
i think so, $135 in a month. with practically zero risk if the BTC market plummets.

Oh I miss Phoenix so bad. Phoenix craigslist &gt;&gt;&gt; Boston craigslist. Just search anything, and you'll find the Phoenix craigslist market of buyers and sellers is much larger.
But anyways, this is hillarious.

jeez, someone really wants to wipe bitcoin off the face of the planet.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:31:19
yeah this shit is suspicious. is someone dumping coins onto an exchange or  is tradehill up and running and stuff is happening behind closed doors?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:43:28
Meanwhile, my Dwolla is getting validated from my cashout last night. I think we all saw this coming. Bitcoin value depends on one exchange, that one exchange sucks, everyone wants to buy, everyone wants to sell, everyone wants to hack/DDoS. The end.

why is it so hard to just have a full featured client... i mean, c'mon its one thing to trust online banking because of what the banks can offer, but its another to trust an online wallet where if you're money is gone, its gone.

supply and demand economics. if you have 200 sellers, they're competing for your money. if you have 10 sellers, well, you don't have as much choice. the mt gox verification queue and moving money into mt gox means that by the time you actually buy some bitcoins, the price could be $30 higher the next day. for this reason, people dump their money into bitfloor immediately, and can buy their coins within 30 minutes. people know this and ask for more on bit floor since they know you'll pay it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:56:47
i really like bitfloor as well. deposited money at Bank of America, had money in my account in about 15 minutes. Boom, done.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:38:15

And you're forgetting that I have multiple wallets. I could distribute my funds to a dozen wallets, or a half dozen, or maybe two dozen wallets then pay him through 2 dozen wallets to preserve my anonymity. While you could definitely trace funds back, it would be pretty difficult to do so. I could always use a different address to pay my drug dealer each time, he couldn't fuck with me if he wanted to. Its like drug dealers using prepaid phones.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:48:16
sorry, i meant 7770. but yeah, the 7770 is pretty good for the price. plus, if BTC crashes, you can always sell your card for like $70.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:52:52
You are probably correct, but I remember buying a bundle once and they discouraged against small donations like $0.50 because some credit card processors have a flat fee of $1/transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-07 04:34:26
yeah lol, talk about unbiased and without conflict of interest.

mine BTC with your gaming rig to subsidize AND buy bitcoin. that's what i did :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:15:07
i have a similar feeling. i'd like to start buying and selling stuff using BTC.  so much simpler to use.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:29:13
It was over yesterday. In fact, the signs were there last week that there are manipulators, DDoSers, speculators, and everything in between. That's not something you want to play with unless you can afford to lose that money.

Don't sound embarassed, that's a large amount to be sinking in. For reference, I made much smaller deposits, 1/10 of what you made and they went through. I'm guessing there is some weird stuff going on with LocalTill.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:30:47
Of course it does. You must be one of the ones who panicked and caused the crash because you treat it as a commodity. Nothing has changed about Bitcoin's security or fundamentals. The only thing that changed was its exchange rate in fiat.
I sat thinking to myself during the crash that there was no news regarding illegalization of BTC, security flaws in BTC or anything, so why were people panic selling? 
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:49:27
its actually not. i'm pulling 150 watts from the wall on my machine, i've only been mining 16 hours a day, when i'm at work and sleeping, that's less than $0.50/24h for power in my area at $0.15/kWh. again, if you're into gaming, and you've been putting off a GPU upgrade, now is a great time.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:14:42
a friend told me to get an online wallet because of the convenience. to me it sounded like the stupidest idea ever, and it it still is... it'll take a lot for me to move my coins onto an online wallet....

you've got to be a bit more precise. since AAPL become publicly traded, it went from pennies to almost $700-800/share. yeah, it closed today at $461.91, but stocks are also different in that you can buyout companies with enough shares.
@_date: 2013-03-23 04:24:13
too early to tell, but just to play devil's advocate, look at diamonds. aside from aesthetic value, it doesn't mean much (unless you talk about using diamond to cut rocks), and yet look at the prices you can fetch for diamonds. people still mine diamonds because of that fact. its the diamond-water paradox, although i'm not sure it'll apply since we're talking about a currency, but after all, what is currency except for a way to trade goods?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:52:20
I'm going to agree with this sentiment. People that hear stories of people running mining rigs and becoming "rich" don't realize how much work goes into putting a rig with 4-5 radeon 5870s together. i guess you could drop 2-3 7970s and get a similar hashrate, but that's somewhat of a gamble given how soon ASICs could be out.

nope. you just show them the paper, ask for an out of state deposit slip, and either the nice cashier will fill it out for you, or you fill it out, hand them money. and then go buy some BTC on bitfloor.

I think a lot of people who are going to be buying the avalons are the ones who have been mining for a while, or had accumulated BTC on the cheap. sure, its $5,430 right now, but these people are probably in it as a hobby.
also, if i believe correctly, BFL also took preorders with BTC, and so if you paid 75 BTC for their single, you're also in for $5500, but you actually don't have a product right now, and probably won't have a product for who knows how long....

yeah, you'd have to buy cards now, and hope that you already have a rig set up and ready to go. honestly, after discrediting bitcoin a few years ago, i'm glad i've looked more into it. have you seen the "mining rig" thread over at bitcointalk.org? absolutely amazing and ridiculous stuff. some people have run 5 radeon 5870s on one motherboard. lol.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:09:36
You can easily prove to Paypal that your BTC send address sent x amount of BTC to buyer's address. Its hard to refute that. You could easily take that person to court and win. Just look at the blockchain, all records of BTC transactions are visible and irrefutable.

You would think that since its happened, what 3-4 times the past 4 weeks, that people would know better. Look at the amount of users on here right now wondering what's going on. NOTHING IS GOING ON. BUSINESS AS USUAL. THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

Because one bitcoin is still bitcoin. None of the fundamentals of bitcoin have changed except the exchange rate.

You can still buy, there are coins available on exchanges such as Bitfloor and Mt. Gox. Bitfloor would be the easiest to get your money into, you can go to a Bank of America, deposit your money, and buy BTC in about 15 minutes, not counting traveling.

its not only cool, but it'd be very useful for them since they probably get very little of the actual money once the credit card processors eat up all the fees.

was just about to mention that lol. but the author of this article doesn't understand much about bitcoin mining. GPU set ups consume ridiculous amounts of power and then cooling them is an additional power draw.
