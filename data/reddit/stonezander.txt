This C&amp;D, if you read it, says for Bitconnect to stop selling through affiliates in Texas because they have failed to provide/disclose enough info pertaing to basic financial institutions and failing to disclose the amount of risk involved.  It says nothing about "ponzi schemes." or them shutting down Bitconnect.

Thanks for putting that out to people, even if they don't want to believe it. Based on the charts and past history, we have a little ways more to go. However, it is safe to say that 10k is a great and safe buy when you have a long outlook.

You could be totally right. This is Bitcoin and no one tames this beast,  it does what it wants. I'm using past history to predict the future which doesn't allways work. But when it does....

I don't blame The All Out people that bought houses or paid off their house, or climbed out of debt; that is something that will have a lifetime impact on that person and they can exclaim that Bitcoin did that for them. I see no failure in letting them have that. Imagine if Bitcoin went up their entire life and because they didn't want to miss any gains they never sold, then they died. What good will it do for them in the grave. I know what you're thinking they could wait until the value goes up equivalent to what they hold currently, but there's no guarantee that the price will hold or that it won't go down for a couple years etc etc. There is a saying that everyone knows, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I get it I don't think I would ever sell all my coins but I'm in a different position then other people. For some, they need to sell all of their coins to make a difference in their life and they shouldn't be put down for that.

I wanted to put a buy at 10.5 but my money showed up a day late. However, with the resistance to get above 15 I believe we could go under 10 and the buy wall will dissapear as alot of it will be bots that will pull their orders and place a lower buy order as it approaches 10 in the next week or two. However, I have been burned before by waiting for it to correct to it's lowest point which at this point on my charts is 8150ish so I figured I would go with 9k to have a cushion.

Because we are not children. Do we use corporate tactics to kill a competitor, who we say is not a competitor? Is it just me or does it seem like there is a lot of people that want to actively go after BCH instead of let the free market determine what is best. Some of us here seem like we are trying to lower ourselves to that of people who write political smear campains.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:40:15
The hard cold truth... I love Bitcoin as much as the next forward thinker but until people stop hodl ing and start spending, bitcoin will never be adapted as main stream currency. If we keep comparing how much value our bitcoin is worth in fiat, it will just be something you can store value in. Not until we compare how much of a given product you can buy with a bitcoin instead of how valuable it is, will bitcoin be looked upon as currency. ie, 1 bitcoin can buy a nice suit, not 1 bitcoin can be exchanged for $4000. I understand they are interchangeable in a way but it is how the everyday man needs to relate to it for a solid change to take effect (along with many other factors). So the questions we need to hear are, what can my bitcoin buy? Not, what is my bitcoin worth?
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:19:56
I Hear that.

@_date: 2017-08-23 21:57:24
Actually if an exchange let's you margin trade you can have a short position. Though you might not actually hold the coin you are borrowing the value of that coin and selling it hoping to buy back up at a lower price and close the position. Hence a Short order

Agreed, entrance into an ETF will allow people to trade bitcoin like an asset. They wont think to hodl like we do and will look to take profits here and there. I think when they come in there will be a surge in value, initially, but then we will see profit taking that will start giving our moon ride a rollercoaster effect that will increase the time it takes to get to the moon.

Yeah, I made the mistake of depositing into my USD wallet instead of purchasing with a card to get the current price. It just sucks it takes so long which is why we are all here looking forward to crypto currency to make transactions instantaneous.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:42:14
So you are saying that when new people come in they think Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin? I don't believe that to be true they simple look at the prices and know there is a difference. Just because you have brothers with the same last name does not make them the same person, nor should one of them kill the other one off just because the represent the family name. As for pulling miner numbers down, you have to blame the miners themselves and their own interest (which by the way, is the way it was set up to be). Imagine there was another altcoin that showed up out there that finally became the "world excepted decentralized cryptocurrency" and all the miners left both chains to go and mine that. Would you blame that coin for fufilling the dream of a decentralized cryptocurrency that finally was excepted worldide for transactions of goods and services? Yes, it would kick Bitcoin off as the King of the Mountain, but it would show that we finally made it. If you are a true believer in Bitcoin ideology than the dream is that we are not controlled by a fiat system, it shouldn't matter which coin or token gets us there it only matters that we get there.

I'm kinda in your boat, especially for the fact that so many people "hodl." If no one is spending it, it will never be an everyday currency. I take it liken to gold where Bitcoin is a store of value. Most people will trade their currency for bitcoin hoping to watch bitcoin's value rise. Not so many are willing to spend it just to see it go up a grand a week later. With all of the speculators out their quoting future valuations anywhere from 75k - 1M. I don't see many people offering up their bitcoin for a new computer anytime soon.

Guys, there is something called patience for the long game. As much as I'd love a dip to happen when I'm at my computer it's gonna take some time. Take your charts out to a weekly view and a moving average that matches the chart and you might get a better feel for what the dip price "might" look like. If your looking for a short run profit, a $4000 ankle bite might be worth the buy for a 10% run up to 4400.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:36:34
True, but you can have panic sellers that bought in at 4200 and don't know enough about it to weather thru the huge swings and will think "I have to get off before it hits $0", that's good news for those of us waiting for dips however.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:21:02

No matter the investment it's wise to diversify, sure you might miss out on gIns but it lowers the risk factor.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:28:39
It is really infuriating when these exchanges want to be seen as big and legitimate but are not willing to fund enough to provide the proper support needed for the growth that they hope to get. It's almost as if they are a 22 yr. old in their garage running the show and that goes for a lot of them. Since a majority of them are not legally responsible (yet) and they screw over enough people, that will allow governing agencies the justification to come in and regulate crypto currencies.  These shity exchanges are what will bring centralization to what is supposed to be decentrailized
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:14:07
Yeah except they have to wait until 11/28! Did anybody else notice that?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:04:58
He brings up legitimate issues. If this was a company and it got donations, people would want an update. Otherwise the term fraud would be thrown around along with lawsuits. But this is cryptocurrency and I think the fact that there is no immediate regulatory oversite, people feel that they don't owe a fudiciary duty to those that fund them because, "Hey, no one is gonna do a thing about it."
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:32:33
Interesting. So he does not stand for a specific coin, only against Bitcoin? If that is true and his main goal is to only be against BTC, why wouldn't he just back a different blockchain like Ethereum? There has to be more to his reasoning.

Yes, you can judge his character but in the end, if he sold all his BTC for good reasons the net result would still be the same. And what's up with the down voting for sound logic? The basis of what I said is, anyone should be allowed to sell their coins anytime they want if it is their coins. What is the opposite of that? Others get to control your money and determine when you get to sell it? Isn't that what we all came here to get away from the banks doing that to us. Regardless of what anyone's reasons, a man should have control over his own money. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:39:20
Thanks, I guess what I'm asking is kinda what is the worst case scenario, as in what if they don't dump the coin? I get that that is what we think is going to happen, but what if they don't?

Whatever his agenda, it is his BTC and should he not be allowed to do what he wants with it? Should others be allowed to tell you when and how you should move your BTC? Who cares what he does with his coins, that's his business as it is with you and your's. This game of blaming others is getting tiresome. Let him sell all of it then we don't have to talk about him any more...or will you pick someone new to complain about?

@_date: 2017-11-12 04:32:58
Honest questions? If it doesn't sell off, what does that mean? I know there will be a correction but what if it doesn't go all the way back down? Does that give some sort of picture to what is happening?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:52:48
But calling it a bubble does not mean Bitcoin will die off. The stock market has bubbles, Realestate has bubbles and last  I checked the NY Stock Exchange is still there and we are not all homeless. Bubble means something is CURRENTLY over valued and is about to correct which it did. 3000 down to 1800 is quite a "pop" its also resiliant and recovered quickly. Current highs do not mean he was incorrect. Infact the opposite, he called it correctly which allowed me to look into Bitcoin and buy that dip. 
Thank you, Mark.

I'm with you on this one. Some would call it a correction some will call it a bubble bursting. Most Fiance people on the outside that have not really watched the price action on cryptocurrencies over the years will look at the charts and say a 50+% draw down is a bubble bursting. I'm inclined to believe that myself, except I've seen the prior year's "bubbles." (Look back for yourselves: May 2017, Feb and Nov of 2013, Jun 2011, Nov 2010....
For the frequency of these draw downs I would tend to lean towards the terminology of correction. The amount of the draw down (volitility) is just the nature of a lack of volume traded in the cryptosphere.
With that being said calling people out and saying they are FUDing for pointing out things that have happened in the past a number of times is in bad form and quite foolish to ignore;   regardless of that person calling it a "bubble" or a "correction."

If this post is real and you are feeling suicidal you need to turn to some real help not a bitcoin hand out. If you are given bitcoins and you lose them again you are just back at being suicidal if you don't fix the real underlying issues you have. 
I have lost large sums of money in my life and took them as learning lessons. And be greatful that you still have a family that loves you with or without bitcoin. With that being said, I hope all goes well for you moving forward and with the job hunt as well since it seems you are hurting for money to buy bitcoin with.
If this is a scam, which it looks most likely to be... karma's a bitch.

Wait, what? Could you please break this down. Not that i dont trust you but i just deposited money from my bank straight to GDAX and it said it will post in 3 days. The last time i deposited from my bank into coinbase (5 days) then transfered over to gdax(instantly). Please explain as you now have me worried.

This graph needs to be corrected. The OP shows the # of days, low, and % decrease for the current correction. He/she should have question marks across the first line except the high block. If you actually chart out all of these correction (and I have) you see that all prices come back at least to a moving average (I used a conservative 22 days). Dont take it from me or anyone else, do the research yourselves and see what you come up with. I see that we still have a ways to go on this correction, what do you see?
On a side note, the always safe hodl will work but if you are looking to buy the dip...this is a good basis to go off of. Remember however, that past performance does not guarantee future results, but it is a good educated guess.

Good timing to get in.
Any transaction on GDAX will display in coinbase's history as well.
Once you have gdax you pretty much won't have to use coinbase again, unless you want to look over transaction history (it's easier to read on coinbase).
To monitor your orders use gdax.
To monitor the market price of bitcoin, use a chart site that tracks bitcoin price for coinbase/gdax, as there are a number of exchanges out there with different prices for a number of reasons to big to explain in this post. I personally use the free version found on  
When you look up BCTUSD trading pair, make sure you pick the one for Coinbase.
hint* If you want to look further back in time of bitcoin historical chart pricing use the BTCUSD from Bitstamp as they have been around a long time.

Your only taxed on any gains. At what rate (%) you are taxed at depends on how long you held that asset. Less then 12 months or greater than 12 months. It will usually be a lower tax rate if you hold the longer route.

I should make up something called Fakecoin (FKC). You can then trade USDT for FKC on a 1 to 1 basis. Then I could just make more of it out of no where, anytime i want and have people trade me their tethers for FKC (*murmers silently* Then I'll go exchange them for BTC.) Sounds legitimate right? Who wants to join me.

No problem. This was one of the most valuable things I got from Reddit. Just paying it forward.
Also just an added cherry on top. Take a look at the weekly charts and put a 22 day moving average on it. You'll be surprised to see that you can figure out the general bottoms too. Look back at all the climbs and falls and you'll see the 22 MA is usually were it starts turning back up.

Get an account on Coinbase and once verified, open an account on GDAX and trade there (the fees are cheaper or free depending on what type of order you make). You won't have to verify on GDAX because it is owned by Coinbase. If you buy using "limit order" you wont pay a fee. Also there is no fee to transfer funds between the two accounts. Good luck!

How would governments kill Bitcoin? Try thinking from their point of view. If I were a government and wanted to kill a currency that has a finite amount and my currency I can just produce an endless amount of... I would buy up all of the available supply on the open markets and leave so little that there was not enough liquidity to create a market for it. Do we see this happening? Or better yet create government owned mining farms greater then 51% and destroy it from within. 
I'm not so sure the government's are think so much as to battle it as I think they will try to utilize it to create more control!

Dang, but who or what said 9 days? I didn't think about it I just did it then gdax auto response said, thanks, deposit should post in approximately 3 days. Were you trying to deposit a large amount or use a money wire? I just have a credit union. 
Haha, I get it. Chase is owned by....drum roll please.....JP Morgan. Dang Jamie Dimon works fast.

Unfortunately, you end up with exchanges like Coinbase replacing your old brokerage, and you couldn't dream of getting to talk to a rep on ANY day let alone the Friday before Labor Day. As much as I love leaving the old financial system behind, there is something to be said about their customer service that the cryptocurrency world has yet to bring on board.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:00:51
Did it through GDAX on Thur. If you look on Coinbase history and click the pending deposit it will tell you a date that is 5 business days from when you started the transaction. So it says I will get my funds Thursday night. Kinda bull since when I submitted the deposit GDAX auto response said something along the lines of, Thank you for your deposit your funds should be available within 3 days. Mind you, I am in California and so is Coinbase. ACH has never taken longer then 3 days for anything in the US for me and yet some how Coinbase tends to take a full 5 days. More like the are using my money for a couple days before making it available to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:29:58
Dear Coinbase, WHAT...THE...FUCK!
Why the hell are you so shitty when it comes to customer support. You are so bad that you scare away new people from trusting in something so beautiful and then they blame that beautiful thing (Bitcoin) for YOUR shitty forseeable short comings. I understand that this person that wrote the article had many faults of his own, but you as a cryptocurrency exchange should be leading the way to building trust in the cryptosphere for new comers. If you don't change soon I will be hoping for a group of users to create a method for your demise. There are enough exchanges out there that we could do with one less exchange that is hindering or destroying Bitcoin's future.

I believe they did create a tax law stating that if you spend on a purchase over $500 then you must account for the increase in value of your cryptocurrency as a taxable transaction. But if it is under that amount then you don't.
Note: I could be wrong on the amount

What the hell does protocol have anything to do with my analogy. The analogy is for new technology.

You seriously need to look further back then that. Specifically to all the other year's run ups and corrections: Jun 2017, Nov 2013, Feb 2013, Jun 2011....
After every major run up there was a correction back to a moving average level before rising again.
Although it is safe to say, past performance does not guarantee future results; however, it is a good educated guess.

Honest question, what happens when volume goes way up in the future when there is mass acceptance of Bitcoin and you need more then 1, 2, 4Mb? Will Segwit be enough? Will 8Mb? True leadership thinks about the horizon not just the immediate problems. Do any of the current options fix the problem of the long game and if not, can we pull ourselves and our egos out of our asses long enough to figure out the best solution for an infinite amount of transactions (an exageration). If we keep going in the direction of tearing Bitcoin apart,  we are likely to see it becomes the "myspace" of the cryptosphere that many refer to.

There can be more offers to sell that aren't executed on because there is someone willing to sell for less.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:17:16
The value will come from what someone is willing to buy it at, not from BTC. If someone is willing to buy it at $500, it will be intrinsically at that moment, $500. BTC value will also rise or fall based on a number of things but because Bitcoin Cash was pulled out of BTC (like pulling $.50 out of a dollar bill) is not one of them. Instead think of it as duplicating the dollar bill and calling the second one peso.
