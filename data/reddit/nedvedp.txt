Awesome, I also started translating the Bitcoin Core.

I haven't done this for the bounty, but that would really be cool. There have been some talks about compensating translators in the future. I think it can be good to give the opportunity to people to earn some bitcoin. In developing countries, it's sometimes hard to buy Bitcoin. Here, as far as I know, there is only one local exchange.

I must say I read quite a lot for the past year or so, so I'd say I had quite good understanding, but it indeed helped me "refresh" my knowledge, I would definitely say this type of work is useful. There are still some outdated strings English guys have to update, but I plan to be an active translator and help educate people in my country as the mass media (not just here) rarely provides good information about this ground-breaking protocol.

Which link you're referring to?
All of the strings pushed to Transifex are 100% translated, but they still need to push the new strings for translators. That's why there might be some English words on the Serbian site, just like any other translated site.

Ne izgovara se sa J definitivno, ovo je verovatno pisao neko ko nikad nije koristio Bitkoin.

Indeed, just join your language on Transifex

I've done it for no compensation and I've done it over the course of several weeks. 
There are some talks that the translators might get some sort of reward in future, you'd have to ask site owners.

Okay realized which link you're referring to 
There are numerous sections to translate. The main site section called YML bitcoin.org is at 100%, the others are for developer documentation.
