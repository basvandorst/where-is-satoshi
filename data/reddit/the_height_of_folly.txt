I would pay all the btc I own to see Batman beat the hell out of Donnie Moscow

Pizzerias hate them!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:04:00
Good for you. Enjoy it!

Made you feel it, did he?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:21:38
Mine is at 0. I'd only been at it for a week. Oh well. At least I didn't lose more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:39:16
What did you do?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:10:29
I would delete this and anything else that mentions your bitcoin in case she tries to get it.

I really need to see the full video of this. It looks like something was happening on the escalator going down.

Who says I have bitcoin?

Aw hell, I'm getting ahead of myself again.

Does anyone else struggle to read posts from Twitter?
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:31:53
Hmm...not sure if the username checks out.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:33:30
So what happened here? Does anyone know what was going on?
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:42:37
Surprised to see me?
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:43:00
Wow. That's crazy. I can't believe the situation there just doesn't improve.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:09:29
By all means then, buy some more! I'll join you.

What is the Venezuelan government's stance on cryptocurrencies? I've seen a few other people on here using them there and would like to know if it's something that has to be done discreetly or not.

Ronso protect Mt. Gox...aw hell, never mind...

Banks hate her!

I once heard a saying that's stuck with me: Bankruptcy is temporary. Poverty is eternal.
If I acquired an enormous amount of wealth through Bitcoin, I would do what I could to keep it going.

 The memes are coming back, aren't they?

I recently watched the Banking on Bitcoin documentary on Netflix. It had an interview with a guy saying that you should invest in whatever China bans. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:26:42
Yuan for bang?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:59:54
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:58:00
I really wish the term 'fake news' would just go away. I never heard it used until Twitler started bitching about it.

I finally jumped in and bought some last month and it's gone nowhere but down. I'm hodling but it's a little disappointing to see a 4x value increase through the whole year right up until the moment I bought.

Is it possible to learn this power?
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:01:15
Are you ok?

Retired at 32? Teach me...
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:29:55
I forgot about that. Back to square one, then.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:18:15
Netflix hates Bitcoin exchange graphs!
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:47:38
I like the way you think.

I'm more interested in the $500K bitcoin to see if John McAfee is a man of his word.
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:09:00
That sucks. Best of luck in the future.

Not sure if they followed their own motto.
