A post about market manipulation is considered off topic now?????????????????

It's the same concept. This article helped break down an SEC litigation release against a group of brokers operating a daisy chain.  Crypto has no regulator that does this yet, so all we can rely on is prior examples seen in the stock market.  
You have to agree that the internet ruined.  It's not the same anymore.  So much red tape, rules, everything gets blocked for the slightest infraction.. I thought someone from Salt Lake City, the home of Patrick Byrne, would respect a post like this

Hi, just giving everybody the heads up. Do not trust CNN Money for your financial news as it has just recently come to my attention that they are initiating explicitly fake analyst forecasts. Just looking out for everyone. Here is the link . I archived it just in case they decide to remove it

Just warning everybody about CNN Money.  They post explicitly fake analyst forecasts, do not use them.  [Link](

Unfortunately yes.  I always just assumed we were supposed to take what they said at face value.   They are well established companies with hundreds of years of combined experience, so seeing this instilled significant doubt about their credibility.  It's, again, unfortunate.  What's worse is that they are forced to the top of the feed, while everything else gets banned.

Fuck off!!  Uber drivers 2000k a week!!??!!!!  Is it still like that?

The same thing is happening in Vancouver.  Seems to be a Pacific coast thing.  Sure, a small group lives a dream, but the majority live in hot sweating needle/shit infested tents

Yeah but places like that account for a smaller portion of the population too right..A lot of people are forced to move to big cities due to urbanization

It's not just San Fran though.  New York is also obscenely expensive.  Many people feel the crunch
