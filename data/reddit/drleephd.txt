"dollars are fake",
"it's not gonna work".
those are all reasonable opinions. honestly, it's too early to say where this experiment leads. there's no way to say that any one particular coin will be extremely valuable in the future, otherwise bitcoin would already be $1M each. cryptocurrencies and blockchains are like the internet in 1992, It's a huge disruptive technology with tons of potential, but still very early in its infancy.  
Even if you don't like bitcoin, and I get that, it would be wise not to ignore the future potential of the technologies behind bitcoin.  If you don't want to invest, nobody is forcing you but personally I think it's a worthwhile one which will continue to be important in my lifetime.

As long as you like your glasses, or at least like wearing and paying for the brand-names it doesn't really matter. you should enjoy your purchase, but as a consumer you should also be informed.

bitcoin wallets all work pretty much the same, it's just a question of who holds your private keys.
with coinbase you don't actually get to hold your private keys, you're just trusting coinbase to do it for you.  If the coinbase website were to shut down, you could lose access to whatever bitcoins they're holding on your behalf.
holding your own bitcoins on mycellium or another app-based wallet allows you to control your own private keys.
better still, is to have a hardware wallet such as trezor or the ledger nano s which keeps your private keys on a physically secure hardware device and exports pre-signed (unchangeable) transactions to a internet connected computer and then to the blockchain whenever you decide to spend some coins.
the bottom line is, anybody who has the private keys for your bitcoins can spend them or get hacked and lose them so it's important that you and only you have control of those private keys.

Almost any bitcoin software supports importing a private key from a qr code, You could send it to your coinbase deposit address as easily as sending it anywhere else.  Mycellium on Android is what I use.
It is considered best practices to store your coins on a wallet you control, so, moving those coins to a new address in mycellium with a printed paper backup is more ideal than storing money on coinbase.

If you ever considered accepting bitcoin payments directly, you don't even need to use any third party services at all. That's one of the great benefits of bitcoin!  Just a phone, tablet, or even just a QR code printed out and stuck to your cash register is all you really need to accept bitcoin payments.

- "IP address restrictions"
They removed the feature
Hello Coinbase user, this is Craig from Coinbase.
Last week we added an unannounced feature that allowed users to set IP address restrictions on their main account.  This feature primarily existed for a specific set of accounts of our choice, and was temporarily added as a user-facing feature before a real decision was made about it.  We've decided that IP address restrictions won't be a generally availble feature on Coinbase, and have removed the ability to edit them from all accounts.  (Except for the API, where this feature still exists.)
You are receiving this email because at the time the feature was removed from view, you still had an IP address restriction set on your account.  That restriction will still apply for the next 24 hours.  After 24 hours, all IP address restrictions on accounts will be removed.  If you will be making any changes to your account as a result of this update, please do them ASAP.
We think it's really cool that you stumbled upon this feature and decided to give it a try.  I hope it worked out for you during its brief window of availability.  We're dedicated to security here at Coinbase, and just released some alternative security updates.  If you are interested in learning about them, please see our latest blog post.
If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks for being with us!

Coinbase is probably the most seamless then.
withdraw or deposit takes 3 or 4 days.
deposits get faster once you've verified your acct.
you get paid at today's rate when you sell coins but the delay comes from ACH transfers to your checking acct taking a while.
make sure you enable two factor authentication and disable API access.

If you're going to buy more than $100 worth, make paper wallets.

The problem is that an API key circumvents 2FA.

I was using Virgin Mobile, but they're about to launch data packages which stomp all over net neutrality. I'll probably be switching to ringplus really soon. I activated one of my old phones to test drive it. Coverage is the same as Virgin Mobile and they have some really geeky features including full network API access. you could make your own apps to forward calls, swap ESNs, and more.
Since Sprint owns VirginMobileUSA; which is working to subvert Net Neutrality, I kinda wish that ringplus didn't use sprint's network at all.
at the same time, I can't think of any first tier phone company that actually supports net neutrality. Ringplus coverage is good in my area and they accept BTC so it's clearly the lesser evil. 
Also, Ringplus doesn't seem to sell phones directly, but encourages you to use an old sprint phone.
Probably the best phone possible right now is an unlocked nexus5 which is $299 directly from google. (you have to get it from google, a sprint nexus5 won't activate).
They claim that they won't activate VirginMobile phones but my old phone slipped through the cracks. I suspect that since I had it replaced under warranty, Virgin sent me a universal Sprint phone back.
additionally, any LTE phone you get will require a sprint LTE SIM card.  ting will sell them to anyone and they work with ringplus, or you might be able to get one from your local sprint store but be ready to explain why you need it, and dumb it down for them to understand.

A member of my family and their spouse are way into cryonics. They go to meetings. conventions in other states. they go to meet the people they'll supposedly know once they're unfrozen.
It all feels almost like a religion and very scammy.
Basically they have you take out a life insurance policy to pay for the popsicle club dues with no assurance that you can ever be unfrozen or that they won't go bankrupt and you'll rot in a warm stainless steel flask in a warehouse somewhere.
you wear a silver medical bracelet all the time, forever, to let paramedics know that you're supposed to be packed in ice upon your death and then they have a phone number to call for further instruction. Hospitals aren't really equipped to prepare people for cryonic suspension
good luck.

I'd rather leave my assets to surviving family members than tie them up in a rube goldberg machine that probably doesn't work, and if it does you'll probably come back to be Nixon's head in-a-jar from Futurama.  No thank you.

My credit union is [SELCO.org]( but you might not be eligible to join unless you live in Oregon, or at least have SOME family members in Oregon.
Each credit union has their own charter and requirements for who can join. They make the rules so they can better serve their members and invest in their local communities, so you really should find a LOCAL credit union.
In most cases just living in the same city or county as their branch makes you eligible.
Also, you say you're overseas, Are you serving in the military?
There are lots of good credit unions which cater specifically to current and former armed forces.

I'd like this to happen too for the free publicity, but it will never ever happen.
They're not giving out gold just for a laugh.
The promotion is intrinsic to their brand, and their name.
The name DORITOS comes from the spanish word '***dorado***' which actually means ***golden***.

This is hardly a bitcoin copycat.
Bitcoin's success at retail POS terminals in the first world is barely even necessary.
Internet commerce, B2B transactions, replacing paper check or ACH transfers and doing international remittance are some of bitcoin's strengths.  A point-of-sale terminal and a Best Buy app isn't as strong as a robust PROTOCOL.
If anything, It shows that some people are starting to trust Cryptography and their smartphones to make payments more than they trust businesses having access to their credit card number.

feel free to private message me any other questions if they come up, and good luck to you in your trading. (or holding).
I'm pretty far from an expert but happy I'm happy to share what I know.
also I would not make any large purchases until you have instant transfers verified/allowed/available on your coinbase account. It takes a few extra days but if the price goes crazy the day after you buy you'll be happy that you can act on it.
I bought my first coin at $850 during the first throwes of the last crash, the bull trap where it went from $1300 to $850.  The next few days it recovered to over 1100 before crashing again when I finally got my coins.
I held through all of it and did okay in the end, but I could have done much better.
wait until you get instant transfers available before making any larger buys.

Yes, torrents.
I suppose the pirated releases aren't generally considered secure by safety conscious cryptogeek standards, but it's WINDOWS we're talking about anyway.
There are MD5 hashes available for all the official DVD isos.
Microsoft doesn't publish these hashes, but someone has gone to the effort of verifying them against physical copies.  I suppose I just trust the consensus on this. 
I've never bothered to verify an MD5 against an operating system torrent.
If I ever did, it would probably be a high security system running something other than Windows.
The biggest leap of faith is probably whatever tool I download to bypass WGA, but it's never been an issue.

Gox is such a piece of crap. I don't even really see why they're mentioned so often.
I wish I knew about Coinbase way back in May.  I almost bought coins at MtGox for around $100 each but the signup process was so convoluted and $100 seemed like a lot of money for bitcoins back then.
I never finished signing up and kinda forgot about bitcoin for a while.
fast forward a few months and Bitcoin broke $1300 each. I was kicking myself for not studying it more back then. The price today is less than $900 now and it was nearly $1000 a few days ago. There is almost certainty that we'll be back over $1000 this year and never coming back down.
There's been talk that we're all going to the moon sometime after that.
Seriously. Investing in anything is risky and I'm not going to promise you'll become a millionaire or even that you won't lose money but it couldn't be any easier to TRY.

Mycellium wallet is quite good and I'd feel safe carrying $20 to $100 on my phone with private keys at all times with it.
for anything more than that, I trust a mycellium wallet paper backup.  Bitaddress.org printable wallets are good too; although something like a trezor hardware wallet would be the best choice since it's a separate tamper proof device which actually signs and authors the bitcoin transaction separately without your private keys ever being exposed to even the device you're using to send your bitcoin transaction to the internet.
Even if you get a hardware wallet though, It's important to keep a want to keep a copy on paper somewhere else in case the hardware wallet dies in a house fire or falls into the ocean.
Paper wallets can be encrypted with BIP38 as well.  somebody else can probably explain it better than I can, but the gist of it is that you can have an encrypted paper wallet in your living room and robbers could come in and steal the paper but they would never be able to get your bitcoins without also having the wallet's password which you would keep off-site somewhere else.

Hardware wallets are very simple computers to hold your Bitcoin private keys and sign transactions.  The point is, even if your computer, phone, or Windows is infested with malware, your bitcoins arent on it. Your private key is never even in RAM of the computer sending the transaction, the trezor authors the whole transaction, confirms the send address on it's own screen and and then sends the pre signed and unchangeable transaction to the computer to be put on the blockchain as is.
Hardware wallets can also be encrypted so that if someone else steals your wallet they can't access your funds. A wallet passphrase that you generate on your wallet and write on paper can be used to regenerate your private keys if your wallet is lost or stolen.
If you hold a lot of Bitcoin it makes sense get a hardware wallet. I'm careful about my computer's security but I don't trust that much money on an internet connected device that I almost never turn off.

This isn't an ethereum problem or a bitcoin problem.
This is a reddit problem.
Just like some subs don't allow posts from low-score or zero score new accounts, reddit needs a spam filtering option to block PMs from low-score new accounts.
This very same script could be used to sell sketchy diet pills in or any number of different spammy things.
Reddit needs to fix this.

Old hardware is really neat, but this is far from a good method of cold storage.
Granted, the USA's nuclear launch codes are still stored on 8" IBM 33FD floppy disks; but in their case, physical security is more carefully guarded than using good encryption.
Once somebody has physical access to your old hardware all that's stopping them from getting your data (or bitcoins, or missiles) is the level of encryption you've used and that has gotten much better in the past 30 years.
Security-by-obscurity is neat, but I'd rather not trust it.

It seems all the development is going towards monetizing the app rather than improving it; and it could really use some improvements.

In the US, persons under 18 years old cannot grant consent to enter into some types of contracts. 
*edit-- they CAN consent to contracts, but in some cases those contracts aren't enforceable.*
one possible example would be that the Coinbase terms of service probably state somewhere that a bitcoin may lose or gain value but a minor's bitcoin purchases may be legally reversible if they were to claim in court that they did not understand the risks of investing.
for this reason, some money service businesses simply choose not to offer their service to minors.

with app-based wallets, your private key is stored on your phone and could be stolen with the perfect storm of malware. 
It's still unlikely, but not impossible. and the threat grows every day as the value climbs.
Hardware wallets store your private keys away from the internet and have their own CPU to sign and export transactions. When you create a transaction with a hardware wallet, your PC/phone never even has your private keys in RAM, so your coins can't be stolen.

Bitcoin and XBMC!  two of my favorite things.
I've been using XBMC (kodi, whatever)  since it was XBMP on the first gen xbox.  it's grown more and more useful all the time.
I currently run kodi on two low-end ITX systems built as media centers. They only use about 19watts and play any video I want, even 1080p.
everything in the backend is linux (openelec), and they're extremely stable and quick!
If my movie file server is asleep, kodi can send a WakeOnLan request and turn it on from my remote!  That's just one neat feature.
So many options for customization and I don't even have to get dirty with a ssh prompt unless I want to.
I've since added SickBeard and SabNZBd to download and categorize shows automatically. Now I can just name any TV show, type it into sickbeard, and it will create a folder and fill it with all episodes of that show in any quality I want, along with all the correct metadata and episode info, without interaction.  I just tell it what I want to watch and it does the rest. saved on my 6TB file server forever.
It's a much better user experience than Cable+DVR!

I have an $8 transfer to poloniex with a 40 cent (5%) fee stuck since yesterday morning.  
Lots of money flowing from alts to BTC and back right now.
The fee market does work, but I wish small transactions were cheaper.
That said, I'm not in a big hurry so I'll just keep waiting.
That same day I also moved $5000 for a $1.15 fee and it confirmed within 20 minutes. 
I think there's just a huge surge of genuine usage right now.  usually when spammers try to jam the mempool you can still get confirmed by paying a reasonable fee.

    13     Highlighted Provisions:
    
    14          This resolution:
    
    15          ▸     encourages the expanded use of bitcoin in the state;
    
    16          ▸     proposes the creation of the Council on Payment Options for State Services to study
    
    17     whether and how the state could accept bitcoin as a valid form of payment;
    
    18          ▸     proposes that certain persons be a part of the council;
    
    19          ▸     encourages the council to study certain issues; and
    
    20          ▸     encourages the council to share its findings.
    
    21     Special Clauses:
    
    22          None
    
    23     
    24     Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah, the Governor concurring therein:
    
    25          WHEREAS, the state of Utah was founded upon the principles of industry and
    
    26     entrepreneurialism;
    
    27          WHEREAS, technological industries, including industries in emerging technologies,
    
    28     play an increasingly important role in Utah's economy and culture;
    
    29          WHEREAS, the state must remain open to new technologies and ideas to continue
    
    30     attracting talented and educated entrepreneurs to the state;
    
    31          WHEREAS, publicly released in 2009, bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital
    
    32     currency and may hold promising benefits for individuals, communities, and the state;
    
    33          WHEREAS, bitcoin is based on the principles of free-market capitalism and is not
    
    34     centrally regulated;
    
    35          WHEREAS, bitcoin provides merchants with an attractive alternative mechanism for
    
    36     accepting payment because transaction fees for bitcoin are generally much lower than those
    
    37     imposed by other payment processors;
    
    38          WHEREAS, many major companies now accept bitcoin as a valid form of payment,
    
    39     including Utah-based Overstock.com; and
    
    40          WHEREAS, the worldwide market capitalization of bitcoin is valued at about $3.3
    
    41     billion US Dollars:

    43     the Governor concurring therein, recognizes the potential benefits that could come from the
    
    44     expanded use of bitcoin in the state and recognizes that the state could be a key player in
    
    45     promoting the use of bitcoin.
    
    46          BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature and the Governor propose the
    
    47     creation of the Council on Payment Options for State Services to study whether and how the

    52     Commission, Ĥ→ the Department of Technology Services, ←Ĥ subdivisions of the government
    
    _52a     that could viably accept payments from citizens
    
    53     in the form of bitcoin, private entities that accept payment in the form of bitcoin, local

    58          BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature and the Governor encourage the
    
    59     council to identify any state or federal statutes, rules, regulations, or policies that would affect
    
    60     the state's ability to implement and operate a system by which the state could utilize bitcoin as
    
    61     a valid form of payment.
    
    62          BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature and the Governor encourage the
    
    63     council to study how the state could minimize its exposure to risk if it accepted payment in the
    
    64     form of bitcoin.
    
    65          BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature and the Governor encourage the
    
    66     council to share its findings, including recommendations, with the Legislature and the

I agree that it's unlikely they could crack SHA256, but it's mostly accepted that quantum processors could break ECDSA, the elliptic curve digital signing algorithm.
The threat of ECDSA failing would allow an attacker to derive the private key from a public key, but they would need more than just the wallet address, since the wallet address is merely a hash of the actual public key.
If we're talking about LOST coins sitting in fresh addresses that were never spent from, or even if they only spent from once then there isn't enough examples of the address's signature to reconstruct the full public key that a quantum attacker able to break ECDSA would need in order to derive the full public key.  **Lost coins would actually be safer than wallets that sign multiple transactions** because with no other outputs, the full public key might not be obtainable to an attacker.

I'm currently selling premium shares of bitcorn for $7 a share. BTC accepted.

I like to use bitcoinity.org/markets for charts.
to show the value of my cold wallets I just have the public keys loaded into mycellium on android.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:43:21
the hardware wallet stores the private keys. When you want to make a transaction, the transaction is sent to the hardware wallet, signed with a hash of the private key, then the signed transaction gets sent back to the host computer to be sent to the blockchain
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:44:52
I've been telling people to buy since 2013,  business as usual over here. my bookmark to the bitcoinity charts still has the price at $387/btc.

there was one on ebay which sold for over $7000 a few days ago.
not sure if it was the misprint edition or not, but that's likely worth more.
I'd hang onto it though if I were you, and not just because it would be foolish to sell a funded physical bitcoin for paypal with "ebay buyer protection."
Even if bitcoin drops to zero it will likely have some numismatic value. you should consider having it graded and encapsulated even if you don't plan on selling immediately.
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:53:55
ehh it's gonna take more than a bunch of $10 buys to pump the price.

I just made my first 1BTC purchase on coinbase last night, right while everything was happening.
I was lucky enough to check the ticker and then watch it for about 20min and got in at $854 with fees.
For an automated buy, it sounds like you did very well,
I might give it a try.
I'm pretty ultra paranoid though since a close friend of my brother had his account hacked a few years back. he was running a computer with spyware and lost 354 BTC!
I only do trading when booted to an ubuntu liveCD now.

just to be clear, if you get a trezor and it comes with seed words on paper you shouldn't trust those seed words.  part of the setup process is generating a new seed using authentic firmware. If the seed words come preprinted it's likely that whoever sold you the trezor might already have access;  only trust seed words that you've generated yourself with authentic firmware and written down from the trezor screen. it only shows the seed words once.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:35:52
grading services? I'm not really sure how all that works to the level that I could suggest a particular company. A coin show perhaps?
You should also be careful who you allow to handle your funded coin, because the key is under the sticker and anybody who copies that code can steal the coin attached.
your local stamp and coin shop might know about getting it graded, or at least they would have the regular plastic snap together coin cases or a windowed cardboard case.  don't let anybody handle the coin out of your eyesight.

It seems like there would be potential of static electricity which isn't very nice to bare boards or expensive mining rigs.

I think there is a better alternate coinbase android app with advanced trading features that can do it.
I'm a little bit spooked about installing it though since it isn't the official app.

I think this is still important for anyone who has a financial stake in BTC;  Even if they aren't involved in mining.  Less coins being mined = less supply = moon?

I should have clarafied.. I don't think you can run THAT app off a CD, because its an android app.
right now I'm trading within my browser, on a desktop running from a live CD.
The live-CDs are pretty fool proof. just throw it in your drive and boot from it they usually load drivers for almost anything without any intervention.  My laptop doesn't like to have working wifi on the liveCD which is probably a linux compatibility issue but everything else works fine on quite a few computers I've used them on over the years.
setup is pretty much download the ISO CD Image and burn it, then boot.
