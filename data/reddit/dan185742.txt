Have you tried Ninki Wallet? It has simple sign-up and available on iOS and Android.

The new mobile version has a much simpler sign-up, the original sign-up process was a nightmare but has recently been stream-lined.

You should choose Ninki Wallet. It's available on Android and iOS, the sign-up process requires only a username and 4-digit pin to be entered (takes 30 seconds), the wallet is extremely easy to use, plus it has multi-signature with spending limits.

I agree, in my opinion this is the most obvious user case for bitcoin that is likely to take off in a meaningful way in the short to near term

For those people who were kind enough to connect me as one of their contacts in Ninki Wallet, please post your validation phrase below and I can validate you and send a small BTC tip.

You create your own network from within the wallet. Once you have set-up an account you can link contacts. 
If you want to try out the network feature try adding me, ninkidan as a contact. Once linked there is a final validation step, you can validate me using my validation phrase...
"brush prize goose catch uphold scrap razor safe spawn palace vault loud crime cloth cage"
(exclude the quotes when validating)
Your validation phrase is under your avator image. If you post here I can validate you and send you a tip
