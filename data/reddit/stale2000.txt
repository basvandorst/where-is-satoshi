Losing hashpower means that 51% attacks become easier.  For example, lets say that for some strange reason, 99% of the hashpower leaves the main bitcoin network, but price remains the same.
That means, that I can come along and spend a couple thousand dollars to double spend, via 51% attacks.
@_date: 2017-02-13 01:06:31
Bigger blocker over here.  I can confirm that this would chill me out until at least 2024.
But this is still kinda missing the point.  The point that needs to be recognized is that by 2030, the world's bandwidth capacity will have massively increased.  It will have increased so much that a 2MB hard fork, should be undeniably safe.
Immediate capacity is nice, but the fear that big blockers have is that we will stay at 1mb forever, even as technology gets better, and all the concerns that small blockers have are rendered null and void by tech progress.
@_date: 2017-02-07 05:52:50
Trust matters because people are creating proposals in bad faith.
If you create a "blocksize increase" hard fork that actually decreases the block size by 70%, then you are a malicious actor, and your opinions shouldn't be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:14:54
And what I am saying is,  is that these people DO have code.  
The coinbase people most support bigger blocks, and their company has produced lots of code for their bitcoin company. 
Miners write code for their mining Operations. Wallet developers write wallet code.  And many of these developers have put out support for both sides of the debate. 
And there are a lot more bitcoin developers in the world than just the very small group of 20  or so people who contribute to the singular github repo known as bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:52:38
Thats how open source works.  If core writes code, then any other person in the world can use that same code, and have code that is just as good as core's code.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:25:41
lol,  even the core team wants to increase the block size.  They just want to do the hardfork in 2024, not 2017.
So yes,  if there is a hardfork, supported by core,  that is still bitcoin. 
Also,  we had 32 mb blocks in the ORIGINAL bitcoin blockchain. So we would be just taking bitcoin back to its original vision. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:26:50
Then go to real life meetups. I do it all the time in San Francisco.
And I can tell you that this whole debate is far from settled. There are lots of people,  that I meet in real life,  on both sides of the debate. 
Or if that is not possible,  look at the opinions of major stake holders,  such as coinbase employees,  or other real life people working in the bitcoin industry.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:08:51
Yes,  and transaction malleability can be fixed........  as soon as a hard fork happens to 2mb. 
You still need miner approval either way. 
Unless there is a way to fix it without a soft fork? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:38:59
it needs 95% to pass.  And currently 74%  are saying "no segwit".
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:58:44
Even Lukejr supports a 2MB hardfork (He wrote blocksize hardfork code!!), as do the majority of core developers.  Segwit increases the blocksize to 4MB (via soft fork).
There is just disagreements about WHEN a 2mb hard fork will happen.  But nobody thinks that it isn't going to happen eventually.  It is all just arguments about the date.  Bigger blockers want yesterday, and "small blockers" like lukejr want 2024 as the 2mb hardfork date.
This is because even the lightning network is going to need bigger blocks for it to work properly.
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:55:27
Nobody would be fired.  Core devs can continue to write whatever code they want, and the community will use it.  
Thats how open source works.
They will just ALSO be running on 2MB when a fork happens.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:54:41
Bitmain is against segwit.  The CEO frequently and publicly comes out against it.
That doesn't mean that he is pro-BU though.  BU has its own problems.
Bitmain wants segwit AND a 2MB hardfork, and is unwilling to deploy segwit if it is not packaged with a 2mb hardfork.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:34:04
the core developers are just people.  
They write code,  and the economic majority decides if it is valid. 
If the economic majority decide to not implement something then none of the opinions of the core team matter. 
The economic majority can decide or not decide to do something any time they want, and nobody can stop them,  no matter what some Core contributors to a random github account say.

@_date: 2017-02-07 19:52:27
Exactly. They are not obligated to do anything. 
And by the same token,  miners aren't obligated to implement their changes. 
Since this is the reality,  I guess nobody is going to get what they want. No big blocks and no segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:38:58
Nobody is going to deploy BU without consensus.  But the same is true for segwit.
The big blockers have been yelling for years, and most have given up any hope for compromise.  Nothing is going to change if Core doesn't budge.
And because nothing is going to happen, the big blockers may as well just stall and refuse to implement any other improvements, such as segwit.
We'll see if Core changes their mind once THEIR changes have been stalled for years.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:55:09
This is exactly why a fork isn't going to happen until Core changes its mind.
It is clear that they will go nuclear if they don't get their way.  So the only solution is to withhold segwit, and prevent them from making any changes until they change their mind.
All we have to do is make sure nobody gets what they want and wait until Core caves.  Their tune will change once they realize that their lightning network is going to be prevented.
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:17:34
No,  let's just keep status quo until we are certain of everything. No big blocks,  AND no seg wit. That way nobody gets what they want until consensus is achieved.

If Core wants to merge in a 2 MB fork from BU or classic or anyone else, I am sure that everyone would be happy for them to do so.
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:56:44
Yes, there is Consensus.  And the Consensus of the vast vast majority of the bitcoin economy and ecosystem is that we should increase the blocksize.
Maybe the Core team should actually, you know, go along with the Consensus.
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:47:00
Yeah, I think what he was measuring is the chance of, immediately after the fork, the 1MB chain "beating" the classic chain by being a single block ahead of it (but only temporarily, as the more blocks that get mine, the more unlikely it is that 1MB stays ahead).
@_date: 2016-03-07 04:32:58
Whats wrong with increasing the node count?  The more nodes that exist, the more that the network is protected from DDoSs.  And a validating node is a validating node.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:16:20
But the problem is that no one trusts you guys right now.  If you don't commit to something, then nobody is going to actually believe you.
CORE developers suggested a 2-4-8 increase months ago, because at the time, it was the "compromise", but not it is clear that that was all double speak stalling tactics.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:09:56
Which is why we are hardforking, pb1x.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:05:45
OK,  how about this. No hardfork, but ALSO no segwit.
That way nobody gets what they want until both sides come together. 
Miners cannot be forced to implement the softfork. The soft fork is EQUALLY contentious, and as you just stated,  we shouldn't be doing contentious forks. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 18:00:36
First of all, do you really believe a 30% attack is realistic?  There is maybe 1 miner who could do that.You have to ask yourself the question "Do I believe this one miner is going to do this".
Secondly, you understand that nodes are run by people, right?  
We aren't beholden to a rigid set of rules. The blockchain voting isn't something that everyone is FORCED to hold to.  If people believe that one of the miners is faking support, this can be handled by ignoring their vote, or with other ways.  EX: we can just go back to normal voting, and agreeing formally to do something like "we will move to big blocks on this date".  
And if a miner really does act in such a bad faith manner, this miner can be retaliated against.  Users can move away from their pool.  Or more extreme measures can be taken.  We can orphan their blocks.  If a miner acts in such a terrible way, they are DONE FOR.  Dead. Game over.
Also, there isn't going to be anything contentious.  If one side really does have 75% support, the other side will quickly follow.  They aren't going to throw money away.  Or if support is faked in some way, the Classic side will just move back to main chain and try again later.  Two chains will NOT exist at the same time.  It will all be settled within the first hour of the hardfork.  If it works it works, if it doesn't then people just go back, and they have only lost around 10k in monetary damages.

@_date: 2016-03-01 03:32:05
You don't have to incorporate anything.  If 75% agree to hardfork  , then the hard fork will happen (hardfork won't happen, with &lt;75%, so there is no risk to pro-hardforkers), and everyone who wants to stay on the "main" chain with the &lt;1% hashpower are free to do so.  If they don't care about the much greater chance at a 51% attack, they are free to stay.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:11:08
Then I guess we are going to stay with the status quo, and that is fine by me. 
I'd rather have a status quo where nobody can do anything, as opposed a world where a singular anointed group is allowed to dictate all changes.

So you are saying you need 2.2 mb for 2mb of capacity?  That is still less efficient.  
Worst case is 4mb, according to the bitcoin core FAQ.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:21:11
No it is not.  That is called a soft fork.
Miners could soft fork the soft fork. 
Segwit would no longer be valid. 
Although,  the other argument is that soft forks are 51% attacks and vice versa.
But let's be clear that this is basically the same as a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-03-31 00:38:26
Well you have nothing to worry about then. Classic won't activate without large amounts of support. If any miner wants to have more support, they can just withhold support until consensus is "overwhelming". So no need to worry. Classic will never trigger without overwhelming consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:03:05
Not if core merges a 2MB hardfork. 
That has always been the goal. Not to switch to BU,  but to pressure core into merging 2MB hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:37:54
Majority of nodes means nothing.  I can spin up a hundred nodes in under an hour, for a reasonable cost.
Also,  miners can just soft fork the soft fork,  using only majority hash power,  and censor all segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:40:44
Read back on the posts from then. 
Bitcoin classic was ALWAYS about 2 MB HF AND segwit.
What do you think the Hong Kong consensus was about? It was explicitly calling for classic/2MB HF AND segwit. It was never "we support 2MB soft fork".
Nobody was ever against implementing the segwit blocksize increase AFTER classic HF.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:10:16
They don't have to 'know' 100%.  But at the very least there could be some open discussion about it.  Even if it is purely subjective.
You can make estimates.  You can talk about data.  You can said what you'd need to see on the network to consider further increases to be safe.  You can talk about future network improvements, which don't exist now, that would allow for these changes.
Or in other words, you could plan and discuss for the eventuality of a second blocksize increase, in the same way that we discuss other possible changes about bitcoin all the time.
If you admit that it is going to happen eventually, then there is no reason to not discuss future changes, and discuss what information we have available now.
EX: imagine that there is a network improvement that is coming down the pipe that will make the network twice as efficient.  You could join together a future blocksize increase to the release of this network improvement, because if blocksize doubles, and the network gets twice as efficient, then by definition, you end up in the same place you are in today.
Or, you could just release code to the flexcap that was promised in the roadmap, and have a discussion about that.

Nullc, what you are missing is that, unfortunately for Core, they have lost the propaganda war.
Even if you don't believe that Core owes anyone an apology for censorship done on reddit by other people, from a tactical perspective, it still makes sense for Core to clearly denounce it.
Lose a small battle now, to potentially win the larger battle later on.  
The "stakes" of apologizing for, and denouncing censorship done by other people, are very low.  You give up nothing, but gain a large PR victory.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:25:19
No.  The solution is to just prevent all changes until comprise happens. 
No hardfork AND no segwit.
75% of miners don't want segwit right now. It is the definition of a contentious change. So we don't implement it until everyone agrees. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:33:59
I am a big blocker myself,  but this meme needs to die. 
Sure,  2 years ago there was something that could be called "censorship". 
But credit where credit is due,  theymos has completely stopped doing that.  You are free to support big blocks as much as you want here,  as long as you are respectful.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:50:22
Sure. If you don't care about exchanges refusing to list your altcoin, and refusing to support coin splitting into 2 different forks, which they have already stated is what they will do, then go ahead and exit with a POW change or something. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:40:47
If that is the case, then we have nothing to worry about.  Hostile/contentious hardforks are no danger at all, and will not cause any chain splits, or bitcoin doubling, and everyone who was freaking out about them are wrong.
Either hardforks/contentious softforks are dangerous or they are not.  Both are equally dangerous/not dangerous.
My point is, that a UASF ALSO requires the same level of support.  If it is contentious, then it will not work (Or it will work, if you are a believer that contentious hardforks also work).
There is a large minority of people who are not in favor of segwit, and they have enough economic power that they would buy the original chain, and not follow the softfork.  You do not need JUST the majority.  You need everybody.  Because if 30% stay on the original chain, then the original chain will just have 30% of the value, but it is perfectly possibly for there to be 2 chains, with 2 different values, if a contentious fork happens(soft or hard!).
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:10:33
The difference is that the blocksize increase hardfork was NEVER going to activate, without &gt;50% of hashpower.  
Big blockers will agree with this article, that hardforking without majority hashpower is absolutely insane.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:34:30
There is a third option. And that is to soft fork the soft fork, and prevent all segwit transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:51:55
I've read the Core scaling outline,  and I am aware that it gives an outline "generally"  of a data driven approach to an eventual hardfork. It does not lay out any specifics of what this approach is,  though.
My issue is that I am worried that this "data driven" approach will just result in a post hoc debate where everyone just uses whatever data results from this "investigation" to support whatever previous side they supported. 
Great!  Let's be data driven. But let's define ahead of time what "safe" and "unsafe" means,  and make falsifiable statements. 
That way,  if you define ahead of time what is safe,  and what evidence you would require to support a hard fork then if that future comes to pass,  I can take that evidence to you and say "you said you would support it if this happens,  and it happened!  No changing your mind now! ".
I want people to commit/make predictions.  Or at the very least,  I want people to look like idiots when they inevitably go back on their commitments/predictions.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:18:13
Also,  even ignoring the node count argument. 97% core does NOT mean "supports POW change" or "supports UASF".
Even using your own metric,  it does not support your argument.
Do the same thing,  but have a voting/signal mechanism where nodes can vote for POW and UASF.  At least that is a little bit of evidence.
What we have now is a bunch of nodes who support miners.  Segwit is defined as "we will only fork if miners signal it". That's what the code does.  It does not UASF.
A vote for Core /segwit is a vote for allowing miners to decide.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:03:04
And this, ladies and gentleman, is why SegWit is never going to activate.  
Thank god bitcoin is resistant to contentious changes.

"The ability of someone controlling a majority of network hash rate to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from confirming."
Emphasis on  "prevent new transactions from confirming.".
If you do not know how a 51% attack works, I am not sure what to tell you.  Unless you have some reason to think a 51% attack couldn't be done on segwit transactions.  Are you asserting that it is impossible to do a 51% attack against segwit transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:05:02
Core can fork to 2MB, and that would still be Bitcoin. 
Or if the economic majority decides to do it.

Please don't use that link.
That is just a link that shows people who have implemented code, in case segwit happens.
OF COURSE an exchange or wallet will implement segwit.  If that is where the market is going, they aren't going to be left behind.
Come back to me with a list of people who actually say "I support segwit over a 2 MB hardfork".  Or "I will not follow a 2MB hardfork, even if the miners and the market are following it".
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:41:34
Segwit will not be implemented.  It requires 95%.  Why would the big blockers give Core anything that they want?  At this point, we may as well just stall all future changes until Core gets mad enough to realize their mistakes.

" In order to split the chain the miners would have to deliberately create invalid block"
This is valid bitcoin behavior.
So one person would mine a block, a valid bitcoin block, and other nodes might follow.
It does not have to be a deliberate attack by ALL the miners.
All that has to happen is a SINGLE miner mines a SINGLE malicious.

Sure.  And the onus is on you, or the economic majority, to demonstrate this fact.  
If people do not have a specific, measurable, way of defining what this consensus is, then the assumption should be that they do not have consensus.
Bitcoin is to important to guess about.  People need to prove that they have the economic majority.  Anything else is way to risky.
I have no idea what the economic majority is, because that is such a nebulous question.  But I am open to people presenting me with facts that support this conclusion.  But so far, basically nobody has provided any facts at all that support this conclusion.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:37:40
Nor are they supporting it.  They have given no opinion.  And if we are going to make changes to the bitcoin protocol, as drastic as a UASF, then we absolutely NEED core's support.  
So a UASF does not have Core's support, by the fact that they have not stated any opinion on it at all, and have neither supported nor denounced it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:49:14

Let's just implement that in Core and get on with our lives. If that happened,  consensus would form overnight

Ehh, bitcoin has been doing fine.  It continues to work.  And it will continue to work, even if we freeze the protocol to what is is now.

@_date: 2017-03-16 18:13:44
Ok, but the burden of proof is on Core to show that they have the support of the community.
They do not have it though.  Just look at this subreddit.  Segwit does not have consensus.  If it did, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:10:32
Well, it doesn't make it easier.  The argument though is that the network is more ready for it.  
Blocksize increases cost to nodes.  Personally I'm in favor of a HF right now, but other people want to delay it until technology gets better, and it is cheaper to run a node.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:11:07

Deploying segwit does the same thing. 
You are depriving me of my valid bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:20:20
That's only if exchanges support a UASF. 
None have said this. They are antiBU but NOT pro UASF,  yet. (prove me wrong and provide me with a tweet or statement FROM an exchange)
A segwit invalid block is still valid to the exchanges, as of this moment.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:43:42
No. They have coded their software to allow for segwit to happen. Because they are businesses and will follow the market. 
They have NOT supported something insanely crazy like a UASF. They are wildly different.
Collect the same list of people saying "yes we will go against the majority hashpower to activate this softfork" and THEN you will have economic majority. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:17:09
Could we also make it so it has the ability to reject segwit transactions?
I want the power to be put back into the hands of wallet developers,  so they can choose whether or not to allow segwit to happen.
Segwit does not have 100% support, so defensive measures need to be taken.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:57:40
sure, but miners can just soft fork segwit, and nothing anybody can do can stop this if they have majority. Not hardfork. Soft fork to prevent segwit 
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:05:05
Nobody is going to do a contentious hardfork.  Nor are they going to do a contentious soft fork.
We are just going to have status quo for the next year, until people compromise.
I'd rather have bitcoin frozen in time forever than have changes be made without consensus.  And right now, neither sides of the debate have consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:17:46
But,  you COULD do a 1 line change,  and this would get everything that people wanted. 
As I stated in the exact line that you quoted,  This is not what BU is doing,  but the one line change is the main thing that everyone wants.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:38:51
If the problem is really about it being a hardfork, then you don't have to worry.  You can do basically anything with a soft fork if you hack it enough (including really crazy stuff like adding an additional POW algorithm).  
We could do 8MB blocksize increase using extension blocks SF, if we wanted.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:28:06
The transactions have not doubled,  but the fact is that 4mb maximum is sent over the network that only includes  2mb of transaction  capacity.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:57:31
What are you so afraid of? 
Lets let the community decide.
Or is that what you are afraid of?  That you are massively on the wrong side of the community?
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:36:14
Miners can just soft fork the soft fork. 
Sure,  they cannot force a hardfork. But if 51% of miners choose to censor all segwit transactions,  there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. 
What are you going to do?  Make mining empty blocks invalid? Require a minimum block size? 
Once 51% decide to do something,  it is awefully hard to stop it,  with all the attack vectors that opens up.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:39:34
Uhh, if tens of thousand of dollars are on the line, and I am an anonymous person on the internet who can get away with it, yeah maybe.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:29:51
I guess my point is that a User Activated Soft Fork, is effectively the same thing as the "federated consensus" that you brought up. 
So either federated consensuses work, or they don't.  And if they work, then we don't need miners at all.  And if they don't work, then it isn't possible to do a User Activated Soft Fork.
Although, I guess maybe the hybrid approach is a valid argument?
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:27:52
That's not the same as supporting something as crazy as a UASF or POW change. 
Let's wait for exchanged to give EXPLICIT support for these things before talking about economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:12:03
We can still discuss a potential hard fork right now.
If the everyone is so intent on the Hong Kong agreement, then how about someone create this Hong Kong hard fork code right now and lets discuss it and lets pick a date for when we want to merge it to master in Core.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:40:55
These are people who have made their software ready for segwit. NOT people who support a UASF, and will enforce it. These are two,  wildly different things. 
All these companies have said "we will follow the market", so of course they will code their software to accept any possible outcome.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:40:12
Users matter. It is the economic majority that decides what bitcoin is. Not a single development group or reddit admin. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:14:58
I wasn't asking about the miner's opinion.  I was asking about the opinion of the economic majority.
Let's try and measure that first,  BEFORE going through with these contentious changes. 
That's all I want.  Just some actual proof that the economic majority supports this. But so far,  I have seen zero evidence that this is the case. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:00:28
Look,  if you have a different method of forming consensus, then how about you define it yourself. It has to measurable.
And we will use this metric to determine consensus on BOTH BU And segwit.
If this metric shows consensus for neither,  then we should deploy neither. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:30:25
not true. 
If a chain only has 1-2%, then anybody can just come along and mime empty blocks for days, or reorder the transaction list. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:06:05
Because most companies don't care,  that's why. They don't support either side,  so they will fix their code to make it work.
Companies will just follow the market,  so of course they are fixing their code,  so that they don't get left behind. They are out to make money,  and getting left behind means that they will lose money.
There is no evidence that companies have chosen either side, or will go against either side.  If core merged a 2 MB hardfork,  I am sure that coinbase and everyone else would list it as BTC.
If you have evidence of all these major companies saying "I do not support 2MB, I only support segwit, even if the majority hashpower goes for 2MB, I will stay on the minority  chain ", then feel free to post it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:35:58
That's the stupid way to attack it.  The safe way to attack segwit is to just soft fork the soft fork,  and prevent all segwit transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:38:36
Negotiation power.  If we don't force 4 MB now,  it is difficult to believe that Core will ever blocksize increase again. 
There are still things that Core could do to convince me that they are actually willing to do this in the future,  though. 
For example,  they could put a date on the scaling roadmap that's says "double blocksize in 2020. We are confirmed doing this".
Or they could merge code to master that only activates by 2020. 
They can pick whatever date they want.  But in order for me to trust them,  they need to commit to a date,  and merge code into master. 
Before then,  I'm in favor of just stalling to force core to cave,  and allowing the community to decide.
But right now I think that Core is just going to continue to speak out of both sides of their mouth without merging code to master that allows the community to decide.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:52:38
It says so on the bitcoin core segwit FAQ that I linked. 
"The current proposal for soft fork segregated witness (segwit) counts each byte in a witness as 0.25 bytes towards the maximum block size limit, meaning the maximum size of a block is just under 4MB."
4MB is worst case.  But even better cases is not 1 for 1.  It could still be 3mb, for 2mb of transactions, but it is never 2 MB for 2MB of capacity.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:30:31
Sure,  but then we also have to remember that they are not in charge. 
The community is in charge. Core makes suggestions and the community can choose to take those suggestions or ignore them. 
Right now,  the community is taking the action of ignoring their suggested change of segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:05:56
There is no activation date for BU. 
If some miners fake signal,  people will know.  And they will just NOT fork. 
We are not locked in to code. An attack can be ignored.

The bigblockers want 2.1 segwit PLUS 2 MB HF. 
I forgot that I have to include that line in every single post I make,  because otherwise for some strange reason  people will think I wasn't implying segwit AND 2MB HF (even though nobody ever argues for only 2MB.)
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:24:04
Nodes that do not upgrade to UASF absolutely DO see these blocks and believe them to be valid. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:23:12
Nobody is going to actually run BU.  They just want Core to merge in a 2MB HF + segwit change to master.
Also, the developers are not in charge.  Developers make suggestions.  Even if it wasn't a buggy mess, BU would never be in charge, in the same way that Core is not in charge.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:51:54
And what if miners respond by soft forking the soft fork?  With majority hashpower you can just orphan all segwit transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:54:23
You can't really ignore it because it isn't incompatible with the network.  Soft forks are completely compatible.  
I GUESS you could create your own soft fork as well.  But then you need to convince other people to go along with you.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:29:12
This is not true.  There are arguments every single day on this forum.  Segwit absolutely does not have consensus, as proved by the fact that we are even having this argument.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:21:58
I agree that node count is a bad metric, and I don't have a definition of a specific metric myself.
These specifics can be determined through discussion.  But it is concerning that this discussion isn't even happening about this "generally". 
The way that you go about this is that you start with a subjective definition of "centralization" and you work forward from there to determine multiple, quantifiable metrics that approximate this subjective definition, while keeping in mind that some are more easily gamed than other.
And maybe you never get to 1 specific "provably correct" definition, but thats OK.  Even a mostly subjective definition would be miles ahead of what we have now.  I can still judge people on their subjective definition, and it is still a "commitment/prediction", albeit a less strong one than a purely objective metric.  But this discussion isn't even happening at all.
Or you go approach it from a different perspective of pegging a blocksize increase to technical network improvements that are coming down the pipe.  For example, let assume there is a technical improvement that will decrease average bandwidth usage (or decrease the "centralization penalty/cost" of a blocksize increase) by 50%, and it is coming out in 2020.  Such a network improvement would mean that you could double the blocksize and things would theoretically stay the same as whatever situation we are in now. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:08:05
I am not in favor of a contentious hardfork.  Nor am I in favor of a contentious soft fork.
I want a consensus, non-contentious fork that includes both segwit, and a 2MB hard fork.  
And if we can't come to consensus on any of this, well thats fine.  Freeze the bitcoin protocol to what it is now, and don't make any more changes.  No hard fork, and no segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:15:55
A whole lot of us just want segwit plus 2MB HF.  
Core doesn't even oppose on on chain scaling. They are absolutely in favor of onchain scaling.... Eventually. 
There is just disagreement about WHEN onchain scaling should happen. 
Are you going to call the Core team shills when in 5 years they increase the blocksize, and do exactly what the bigblockers want them to do?
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:37:54
Most bitcoin  Core developers support a hardfork.... Eventually. 
The debate has always been about WHEN it is going to happen, not IF.

@_date: 2017-03-22 19:45:14

Oh well. Looks like we will just have status quo for the next couple years until consensus is reached. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:04:28
The environment we are in is extremely contentious. We shouldn't make any contentious changes,  which fortunately,  most miners agree with.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:38:17
Not yet.  The core team, in the past, has been against contentious changes.  So it would be extremely surprising to me if they supported something as controversial as a User Activated Soft Fork.  
The problem with a UASF is that other people in the future might try to do the same thing.  It is a bad precedent that could cause 2 chains and unintentional hard forks.
Edit: Luke-jr, a prominent core developer, has called UASFs unsafe.  So at least 1 core developer thinks they are unsafe.  Here is a link to him comment:
 
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:18:21
Core is just people.  They have no more rights than any other bitcoin user.

The complexity is that it does not have consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:52:26
Of course!  Nor is it wise to hand it to a single group of developers.
We shouldnt make any changes that are contentious. The community should decide. And if the community has a significant minority of disagreement..... Then we shouldn't make the change.

@_date: 2017-03-05 20:26:01
Ok then, lets say the miners order these transactions by orphaning all segwit transactions.  Segwit is backwards compatible, so old bitcoin transactions are still valid.  It is perfectly valid to only include non-segwit transactions.  Or if the nodes "force" the inclusion of a single segwit transaction block, then by orphaning all FUTURE segwit transactions.  
All nodes are currently programmed to follow the longest valid chain.  So if 51% of miners orphan segwit transactions, then they won't ever be the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:19:14
No it is not a compromise.
For 2 years, Core's plan has been segwit.  Segwit is core getting literally everything they want, as they have not budged from this position in 2 years.
The Compromise was the Hong Kong agreement.  And the Hong Kong agreement was basically "No Segwit unless it comes with a 2 MB hardfork".
Well that is the situation we are in today.  No Segwit.  No hardfork.  If Core wants this to change, all they have to do is merge a 2MB hardfork into the github repo.
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:21:58
No. Let's do nothing until people compromise.
No segwit AND no hard fork,  unless they both happen at once. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:32:44
OK then.  what does it involve counting?  What metric does it use? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:48:54
If it is so uncontroversial, then it should be EASY to get companies to publicly state that they support a UASF.
The link about Segwit Ready companies is not the same thing as support for a UASF.  
When we have this list, of companies that publicly state that they will go against the majority hashpower, then I will believe "economic majority" arguments.
The onus is on you to prove that you have their support.  It doesn't matter how good of an idea this is.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:38:42
Well there is no evidence that the economic majority supports either side. 
The exchanges, for example,  all support status quo.  IE NO forks. 
Get the exchanges on board with an explicit POW change and then you can start talking about "economic majority"
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:46:57
Yes they will be able to decide. All you have to do is orphan segwit blocks. And if 50 % orphan segwit transactions,  they will not be on any chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:56:06
The onus is on you to prove that you have support.
If you really do have support of the economic majority, then please provide me with a tweet from the coinbase CEO that says that he will support  a UASF. 
Or ANY other major exchange. If you really do have the "economic majority" then providing this information should be easy. 
And no,  "Segwit ready" does not count. It has to be support for UASF.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:42:39
It is not a deliberate attack though.
This is because the malicious block is a valid bitcoin block. 
If half of the network is segwit unaware,  then they would mine on top of the valid block. 
All old nodes that do not implement the soft fork would follow,  and the network would split.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:44:27

Bitcoin is an open source project, and I am not sure why people don't understand this.
Everyone can contribute to everything.  There are no wars or side, because users can always just take the best of both worlds.
Developers are not in charge.  They make suggestions to the community.  There is nothing wrong with people people making more suggestions to the community, and then having the economic majority decide on each individual suggestion.
There are room for as many suggestors/developers as we want.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:48:38
The Core team in the past has threatened to take their ball and go home if the economic majority "fires" them by not going along with 100% of everything that they say. 
It is,  of course,  perfectly within their right to be big babies about this. But to suggest that Core would just go along with it if the economic majority disagrees with them is ignoring their past statements of 3 years. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:09:47
You can include a spam filter,  but unless you can convince 51% of miners to orphan anything you think is spam,   then it is futile. 
If you don't accept the "spam" transaction,  there are many others who will accept the free money that you left on the ground
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:33:08
Sure, but what stops us from discussing this stuff right now?
There is nothing at all that stops the community from laying out a plan for how this supposed Hard Fork will happen.  
Core can write/discuss code and BIPs and suggestions as much as they want.  No need to delay.
We all agree that a HF is going to happen eventually, right?  Even if it is 5 years from now.  Why not discuss and make plans, right now, for the future date, if it is going to happen eventually?  
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:14:02
Ok, so if it is opt in, imagine this situation.
Imagine that &gt;50% of hashpower does not upgrade, and a SINGLE miner creates a SINGLE invalid block.
Then the majority of hashpower would stay on this "invalid" chain, whereas the minority that uses segwit moves off to a different chain.
If the softfork does not have majority hashpower, it will create a second chain, that old miners do not follow.  Old miners follow majority hashpower, even if that chain is invalid with segwit.
Sure, fine, get majority and soft fork.  But softfork without majority will create 2 chains by definition.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:35:45
Ok, now I am curious.  
There were tons of conspiracies that you could have used.
You could have accused him of being a shill for the "greedy" for profit mining cartel.  You could have accused him of supporting the authoritarian chinese government.  You could have accused him of being an altcoiner who wants to destroy a competing currency.
But you chose.... Zionist Jews????   
Tell me, how does the destruction of bitcoin help "The zionist jews" with their plan to conquer the land of Israel?
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:46:59
Sure.  
By allowing it to be pushed through, it cements Core as the dictators of the protocol, and prevents future blocksize increases.
I do not trust Core to ever raise the blocksize again,  even if world wide internet bandwidth 10Xs.
There is no emergency right now. I do not think we immediately need a capacity increase or the benefits that segwit provides. 
But I am worried that the bitcoin protocol will be forever a settlement layer, even as technology allows for something bigger and better. 
Which is why nothing should change until all major players in the space come together (and yes,  that means that the opinions of devs, users,  exchanges,  AND miners all matter).  
Changes are decided by the community,  not a single development group. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:57:42

Very good explanation, thanks!  You are the only person in the thread who actually thought about the problem posed, and answered it.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:59:42
Because if you don't care about miners, why are we wasting all this money on electicity?
If we trust developer activated soft forks, why not we just let the developers decide which are the correct blocks and transactions.  No mining necessary.  
The whole point of bitcoin, is 1 cpu 1 vote, not some centralized authority deciding on the rules.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:49:57
.... Then what does it mean?  You are being given the full opportunity to provide a definition for the words that you used. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:55:16
What I am saying is,  is that a softfork is only a softfork if it has majority hashpower. 
You claim that majority hashpower is merely desired. It is not merely desired. It is required.
If you do not have majority hashpower, then the soft fork is actually a hardfork, because it creates a new chain.  The old miners that you claim are compatible, will not follow you if you don't have majority! There will be 2 chains,  and the smaller chain will lose. 
This is because your softfork has created clients that are incompatible with the real chain.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:33:46
Well, then we just shouldn't make any contentious changes at all.  Just freeze the bitcoin protocol as it is today.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:34:38
Well, half of the market wants a 2MB hardfork AND segwit at the same time.  It would not be a hostile hard fork if Core just followed the Hong Kong agreement, and included the 2MB fork with segwit.  They can end this debate any time they want.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:05:25
Sure. Maybe. 
But the jury is still out on both of those. 
Before anyone talks about "economic consensus", the exchanges need to express their explicit support for UASF or a POW change. 
If they do not express their explicit support,  well then we don't have consensus yet. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:05:11
It doesn't really matter.  Miners can just soft fork the soft fork and make ALL segwit transactions invalid.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:10:57
You understand that bitcoin core is ALSO planning on hardforking right?  There was a Bejing consensus that Core would write code to hardfork, and the hardfork would happen in about a year.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:35:40
Because if a foot isn't put down, then nothing Core says can be trusted.  
5 years from now there will be another "agreement" and it will be broken because "oh technically the people involved were just individuals" or "sure here is a hardfork. 10 years from now.  And in the mean time it does a soft fork to REDUCE capacity".
It is all just words, and supporting segwit means that the dev team can never be overruled, because they'll just make fake agreements that weren't intended to be followed. 
Instead of living in that world, I rather live in a world where contentious changes are never made. And nobody gets what they want.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:32:34


This is called a regular softfork.  A majority of miners can censor whatever transactions they want.  
It has nothing to do with activation thresholds.  A softfork just means that &gt;50% of miners are censoring certain transactions.
Also, I have seen no evidence at all that the economic consensus is supporting either side.  The economic consensus seems to be supporting "don't do anything contentious."
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:29:11
Wait,  so are we using node count to determine economic majority support? 
Does that mean I should spin up my 1k BU nodes now?
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:13:42
There is actually a technical reason to do it as a straight segwit +2mb HR WITHOUT the witness discount.
The witness discount makes witness data "cost" 1/4 of the normal amount.  That means that blocks can be 1 MB, or up to a max of 4 MB, theoretically.  There is no reason technically that witness data "deserves" this discount.  Data is data.  And it would make blocks more predictable instead of sometimes being 1 MB and sometimes being 3.7MB.
And we wouldn't get weird arguments about some people saying that Segwit is 1MB, and others saying that it is 4MB. (both arguments are incorrect).
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:00:57
But you can also do things like create patches.  
Is creating a one line code change, that changes a single variable, equivalent to replacing the reference version?  If you go into windows 10, and change the value of a single setting, have you now replaced all of microsoft as the official windows development team?
No, of course not.  But I'd bet that at least 40% of people would support this one line code change, that changes the blocksize variable.
And if you make a one line code change, you can just continue to put this patch on top of core, with no problem.  This is a bit different from what BU is doing, but one can easily imagine people getting what they want, without "replacing" anybody.

@_date: 2017-03-26 22:28:42
Cool, but how about we lay out the parameters to those tests ahead of time.
That way we can make a prediction, determine in advantage a good definition of "safe" so that people can't change their definitions later.
For example, you say "if node centralization only gets 5% more centralized, using X definition of centralization, then that means that segwit was a success and a 2MB HF after that is also safe and we can deploy 6 months later.".
I just want to know, in the abstract, what safe means, what tests people will use to determine safety, ect.  That way we all agree ahead of time what to do in the event of a certain result for the agree upon tests.
But so far, nobody has laid out any plan or definition or roadmap as to how these things will go down, or given any thought to how these "tests" are going to go down.  Which leads me to believe that they DON'T have a plan, and are just going to decide to do what they wanted to do anyway, and that all this stuff about "lets see what happens with segwit" seems like a delaying tactic.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:25:17
OK then. What is your technical measurement of this consensus? 
What,  actual,  measurable metric are you using to define consensus? 
Because just declaring that you have consensus doesnt make it true. You have to provide actual evidence for your position. 
And as far as I can see,  nobody in favor of a UASF has provided any evidence that they have consensus. They just declare it to be true. 
Show me the facts.

@_date: 2017-03-28 01:40:51
What about a contentious UASF or a contentious POW change?  
I am especially curious about the POW, to see if your stance on HFs is consistent.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:05:07
Sure. You activate segwit by getting consensus.  Such as getting all the exchanges on board with forking. 
There isn't consensus yet though.  No exchange has said "we will fork even without miners! "
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:17:06
Exchanges don't seem to be on board though. 
They have steered clear of high risk things like UASF and POE change. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:50:40
You could measure it by getting a bunch of companies to publicly state that they support a UASF.  Not support segwit, but support a UASF specifically, with the willingness to refuse to put 2 chains on the market, on an exchange, for example.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:09:23
And what if other people reject segwit blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:02:26
segwit banned is not incompatible with segwit mandatory.
Segwit mandatory just stops INVALID segwit theft transactions.  It still allows old, non-segwit transactions.
I am suggesting only mining old, perfectly valid, non-segwit transactions.  Soft fork the soft fork.  Segwit will follow along, and will have to hardfork to stop it.
Also, I am not sure why everyone is so hung up on softforks.  Literally anything is possible with a soft fork, if you hack it enough.
Big blockers could just increase the blocksize to 8MB, using a soft fork/extension blocks.  Would that make small blockers the attackers now?
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:29:53
The 4MB is discounted witness data.  Witness data counts as 1/4 of the size.  So if you have 4MB witness data, then it fills up the whole block.  But that is only worst case.
Is there something incorrect in the official FAQ that I linked?
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:39:12
Bitcoin is open source.

@_date: 2017-03-16 18:22:06
Miners cannot force  a hardfork.  But they absolutely can censor transactions.  
It does not matter how many nodes there are if miners just soft fork the soft fork and make segwit invalid.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:56:45
Well here is what the official FAQ released by core says.  It says 4mb is worst case.

Don't talk about it unless you have e evidence.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:05:44
Bitcoin is resistant to contentious changes for a reason.
If a change is controversial, then it should not happen.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:48:08
They currently allow this right now.... 
If you send a segwit transaction,  right now,  it could be stolen,  and the exchanges will accept it. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:34:25
Do you have evidence? Because right now,  no core developers have e publicly come forward. 
Also,  you are playing the semantics game. If you have evidence,  then show it. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:10:23
Agreed. 
I really just want to see some actual evidence. 
If the economic majority supports this, fine,  do it.  
But please please get some actual evidence of what the economic majority supports before doing anything as contentious as a PROOF OF WORK CHANGE. 
The exchange letter that everyone signed doesn't even come close. Show me the same letter,  but in support of a POW change,  and that is a START. 
I don't understand what is so hard about getting evidence before pushing through significant changes..... 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:53:06
It doesn't matter how you define "big player".  Just pick a metric.  Company valuation.  Number of bitcoins that go through their service. Anything.
If there really IS an overwhelming majority, then you should be able to pick 10 different ways of measuring support, and all of your blackbox algorithms should return True. 
If you have to debate about what metric that you are using, because one metric shows one thing, and another metric show another, then you have already lost, and you do not have the overwhelming economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:21:12
The whole point of bitcoin is that miners acting in their own self interest leads to an optimal, working outcome. 
If this assumption in the whitepaper was wrong,  then we need to go back to the drawing board. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:17:54
That's the definition of a soft fork.  A soft fork is when miners censor certain transactions.
Also,  it would be great if all the people talking about the economic majority provided some proof that the economic majority supports them. 
So far I have seen no evidence that the economic majority, or the nodes,  as you put it,  support 1 side OR the other. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:10:31
Because we live in the real world and we are not dumb, thats how.
Nobody will be able to pull off a successful multi-month long lie about what their xx million dollar company is planning to do.
What, is the Bitfury CEO going to tell all of its employees that it IS planning on forking, then have a secret plot among him and secret inner circle that knows what the real plan is?  All while getting shit on by the Core Devs and the community for "betraying" them, and risking a POW hard fork?
Oh yeah,  and then if he pulled off this insane plot,  and caused millions of dollars in damages,  that would DESTROY his business reputation. If he does something like that,  maybe he'll not pay your invoice or something. It is too risky to do business with dishonest people. 
No.  Secret plots and plans don't work like that in real life.
Or the other miners could just meet up with the bitfury CEO in person, and try and determine face to face if he is lying.
Making giant secret plans and plots for  long periods of time is very hard.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:11:02
No. As in the core devs can feel free to make their client compatible with the network, and the community can decide to run their future suggestions or not. 
A single github repository does not define bitcoin. Bitcoin is defined by the network.
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:40:35
"Merging a contentious hard fork into the codebase would tear the currency in two with all the lost money and problems that would cause."
Absolutely. Which is why we shouldn't have a contentious hardfork.  We could use the same voting mechanism that they chose for segwit, and tie both changes together in a single vote. 
I would also argue that a contentious "user activated" soft fork of segwit would cause the same problem,  as it would make the chain split in 2 (if you don't have majority  hashpower, then the miners don't follow your "softfork").
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:24:21
If the problem really is that it is a HF,  then we can just change segwit to be 8 MB,  instead of 4MB. 
Or we can just extension blocks. It is even possible to do emergent consensus using extension blocks and have a changing effective blocksize. All entirely via soft fork.
Would that keep core out of the drama enough for you?  Miner activated soft fork block increase to 8 MB worst case?
Also, Core entered the drama on its owns with the scaling roadmap that advocates for a flex cap.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:22:57
Sure. But it would be obvious if someone is lying. You can't just announce to the world that you are going to lie and then expect the world to believe your lies. 
Fake signalling is an obvious attack that is avoidable.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:33:08
There is also another name for it.  It is called a miner activated soft fork.
The jury is still out on what the economic majority supports. Maybe they would fire them,  but more probably,  they wouldn't do anything because there is large disagreement about what the best path forward is. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:43:50
Let's say you create your own miner,  that rejects all blocks not created by you.  
Only your blocks are valid. But nobody else follows your chain, because it has almost zero hashpower behind it. 
This is a soft fork.  Did you break consensus?
Also,  if you really want to talk about consensus,  you should talk about the bitcoin white paper. 
According to the bitcoin white paper,  bigger blocks don't break technical consensus. They are perfectly compatible with the original bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:37:57
Not if miners just softfork to disallow segwit transactions.  50% of miners can censor whatever they want on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:05:40
That's cool.  Do you have any proof at all to what the economic majority supports. 
Absolutely everyone who talks about the economic majority refuses to give evidence. 
Please get evidence of what the economic majority supports before doing ANY contentious changes. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:11:18
The market is divided. Some people support one thing,  and other people support other things. 
If that was not the case then we would be having this conversation.
We can make protocol level large changes when they are no longer contentious.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:08:14
Contentious HF isn't going to happen. It is posturing while consensus is gathered. 
Also,  it stops segwit and used it as negotiation leverage. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:07:29
Then show me the support from exchanges. 
It should be easy. Consensus means obvious support. I don't think you could find single top 10 exchange That says "we will support a POW change" or "we will support a UASF even if the miners and other exchanges disagree".
You won't be able to find a single one.
They should be shouting from the rooftops!  That's what consensus means.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:36:43
BRB, I am going to go DDOS all the core nodes, and then 51% attack the network.  Oh, wait, does that make me hostile?
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:27:13
83% support allowing miners to decide. That's what segwit does. It puts the decision in miners hands to activate it or not, requiring, 95% of hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:37:54
No you end up with one chain. The original bitcoin chain that currently includes no segwit transactions. 
So what is a UASF?  Basically there are certain malicious transactions that users would make invalid,  and force everybody to not to include. 
BUT,  regular old normal bitcoin transactions STILL work. 
So since regular bitcoin transactions work,  what if 51% of miners just ONLY included regular bitcoin transactions, and orphaned all new segwit transactions?  
Segwit UASF clients would still follow the longest valid chain. And miners would still be producing a valid chain,  because they are doing regular bitcoin transactions.

It does not remain one chain.
It is 2 chains.  The people with the minority who mine the soft fork, and the majority who mine the original, unchanged chain.

Because the developers do not want any blocksize increase at all. They want to decrease it.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:56:03
No.  It is because the changes are contentious.  
Segwit does not have consensus.  A large minority does not support it as of this moment.
Get consensus THEN make your protocol level changes.

Nobody is going to fork unless there is overwhelming consensus among the economic majority.

How about we just don't make ANY contentious changes until we have widespread consensus? 
No BU,  no SegWit and no POW change. 
Status quo has been working just fine for me. There is no emergency.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:22:06
Awesome! That means that bitgo supports the status quo.  Which means no hard forks from either side of the debate (NO BU, NO POW change, and NO user activated fork) , unless they have full consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:47:10
Of course not. We shouldn't do EITHER a hardfork OR segwit until there is consensus.
And miner signalling is just a consensus gathering mechanism. Nobody is going to hardfork until there is wide agreement among everybody. (especially not if exchanges aren't going along with it)
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:49:37
Or they could just add a 2MB HF to segwit, increasing it to a total size of 4MB, and end this debate tomorrow.
There is no doomsday scenario. All they have to do is this, and they can end it. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:13:44
What, so just never measure anything?
I am sick of people claiming they have support without any data.  Pick a metric.  Any metric.  Pick 100 metrics.  If the economic majority supports an outcome, then the conclusion should be obvious.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:02:13
No it is not backwars compatible.  If you do not have the majority hashrate, NONE of the nodes will follow you and there will be 2 chains.
Backwards compatible means "old nodes follow you", and this does not happen.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:21:40
Thats my point.  The big blockers are not just miners.
What about the big block users?  They don't own mining equipment.  They might be perfectly OK with POW change to screw the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:44:55
Softforks are the same thing. Soft forks are "51%" attacks, or worse,  minority orphaning. 
But if you really do think that soft forks are different,   Imagine I started gathering support for a soft fork that made ALL segwit transactions invalid.
See,  you can't just call a blocksize increase an attack.  Segwit itself is a blocksize increase!
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:41:39
And what if users want more than segwit?  The worry is that it will be segwit and never again with any blocksize increase.
If core has no reason not to support a future hardfork, then how about they propose one right now?  Pick a date, any date.  
Until they definitively pick a date, it is all just words, and people speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  If core wants me to believe them, then they should push code to master that allows for a 2020 hardfork.  Or a 2030 hardfork.  It shouldn't be that hard to get them to agree to 20 fricken 30 right?
Big blockers have been burned too many time already for them to be able to trust anything except for code push to master.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:10:43
Sure,  so UASF is perfectly capable of orphaning nodes. 
But what they CANT do is force a block to be accepted. 
So here is the attack. When UASF happens,  actually upgrade to segwit.
THEN,  using the majority hashpower,  be "upgraded" to segwit, but only use forward compatible NON segwit transactions/blocks.
Not invalid segwit transactions. Just normal bitcoin transactions. THEN orphan segwit transactions. 
Segwit nodes will follow the hashpower. Because the hashpower isn't doing anything invalid! 
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:52:57
Exactly.  
If it turns out that miners acting in their own self interest doesn't result in an optimal outcome, then that means that there was an incorrect assumption in the whitepaper and we need to revisit it.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:01:27
Both.  Either.  Any.  
Users, miners, wallet developers, exchanges.
It doesn't matter how you measure it.  Because no matter how you measure it, the answer is the same.  The vast majority of people support Bigger blocks.
The only way that the "Consensus" tips towards smaller blocks, if you only ask the 20 active core developers, or the people who work at blockstream.  Congrats, you've got 40 supporters.  Thats not "Consensus".
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:55:19
Absolutely you can.  It is called an altcoin.

God I hope so. I don't even care at this point. I just want everybody to stop arguing in insinuations and implications and saying different things to different people and make their opinion know. 
If exchanges/economic majority  support UASF then they should do it/say so instead of deciding things in smoke filled rooms. (BU is guilty of this as well) 
Everybody is just too afraid to rock the boat,  and we are at a standstill. Let's have discussions,  and do this all out in the open.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:41:45
No,  miners would NOT move to BTU.  All they would do is stay on the original bitcoin chain,  and continue to produce regular,  perfectly valid,  bitcoin transactions that are valid to segwit clients. 
The change that they could make is they could just refuse to ever include new segwit transactions. 
NOT make invalid malicious segwit transactions. Just refuse to ever include ANY segwit transactions,  and continue to build on the longest valid chain that coinicidently doesn't include any segwit transactions. 
Miners would still have the ability to order valid transactions. And they could decide on an ordering that doesn't happen any segwit transactions. 
If you want to force miners to include segwit transactions you need to hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:26:03
Look,  that's fine. But please come up with a definition for "economic majority" that is factual and measureable, before declaring that you have the support of the economic majority.

How is it possible to achieve compromise when one side won't make any commitments to budge an inch?  
The big blockers didn't start at 2MB, they started at 8MB + growth.
They have compromised down to what we have now, and Core hasn't changed at all.
How can Core possibly be negotiated with, when they have rejected everything the community has suggested?
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:27:50
OK,  that's cool. If Devs can't force changes to happen,  then I guess there is no harm in merging a 2MB HF vote/signal mechanism into master, that is set to true by default,  EXACTLY in the same way segwit does.  
Or even better,  core should release, in master,  a signalling mechanism that would signal approval for BOTH segwit and 2 MB HF at the same time.
Let's let the users decide if there is "consensus". And the users will be able to decide once core merges to master and allows users to vote,  with nodes or something.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:38:30
There is no negotiation. Only consensus.
And right now nothing has consensus. Not BU,  not HF,  not segwit and not UASF. 
That is the state of the world, and all changes are going to be blocked until consensus is reached. 
If Core doesn't like it then it should put out proposals that are likely to get consensus. For example, Segwit plus 2MB would get consensus.
Core is not in charge. The users are in charge. And right now there is no consensus among users.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:41:30
Most Core developers support a blocksize hardfork. Read the roadmap, it is all there.
The argument has always been about when it happens. Not if.

This is disengenuous.  There are a whole lot of people who do not support activating segwit as of this moment.  Just take a look through this subreddit.

The issue is that if you wear a red hat, or are even against the idea of killing people wearing red hats,  you are all of a sudden an enemy,  and not "uninvolved".

Lets say a large amount of users reject segwit, and proceed to make perfectly valid transactions on the original bitcoin chain, that just so happen to exploit segwit and steal a bunch of coin.
Would you be in favor of killing off the "attackers", or are they perfectly allowed to engage in this behavior on their "altcoin"?  What if exchanges have differing opinions on which is the "real" chain?

This is awesome!
I am sick of everyone just "talking" about the economic majority without using ANY quantifiable metrics.  
If you think the economic majority supports you, fine, show me the data that proves it.
This metric, like any other metric, is, of course, imperfect.  But at least it is SOMETHING.
Lets get a whole bunch of metrics together and use them to determine what the economic majority really is.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:46:57
Lets consider 2 scenarios.
Block A: Includes a very large amount of witness/signature data.  For example, by a user sending a very large signature.
Block B: Includes a very small amount of witness data.
Which block is larger?  Which block has a higher transaction capacity? And which block has a better transmitted blocksize to capacity ratio?
Segwit gives a discount to witness data, which incentives people to include larger signatures.  Correct?
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:05:30
That is not how nodes work.
If I mined a bunch of empty blocks, and created the longest chain, it would orphan the other blocks.  
If I am a miner, I can just refuse to mine on any segwit transaction.  Even with the UASF, you can just do your own softfork to stop segwit transactions from happening.
I am not saying that you do an illegal segwit transaction.  I am saying you stop ALL segwit transactions, and only allow old , non seg wit transactions.
You can soft fork, sure.  And miners can ALSO soft fork your softfork.
That is the DEFINITION of a 51% attack.  51% of miners can censor whatever transactions that they want.  They can't force people to accept transactions.  But they can ABSOLUTELY censor whatever they want.  Including segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:46:05
But it does create a new chain.
A softfork declares that previously allowed behavior is no longer allowed.
So if the majority of hashpower continues to do this "disallowed" behavior, and the soft fork people don't follow, then 2 chains would form.
A soft fork only maintains a single chain if it has the majority hashpower.  Old nodes would follow the hashpower, and if the softfork does not have majority, then the old nodes would not follow them.
Yes, ideally they would have the majority, but there is no guarantee that this will happen.
Let me give a more clear example.  Lets say I create a soft fork that says that only I am allowed to create blocks.  Nobody follows me, but I mine on my new soft fork.  I declare that the hashpower doesn't matter, because only valid blocks are "real" bitcoin, and I am the only person who can create "real" blocks.  This is a soft fork!  There is nothing disallowed about what I have done.  But 2 chains would be created.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:19:57
51% attack. Softfork.  Same thing with different words.
Segwit, for example, "censors" certain transactions that steal money from people.  And ideally it would be done with miner support, using their 51% of hashpower to "attack" the malicious theft transactions.
The only difference between the two is "consensus" and "economic majority".  But it is difficult to guess what that means, because nobody has come up with a satisfactory answer for measuring the "economic majority".
Correct, in this situation, users would have to proof of work change.
Which is why UASF is pretty silly, IMO.  If you are going to UASF, you may as well just proof of work change.  You don't lose anything that you didn't already lose (miner support).

What people want is a hardfork increase. If it doesn't have that,  then it won't ever be passed. 
I am fine either way.  Either don't change anything or add both. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:10:03
Well then Core should do it the right way by merging a 2MB hardfork code. 
As soon as this happens, all this stuff about BU ends tomorrow. 
Ball is In  Core's court.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:01:58
Calm down everyone. 
I think everyone jumped the gun on the freak-out train. Read the tweet. 
He did NOT say that he was working on, and had a concrete plan for accelerating the hardfork. 
He made an offhand comment supporting the idea of accelerating it. 
We don't need nuclear options yet. Although personally I am in favor of a nuclear compromise option of segwit 2MBHF, AND POW change. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:57:09
"This is incorrect. The Core Scalability Roadmap contains a plan to increase the block size after the near-term improvements are done."
Can they set a date for it then?
If this really is the case, they should put out a guestimate.  If they really do believe that on chain scaling is going to happen soon, why is core so silent?  Why don't I see posts on this subreddit by Luke-jr that say "Sure, we are working on a blocksize increase soon!  Just wait until 2019 and you'll get your hardfork!"
We don't see any of that.  If they really do believe in a blocksize increase, they could just put out support for it, commit to a future date, and segwit would be approved tomorrow.
But none of this is true.  If it was true, finding any support at all from them would be easy.
And if this is true, then none of you have anything to worry about.  Segwit will just be delay for the next couple month, until they quickly come out with their blocksize increase proposal.  No emergency.  Just delayed for a little while longer.

@_date: 2017-03-19 19:02:07
Just because Bitfury supports Segwit, doesn't mean that they are on the same "side" as devs/users.
There are more than 2 sides to this debate. 
If core goes nuclear,  and threatens POW change, I think that every single miner would be pushed into supporting BU. 
BU may have its drawbacks,  but if you are about to lose your hundred million dollar investment, what do you have to lose. Even if your past comments denouncing BU make you look ridiculous.

Did you read what I posted?
I said "There is a list of companies who fixed their code to make it compatible with segwit".
Yes, that list shows people who fixed their code.  Of course they fixed their code.  Wouldn't you fix your code, even if things weren't going your way?  Every single one of those companies probably fixed it for a 2MB hardfork as well, on the off chance that THAT happens as well.  Tells us nothing about which side they support.
Now show me a list that of companies that will go against hashrate, in order to support segwit.  Not just "we fixed our code, in case segwit passes"
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:28:39
Then good luck pushing through an extremely contentious change.
If the bitcoin protocol just gets frozen in time, to what it is now, then that would be fine with me.
No Segwit, AND no hardfork.  No contentious changes should every be made to this 20 billion $ industry.

There are is no evidence that the economic majority supports ether side.
Come back to me with a list of companies that specifically say that they support segwit OVER the miners or segwit OVER a 2 mb hardfork. 
There exists no such thing yet.  There is a list of companies who fixed their code to make it compatible with segwit, but no hard evidence that the economic majority overwhelming supports either side.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:13:30
They can set a date for which they will support it.
Not a date of activation.  A date where they will create hardfork voting code, and merge it to master, and support it.  Thats all people want.  For core to not speak out of both sides of their mouths.
They can end this debate tomorrow if in the public core roadmap, they say "We support 2 megabyte hardfork by the year 2019, and we will provide the code to do it!".  Thats all.
Maybe put out a blog post too that says "Core supports a hardfork!"
They absolutely have the power to merge code into master, provide the ability to vote, and write words on the Core Roadmap. They did it will segwit, they can do it with a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:00:17
Jihan is just one miner.  Segwit only has 30% support.  The blame goes with the 70%.
Any it is crazy to me that this forum is all of a sudden in favor of extremely contentious changes.  I thought bitcoin was supposed to be resistant to change.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:38:42
Yes is was designed to do this!  Satoshi himself said that if would be within to spirit of bitcoin to fork to make coins more divisible or other reasonable changes like that.
Satoshi absolutely was support of 'protocol changes", as long as they followed the original vision of bitcoin (ie, 21 million cap, no censorship, ect) 
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:56:46
The point that Brian is making is that if the overwhelming economic majority decides that a fork is the real BTC,  then exchanges would go along with it. 
What matters is the economic majority. NOT the dev team. The dev team makes suggestions. And the community decides what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:23:51
What matters is consensus.
If 2MB hard fork has overwhelming consensus,  then it is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:58:23
Segwit does not have consensus.  A large minority of users do not support it.  Just take a look at the posts on the forums would show you that.
If segwit had consensus, then none of us would be having this conversation.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:14:38
I thought core supported a blocksize hardfork increase? 
Every time I say that I am worried that Core will never support capacity past segwit, someone "corrects me" and says that they DO support a hard fork but not now, so let's just activate segwit.
Which is it? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:40:05
I'm not 100% how multialgos work, but I'd be worried that it multiplies the attack space.  Instead of only 1 group being able to screw the network,  nor you have 2 groups,  and if you take over EITHER one you can be malicious.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:19:14
OK...  But can we collect that proof BEFORE making giant,  contentious changes to the block chain? 
Or is it somehow now OK to experiment with billions of dollars with no evidence?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:30:14
Sure.  But the point is that it is being done by default. 
If you set out the rules,  most people will follow them, instead of bothering to try and get around them. 
It isn't important to get 100% of people to follow the rules. 90% is good enough.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:08:59
Suspect is the wrong word. It would be OBVIOUS if some miners were fake signalling. Because people like LukeJR would be making reddit posts about it. 
There is no code that forces people to fork. Miners can just NOT fork, because all the big players are known. We don't even need to use block signalling because we can just ask the big players whether they support BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:27:11
Because you can't force through segwit.
Sure, a hardfork can be vetoed.
Flag day doesn't work, because miners can always just soft fork the soft fork and prevent segwit from happening, by making ALL segwit transaction invalid.
If you want to FORCE segwit, you have to hardfork a POW change or something.  Otherwise miners just make segwit transaction invalid.   And in the article you just showed, exchanges would not follow a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:21:33
Thats still a tad low for my preference, and I'm a big blocker.

OK... So...  Let's say the community wants 2 MB HF.   Or let's say a large minority of users don't want to implement segwit yet. 
In this case we should probably get consensus first before doing anything,  right?
How about the devs push code to master,  that would allow users to decide on segwit  plus 2MB HF. 
That way the users can decide.

I don't want anything to be done to bitcoin until there is widespread consensus.

@_date: 2017-03-21 01:00:24
If you want a metric to go by,  pick exchanges, not something gameable like nodes. 
If exchanges throw their support behind a POW change or a UASF segwit THEN you can start talking about consensus. 
And no "segwit ready" does not count. It has to be "supports UASF".
If you really do have consensus then proving it should be easy. It should be easy to get your exchange signed letters that throw their support behind UASF or POW change.
If there is consensus then these big players should be shouting their support from rooftops but they aren't doing that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:33:42
Yes. But you are spamming this all over the place,  and using it to imply that the economic majority supports one side. 
I see this time and time again with people who talk about running full nodes. 
Yes. Full nodes and the economic majority decide what bitcoin is. I agree. 
 But nobody who ever talks about this stuff actually back up their claim that the economic majority has actually made a decision and supports their side. 
So I am in disagreement with you in the way that you are attempting to imply that the economic majority supports you.
Show me some evidence, otherwise all your talk about economic majority is FUD.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:31:46
Reading the Roadmap, basically, they are in favor of an additional blocksize increase (on top of segwit), but they are refusing to give any specifics about WHEN this blocksize increase is going to happen, and refuse to have a discussion about what factors would allow it to happen.  
Well.... except for luke-jr, who wants a decrease.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:07:41
If this is such a threat to bitcoin, they can be stopped tomorrow by Core.  
All Core has to do is merge a 2 mb hardfork vote, and nobody will bother with BU ever again.
The ball is in their court. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:13:43
They aren't refusing to release the source code...  Did you make a request and was it denied?
Also, the new code is almost certainly already on github now, so no violation ever happened.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:04:32
There has been no study on the economic consensus.
People throw out the word "economic consensus", but the problem is that they never define what that even means.
An economic consensus must be MEASURABLE, and falsifiable, for it to mean anything.  Nobody should be able to just assert that they have economic consensus, without proof.
Miner consensus, may not be what we want, but at least it is measurable, and people cant lie about it.

So,  what,  we should Fork to prevent a hard fork???  
What ever happened to "don't to contentious forks? "
The shoe is on the other foot now. Segwit is contentious. Contentious changes are dangerous. Therefore we shouldn't do them.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:15:52
OK,  but then what's the point? 
Why would anyone possibly want just the code if it isn't going to merged. 
There is no point at all to agreeing to such a silly agreement. 
Although the code that was releases might meet the technical definition of the "agreement", nobody in their right mind would think it meets the SPIRIT of the agreement. 
The spirit of the agreement was that segwit and 2MB are a package deal. One isn't going to happen without the other.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:23:30

@_date: 2017-03-18 23:20:32
Forking is hard to do. Preventing a soft fork is easy. 
Big blockers can just stop the soft fork from happening forever,  until core caves. 
UASF doesn't work because miners can just soft fork the soft fork and make segwit not work. A POW change would be required to force segwit to happen,  which defeats the point of stopping the 2MB HF in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:22:46
The person asked me a question and I answer it.  He asked me what I thought would be a good definition of proof. So I nicely answered the question. 
It is called having a discussion. 
If you have any evidence at all that the exchanges support a UASF,  or a POW change,  then please provide it. 
It has to be them specifically saying "we support a UASF and will do it ourselves/follow the chain" or "we will follow the new POW".
That's how evidence works. People say things. And we should listen to the actual words that they say. If those people have a different opinion,  then they can say something else. 
That's all I am asking. Read the actual evidence, and don't assume things that aren't specifically said.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:18:33
We do not all want the same thing. 
Segwit people want 2mb soft fork and then never on chain scaling again.
BU people want on chain scaling that maybe would be compatible with dial up connections. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:09:09
Thats fair.  But if what you say is true, then we literally don't need miners at all.
If users are able to come to a decentralized consensus on Segwit, then, by definition, the users are ALSO able to come to a decentralized consensus on other things.  Such as the blockchain transaction list.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:59:39


These are not messages of support for a UASF.  This just means that they are segwit compatible.  There is a huge difference.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:44:52
Ok, so what if other miners start signalling that they will orphan BIP 148.
IE, they will orphan blocks that are threatening to orphan other blocks.
That is where this war leads.  You threaten to orphan one side, and the other side will threaten to orphan you back for making that threat.  I wonder which will win.  Bitfury, or every other miner put together.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:53:13
People keep claiming that miners don't have any power, and that the nodes can overrule them and do a user activated softfork.  
So why don't the Nodes or Users just do this anyway with the blockchain transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:18:18
Look, if it is not about blocksize, then how about a compromise.
Segwit, 2MB HF, AND a POW hardfork.
That way EVERYONE is mad. I'd support it. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:33:19
Adam Back said that he would create a "No-XT" client, that signals a hardfork, but doesn't actually do it.  So as to sabotage the voting process.
Luke-jr submitted the classic proof of work change, so as to scare Chinese miners into submitting.
So the answer is both.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:13:15
Killerstorm.  You understand that bitcoin core is ALSO planning on hardforking right?  There was a Bejing consensus that Core would write code to hardfork, and the hardfork would happen in about a year.  The hardfork is happening either way, and the people you support are going to do it even if classic doesn't succeed.....
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:41:35
I don't understand what your probability chart is doing.  If one side has 75% support, it will quickly overtake the 1MB chain.  
Yes, immediately after activation, if the 1MB chain gets sorta lucky, then its chain might lead for a couple blocks or so, but the 75% chain would very quickly beat it, even if the 1MB is "in the lead", temporarily.
Also, I reject your claim that it can "never activate" with more than 75% support. Example: lets say it has 60% support, and then a miner that is contributing 20% total hash power switches to classic.  Classic would now have 80% support.  Which is more than 75%.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:55:18
Correct.... Which is why you need the majority hashpower.
But right now only 30% of miners support segwit.  So they need a lot more support before they can safely fork.  If they fork without majority hashpower, then it will just be a separate, alt coin chain, as the majority stays on the main chain.
This is why we don't do contentious changes on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:15:47
Maybe.  But I don't think twitter will take a side on the BU vs Segwit debate, so we don't have much to worry about.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:27:50
Ok then, how about this.
We take a vote, of every holder of bitcoin, and if 5% disagree then we don't have consensus and shouldn't make ANY contentious changes (No hard fork, no segwit).
Is that a reasonable definition for consensus?  The definition being, that if we don't have overwhelming, obvious, support (which we absolutely do NOT right now.  There are multiple arguments EVERY DAY on this subreddit), then we don't have consensus?
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:58:40
How about do it at the same time?  Segwit has already been delayed for months.  Maybe in a couple more months, it will be time for the hardfork.  Can't we just wait until then?  There's no emergency.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:13:24
I can spin up a hundred nodes in under an hour, at reasonable cost.  Node count means nothing.
And if you want to talk about something more nebulous, like "economic majority", the burden of proof is on you to define what the hell that even means, as well as prove that you actually have it.
People use the word "economic consensus", and then assert, without evidence, that they have the backing of this undefined concept.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:52:43
By the fact that we are having this conversation.
There is no widespread agreement on any scaling plans. 
If there were then bitcoin classic and unlimited and the Hong Kong agreement would never have happened,  and segwit would already be merged. 
Nobody agrees on anything. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:49:40
Fortunately, no exchanges have said that they are going to do this.
Everything single one of them has said "we will follow the market,  or just split people's coins into 2 chains".

There is no emergency. We can just wait until consensus it reached,  and we shouldn't do anything controversial until consensus among BOTH sides happens. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:56:38
Even core supports a hardfork.  They just disagree about when it should happen.  The 4mb segwit fork couldn't possibly support Visa levels, even with the lightning network.  So there is universal agreement among the technical experts that a hardfork will happen.... eventually.  
But that might be 10 years from now.  And if that is the case, then in 10 years we will get segwit.  I am looking forward to it!
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:36:04
Except that nobody wants to hardfork with &lt;75%, so there isn't any risk.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:00:12

If they really do believe this then they should set a date.  "In year X,  we believe the blocksize should increase past the segwit increase". 
You won't find this though. The lead developer Lukejr thinks the blocksize should DECREASE.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:46:04

I have explained my exact points, and you just say fuck off without even addressing it.  
If there is something incorrect about what I say, then explain what is wrong with it.  That is how you argue in good faith.  
If you disagree with someone, you don't just say "you are wrong".  You say "You are wrong, and here is why".  And then if the other person says "actually, what about X, Y, and Z" you should respond and say "Reasons X, Y, and Z are wrong because of A, B, and C".  You don't just say fuck off, do more research.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:01:08
No,  BUers are not activating right now because that would be financial suicide. 
The debate is still WAY to contentious for either big blocks or segwit to be deployed safely. 
BUers are smartly waiting it out until core is willing to compromise with a 2MB HF.  
Tick tock. Time is in BU's side,  because there are a lot of people who REALLY want segwit deployed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:59:00
Miners can just soft fork the soft fork and disallow all segwit transactions. 
51% can censor whatever transactions they want. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:47:57
If only it was that.  
Unfortunately I suspect it is more like "We declare that we have the majority, and we aren't going to use anything measureable metric, because it might prove us wrong".
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:37:26
"How does miner signaling say anything about user consensus" 
I was just picking the same definition that Core used for segwit. If this is a bad measurement, then segwit needs to be fixed to use a different signalling method.  Otherwise we won't know if it has concensensus among users. 
Whatever method that Core uses in its master branch code to gather consensus and deploy segwit code,  let's use the same thing for 2MB HF in the master branch.   
That way users can decide. I am confused as to why you are against letting users decide,  using the same methods that users are deciding on segwit.
If the method is good enough for segwit, then it is good enough for this. 
There's no harm in letting users decide,  right? Pick whatever method you want,  but let's do the same deploy method for segwit as for other  blocksize increases. IE,  code deployed in master.
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:18:25
Well if core supports a 2 4 8 proposal, then they should make a pull request, and put it on the roadmap. 
This is totally false though. Just go back 2 years and you see core vehemently opposing any hard fork block increase. 
The ball is in cores court. ANY hardfork block size increase will be accepted.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:46:12
What I would consider sufficient is an overwhelming  list of companies that support a UASF,  and statements saying that they will go against the miners. 
A list of segwit ready companies is not enough. It has to be companies that will specifically support a UASF,  and not some noncommittal statement like "we will follow the market!" or "we are ready for segwit".
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:20:53
The purpose would be to force compromise.  Basically, nobody gets what they want until everyone comes together and agrees.
There is no emergency.  We can wait a couple years for both segwit, and a hardfork.
Also, segwit is backwards compatible.  So exchanges CANNOT choose to disallow old blocks.  Because everyone agrees that old blocks and old miners are allowed in segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:19:54
Before we do a UASF we really need proof that the users actually want it. 
No more talk. I want facts,  and measureable numbers.
Proof. Not rhetoric.
If there is no proof,  then we should not activate contentious changes.

Node count doesn't really mean anything. I can spin up a hundred nodes tomorrow if I felt like burning some money. Doesn't mean anything. 
The measure that I would use is support among big, important,  bitcoin companies that actually have power. 
Exchange support is a reasonable rough draft initial measurement, for example. (I'd argue that there are other important bitcoin companies as well.  But exchanges is good enough for now.) 
I've seen the letter.
The letter is saying that exchanges will list BU as an altcoin. This is absolutely evidence that the economic majority does not support BU as of this moment. 
This is very new evidence though. 
BUT,  let me tell you what the letter does NOT say. 
 What it does not say is that the exchanges will support a UASF.  
It does not say that exchanges will support a POW change,  which everyone is talking about now. 
It does not say that exchanges will refuse to support a 2MB HF + segwit "compromise" if core proposes it. 
So yes, the letter is very new and very important evidence. But it is very specific evidence that means 1 thing, and does not mean other things.

How so? 
Let's say 30 percent decide to soft fork,  and the other 70 percent doesnt follow that change. 
Which is the chain?  
The 70 percent chain is larger,  but the 30 percent believe that that chain is "invalid".
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:06:02
They could determine if it is fake by asking people. There are only a couple miners. 
For example let's say Bitfury fake signals.
What,  are we all of a sudden going to believe that they just switched? Maybe... 
But it'd be easy to tell.  It is not a question of "are these random people on the internet telling the truth". It is a question of "is Bitfury lying". Which we can easily answer. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:42:26
Not yet they aren't.  Hopefully they will put a stop to this, and refuse to merge a POW change that doesn't get "consensus".
I'm not worried yet about a POW change because I don't think Core will merge it.  But maybe I have underestimated the lengths they will go to.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:23:50
Segwit does 2.1 MB average. It does not do 4MB average. 4 MB should basically never happen.

That would be awesome if there was a vote!  
Then we can be absolutely certain about what everyone believes.
But do you think that Core will support any sort of vote, that isn't entirely just made up by them and the other "experts".
Do you think they will take such a vote seriously?  Or will it be dismissed as "populous rhetoric", like everything else has been?
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:51:10
Then core should implement 2MB HF. 
That would take ALL the wind out of BUs sails and get the community on board.  If core implemented 2MB HF it would pass overnight.

Big blockers want 2MB plus segwit increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:23:42
Segwit WOULD break consensus  as well. 
They work soft forks and nobody would follow the softfork.
The majority of hashpower would stay on the original non segwit chain.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:22:03
I don't care about miners.  Whether they support bigblocks or segwit.  Punishment is the wrong word.  It is about making bitcoin more decentralized.
Bitfury, a segwit support, is one of the bigger centralizer problems because they don't sell their miners to the market.
Of course there are disadvantages to POW hardfork, but everyone is talking about "firing the miners" anyway.

You asked, and I'll deliver.  I am glad to provide you with the hard data.
This is a poll of the economic community, that is weighted by economic activity (make sure to click the enable weighting button):

The concern is that if Core is able to push it through in this extremely contentious environment, then they are forever the centralized authority in charge of bitcoin. 
Core is not in charge. They make suggestions. And the community decides. 
Most people support segwit, EVENTUALLY, but not tomorrow.
Fix the community, come together, and then when everything isn't contentious, get Core to commit to a long term scaling solution,  THEN do segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:19:28
How about we let the users decide? 
Neither side has consensus right now,  so let's not do anything.

According to the facts, currently 39% of the bitcoin economy is supporting segwit2X, where as ~0% is opposing it. (And everyone else hasn't made any statements)
The majority of the economy is quite clear what they support.
The economic majority has ALWAYS been in charge of bitcoin.   The opinions of rando reddit users with their rasberry pi nodes have never made a difference to bitcoin.

Replay protection "by definition" breaks all wallet software.  
There is no way add replay protection without doing that, because the entire purpose of replay protection is to break old software.
But, once again, if Core really cares about replay protection, then they can add it to THEIR chain.

It will give us information about how the legacy chain will stand up, when it has &lt;1% of the hashpower of segwit2X.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:22:39
I believe that is just an EXTRA difficulty decrease.
So BCH still uses bitcoin's NORMAL difficulty function.  IE, block difficulty readjustments ever 2 weeks, but ALSO if there is a doomsday "zero blocks" scenario, it fixes itself so the blockchain doesn't stall.
But at the end of the day, the difficulty will still readjust after 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:29:41
Hey Crytolution! 
If you want to argue that since the hard fork is a long way off, that a lot of miners might change their mind and not support it, then that's a reasonable argument. Miners MIGHT change their mind and not support segwit2X. 
But, your argument about nodes kinda misses the point. 
The problem is that if 99.9% of miners immediately switch over to segwit2X, then the legacy chain is doomed. 
It does not matter if you call it  shitcoin. Because if the hashpower is reduced to 0.1%, then the legacy chain can just be 51% attacked it oblivion by anyone and their mother. 
The only way that the legacy chain can fight back is with a proof of work change, and if that happens then both chains are hard forks.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:00:06
Well that sounds like a huge problem that Core left in when they created segwit.
Why would Core open up the network to a 4X attack that only gives us 2X capacity?
It seems like a better solution would have been to increase capacity of 2X but disallow 4MB witness only blocks that don't have transactions in them.
Do you know what gives us 2X capacity, but only exposes the network to 2X attacks?  A base block size increase!
There are also simple ways of solving the problem.  Just put a max allowed blocksize of 2.3MB, but keep the segwit discount.  That way the capacity can be 2.3X, but only exposes the network to 2.3X attacks.
If this was such a big problem, then why did Core create it?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:21:07
Engineering is about tradeoffs.
Two sides disagree about how much they care about the tradeoffs.
That doesn't mean 1 group is automatically right or wrong.  We both agree about what the tradeoffs ARE, we just don't care, because we think that Core is being way to conservative.
We don't need bitcoin to run on a raspberry pi, which apparently core cares a lot about.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:05:29
So then would you like to take back your statement about how this is about process and timing?
Your new statement is that you think that the developers do not need a blocksize increase.
If the core developer are unwilling to publicly support a blocksize increase "in general", as long as it fulfills certain criteria, then obviously the process and timeing arguments are just misdirection and delaying tactics.
The real issue has nothing to do with this other stuff.  The real issue is that the core devs fundementally do not support any more blocksize increases.
If they DO support one, as long as it is a "good" proposal, then at the very least they should list out their criteria that would need to happen for them to support it.
Like, they don't have to do the work.  But I'd like to see a whole bunch of core devs say "If a blocksize increase proposal has features X,Y, and Z then I will 100% support it."  
But once again, they won't do this.
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:44:02


Then perhaps they should create their own fork, and set a date for when it is to be deployed.
But until that code is merged into master, or at the very LEAST has a BIP that is being publicly supported by the core devs, that is all just talk, and talk is cheap.
Again, if they support a hard fork blocksize increase, then they should go ahead and release that secret code and secret BIP that they oh so support.
Until they do that, us segwit2Xers are going to continue doing what we have been doing, and there is nothing you can do to stop us.  We will not delay.  We will not postpone.  Go and put together a better proposal and we will consider it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:33:45


If I am wrong, then they can feel free to correct my mistake by creating their own BIP for whatever date they believe is the appropriate time that a blocksize hardfork should happen.  If they don't think that a blocksize increase is going to be needed until 2018, then their BIP can have that as the date.  At least then we have something CONCRETE to talk about.  No more waffling or hiding their opinion.  
Core doesn't HAVE to do anything.  I am merely point at that we are not going to stop the fork unless there is another, better proposal that has community support on the table.
If core really really wants to stop us (and with how much they are freaking out, they do seem to REAAAALLY want to stop us), the course of action that they would need to take is quite clear.  But they can feel free to do so or not do so, and we don't really care which.


Me, 90% of the hashpower, major companies like coinbase and bitpay that run basically every bitcoin merchant in the world are indeed going to do so.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:18:08
The argument is that it breaks all wallet software, and that the minority chain should instead add it.

And when segwit2X activates will you admit that you are wrong? 
The fact that they are still pushing for 2X proves that it really was about a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:13:25
Easy fix.  Just make the max total blocksize 4MB.
IE,base block is set to 2MB, witness data still gets the 1/4 weighting, but the MAX total blocksize is set to 4MB.  IE average blocksize is 3.9 MB, with a max of 4MB.
Done.  Single line of code.  There is literally a line of code that has the max block weight or something, and that could be set to 4MB.
It is disingenuous to keep bringing up a problem that is so freaking EASY to solve.

@_date: 2017-08-27 19:01:55


The ones that you just claimed don't oppose a blocksize increase but simply don't support segwit2X? So whatever group that is.
If they aren't writing code or making a BIP, or publicly supporting one of the existing hard fork blocksize increase proposals, then I see no reason to believe that they will ever do so.
If this really is some sort of principled stand against a rushed hardfork, then those principled core devs, whoever they are, should put out their own competing proposal that is oh so much better.
But until they do that, us segwit2Xers are going to continue to proceed with segwit2X.
This BS of trying to play both sides, and trying to pretend like this is about timing or rushed hardforks or whatever is frankly just getting annoying.  If there is a better proposal, then propose it or support it PUBLICLY. 
Otherwise I see no reason to think that this is anything other than the same delaying tactic that has been played over and over again.  And we are not going to get tricked into delaying again.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:36:51
Bitcoin cash is not the same as segwit2X.   You said bitcoin cash.
Bitcoin cash already exists and has replay protection, where as segwit2X is not adding replay protection.  It is not adding replay protection, because it has the support of 90% of the hashpower plus support from companies like coinbase.
So yes, the legacy core chain WILL have to add replay protection, if they care about it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:03:34
If you don't have any significant amount of economic activity, then your node doesn't mean anything.
Bitpay and coinbase account for basically every real world merchant in the world, so that is a huge amount just right there.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:29:41


This has been tried before, and has been attempted for the last 2 years.  
Segwit2X IS working with the community and the economic majority.  It just isn't working with a github repository.  
Bitcoin is run by the economic majority, not proof of github.
A blocksize hard fork would be blocked by these github repository maintainers, in the same way that it was blocked for the last 2 years.
If the github repository maintainers have a better proposal, and are willing to compromise this time around, then they should make their own blocksize increase proposal and present it to the community.
The big blockers are done with giving a couple people veto power, though.  We are just going to get the permission of the economic majority, because the economic majority was always in charge to begin with.
If the github repository maintainers are upset that they aren't being given veto power, then they should have thought about that first, before blocking perfectly reasonable proposals for the last 2 years.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:16:02

Blacklisting miners, in order to defend against 51% attacks,  is basically impossible.
This is because you need EVERY node in the entire network to ban them. 
If even a single one lets in the misbehaving miner,  then the legacy chain can be attacked. 
You are arguing that nodes can defend against 51% attacks by blacklisting, and that is just not true. Go read the bitcoin whitepaper. 
If someone is attacking the main chain via a 51% attack, they can just set up a completely new node at any time to send that attack through.

Bitcoin, as defined by Satoshi, was that you could just remove his temporary spam limit by changing 1 variable. 
Yes, he said that.
"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.
Emphasis on " old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade"
You can disagree with Satoshi, but please do not lie about what he thought.

It decreases the total blocksize to 2MB, from the 2.3 that segwit provides.
The reason why I don't consider that serious, is because nobody cares about base.  They care about total blocksize capacity.  
Setting base blocksize to 2MB for a a total blocksize decrease to 2MB, is something that nobody wants.  So it is disingenuous to put it forward as a "solution" that the big blockers want.  
I am not sure why even the small blockers would want that.  It is just a distraction.
If people think that BIP 103 is acceptable, sure that can be discussed.  But it has nothing to do with COOP, which is just a distraction.  BIP 103 should be discussed on its own merit.  It should not be bundled with a proposal that pretends to be a blocksize increase, but is actually a blocksize decrease. (2MB is smaller than 2.3MB!)
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:17:06


If his proposal is so great, then he should submit it as a BIP and publicly support it.
Thats the problem with all these other "solutions".   They are basically just distractions, created by people who don't actually want a blocksize increase.
If Core developers really are willing to do some sort of slow growth proposal, then I'd love to see them propose it and publicly support it.  They won't do this though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:18:46
Average blocksizes will be around 2.3 MB, assuming everyone uses segwit (which of course won't happen immediately). 
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:39:50
Giga blocker?  I am not really sure where you are getting that.
Obviously we couldn't do gigabyte size blocks tomorrow.  I don't think I have ever claimed otherwise.  In 20 years, perhaps we might be able to do it, if our current rate of technology change stays as it has been for the last couple decades.  But obviously not today.
I also have always been in favor of following the hashpower.
So obviously I would not support BU if it was forced to POW hard fork.  
If the hashpower stays on the core chain or segwit2X chain, then I do not believe that it is a good idea to deviate from it, so I am not really sure why that would make be a hypocrite.  
If you are forced to POW hardfork in order to keep your chain alive, then your chain is over, and you should go try to get a different proposal implemented.  So no, I would not support bitcoin unlimited if it does not have the majority hashpower and was forced to POW change.  
Similarly, I think that bitcoin cash is kinda dumb because it is a minority hashpower fork.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:06:40
Your are being dishonest.
Segwit is not 4X the capacity.  
Average blocksize will only be around 2.3 with segwit.
The big blockers do not care about max.  Nobody does.  We care about average capacity increase.
Please stop spreading this dishonest FUD about 4MB.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:29:57
This comment is hilarious.
Do you honestly believe that freaking coinbase isn't going to move to segwit2X?
Like, I am not sure how much more they can shout from the rooftops that they support it.
Do you believe that Jihan secretly doesn't support 2X either?
I am going to laugh very hard when coinbase comes out with their bitpay style segwit2X node announcement, and you'll be "surprised" that coinbase did exactly what they said they were going to do.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:52:15
Sure, but so far, 99% of the mining power has opted in, and I don't know of a singlr major miner that has said that they will stay on the legacy chain. 
If the legacy chain has a very small amount of hashpower then it can be easily attacked, and a POW change will have to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:08:13
OK cool. So if softforks don't need consensus, what happens if a large amount of people just decide to make their own softfork called "reject all segwit transactions". 
Yeah,  yeah,  now you are going to yell that this would be an attack on the network or something. But whatever argument that you make about this softfork ALSO applies as a valid argument against segwit itself.
If segwit as a softfork is fine without consensus,  then so is my "reject all segwit transactions" soft fork.
Or even better. Let's do ANOTHER blocksize increase,  on top of segwit as a soft fork, since this is possible.  And let's do that without consensus. Team 8 MB soft fork!
Are you sure soft fork without consensus is a road you want to go down?  Because the other side is perfectly willing to take advantage of that.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:14:29
Ehhh, you don't have to make bitcoin literally unusable. All you have to do is block segwit and soft fork the soft fork.

@_date: 2017-08-25 15:16:40
Average blocksize is predicted to be around 2.3 MB.

Yes, 2016 blocks, which on the main network is 2 weeks.
So if there are less blocks it will take more time, but with the difficulty trapdoor, the BCH chain is in no danger of stalling out.
But as soon as you get to a SINGLE difficulty adjustment, then everything works out.  And if other "attackers" are mining more blocks, well then it will just adjust faster.

You can do what you want, but basically every single merchant is in the world is going to follow segwit2X, because they all use bitpay and coinbase, and THOSE companies are following segwit2X.

If the problem is process, and timing, then Core should publicly state that they support a blocksize increase, and put all this work on the Core roadmap, along with expected dates of completion.

@_date: 2017-08-20 22:10:17
You have misinterpreted the problem.
Segwit does this really dumb thing with a witness data discount.  
What they should have done is something that would result in 2MB average blocks, with a max blocksize of around ~2MB as well.
If the awesome core developers don't see this as a problem though, because they wrote segwit to include this flaw, then I am not going to treat it as a problem either.

People won't sell. They won't be able to, because the legacy chain will be extremely vulnerable to double spend attacks and more. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:48:47
Thats fine, but you have to admit then that these "smart contracts" are basically useless right?
The whole point of smart contracts was supposed to be that nothing matters except for the actual code.  
It has now come to light that this is NOT the situation, and you may as well just use a regular contract, with all the subjectively that comes along with it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:20:46
Oh?  And which miners have stated that they do not plan on following the 2X Hard fork?
As far as I am aware, it is &lt;1% of the hashpower.  
If I am wrong, then please name a SINGLE one that explicitly stated that they do not plan on following the 2X part.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:28:19
You are talking about the COOP omnibus proposal, correct?  Thats what the link that you posted goes to.
I am glad that you brought that one up. 
Yes, yes that proposal is a poison pill!
After re-reading the mailing list The COOP proposals sets a hard cap of 2MB, but changes the segwit discount.
So COOP would result in a hard max of 2MB block capacity, that can be either segwit or legacy transactions.
This is obviously not what the big blockers had in mind when they talk about 2MB + segwit.  2MB plus segwit means 2MB base blocksize, with the segwit discount, for an average of 4MB total capacity (and up to 8MB max block size).
The REALLY interesting thing is that the COOP proposal is actually a blocksize DECREASE when you compare it to regular segwit!  Regular segwit is expected to do ~2.3 MB of capacity, where as COOP is only 2MB.
So yes, I do consider any  blocksize decrease proposals to be equivalent to a not serious, poison pill proposal.
Now, if you are arguing that you want the proposals to be as is, for 4MB average, along with your legacy chain attack feature, but you want it to be pushed back to 6 months, then yes, that is a good compromise proposal.
And if the majority of Core supported it, then even I would support it as well.  A serious blocksize hardfork proposal from Core is all anybody has been asking for.  
But unfortunately, the likelihood of Core supporting that, and merging it, seems low, so I am not going to get my hopes up.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:32:13
Because those proposals are either delaying tactics or poison pills. 
If segwit2X includes those "features" and "protections", it makes all wallets incompatible. 
There is no reason to do that when we can fork and take the wallets with us, that are programmed to follow the most hashpower. 
And it would be done for no benefit. 
Core would NOT all of a sudden start supporting a blocksize increase if it included those poison pill "features". 
It is too late to go about changing everything.
If those features are so awesome, then Core should merge them into the official Core client and see how it goes.  
They won't though, because these are not serious recommendations, with any amount of support.  If they DO have support, then they should be merged, but Core won't do this.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:39:12
Then those core devs should feel free to create a BIP, write the code, and merge it to master in the bitcoin core github repo.
Until they, at the very LEAST, create a BIP and publicly support it, well then that is all just talk.
Segwit has yet to produce those "4MB" blocks that everyone was talking about, and isn't going to do so for a very long time, if ever.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:55:49
Coin.dance currently shows that Kraken supports segwit2X.  You all are dreaming, and taking people's words out of context.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:47:15
You were recommending implementing "protections" ie wallet-incompatible replay protections, as well as "excellent" forks such as spoonet.  
I was pointing out why these are a bad idea.  They basically ensure that segwit2X would fail, and are poison pill recommendations at this point.
The 2MB fork in November is only disruptive to the people on the legacy chain.  
If the legacy chain wants to prevent that disruption, then they can feel free to add those "replay" protections themselves, or POW hardfork off in order to protect themselves. 
Whether you call this an "attack" or not is not our problem.  You can either move to the new chain where the economic majority is going, or you can implement these "protections" on the Core chain, and hardfork off the network.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:19:21
Thats not what the code says.
I am not sure where you are getting this 32MB thing, when thats not what the code does.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:14:58
Be careful what you wish for.
A second blocksize increase will just be added via a soft fork, through extension blocks, if segwit2X fails.
Good luck stopping a fully backwards-compatible soft fork blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:35:08
Sure, as is segwit2X. 
When 90% of the hashpower, as well as major companies like coinbase and bitpay move over to it in November, I can assume that you won't say anything about a takeover or core being fired, and you will admit that the economic majority has spoken and that it is just another open source project,  correct?
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:17:06


Don't you mean "space network"?
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:26:33
And then as soon as they stop mining.... the difficulty decreases.  It makes zero sense to mine on the chain, as an attack, because as soon as you stop the difficulty decreases.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:57:13


Yes.  Please do that.  That would be wonderful.  
You've got 2 options.  Follow segwit2X, or POW hardfork.  
You are getting a hardfork one way or another, because the main chain will have 1% hashpower and could be 51% attacked by anyone who feels like it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:56:01
Here you go!
Here are some choice quotes:
"Blocks are too large right now"
"But that's several years (decades perhaps) away"
He literally thinks that a blocksize increase won't be needed for decades.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:20:12
And the solution is to have the discount but put ANOTHER maximum on the blocks that only allows the blocks to be size 2.3MB. 
IE you make 4MB witness only blocks impossible. Easy.

They are mining on a new "fork".  You can't force miners to mine on the fork that you like.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:20:47
LOL!  No.  It is just a delaying tactic.
If Core really wants to see big blocks, then they should make a BIP, set a date, and PUBLICLY support it.
If they did this, it would stop segwit2X in its tracks.
They will not do this though, because Core developers are EXPLICTLY against any future blocksize increases anytime within the next decade.
Read the stuff that Luke-jr says.  He explicitly says "no more blocksize increases beyond segwit, within the next decade".
Luke-jr even wants a blocksize DECREASE.

Bit 4 means what the people signalling it intended it to mean.
Every single miner who signaled bit 4 was doing it to signal new york agreement.
Were you a miner, with 10% hashpower?  No?  Then your opinion on what bit 4 means, does not matter.  The only people's opinion who matters on that decision, is the actual people signalling.  They the actual people signalling, were very very clear about what it meant.  It meant New York Agreement.

Bitcoin, and crytocurrencies are the complete opposite of being "together".   Bitcoin is about being about to choose your own rules, not being forced into one set of rules via the heckler's veto.
Forking is, and always has been everyone's right.
You can feel free to stay on whatever chain that you want, and the rest of us can fork, as is our right.
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:28:32


Its almost as if people should have started working on this stuff 2 years ago.  
Oh wait.  The big blockers DID try to get that to happen.  And there was resistance from core every step of the way.
Core is not interested in any more blocksize increases anytime within a decade.
So it is difficult for me to go along with arguments like "lets just wait and test stuff more" when it is all just a delaying tactic that is meant to stop all progress.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:23:39

@_date: 2017-08-06 19:17:57
A blocksize increase is about to be testing on the main chain.
Segwit was a blocksize increase.
So if the small blockers are right, then all those doomsday scenarios will partly start to show up on the main chain.
If those bad big blocks side effects DON'T show up though.... well that means that the small blockers were wrong.
The facts and evidence will prove who is right.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:13:21
You can do whatever you want. 
But 99% of the hashpower is going to follow segwit2X, along with companies like coinbase. 
If you want to stay on the chain that can be 51% attacked by anyone and their mother, then be my guest. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:23:10
A blocksize increase can happen easily via a soft fork.  Both segwit, and other proposals, like extension blocks, are soft fork blocksize increases.
But every time extension blocks get brought up, the small blockers yell "OMG a soft fork is the same thing as a 51% attack!!!!!  Don't attack the network!!!"
When people suggest soft forking, it is mostly just another delaying tactic that is used to push back the blocksize increase even further down the line, until the clock runs out.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:16:59


If this is so important to you, then Core should add replay protections to ITS chain.
If they aren't willing to do that, then obviously they don't care about replay protection either.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:36:05


I was merely curious WHICH specific miners you believe are going to defect.  There really aren't to many of them to choose from.
The only one I can think of that would even consider it is Bitfury, because bitfury was one of the bigger segwit supporters.  But the problem is that the UASFers REALLY pissed bitfury off a couple months ago, by threatening to proof of work change (Go read the stuff that Luke-jr was saying.  He had a POW change in reserves, in case UASF got less than 10% of the hashpower)
So I am not sure if bitfury is going to side with people who were threatening to destroy their entire business.  If the segwit'ers and luke-jr are willing to threaten to POW change once, maybe they are going to threaten it again in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:55:03
And how are those "4MB" segwit blocks coming along?
Oh?  There aren't any?  The network is staying exactly how it was before, and there has been close to zero effect on capacity and fees?
Will you look at that.  Crazy.
Let me know when those predictions that you linked to come true.  Segwit's "block size increase" is in full effect right now.  So those evil, terrible, negative effects that you claim are going to happen should start to become measurable.
Personally I think we will be waiting a long time before those predictions come true.  And we are recording and measuring data RIGHT NOW about who was right and who was wrong.
" I don't know anyone who has replicated those results more recently."
All you got to do is look at our "4MB" segwit network that is playing out.  All we have to do is wait, and the data will prove who was right.

It can scale at the same rate of bandwidth costs decreasement, which has gone down by 20% every year for the last couple decades. 
20% every years adds up pretty quickly. 
If that trend continues, then we absolutely will reach Visa levels eventually. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:56:26
Extension blocks was already created, and released a couple months ago by Poon, the original creator of the lightning network, and Jeffrey.
Core should have taken that proposal seriously, if it actually cared about compromising.
But they didn't.  Instead, many accused Poon of being secretly funded by Bitmain or something and shit all over his proposal.  People called him a traitor to bitcoin for doing good work.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:29:41
The problem with that logic is that even if it is an "alt coin", the main chain will STILL be doomed. 
Read the stuff that Luke-Jr is saying in this thread. 
If 99% of the hashpower moves to segwit2X, then they plan on POW hard forking, and then BOTH chains will be "altcoins". 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:08:51

Technology is rapidly improving and bandwidth costs are constantly decreasing at a rate of 20% every year. 
Sure, we couldn't do Visa levels tomorrow. In the same way that the 1999 Internet couldn't have handled 1 MB blocks (if Bitcoin had been invented then) . But the internet got better, faster and cheaper since then. 
And it will continue to get better faster and cheaper, until we potentially CAN handle visa levels. 
It is not going to happen tomorrow, but a few more decades of 20% improvements every year adds up very quickly. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:42:27

You are focused too much on the hard fork part.

Then your only option will be to hard fork yourself with a POW change.

Well it is an "alt" that 90% of all merchants will be following.

@_date: 2017-08-05 03:33:53
Ugg. If all those other hard fork wish list items are so important, then maybe Core should make a BIP that includes both them AND a blocksize increase hard fork. 
Talking about the hard fork wishlist is just ANOTHER delaying tactic. It is not a good faith proposal. It is just another attempt to poison pill the big blocks proposals that have a serious chance of succeeding. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:09:34

Coin.Dance shows a much different picture of how much of the economy supports segwit2X than your link. 
Your link is straight up dishonest as many of the companies on that list are explicitly neutral, and aren't segwit2X opponents. 
I very much look forward to November, when  2x activates without replay protection, amd I get to LOL at all this FUD, and say "I told you so. It looks like the economy really does support 2X".

That doesn't make sense.  As soon as these "attackers" stop mining, then the difficulty will be reduced.
Attackers are free to spend their money helping out the bitcoin cash chain, it doesn't cause any permanent difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:49:36
The blocksize is not quadruped though.
The Average blocksize stays at at 2.3 MB.  That is actual data that is sent over the network.  
4MB blocks are actually impossible, as that would mean the transaction is entirely witness data, but even 3.9 MB blocks are not likely.

It is a pretty simple clarification about a major aspect of how it works.  No need to go in to complicated technicals.

This is a very simple high level clarification.

The official policy of most of the bitcoin core team is that they support a blocksize increase in theory, they just don't agree with how it was currently done. 
So either the bitcoin core team disagrees with your or the bitcoin core team is full of liers. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:21:59
What matters is the actual effect on the network. 
The fact that nobody is actually using segwit is slowing proving that segwit isn't as great as it was advertised to be. 
Is something that will create 2MB blocks a decade from now a "scaling solution". Most would say no. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:51:40
A hardfork blocksize increase was always at significant risk of being rejected.
I have criticized the various hardfork blocksize increases in the past for that, because I believed their tactics weren't as good as they could be.
This is not over.  The next step is to gather support for a soft fork blocksize increase, such as extension blocks.  Segwit was a softfork blocksize increase, so we know that it is possible to deploy these to the network.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:24:58
All of the bitcoin core team will tell you that they support a blocksize increase. They just disagree with how it was done.

..... Back in 2015.  And yet now it is late 2017.  Do those people support those proposals now? 
These proposals were made during a timeperiod where all the miners were signaling "8MB". These proposals were "moderate" at the time. 
And now, 2 years later, when the big blockers have changed their proposals downward the goal posts have moved. 
Now these people aren't supporting their previously "moderate" proposals. 
The reason they aren't supporting them, IMO, is because they were never serious to begin with. It was all just a delaying game, so that they could get their favorite changes approved, and then move the goal posts to something different. 
I would love it if the members of the bitcoin core team we're willing to publicly come out in support of "moderate" proposals such as the ones that Pieter and Adam did back in the day. 
But I am not going to get my hopes up.

The facts I've stated seem to be fairly uncontroversial.  I mean, they ARE the official position of most of the bitcoin core team.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:49:23
Fine, then how about the Core Development team merges a 2MB base block hard fork?
How about they make a BIP?  How about they come out in support of ANYTHING AT ALL!  ANYTHING!
Pick a date.  Any date.
If they aren't willing to do anything of that, then you cannot pretend that they support this.
@_date: 2015-08-27 04:21:45
Perhaps the 1 byte self destruct situation is unlikely, but I could see a miner, who really really supports small blocks, to vote to reduce the blocksize to a 1/4 MB.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:38:09
Those wallets had over a year of warning to implement segwit. 
How come they didn't do that? Is it perhaps because they didn't want it enough to spend the effort to do so? 
The conclusion that we CAN draw is that apparently very few Bitcoin developers and companies wanted segwit enough that they were willing to spend the time making their service compatible.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:06
Extension blocks is definitely the best solution. 
Unfortunately, you'll have to convince Bitcoin core of that.  The original lightning network developer created an extension blocks fork and all the other Core developers called him a sellout. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:48:05
A blocksize hardfork without the support of the core team always had some risk of failure.  It is the reason why I have advocated in the past for extension blocks, which is a soft fork, and only needs the support of the miners. (a hardfork plan is better than no plan though, obviously) 
se la vie.  Plans fail, and you move on, and work on the next plan.  Segwit2X certainly got a lot closer to suceeding then any of the other blocksize hardfork attempts.  So thats something.
But, since the original plan didn't work, then we'll have to go with following whatever plan the Core team has for increasing the blocksize, as stated in their Core Roadmap.
They have said in all their public statements that they support a blocksize increase, just not how the current movement went about it.
So I am very interested in learning what their plan is.  Well, unless of course, they were all just lying, which is certainly a possibility.
But either way, I'd love to know what their plan is, that they've stated to have, or if they were all just lying the whole time.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:00:12
Ok then.  how about they state PRECISELY what would fall under the definition of "needed".
Is it average transaction fees?  It is related to bandwith costs? Is it related to total number of nodes on the network?  Is it related to how "decentralized" the current network is?
Have they thought about ANY of these metrics at all?  Those are just some I came up with in 60 seconds.
Literally ANYTHING AT ALL, would be nice.  Any PRECISE metric.
Because as far as I can tell "needed" according to the core developers, is 30 years from now.
If the Core Devs aren't willing to precisely say what would cause them to support it, then they don't get to play both sides and pretend like they support it.
Refusal to give any specifications basically means "never".
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:08:34
Wow. Look at that segwit adoption rate. 1.05 MB average block size. 
Much scaling. Such blocksize increase. 
Maybe in a decade or 2 it will reach that fabled 2MB, that it was advertised to be. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:30:48
Segwit decreases decentralization because it increases the blocksize. 
So that means that you oppose segwit I guess? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:25:23
And the fact that nobody seems to be using segwit proves that segwit wasn't such a great scaling solution after all. It did not live up to what it was advertised to be.  
It is a flaw with segwit. Segwit apparently sucks so much that the economic majority doesn't seem to be interestes in using it. 
I could have told you THAT a couple months ago. 
The big blockers could have explained this to you and BashCo months ago.
Segwit is not living up to the hype. As proved by the network right now.

Did you read my comment?
I said BASE blocksize increase.  Everybody knows what that means.  That means that 2MB of legacy transactions would be allowed, and up to 8MB of segwit transactions.  Anybody who does not know that is either a troll or an idiot.
Go take a look at those "3.7 MB blocks" that don't exist on the network right now.
It seems like segwit wasn't much of a blocksize increase after all.  As the average blocks are still barely at 1MB.  
Let me know in 20 years when that average gets above 2MB.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:38:21
Well if you think that they are telling the truth, then it should be simple to admit that "the core devs support a blocksize increase". 
People on this very thread are refusing to say that. 
Either Core supports a blocksize increase, or they are all liars. 
It is one or the other. And both of these situations don't seem so great for people here on reddit.

Some "doubling". 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:12:15
But don't you think it would be a good idea to talk about these useful metrics?
How come there is ZERO discussion about metrics like this?  And that nobody at all will give their definition of what they think is a "healthy" network, or what would cause the network to "need" a blocksize increase?
I mean, isn't this supposed to be a meritocracy, where we use data, and science and metrics, and facts to come to the correct conclusion?
And yet nobody at all on the Core team is talking about metrics or facts or data?
Hmm, I wonder why.....  Maybe because it was all a lie and a delaying tactic from the very beginning....
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:36:38
Do you disagree with the official stance of most of the bitcoin core team then? 
I am merely giving information about what they claim to believe. 
A hardfork without the support of the core team always had some risk of failure. 
So I guess now we'll have to go along with whatever blocksize increase plan that the Core team supports. 
Everything that they've stated is that they DO support a blocksize increase eventually.. They just don't support how the current plan was implemented. 
Or were they lying?

There are multiple ways of measuring this beforehand. 
For example,  if 90% of the major exchanges come out and say that they support a UASF,  and will not support the competing chain,  then you definitely have the economic majority.
If the economic majority is not clear and obvious to everyone in the community, then you don't have it.
If you don't have multiple metrics that prove that the economic majority is on your side,  then you don't have the economic majority's support.
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:01:59
Consensus by declaring that you have consensus isn't a great algorithm.

Well, he's supporting the "compromise" 2MB HF + 2MB segwit proposal.
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:51:09
So... They held up their end of the deal by creating a fork that DECREASES THE BLOCKSIZE.
Do you honestly believe that any big blocker at all would support that?  
Why would anybody possibly agree to this?  I want some legitimate explanation of the thoughts that would be going through a miner's head or a big blocker's head, about why they would ever make such a deal if they knew that the people making it would create code that does literally the opposite of what they asked AND that they had no intention of merging.
Fine how about this.  New Hong Kong deal.  The miners agree to activate segwit in 2030.  That is technically holding up their end of the deal.  There was no exact date that the miner agreed to.  They only agreed to "run segwit in production".  They can just run segwit, but add a patch that removes the activation signal.  So they are being completely honest and genuine by activating segwit in 2030.
Or how about this deal.  They activate segwit right now, AND activate another soft fork that makes segwit invalid, completely rendering segwit useless.  Totally holding up their end of the deal.  You can't accuse the miners of anything!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:04
Before you all start celebrating, you should know that this isn't over.
A hard fork blocksize increase may have failed, but doing the blocksize increase via hard fork always was going to have this risk. (I have criticized it for this risk in the past, but sometime you just have to make do)
The next step, IMO, is to do a blocksize increase via a softfork, for example, by using extension blocks.  
Segwit was a soft fork blocksize increase, so it should be known that since one already happened, that it can happen again.  
You only need miner support to do a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:22:17
Or just fix the "problems" with extension blocks and see what happens.
Extension blocks can be made segwit compatible and can be made asic boost incompatible.
Everyone wins.

Yes, it should have biases! Do you know which biases I agree with? I agree with the biases, and white paper originally set out by Satoshi. And guess what?

Then segwit was designed incorrectly and we need to fix it by removing the variable block size.  
It would be great if segwit provided exactly 4MB, without this discount thing, so as to maximize the number of transactions that can go in 4 MB blocks.

Yes,  and now the information is available, so anyone can peer review it!

Bitcoin hardforked from 512kb to 1mb, already. (There was a database change that made 1mb blocks not accepted, thus hardfork). And bitcoin didn't have any trouble dealing with that.

No, if Brian disagrees then he can choose to run different software. If miners disagree they can do the same. If users disagree, they can choose to buy/sell bitcoin on whichever fork they prefer. 
THAT is how consensus works. Core is free to do what it wants, and everyone else is free to go along with them or ignore them, as they prefer.
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:00:26
Segwit is a form of extension blocks.  They are the same thing.
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:11:58
Node count isn't what matters.  What matters is the "economic majority".
Unfortunately, the UASF proponents refuse to give a definition of what exactly that means in a way that is measurable and falsifiable ahead of time.  
(I guess you can always define economic majority as "if it succeeds then we had the majority, if it does not, then we didn't have the majority".  But that is circularly true by definition so.... it is stupid and useless for predictions.)  
They are using the "consensus" algorithm known as "consensus by just declaring that you have consensus".
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:43:51
I do,  and I did. 
So,  as we can now agree, there is no more problems with the whole "didn't allow people to peer review".
The proposal was peer reviewed on the mailing list,  and there is no issue with that. It can be judged on its merits,  not BS "waaah, they didn't email me first! " arguments.

Its called open source.  "rival implementations" is how open source works.  Anybody can fork anything and make whatever changes they want.

@_date: 2016-02-21 08:22:12
Ok, but was this new consensus an actual comittment from core?  
Or in 3 month are a bunch of core people going to come around and say "Uhh, that consensus was done by individuals, NOT by us Core developers.  We still aren't committing to an specific date for the HF."
And then we are back to where we started, with more roundtables, and meetings and "consensus".
I don't understand why it is so hard to get an unequivocal "YES, WE CORE DEVELOPERS ARE HARDFORKING ON THIS DATE".  
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:02:12
No, miners can completely ignore the extension block chain.  The only restriction that they have to implement to be 100% safe is "don't spend anything from the anyone can spend tx".  IE, don't steal people's bitcoins.
But they absolutely can continue to validate normal, non-extension blocks transactions on the original 1 MB chain. 
The only real risk is if you get sent a block with invalid extension block data, and then you starting mining on an invalid block.  But this isn't a problem if over half the network is rejecting invalid extension block data.
It works exactly in the same way that segwit does, and is as equally "opt in" as segwit is.
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:52:34
Thats what the community is doing right now!  Bitcoin classic is the actual method in which a group of people is trying to determine consensus!
If the economic majority agrees with Core, then they will stay with Core.  If they agree with Classic then they will hard fork to classic.  
Thats how the economic consensus works.

Would you have any problem with a Core announcement like that?
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:19:25
No.  UASF is about orphaning blocks that don't signal.

@_date: 2017-04-13 05:39:35
Uggg, I don't think you understand how segwit works.
The ONLY way to get 4MB of transactions is to include 4MB of witness data.  AKA, 4 MB of data that sends a single bitcoin transaction.
I don't want 4MB of data to be used to send a single bitcoin transaction.  That is spam.  What I want is for bitcoin's ~7 transactions per second average capacity to increase to 28 transactions per second.
And the way that you do that, is you get rid of the witness data discount, and you just have straight up 4 MB blocks.
Right now segwit allows lots of witness data, and not a lot of normal, transaction data.  But normal transaction data is the important part!  It is the NOT spam part!  
Segwit allows people to spam the network with useless witness data, when we should instead be increasing the transaction volume of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:49:45
Not really.  If miners have 51% of hashpower on their side, they can soft fork whatever changes they want, including a soft fork blocksize increase.
They can soft fork, because they will be the longest valid chain, and they will be valid even to people who "disagree" with the soft fork.
The purpose of miner signaling is to figure out if you have 51% or not, so I wouldn't call that meaningless.
You can still soft fork in other ways, but miner soft forking can't really be stopped, unless you do a fork of your own, or you for some reason decide to follow a minority chain, even though the majority chain is also valid to you.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:25:44
Meh. That's a bad attack. 
A better attack is to just soft fork a second time and orphan all segwit transactions. 
Nonsegwit transactions are still valid under segwit. So this would "prevent" segwit from doing anything. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:46:47
Uhh, Jihan got exactly what he wanted on litecoin.  He got a commitment to increase the blocksize if blocks are ever filled.
If segwit included an addition 2MB increase, for a total of 4MB average transaction size, then segwit would easily be supported by all the big blockers and all of the mining pools.
@_date: 2017-04-01 06:49:12
Sure.  The same way that segwit increases the blocksize.  Using extension blocks and a discount parameter.  
Segwit increases the blocksize to 4MB max (average 2MB).  We could easily increase it further by placing some of the transaction or signature data in a different location and changing the discount parameter.
@_date: 2016-02-21 05:06:47
Because if the roadmap doesn't commit to a specific date, they why would we believe that core is EVER going to do a hard fork?  The purpose is accountability.

@_date: 2017-04-13 02:20:01
You've got your numbers wrong.  Segwit is 2MB average.
Segwit + 2 MB HF is 4 MB average.
If Core really does support 4MB, then how about we get rid of the discount parameter thing and just make it 4MB flat?
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:30:26
You can raise the blocksize using a SF, segwit does it. So we could do the same thing and raise it even further via soft fork. 
SF vs HF is a weird debate as a SF can do basically anything,  including changing the POW algorithm, increase blocksize,  increase 21mil cap, ect 
@_date: 2017-04-13 02:32:02

Thats why they could use multiple metrics.
IE, things like "cost of running a node" is a very easy metric that couldn't be gamed.  They could say "If computer hardware, and bandwidth prices get cut in half, then by would mean that the network can handle an X% blocksize increase".
Or things like "number of users using these various bitcoin services".  What, are the big blockers going to hack an all the exchanges, so as to fake user numbers?
It is not about just 1 metric.  It is about having a freaking discussion of the multitude of various things that could be considered.  And if 1 metric doesn't work then use a different one.
But nobody seems to be interested in having this discussion.  The discussion is the important part, not an exact number or whatever.

Correct, they will be incompatible. And then you as a user can choose which chain you want to buy from and sell from. The market would VERY quickly decide which one is "bitcoin" and which is the altcoin, causing one to be worth a lot and the other to be worth 0. That is how the market would vote.

It does if I can convince other people to accept my rules.  And it does matter if those people start calling it bitcoin.  Thats what a soft fork is.
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:37:06
Sure,  and then later these miners can orphan all segwit blocks. Not orphan signaling. But soft fork the soft fork, and then ONLY include non-segwit, but perfectly valid bitcoin transactions.
UASF goes both ways. 
If game theory says that a minority can fork segwit then a minority can also make segwit blocks invalid.

Nodes don't have to upgrade though. 
Nodes follow the hashpower of the longest valid chain. 
If you produce an invalid block, under the new SF rules,   it would be orphaned by the miners. 
If miners soft fork to increase the blocksize via extension blocks,  and the miners have the most hashpower, then the unupgraded nodes would follow. 
This is because a soft fork blocksize increase via extension blocks is still a valid chain.
@_date: 2017-04-22 03:00:56

The problem is that a lot of people get the shorts in a twist when you suggest something like this.

I agree with you.  Core is not in charge, and has never been in charge.  The community is in charge and decides what bitcoin is.  Core just makes suggestions, and if we don't want to listen to their suggestions and go with someone else's suggestions, thats ok.

Ok, but what if 2 groups want the consensus code to be different?
It is not always about "find the best solution", because different solutions have different trade-offs.  A trade-off is not strictly better or worse.
It is a questions of fundamental values.  You can't "cooperate" with someone who has different fundamental values.  Both you, and the other people have valid reasons to support their solution, and no amount of compromise, or review process changes the fact that a trade off is a trade off.
We should absolutely use a BIP process, and peer review.
But we can have a decentralized BIP process and decentralized peer review.  Whether or not a BIP is approved by one specific group of developers is of no importance.  Sure, they can give their feedback as well.  Go ahead.  But they have zero "authority" over whether these changes are deployed on the network.  They are not in charge, they do not have veto power.
Nobody is splitting anything up.  Open source means open source.  If one group of developers wants to merge in the changes to their singular github repo, they are free to do so at any time.

"Yes! Segregated witness replaces the block size limit with a new block weight limit, counting each byte of witness data as 1 unit of weight and UTXO transaction data as 4 units; as a result, the maximum size of a block becomes just under 4 MB.
However, blocks are not expected to consist entirely of witness data, so blocks near 4 MB in size would be unlikely."

Sure, they have to share the same consensus.
Have about Core gets with the program and fixes their consensus code to provide something that people want?
Or how about they allow users to decide on the consensus code, by accepting the extension blocks changes, and allowing users to vote on it?
@_date: 2017-04-04 14:56:02
Size is TBD.
Extension blocks can be as big or as small as the "community" wants them to be.
Unfortunately, there are differing opinions about what the "community" wants.
I really like this extension block approach because it completely bypasses the HF vs SF debate and gets to the meat of the argument.  That being, do we want limited capacity, with higher fees, or less decentralization and lower fees.
No more FUD about "changing the rules" or altcoins or whatever, because it is an opt in soft fork!

Ok, but we are already on a hard fork.  Bitcoin has hardforked twice already.  
And even if it is considered a "new currency", people publicly make new altcoins all the time and they aren't being sent to jail.
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:45:55
Give the signature even more of a discount?  Add an additional space where you can put the signature?  Move out parts of the signature?
According to Core there are are multiple ways to do this.  It isn't some big challenge to use extension blocks to increase the blocksize even further via soft fork.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:40:44
Because fixing the problems with extension blocks is easy and the creator has already offered to fix them. Nobody is wasting any time. 
There is nothing wrong with having multiple proposals and having the community decide which is best. 
Or we can do both!  Segwit gets activated AND extension blocks. 
Extension blocks is completely opt in,  so you have nothing to worry about.

One of the chains will give up. 
Nobody is going to spends millions on a failed chain. 
That doesn't mean that UASF will win though. They could just as easily be on the wrong side,  if they don't have "economic majority".

@_date: 2017-04-10 21:34:53
Ok, cool.  Then how does the "economic majority" get measured?
What falsifiable metric or stat are you using to determine if you do (or do NOT!) have the economic majority on your side?

We don't have to hardfork to increase the blocksize.  We can use extension blocks and increase the blocksize even more, in the exact same way that segwit increases the blocksize.
And now, litecoin is going to blocksize increase when their blocks fill up.

You are basically the only person who has put out any falsifiable definition of economic majority.
Defining what the economic majority is, is not a minor side issue.  It is literally the most important problem that needs to be solved for a UASF.  It is the only thing that makes a UASF work.
And yet, for how extremely important it is, websites like this:
mention the "economic majority" 20 times, while barely touching on what it means.  There should be paragraph after paragraph describing the technical details of the economic majority, instead of only half a sentence included on the site that says "uhh, wallets and exchanges are important".
The economic majority is the only thing that  gives  and of this stuff even half a chance of working, and yet nobody seems to care about defining it.
Where is the "economic majority" whitepaper that I can read?  Where are the discussions and comments from PhD economics professors? I can get the same exact things, when discussing the hard, interesting crytographic problems of bitcoin.  
But for economic majority, there is nothing.  Because nobody cares, they just want to plug their ears and gamble that everything will work out.

Agreed, of all of the ways that a UASF COULD be done, BIP 148 makes no sense.
It makes ALL unupgraded nodes invalid.  
If you are going to UASF segwit, then don't orphan people who refuse to signal.  The way that you do it, is you just activate segwit!  Don't orphan non-signallers, orphan invalid segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:32:10
The spirit of the agreement is that segwit and 2MB HF are a package deal.
There is literally no point at all to the Hong Kong consensus if it is just 2 developers, acting as individuals writing fork code that they know will never be merged.  
Why would any miner be stupid enough to agree to THAT deal?
The developers played stupid games where they thought that they had tricked the miners into agreeing to a bad deal by writing code that they never intended on using... and well, those developers have now learned that this trick didn't work out too well for them after all.

@_date: 2017-04-01 02:40:08
I am in favor of a segwit + 2MB HF solution, but this proposal is dangerous.
The plan is to set the HF date AFTER segwit happens, which means that groups can fake signal, and then prevent the HF later on.  
Any "compromise" solution should make both changes happen at the same time, to prevent groups from changing their mind or fake signaling/lying.
Also, doing a 2mb Segwit SF AND and additional 2 MB SF is probably easier to get past the community.  I am not sure if the other side is ever going to allow a HF.  But thats ok, you can do basically anything with a SF.  May as well up the ante and soft fork to an even higher blocksize than segwit provides.
@_date: 2017-04-13 05:21:32
Because on average the blocksize would be 2MB.  It absolutely is variable.  Sometimes blocks will be 1 MB, and in rare cases they will be 4MB.
Lets fix that so it is always 4MB.  No variables.  just 4 MB of data that could be either transaction data OR witness data, and 4 MB all the time.
It does not provide 4MB all the time.  If I include 4MB of transaction only data, and zero MB of witness data, my block will be rejected.
The only way to get 4MB is to include 4MB of witness data.  That is not useful.  I want to provide 4 MB of regular transaction data.
@_date: 2017-04-13 02:33:56


So.... you mean.... like a soft fork?  The same thing that segwit does?
Extension blocks does literally the exact same thing as segwit does.
It has all the advantages and all the disadvantages of segwit.

Yes...  And they can make improvements based on those suggestions.
That's how the process works. 
What I am annoyed by is all the people freaking out because Greg didn't get first dibs.
It is fine to have lots of proposals from lots of different people, and when there are problems with a proposal, as has been brought up with extension blocks,  we can fix the problems and make a new proposal. 
Or we can make am entirely different proposal! 
This whole secret conspiracy stuff and people getting offended because they didn't receive an email is BS.  The majority of objections I see to extension blocks is because of the "didn't email" thing,  and that argument is dishonest.

@_date: 2017-04-13 02:39:48
No.  I suggest that there should be multiple bitcoin development teams working on multiple, divert, and potentially incompatible clients.
The users and the economic majority would then decide what bitcoin is.
Developers only make suggestions.  They don't control anything.  Well they do.  They control a single github repository.  But a single github repository does not define what bitcoin is.  That decision is up to the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:27:38
The experts support a blocksize increase.  Yes, even a hardfork blocksize increase.
Check the Core roadmap.  It is all there.
The "debate" is about WHEN the inevitable blocksize increase above and beyond that which segwit provides, will happen.  Will it be in 2017? 2018? 2020?  
That is the debate.  It is about picking the year when it happens, because Core supports blocksize increases, as specified in the Core roadmap.
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:59:22
Users of the bitcoin protocol are anyone involved in any aspect of bitcoin.
They are bitcoin holders.  They are wallet developers.  They are exchanges.
These different users have different amounts of economic power.  And they exert that power on the bitcoin protocol.
And they can make up whatever rules they want, and nobody can stop them.  They can also convince other users to run their rules.  And if they get enough people to agree on something, their rules have an economic effect.
Don't like it?  Then run your own rules, buy on the chain that you agree with, and sell on the chain that you don't agree with, thus exerting your economic power as a user.
I as a user can buy and sell on whatever chain I want.  THAT is what it means when people say that users control bitcoin and users make the rules.

What if I were to tell you that Core supports a blocksize increase BEYOND that which is provided by segwit.
They support it!  It is literally in the core roadmap!  The debate is that although they support it, there are disagreements about WHEN it should be deployed.
Some core devs say that we could have 4MB in a couple years, and others, like luke-jr, say that it could be decades.
Please listen to the experts.  And the experts currently support a blocksize increase &gt; segwit..... sometime in the future.
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:23:21
If segwit was changed to be an average of 4MB, instead of 2MB, then it would be supported and activated by the miners overnight.
Big blockers and miners have been yelling for years that this is what they want. 
Do this and segwit gets activated. So yes,  a meeting like what ltc did would definitely work. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 15:33:12
I don't think that you understand the whole ethos of open source development.
You are not married to one "side" or the other.  Everyone is free to make suggestions to the community.  And it is OK for people to support 1 proposal, and then submit their own, slightly different proposal.
Suggestions should be evaluated based on the merit of the proposal.  Not based on who proposing them.  Core devs make suggestions just like anyone else in the community can.

Consensus is defined as "lots of other people agree with you".
Just asserting that everyone else agrees with you doesn't make it true.
If you make such an assertion, you should be prepared to back up your opinion with evidence.
You could back up your assertion of fact, for example, by pointing to a dozen or so exchanges or major companies that all that has put out a press release saying that they are in favor of a UASF.  
But so far the major players in the space have yet to come out in favor.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:39:12
Extension blocks are opt in.  You don't have to use them if you don't want to.  The 1MB blocksize limit will stay exactly as it is, and you can continue to use/mine on top of it.
From the perspective of someone who doesn't know the changes are happening, It is really not much different from putting your transactions on the lightning network or any other 2nd layer solution.
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:56:44
There is no forcing involved.  If you want to stay on the legacy chain, feel free.  Those of us who want to continue on with the block size increase, without replay protection, will continue to do so, and there is nothing that you can do to force us to stop.

If Bitcoin is so centralized that it can be severely damaged by a couple high profile developers leaving, then I really hope this happens now, before Bitcoin gets really big, so that the bitcoin community doesn't have to worry about this risk vector.

"If all developers of Bitcoin disappear (and don't come back, and aren't replaced), Bitcoin will die.

 Fortunately, none of these are realistic possibilities" 
I certainly hope so. But that is not the argument that everyone has been making here for months. 
The argument that everyone has been making is that if devs don't get their way, then absolutely all of them will take their ball and go home, and there will be nobody to replace them, and that Bitcoin will die because of it. 
I hope that the community finds out soon if this a real threat or not, so that we can solve the "devs threatening to leave" problem.

And yet where are those 4MB blocks?
Oh, right.  They don't exist.  A 4MB limit means nothing if the average blocksizes are 1.1 right now.  And even with full adoption average block sizes would only ever get to 2.3 or so.
Also, 4MB is literally impossible, because that would mean 100% witness data, which can't happen.  The actual limit for an actual block that could be created is slightly lower than 4MB.

Extension blocks do not increase the base blocksize. They increase the effective blocksize by adding additional, separate space.  This is all done via soft fork. 
This is similar to how segwit increased the blocksize via a soft fork. Segwit didn't increase the 'base' blocksize, but it increased the effective blocksize none the less.

I sincerely doubt that 4MB average blocksize s will result in the destruction of Bitcoin. 
There are existing altcoins that are already much larger on the size scale then that. EX, ethereum has way way way worse scaling problems. 
The a few core developers themselves have suggested doing a 2 4 8 blocksize increase scheme, and many core devs are supposedly ambivalent to a blocksize increase, they are just debating about timeline. 
Why would core devs be ambivalent to something that supposedly would cause the destruction of Bitcoin? 
Or were all those arguments about "core doesn't oppose a blocksize increase, they just want it to happen later, and for it includes other features like spoonnet", totally lies?
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:37:58
If many on core support a blocksize increase above segwit, then they should feel free to write code and merge it into core. 
I do not care about their words. They should make a BIP and merge code to master.
Thats what us segwit2Xers are doing. Don't like it? Then push code, make a fork, and maybe we will follow.

Well if Bitcoin Core has a better way of increasing the blocksize, then they should make a BIP and merge the code into their github repo.
If their process is so much better, then I would love for them to act and actually merge code that will increase network throughput.  You know, instead of that segwit code which only resulted in a couple percent increase in transaction capacity as of now, and will take another year to only get maybe an additional 50% blocksize capacity (if you look at current segwit rate of adoption).
The proof is in the pudding.  We can measure the success of their efforts on the blockchain right NOW.  And all those promises of an immediate, large capacity increase turned out to be false.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:53:33

The economic majority will decide what is the real "Bitcoin", as determined by price.

Do you understand how segwit works?
Here, I'll link the faq:
It is quite clear how segwit works.  If you make a transaction that is entirely witness data, then that would be almost 4MB in size.
Are you arguing otherwise?  Are you saying that it is impossible to get ~4MB blocks when it is very clear how this would happen (by having a block that is entirely of witness data)?
Here is a more indepth explanation of how the block weighting works.
From the wiki page:
"The maximum size of a block is nearly equal to the max block weight, so currently 4MB. This is not somehow "made-up" size; the maximum block is really 4MB on-disk and on-wire."
Are you saying that the Core devs are misleading us about the fact that segwit is a 4MB max blocksize increase that only provides about 2.3 MB of capacity?  Because Luke-jr posts all the time here about how segwit is a 4MB blocksize increase.
Perhaps Luke-jr should create those 4MB blocks that he is so fond of arguing that segwit provides.  I'm not sure why he would have to though. Do you not trust the opinions of the Core devs like Luke or something, when they shout to the world that segwit is a 4MB blocksize increase (that only provides a doubling of capacity, according to Luke's research)?
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:41:09
So are the devs going to leave, and cause the destruction of bitcoin, or will bitcoin be totally fine even IF they leave?
I am pointing out that if "devs leave, therefore bitcoin dies" truly is such a big existential threat, then I hope it happens sooner, rather than later, so that the bitcoin community can fix it. 
It is too dangerous to have an existential threat like this lying around.  It should be triggered asap, so that we don't have to worry about it later.

The previous statement from coinbase answered this question.
Immediately after the fork, the legacy chain will retain the BTC ticker, and segwit2X will have the B2X ticker.
It is only AFTER one of the chains becomes a clear winner that the BTC ticker symbol will change.  So you can expect that to take a couple days at least.

No, because they are the centralized authority in charge of that github repository.  
If you want to make a change to bitcoin, and Luke-jr uses his bitcoin veto powers, the correct solution to get your change implemented is to fork the repository, and convince other people to run your code, not go through a process where a central authority can veto any changes that you make.

Here you state the the purpose of the blocksize increase hardfork is to actually DECREASE the blocksize.  I mean, what, are you seriously here?


Here you state that blockstream, the company that is home to people such as Greg Maxwell, is in on the segwit2X conspiracy.  Nobody who has ever read anything that Greg posts would come to the conclusion that he is on the same side as the segwit2Xers.


Here you talk about the theory of a corporate takeover of bitcoin as if it is some new idea that you have just came up with, that nobody else thought of.
Which makes no sense as people have been accusing the bigblockers of being a corporate takeover for years!
The FUD, and accusations that you are saying doen't bother me.  
What bothers me is how completely inconsistent it is, and how it has accused us segwit2Xers of secretly being small blockers, and how it has accused freaking BLOCKSTREAM, some of the biggest Core Supporters, and small blockers in this entire community, of being IN on the segwit2X conspiracy.  
Like, what?  Get your story straight first.  At least I can respect a good piece of propaganda.

That is one interpretation.  But it is not an interpretation that any of the segwit2X signers agree with.
The people who actually signed the agreement never subscribed to your interpretation of it, and therefore have not broken it in their minds.  And the fact that the people who signed it do not believe that it is broken is the only thing that matters.

You could think that.  But the evidence doesn't really show that at the moment.

Segwit2X only needs 66%. This is because 2/3rds of the hashpower is enough to both mine the segwit2X chain, AND 51% attack the legacy chain with empty blocks.

Well pre 0.13 nodes aren't aware of your soft fork. 
Those nodes are apart of the network as well.

There has already been a major hardfork without replay protection in cryto. 
Ethereum did it. I don't agree with ethereum's original motivation for their hard fork, but the fact of the matter is that it turned out fine for them, even though there was significant dissent. 
Yes, there is serious dissent, and that's OK. My answer to all your questions on what happens during a hardfork is "whatever happened when ethereum did it". 
Those who are worried about the disruption should stop trading during the couple days that this happens. 
There will be chaos for a little bit, but a winner will quickly emerge, and the economy will follow that chain. 
It is actually likely that significantly less disruption will happen for Bitcoin, because bitcoins 2 week difficulty adjustment algorithm makes it very difficult for a dead chain to recover. You are basically forced to POW change at that point, at which time the disruption is solved. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:08:34


So the propaganda that people have been posting about how "full nodes run the network" is misleading.
What a full node does is it allows you to know the current state of the blockchain.  Why would someone want to know the current state of the blockchain?  The reason is so that you can buy coins on the chain that you like, and sell coins on the chain that you don't like.
And it is through this process of buying, selling, and using your economic power that you effect the network.
So no, "nodes" don't have power.  They are merely a tool.  Users and economic actors have power.  And they use nodes for the purpose of allowing them to buy and sell on different chains.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:35:33
Then you have nothing to worry about. 
US segwit2Xers, along with coinbase, shapeshift, bitpay, and a bunch of other major Bitcoin companies will fork off, WITHOUT replay protection, and you can stay on your chain that has no hashpower. 
The market will prove who is right. Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:19:30
Yes or no, do you believe that the Core developer team will ever implement a second blocksize increase in the next decade? 
If the answer is No for WHATEVER reason, maybe they prefer a different solution, or maybe they can't get consensus, whatever doesn't matter, then why would the big blockers even bother working with them? 
All of these "core devs are open to big blocks" are in the context of working with Core. 
And in that context, "core devs are open to big blocks" is a horrible argument, because they are not going to implement it for whatever reason, and it is a waste of time to work with them.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:31:37
Because "replay protection" is a hard fork and it would make Core the Altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:25:22


They aren't being "fired".  They are threatening to quit if the economy doesn't do 100% of everything that they say, or deviates even a little bit from their core roadmap.
Those awesome Core Devs can feel free to continue to contribute, but they won't, because they demand that they be the ones in charge and they demand that all of it goes their way forever.
But thats their choice, as nobody can, or should, force them to do anything.  If they want to quit and open up some room for some new devs to get their hands dirty, well thats fine by me.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:01:17
Do you realize that a blocksize increase could be done via a softfork as well?
If the hardfork fails in November, the next step is to just deploy extension blocks, which is a softfork blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:24:07
Nodes do not equal users, is the problem.  A bitcoin user is anyone who buys, holds, or sells bitcoin.  A node is just a method of keeping track of the current state of the blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:21:04
People like Greg Maxwell and Blue haired matt are on record saying that there will likely never be a hardfork.
Greg even goes around attacking spoonnet, even though that is the gold child hardfork proposal by the small blockers.
If they support a blocksize increase, they should state, CLEARLY, "I support a hardfork blocksize increase sometime within the next 2 years", but they don't, so none of them will say that.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:56:52
Sure, here is an answer.
Segwit provides a max blocksize of 4MB, but only provides an average doubling of capacity.
That means that a spam attacker has a full 4MB, a quadrupling, to work with in order to attack the network, but honest users only get twice as much capacity as a benefit.
A blocksize increase has both a benefit and a cost.  A regular hardfork blocksize increase to 2MB would have doubled the "cost" of blocks, while doubling the "benefit", which is capacity.
But the way segwit did it, we now have 4X the cost but only 2X the benefit!
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:34:37
The Proof is quite simple.  Segwit allows for 4MB blocks.  In order to do this, a spammer would just create a 4MB transaction that is mostly witness data.  That isn't in dispute, as this is literally how the witness discount works.  
And according to the research done by the core devs, segwit also only provides an average capacity increase of a little more than double.
That means that a spammer can create a ~4MB block with a single transaction in it (that is 99% witness data), but on average, honest transactions would only be around 2.3 MB in size, based on current transaction distribution.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:10:50


You mean that thing that segwit was supposed to stop?  
Either segwit stopped ASICBoost, or it didn't and that whole conspiracy theory was a lie.
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:30:03
If the Core developers want "their" control back, it is not complicated what their next action needs to be. 
All they have to do is merge in the 2X code, and now they are "in charge" again. 
The market will speak. Either get on board, or get left behind. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:04:52
If you don't like what the mining power is doing, then feel free to Proof of Work change and get new miners.
Even Luke-jr understands that this is Core's only real future strategy.  They don't even plan on using replay protection when they fork off!  Which is hilarious, btw.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:30:00
Well, SOME nodes would reject those blocks, and other nodes would not.  
All nodes that are pre bitcoin core version 0.13. 1(I think that was the segwit version??) will accept "anyone can spend" segwit theft blocks.
Edit: fixed version number
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:53:42
4MB is the COST it is not the benefit.
Segwit COSTS the network its 4MB limit, but only gives us an average of doubling of the capacity.
This is a DRAWBACK, not something to brag about.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:40:32


Is this factually true? I thought that SPV wallets followed the current difficulty algorithm? 
I'd be surprised if it was possible to change the POW algorithm and get SPVs to follow. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:43:09
If there is nobody in charge, then they can't be overthrown. There can't be any hostile takeover. It is impossible for anything to be hijacked. 
It is just a different person writing their own code, and contributing in their own way. There is nobody at all who is in charge of "accepting" any code, and therefore nobody is in charge of rejecting upgrades to code that they don't like. 
If nobody is in charge then there is nobody who can stop someone else from running whatever code they want in their node, even if it is hard fork code.
It is no different than what UASF was doing.
If there IS a person who can "reject" code and prevent it from running on someone else's node, then that person  is the central authority in charge of Bitcoin. They are the king, the central banker in charge of the network.
A github maintainer has nothing to do with what Bitcoin is.  
What you are arguing is equivalent to saying that Lukejr and Greg Maxwell have veto power over what Bitcoin is. If they did, then they would be the central authority of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:35:10
There is a very easy way to implement that.  
You just take every transaction and you publish it to a github repo that is controlled by Greg Maxwell or Luke-jr.
No proof of work or proof of stake needed.  Just whatever one of them believes the transaction history is, IS the transaction history!
BOOM!  We've just created a Proof Of Developer Coin, with the central authority being the Core Developers.
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:01:08
And where are those 4MB blocks that were promised? 
The proof is on the blockchain right now. We can all look at the current blockchain, and see what blocksize are at, and we can see that they are nowhere near even the middle of the road predictions of 2 MB blocks.
We can judge right now how successful segwit is in fulfilling everything that was promised. And the jury says that it has yet to be successful in the promised goal of scaling on chain capacity.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:19:54
Well, no, we'd put the power in the total hashpower.  Which can be anybody.  This is what is described in the bitcoin whitepaper.
I mean, if you don't trust the majority of the hashpower, then you are totally screwed anyway, right?  There are too many attacks to count that can be done if you don't trust 51% of the hashpower,
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:16:01
Well they signed the NYA agreement.  So probably that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:13:01
I mean, It is a common concept in bitcoin.
It even has a name.  It is called anti-fragile.  Anti-fragility is the idea that something (bitcoin in this case) gets stronger and more resistant as it is exposed to attacks. (The attack in this case would be devs leaving)
You could certainly make some good arguments as for why bitcoin is not anti-fragile.  And perhaps you might be right.
But you should recognize that a lot of people disagree and DO believe that bitcoin has this quality.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:44:41
OK, how about the Core devs just merge the 2MB hardfork code then? 
Them the core devs would still be in charge. No need to "fire the core devs". 
I don't want to fire the core devs unless it  is necessary. I would prefer that they just merge the code.

@_date: 2017-10-28 18:25:46
Tell that to the Core team, lol. 
Even just a month ago everyone was yelling about how hard forking automatically makes you an altcoin if you doing have 100% support. 
But now that it is looking like Core will HAVE to POW change.... well the narrative has started to change. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:38:45
Hey! Somebody gets it!
I agree with all that you said. 
Now, here is a further question. Why did we do a solution that increases the attack surface by 4X, but only increases the transaction throughout by 2X?
Wouldn't it be better to increase the transaction throughout by 4X, while also only increasing the security attack surface by the same 4X?
I love when people bring up the 4X security attack service argument. Because that is my entire point! The segwit block weight thing was really dumb, because it 4Xed the security "costs"  while only 2Xing the transaction throughput "benefits".
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:49:19
Isn't this the coin that gave themselves a premined reward? 
Any fork that decides to just give themselves free coins is pretty far up on the disingenuous scale.
Like, fine, if you want to fork and change the POW for whatever reason, go ahead.  But it is a transparent money grab if you just give yourself free coins.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:01:55
But why couldn't we have both done the O(n) thing while also NOT doing the stupid block weighting thing that gave us 4X of attack surface, while only 2X of capacity?
We could have had the SAME 4X attack cost that we have now, but 4X capacity benefit.
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:09:35


Blockchain debate aside, your argument here isn't correct.

Segwit integration takes time and lots of development work.

You don't have to worry. I've been active in this subreddit for 3 years, and have followed both sides of this community descend into unfixable conflict and vitriol.  
Even the in person meetups in SF (which I have been actively attending)  have devolved to condescending snarkyness, when they used to be above the drama. 
Most of the time I at least attempt to be cordial, but the latest conflict has reached the highest fever pitch that I have seen so far, so sometimes it is even difficult for me to ignore the trolls. 
The problem is not with any singular person posting mean things to me on reddit, so I am not going to blame the original poster. The problem is with the community. 
Unfortunately, I don't have any solutions to that, though. Perhaps more people just need to get out there and start talking to people in person. I certainly will continue to do so.

Luke-jr talks all the time about how segwit is a 4MB blocksize increase.  And other people here yell all the time about how segwit2X is "8MB".
I am merely pointing out that this was a lie.  It is a lie now, and was always a lie, and that maybe we should trust people who lie and have been proven false by the current network.
The current network is proving to the world right now who was right and who was wrong about the supposed blocksize increase of segwit.  Because it has yet to materialize.
A couple months from now, it will be the same situation, and the network will continue to prove who was right.  What, are you afraid of people looking at the facts of the actual network, and proving who was right?
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:08:42
That's fine. But at least don't be like the guy I responded to by going around saying that Core supports a blocksize increase, and we just have to wait for them to do it "safely" when obviously they don't. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:03:49
Then I guess Core is freaking out for nothing, right?  No need for replay protection.  You follow your chain and the people who disagree will follow ours.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:48:03
Hey, question.  So you are saying that you will follow the longest valid chain.
Well what happens if the miners implement a Soft Fork blocksize increase, such as extension blocks.  This would be a valid chain, according to bitcoin core 0.15, as it is merely a soft fork. 
Would you then follow the blocksize increase soft fork?
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:38:17
Man, openly making death threats.  How about that.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:04:08


Why would it be alarming?
I mean, if the economy is on the side of the Core devs, then you have nothing to worry about.  
A hostile takeover isn't a takeover if it has the support of the economy.
Either the fork does not have the support of the economic majority, and it will fail, or it DOES have the support of the economic majority, and it will succeed, and therefore NOT be a hostile takeover.
The market will prove who was right.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:39:56
Except that someone in this thread literally made some death threats.  
Go read the comments.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:39:37
That is kinda sorta true. 
Yes the code 'technically' requires a larger than 1MB block. But that is only to stop short term reorgs. 
As am outspoken big blocker, I will tell you that segwit2X is dead if it doesn't get long term miner support. 
If 2 weeks after the fork, the legacy chain has more hashpower than segwit2X, then the segwit2X chain should be abandoned, and other alternatives should be pursued instead. 
The point of segwit2X is not to become a second Bitcoin Cash. It is to replace the existing blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:20:11


That is what people are doing. They have an idea, they fork the code into a new github repo, and they attempt to convince people to run their code. 


It is pretty simple. Lukejr is not the central authority in charge of Bitcoin. There is zero reason or need to convince him, or any other Core dev, of anything.  They are not in charge of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has NO central authority. 
A single github repo has nothing to do with what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is run on proof of work, not proof of github. 


Yes they do. That is how github the website works. A person is the central authority in charge of the github repo, and they can accept or reject whatever changes that they want. That is literally how github works.
If we could trust a github repo, then we wouldn't even need a POW algorithm. We could just ask Luke Jr what the current transaction history is, and he could tell us.
The NETWORK and the economic majority decide what Bitcoin is. NOT a couple high profile github repo maintainers.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:50:31




Haha, thats the first time I've been accused of that.  It doesn't really make much sense though, as I literally attend the in person bitcoin San Francisco meetups every month (with the Core devs, and all that) and my internet presence is extensive enough that it is quite easy to track me down and realize that I am a real person (I am no famous blockchain company CEO or anything, simply a software engineer who has been involved in the community for a while).
If you leave your echo chamber here and actually start talking to people in person, you'd learn that there are quite a lot of very smart people in the space who disagree with you and core on reasonable pros and cons of the current blocksize debate.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:10:03


It would be rejected by user and people.  The ONLY thing that nodes do is allow said users to monitor the blockchain.
Spining up a thousand nodes on AWS does nothing.  What DOES effect the network is buying on the chain that you support and selling on the chain that you don't support.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:08:16
I am saying that Core freaks the hell out everytime someone merely suggests that they might be working on a POW change.  It is a huge overreaction if they really aren't planning on doing anything.
But they ARE overreacting, so it makes you wonder why the subject of "core is working on a POW change" is such a touchy subject....


Pretty sure thats not how SPV wallets work.  Imagine that I, right now, make a new difficulty algorithm that was difficult = 0, and then made my chain of length a billion of something.  Would that cause all SPV wallets now and forever to follow me?  I doubt it.  That seems like a huge attack vector, if any rando could permanently destroy all spv wallets that easily.  SPV wallets follow the longest chain using the CURRENT POW algorithm.
But thats besides the point.  
 


Yeah this very well could happen.  Which is why it I find it weird that Core is freaking out over the suggestion of a POW change.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:35:47
A full node is a method of keeping track of the current blockchain.  Thats it.

The beauty of bitcoin is that you can follow whatever fork you want.
If this guy wants to fork his own bitcoin cash cash coin, without replay protection, he can go ahead and do so.  
If he is going to succeed, then he will need  millions of dollars worth of mining equipment though...
Go ahead and fork.  Or "attack" it.  Unless he has the support of the economy, it is unlike to succeed though...
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:25:40
How's that segwit "blocksize increase going? Because from my vantage point, the average blocksize is currently around 1. 02MB. 
Thanks Bitcoin core. For increasing the average blocksize by 0.02 megabytes. XD XD XD 
And segwit is at almost 20% adoption. So I guess when it gets to 100% adoption then the blocksize will increase to a whole 0.10 MB WOW SUCH CAPACITY. 
I guess segwit wasn't much of a blocksize increase at all as proven by the network right NOW. 
Just because there is some theoretical situation where blocks could be bigger doesn't mean that it actually happened. The actual network has proved that segwit didn't really increase network capacity at all.
The network proved that segwit didn't provide those "4MB"(LOL) blocks that it was promised it be. 
When's the base blocksize hardfork scheduled for then on the roadmap? 
What's the tentative date?
Oh? There isn't one? Oh, people like Greg Maxwell are on record saying that there will likely NEVER be a blocksize hardfork? 
If core supports a base blocksize increase then they should pick a date or stop lying about their support. 
1 date. Any date. Doesn't matter. But they won't.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:55:50

Only if by "we" you mean the people that control a significant amount of the economy.
Your node doesn't mean anything if it is not backed up by money and economic power.  Unless you are running a 100 million dollar company, your vote means very little.  
It is the economic majority that decides what bitcoin is.  Not nodes with no economic power.
There is 1 and only 1 thing that a user on the bitcoin network can do.  And that is buy on the chain that they prefer, and sell on the chain that they oppose.  The price of the resulting chains determine who is correct and which is the "real" bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:20:53
Bitcoin is run on game theory and ration actors acting in their own self interest. 
It is not a democracy.
 If we could run a decentralized transaction history via a democracy then we wouldn't even need a proof of work system.  Just take a vote and whatever the majority decides, IS the transaction history. 
What you are talking about would be more similar to a proof of stake coin.

The betting is available right now, lol. Just go to an exchange, which is where I have gone to. 
Who am I to stop someone from offering 5 to 1 odds? Personally I hope those odds go to 10 to 1 so as to get a better deal before the fork happens.  It is idiotic to take a worse deal than the deal that other people are offering. 
Everyone can put their money where their mouth is right now!
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:40:10

I am trying to get rid of all existential threats to Bitcoin. 
"devs leaving means Bitcoin is doomed" is an existential threat. It is a ticking time bomb. Maybe it will explode now, or maybe it will explode in a decade over the next drama. 
I'd rather have that time bomb explode as soon as possible, so that we can fix this serious flaw in Bitcoin which is that "it can't survive without the current set of developers". 
The devs can stay. I just don't want Bitcoin to ever be in danger because of their threat of leaving. 
I want Bitcoin to be resistant to destruction via the attack vector of "devs leaving".
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:50:53
WOW, it's almost as if changing 4 lines of code and a single variable called "blocksize" is easier than all the insanity that is segwit. 
Who would have thought? Oh wait. The bigger blockers have been saying this all along. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:37:18


If all 400 of those devs are threatening to leave, then this is a serious attack vector that needs to be solved.  And the best way to fight attack vectors is to trigger them, so that bitcoin can build up an immunity to the attack.
Better now than in 5 years when bitcoin is 10X plus larger than it is now.
Hopefully, though, a large minority of them will stay.  But if they don't, well then the community needs to nip this problem early, while its still possible.  
Too big to fail problems need to fail ASAP before they become even bigger problems.
Adversity, damage, and danger to bitcoin, caused by the attack vector of devs leaving will cause people to step up to the plate in order to protect their investments.
The problem and danger will only get worse if the community waits.

Sure, but as long as you recognize that a github repository has nothing to do with what Bitcoin is. 
The core devs are not in charge and we're never in charge, and therefore it is impossible to overthrow or "fire" them. 
If the economic majority decides to ignore cores "proposals" and implement proposals from a different group, that's still "Bitcoin".

The developers that the NYA people put in charge of making the software disagree.
If a single one of the NYA signers 'demands' replay protection, then they should say so, or drop out of the agreement.  Because it is NOT being added, no matter how many times saboteurs demand it.

Yes indeed, saboteurs.
Replay protection make wallet software incompatible, as well as many payment software.  It ENSURE that segwit2X would never be anything but an altcoin.
Segwit2X is not trying to be an altcoin, it is trying to be an upgrade to bitcoin.  Similar to how ethereum hardforked, but nobody is calling THAT an altcoin.
It is nobody's responsibility to do anything.  Don't like segwit2X, then don't buy it.

The tactics of doing a hardfork blocksize increase was kind of a bad idea, IMO. If it works, that's great, but the hardfork strategy has significant disadvantages, in that you can't easily kill the old chain. 
What we should have done is just deploy extension blocks, which is a soft fork blocksize increase. 
So no, if the hard fork fails, the next step is to do it via a soft fork. This is because you only really need the support of miners to deploy soft forks. 
If the blocksize increase was done via soft fork the only thing that Core could do to stop it would be to POW hardfork. Which I hope they do. 


Bitcoin is leaderless. Anyone can contribute by writing code, and convincing people to run it. 
If the high profile developers could leave and destroy Bitcoin right now, well that is an attack vector. And I hope that we solve this attack vector sooner rather than later. Let's get it out of the way.

It sounds like the economic majority isn't on your side.  
Get some economic power on board, such as major mining companies, major exchanges, or really anything and then come back.
Or better yet, just fork off and see if people will follow.
If the market follows you then great, if it doesn't, then too bad.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:28:00
Your node can do whatever it wants. My node, coinbase's node, bitpay's node, 80% of the hashpower, and the nodes which represent the vast majority of the economic activity, will be doing what we want. 
Bitcoin is great like that. If there is a disagreement, we will fork off, and call what we believe to be Bitcoin as Bitcoin. And you can call whatever you believe to be Bitcoin as Bitcoin as well. 
You can stop our economic activity. The only thing you can do is sell of your Bitcoins on our chain. And the market will prove which is the real Bitcoin, no replay protection necessary.

Well then if it isn't about the 2MB, then how about the Core dev team merges the hardfork code and ends thus debate? 
If they merge the code, then the core devs are still "in charge", but we have more capacity. 
That would be a reasonable compromise for me, that I would support.

Why would anyone care if replay protection is added or not to a "worthless altcoin"?
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:15:57


Fortunately there is a great way of finding the answer to that question.  And that is to deploy the fork and see if it succeeds.  If it succeeds then it has the support.  If it doesn't succeed then it didnt.  
Bitcoin is a decentralized network.  That means that anyone can fork at any time, and the economy will prove who was right.


The blocksize debate has been going on for 2 years plus.  Thats enough time.  No matter when it would be done, people would be making the same argument about timing.  I remember 2 years ago people said the same thing, and to just wait a year, or 2 or 3.  And still no progress, because the intention was never to actually make progress on deploying a blocksize increase hardfork.  The intention was to delay the other side and hope they stop fighting.  Well now other people ARE making progress, and we ARE going to push forward on it.
Replay protection is an intentional sabotage attempt.  Replay protection makes all wallets incompatible.  That is a no go.  If replay protection is so important, then the minority chain should feel free to add it, in order to protect itself.


If bitcoin can't handle some high profile developers leaving, then this is a design flaw and it needs to be fixed.  Better that they leave now and cause the damage now, as opposed to cause the damage much later when bitcoin is much bigger.
Fixing the developer problem now will just make bitcoin more resistant by getting new developers and making the dev process more decentralized and resistant to the flaw of being susceptible to devs leaving.   
The whole "bitcoin will be dead if the devs leave!" is an ATTACK VECTOR.  And attack vectors and central points of failures should be fixed.


Bitcoin is controlled by the economic majority, and always has been.  Thats the point.  If you don't like it, then you should get some economic power of your own, and push for what you want.  And if that doesn't work then you can join a chain, fork, or altcoin that shares your philosophy.  Or create your own fork, as is your right, and the right of everyone!
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:19:52
And by extension, if the hashpower follows the new chain, then that means that it has the support of the economy, right? 
How could a hard fork have the support of the hashpower if it doesn't have the support of the economy? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:25:22

@_date: 2017-10-18 16:52:58


Because thats called a central authority.  Nobody 'has' to do anything in bitcoin.


Bitcoin is not a democracy.  It is the opposite of that.  No majority of anybody can force you to stay on their one chain.  Everyone always has the right to fork off and do their own thing, and convince other people to fork off with them.


Different people have different definitions of "merit".  Apparently your definition of merit is that there is a bitcoin central authority that tells people what is and is not bitcoin, and controls the economy.
That does not fit my definition of merit, no matter how many Core devs think that it is a good idea for them to be the central authority in charge of bitcoin, because bitcoin is not a democracy.
If the majority of Core devs support bitcoin kings, known as the github repository maintainers, that determine what is and is not the transaction history, then those Core devs are wrong.  Bitcoin is about getting rid of central authorities.  And merit has nothing to do with a bunch of people, unsurprisingly, voting to give themselves power.
If we could trust a majority vote, or trust central authorities then we wouldn't need bitcoin.  The Core Developers could just set up their own paypal service, and we could run "bitcoin" on their database.  That would completely solve the scaling debate anyway.

Currently defined by WHO? 
What about pre 0.13 nodes? Do their votes count? 
What if all the pre 0.13 nodes decide to follow a chain that has segwit deactivated? That would not be a hardfork from their perspective. This is because they aren't aware of segwit and don't have rules that currently enforce it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:27:06
Nothing is forcing you to do anything.  You can feel free to stay on your chain, as us 2Xers will leave and move to our own.  Just ignore us.  I mean, if you have the economic majority on your side, then you have nothing to worry about, right?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:09:45


Oh really?  Because you know that bitcoin core brags all the time about how they are some sort of open source, decentralized, development team.  It is something that they claim to be proud of.
And you are arguing that this is actually false, and that the bitcoin core developers are actually the centralized authority that is in charge of bitcoin?
Also, if they are the centralized authority in charge of bitcoin, then what do we even need a POW function for?  We could just run the bitcoin network off of a Proof of Github algorithm, where we just ask the core developers what the transaction history is, and their github repository tells it to us.
So which is it?  Is nobody" in charge of bitcoin, and therefore it is OK to get rid of people who were never in charge, or is bitcoin a centralized network where the Core Developers who know whats bests for us tell us what to do?
It is one or the other.  If the dev team can't be overthrown, because "they" and "they" alone decide what bitcoin is, then by definition bitcoin isn't decentralized.  They are the central authority.  
It is either that, or the community/economic majority decides what bitcoin is, and if the community decides what bitcoin is, then the core devs can absolutely be fired, or whatever you want to call it, if the community decides to.

The people ARE doing what we want, by adopting new software. 
That's what segwit2X is! It is businesses and people voluntarily choosing to not follow core. That's the point. 
"Bitcoin core" is nothing but a github repository. People can use the code on that github repository, or not (as people are planning on doing in November).
And if we succeed, then it proves that the economic majority really wasn't on the same side as core.  It can't possibly be a takeover, if it succeeds. Because if it really is a takeover, then it will fail.
The very process that you are describing, where users and the economy revolt against the direction that core is taking, is the very same process that the NYA and segwit2X is implementing.  
The winner will be decided by the market.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:01:48
Well, the benefit of a soft fork blocksize increase is that it can be done as a soft fork, and therefore doesn't need anything close to 100% agreement to deploy.

This would end the same way that the Hong Kong agreement ended.

@_date: 2017-05-20 23:57:26
You are misinterpreting what I am saying. 
Yes,  if they mine INVALID segwit transactions,  they will be rejected. 
But what if instead they put another SOFT fork,  NOT a hard fork,  on top of segwit.
The softfork could orphan all segwit transactions.  You make it impossible for ANYONE at all to include segwit transactions. 
You do not ignore segwit rules.  You add new rules that make segwit not work.
The reason why they would do this is because they don't want segwit to be activated. So even though they can't stop segwit, they can make it useless if they have 51% of the hashpower.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:35:21
But there really isn't that much code to be built.  All you have to do is change the signaling for segwit, which is already done, and then merge BIP 102.

"To say SegWit+2MB implies that SegWit has no scaling benefits"
This is getting really annoying and I wish people would drop it.
Absolutely everyone understands what I am saying when I say "I support 2MB + segwit".
But I always get a bunch of dumb responses like this that purposefully misinterpret what was obvious.
At this point, instead of saying like 3 words, I have to pre-empt all the dumb responses by saying:
"I support a 2 MB hard fork, in addition to segwit, for total average capacity of 4MB, but up to a maximum of 8MB because of the discount, and possibly only 2MB if the transactions only contain a small amount of witness data".
This is getting ridiculous.  
Do you have a better way of referring to 2MB + segwit, that fits on 1 line, and isn't going to be purposefully misinterpreted?
If I say something like (4MB Segwit) people will then misinterpret and say "The core team doesn't even support a 2MB HF, and you are proposing 4MB !?!? wtf".  
Or even more ridiculous, they will say "Oh, you know that segwit supports up to a total of 4MB if it is all witness data, so just activated segwit!" Even though thats obviously not what I meant.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:08:25
Technically the problem with Core Segwit that it only provides an average of 2MB of capacity.
Core Segwit is not the only proposal out there though.  There are multiple segwit proposals.
Segwit, as a general concept, IS going to be activated.  It is going to be activated with the 2MB hardfork, for a total of 4MB average capacity, as that is what the economic majority supports.  
(Only economically important nodes matter, not the nodes of random people on reddit. And, according to what was decided in NYC, a lot of economically important nodes support the "compromise" where as there are very few economically important nodes that support UASF ).
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:00:00
Let me know when coinbase and kraken run a UASF node. 
The only thing that really matters is the economically important nodes. 
Nodes created by rando reddit users don't really mean anything.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:46:06
"Soft forks can't do any kind of changes, only changes that the economic majority supports"
Uhhh, sure they can.  
Basically what you are saying is "lets relax the assumption that 51% of miners are honest".  
That is very important assumption about the bitcoin network that you are throwing away willy nilly.  If you don't have that... well... a lot of bad things can happen.
If 51% of miners decide to activate their own soft fork, like, say, extension blocks, your node has 1 and only 1 recourse.  And that is to do a Contentious Hard Fork and change the POW function.
And now your node is the hard forker.  I am sure you'll find good company with the BU crazies.
But that is all besides the point, as apparently the Economic Majority supports the "compromise" solution, and does not support the UASF.  
There is not 1 major exchange that has said that they will go along with UASF, but on the other end, Coinbase (One of the biggest?  THE biggest?  not 100% sure) is supporting the compromise solution.  And if you start talking about "oh HFs can't happen unless there is zero disagreement", well fortunately the compromise solution could be implement entirely through a SF if people feel like it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:27:50
"non malicious" miners would only join the segwit-coin chain if they believe that the price is higher and that they can sell those coins.
But currently, not a single major exchange has come out in support of UASF, but coinbase has come out in favor of the "compromise" solution.
Those are the only 2 economic majority facts that exist right now.   
In order for UASF to win, price has to be higher, and the economic majority has to be in favor of it(which it currently is not).
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:24:30
Asic boost has nothing to do with segwit.

@_date: 2017-05-31 22:49:02
Well then I guess we won't be activating segwit.
Sure, go ahead and chainsplit yourself off the network.  The facts are that the economic majority is NOT on board with UASF.  
There is a wallet or 2 that is giving people the OPTION of joining the UASF.  But there are basically zero major companies who have committed to splitting themselves off the network.
While, on the other side, the NYC compromise, has freaking coinbase on board, one of the biggest bitcoin companies out there, along with dozens of others, and 80% of the hashpower.
Sure, it is not an overwhelming consensus yet, but at least it is something.  And a moderate amount of economic majority support, is a lot more than the amount that UASF has gotten.
UASF nodes run by rando nobodies on reddit, don't matter.  What matters is the economic majority.  And right now the economic majority mostly supports status quo, which means no segwit, and no Hard Fork, with a moderate amount supporting Hardfork, and more jumping on board.
Let me know when you get, like, a single major company on board with UASF.  Giving people the "option" doesn't count.  Thats called staying neutral.  It has to be "we will run our company on this".
I mean, not even Core supports UASF, lol.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:57:39
What would stop miners from soft forking the soft fork?
Segwit is backwards compatible. Meaning that as long as you didn't include invalid segwit transactions, segwit nodes would follow. 
So miners could just make ALL segwit transactions invalid via a second soft fork.

Negotiations take longer than a day.

@_date: 2017-05-31 22:54:45
The reasoning is to make segwit and a HF a package deal.
Nobody gets segwit unless they follow the Hard Fork.  We stick with status quo until a compromise is reached.
The point is to not force old nodes to hard fork.  Thats impossible.  
The point is to say "you have 2 options.  Option 1: stick with status quo.  Option 2: join the hardfork +segwit chain.".
Edit: and I guess there technically is an option 3.  And that option 3 is "Change the POW function and split yourself off the network".  But that is a nuclear option.  So if you want to take the extremely risky nuclear option, then be my guest!
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:47:57
Big blockers have never been opposed to off-chain opportunities.
As soon as the blocksize increases, above and beyond the small amount that segwit offer, most big blockers will be happy to activate segwit.
The choice is not between segwit vs big blocks.  The choice is between segwit small blocks vs segwit big blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:43:41
I know right! 
People keep taking about the "economic majority", but as far as I can tell the economic majority does NOT support UASF.

You are confusing 2 things.
1 Asic boost.  Asic boost does not increase security.  Security is measured in dollars spent on electricity.  It does not matter what optimizations you make, as it is about dollars, at the end of the day.
and 2 empty blocks.  Empty blocks absolutely DO increase the security of the blockchain.  They increase them in the same way that regular blocks increase the security.
This is because if you have 1 full block, and 1 empty block, in order to reorg the chain, you have to mine 2 blocks.  The addition of the empty block, is still added security.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:22:33

@_date: 2017-05-29 16:45:55
Why not now?
Bitcoin has been working fine for 3 years with full blocks.  And technology has continued to improve since then.  
We should be able to handle 3 years ago + technology in order to be no worse than we were 3 years ago at a very MINIMUM.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:33:15
At the moment 1 GB blocks are too big for users, in the same way that 30 years ago 1MB blocks would have been too big. 
But technology gets better and faster and cheaper over time. 
So,  for example,  if bandwidth costs were cut in half over the next 2 years,  that means that we can safely double the blocksize and we are no worse than we would be today. 
THAT is the kind of discussion I want to see. 
What technological changes would have to happen for a blocksize increase to be deamed safe.
And then precomit ahead of time to blocksize increase if these conditions have been met.

I wonder what we will learn from all of the real life segwit tests that are going on right now.
Litecoin will be a great test of capacity, because it has 4 times the potential capacity as bitcoin would have with segwit enabled.  So if litecoin blocks ever fill up, then it would tell us if it is safe to 4X increase the blocksize or not.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:07:44
And yet, 83% of hashpower, and a bunch of other companies, currently supports the "compromise" solution.

Or at the very least they could do something like soft fork extension blocks into existence.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:13:01
Then why don't we just hardcap total blocksize to 4MB?
2mb + segwit should get 4MB average blocksize.  If 8MB is dangerous, why don't we just NOT allow 8MB?  Make it 4MB average and max.
This witness discounting thing was silly, for preciously this reason, because now we have to worry about the "dangers" of 8MB, while only getting the "benefit" of 4MB average blocksize (assuming the compromise solution)
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:33:04

@_date: 2017-05-30 02:53:29
"Do you think 2mb hardfork is a better TECHNICAL solution?"
It offers more capacity (2MB HF + segwit = 4MB average which is greater than only 2MB average).  
So, if you care about getting more capacity, instead of being stuck with 2MB segwit forever, then yes, that is a technical reason for why it is superior to Segwit.
It comes with DISADVANTAGES as well, such as increased centralization, but there is no technical reason why X amount of decentralization isn't a good tradeoff in exchange for Y capacity.

Oh, sure, now that the scaling debate has been delayed 2 years until Core had their favorite solution implemented, NOW everything is all of a sudden an emergency.
How about we just stick with the status quo instead?  Scaling was delayed for 2 years, and it can be delayed again for another 2 years.

"probably one that preserves covert Asicboost"
Did you read the code?  The code doesn't do this.
It activates a segwit redeploy, which gets rid of asicboost.

It is not about the "agreement".
That contract is long gone. 
It is that the miners support 2 MB + segwit.
That is what they want,  so yes they will support it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:00:55
We don't even need to do a HF to get a blocksize increase. 
We could use extension blocks,  to increase the total to 4MB average,  using a soft fork,  and if the majority of miners is on board,  there is nothing you can do to stop it,  except change the POW. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:47:40
Well you could do all that now if you really wanted.  Just make blocks 1 Gigabyte in size and confirm every 30 seconds. 
I am sure there is at least 1 crytocurency out there that changed this single line of code. 
There are of course,  downsides to this.  But nothing theoretically stops a crytocurrency from being as large as we want it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:55:04
Umm, bitmain has been pushing 2MB HF + segwit since forever... 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:52:41
Does the omnibus proposal force a 2MB hard fork to happen, and PREVENT segwit from happening if the hard fork fails?
If it doesn't do this, then there is zero point at all for the NYC consensus people to get on board.
The purpose of the compromise is to make 2MB HF and segwit (for a total of 4MB average) a package deal.  You cant get 1 without the other.
The Omnibus proposal is not a package deal.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:49:03
Oh, thats very interesting.  
So what you are saying is, is that the economically important nodes, such as ALL of the exchanges do NOT support UASF.
It is almost as if the "economic majority" doesn't support UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:16:25
Are you saying that miners don't have the ability to validate?
If 51% of miners orphan all transactions that steal money, then their longest chain would win, correct?  
Or are you going to call "stopping people from stealing other people's bitcoin" a 51% "attack"?
Yes, full nodes can add ADDITIONAL rules on top of that.  Both users and miners can soft fork however they want.
But presumably, the full nodes still follow the longest chain, and if the longest chain just so happens to not include any theft transactions, then they would follow that chain, right?
Edit: Ahh, ok, I see.  I think you are arguing that, yes 51% of miners COULD protect the extension block money, but they won't, and that the only thing stopping miners from stealing people's money RIGHT NOW is that full nodes keep the miners honest.
Thats an interesting argument.  Not sure if I believe it.  I think that the exchanges would follow along, if the miners implemented such a rule.  Coinbase would certainly follow, thats for sure.

Bitcoin is an open source project.
Core can do whatever it wants, and other people can take their code and do whatever THEY want with it.
There are more bitcoin developers out there than just the small group of people who are currently running the show.
Bitcoin is a 30 billion dollar market right now, and if Core just threw up its hands and walked away, then other people will step forward.  The problem can be solved with money to get more people into the bitcoin dev market, if need be.
I also think that you overestimate how many developers would throw everything away that they have worked for, over this.  Quite a few of the seem fairly ambivalent over the whole drama.  
Many of the Core developers have even ALREADY released blocksize increase proposals.  Off the top of my head, Luke-jr has created multiple proposals.  The lightning network inventor also created one called extension blocks that looks promising.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:38:56
... It was a joke (Thats why I said "I jest").
But lets explain the joke anyway.  I can assure you that it is very funny!
A username with the title "throwaway" + random number is a very common way to create a throwaway reddit account.  
Thus, if it is your permanent reddit account, it is probably a poorly chosen username as it is not very unique, and it would be a reasonably common mistake for other people to assume that you are an anonymous alt account of someone else.
You mentioned that the person was actually an 'important person in bitcoin', so, to go along with what we just established, maybe that means it is a pseudo anonymous alt account of an important person in bitcoin.
Whats a good reason to be using a pseudo anonymous alt account for normal discussions on reddit about the scaling debate that don't require privacy or really have any reason for people to hide their identity?  Answer: To troll.
And you know who is the biggest Core Developer troll, thats spends way too much time on reddit?  Answer: Luke-jr.  
Thus the joke is throwaway36256 is a troll alt account of Luke-jr, along with numerous other troll accounts, such as throwaway36257 and throwaway36258 (which, of course, don't exist).
Obviously, none of this is true.  But that is why it is a joke, and not a real accusation, because I was making fun of the fact that you expected me to know that throwaway36256 is some important Core Developer, Bitcoin Company CEO, angel investor, or whoever else, when it is such a generic name.

@_date: 2017-05-22 15:34:02
Well,  seeing as blocksize increases can be done entirely with Soft Forks,  it doesn't really matter what they agree to,  as long as the economic majority supports bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:54:09
Exactly. We could very much deploy an asic boost blocking change,  and the miners themselves have said that they would support it. 
So I don't see what the issue is. Deploy asicbloost block now,  and worry about segwit later,  and the whole problem is solved!
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:49:38
A reorg would only happen if the UASF coins have more hashpower.  
And if the UASF coins are worth near 0, then it is basically impossible for a reorg to happen, because nobody is going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars mining coins that are worth nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:45:23
There have been multiple.  
If you want the simplest one, go check out BIP 102, which increases the blocksize from 1 MB to 2MB.
Here is a link to the code:
So in order to get segwit + 2MB, for a total of 4MB, all you have to do is merge BIP 102, and then have miners signal segwit, as they have agreed to if they get 2MB HF for 4MB average.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:44:43
It is not going to be 1MB.  The NYC consensus happened, so we are going to have 4MB average transactions + segwit.  
We are getting segwit either way.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:07:42

I am open to all interpretations of what that sentence means.  
Please enlighten me on what exactly it means for nodes to vote with their CPU power.  Specifically, what is CPU power referring to?
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:09:38
Sounds great! What about when miners add a second soft fork on top of segwit.
The soft fork would make ALL segwit transactions invalid.
Not a hard fork.  Not creating invalid segwit transactions. 
A soft fork.  Segwit is backwards compatible. So it would follow the longest chain.
See?  You can't really win if miners aren't behind something. 
Yes,  you can add new rules.  But the miners can respond by putting ADDITIONAL rules on top of that,  so segwit would "activate", but it would be useless.

Everybody mines empty blocks.
The reason is quite simple.  When you receive blocks/create a new one, you need time to verify the block, and build your transaction log of your new block.
In the time that it takes to decide which transactions to include in your new block/as well as verify/ect, you still want your miners to be doing SOMETHING.  So you make them mine an empty block.
Jihan isn't signalling Core Segwit, because he is a big blocker, who would prefer to have 2MB HF + segwit (for 4MB average), instead of having Core Segwit, which only provides 2MB average capacity.

The fact that you are even having this argument proves you wrong.  
Just read all the posts in this thread.  Read the stuff that is in BTC.
If segwit wasnt contentious then you would have no need to argue with anyone about this stuff.  But you do, so that proves you wrong.
Sure, segwit probably has "majority" support.  But majority support != not contentious.

If it is impossible without years of testing, then I say that we wait years.

Yeah, I don't understand.  Do these people really think that they are being clever?  That they will be able to just trick the other side into activating segwit, and then they can NOT follow through with the 2MB Hard Fork (for 4MB average)?
The point of the consensus is that segwit and 2MB HF are a package deal.  Either we get both of them (for 4MB average), or we get neither.
If they are not a package deal, then there is zero point at all to any of this, and we should just stay with status quo.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:00:11
Of course it is up to the users. 
What do you think all this stuff about User Activated Soft Fork is? 
The Users can absolutely increase the blocksize whenever they want,  assuming they have achieved consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:21:33
But if that is the case,  then preventing asic boost should cause segwit to activate later.  So there is no reason to bundle the 2.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:14:39
A small blocker is someone who opposes future blocksize increases that are larger than segwit, or who even wants to decrease the blocksize.
For example, someone who opposes segwit2X's 4MB average blocksize, is a small blocker.
As another example, prominent Core developers, like Luke-jr, want the blocksize to decrease.
Yes, Core is mostly full of small blockers, because they are currently opposing segwit2X's 4MB blocksize average, because they believe that 4MB is reckless.
I am not sure why you are even upset about this term.  There are lots of people who oppose bigger blocks, because they believe (incorrectly, IMO) that even a small blocksize increase will lead to massive centralization.
I am not sure what else you would call someone who has opposed 4MB average blocks for the last 2 years, other than a small blocker.  It is merely a descriptive term.

Will all the quotes I have saved up from Core Developers, I don't believe that they will do further blocksize increase for DECADES.  I have quotes of them, literally saying that decades is the timeline.
Temporary solutions have a habit of becoming permanent.  So if segwit goes through, the whole debate ends today, and isn't going to be brought up again for a very long time.
I rather have nobody get what they want, so that compromise is forced to happen.

Oh, that's wonderful. I guess that means that we should ALSO activate extension blocks.
That way, both core and the big blockers get what they want, as extension blocks is a soft fork that will allow an additional blocksize increase to happen. 
I mean, you don't have to run that code if you don't want.  Extension blocks is opt in IN THE EXACT SAME WAY AS SEGWIT IS, because it is a soft fork. 
You get segwit, and big blockers get out additional blocksize increase. Win win, right?

"Empty blocks have less value to the network than blocks with transactions."
Not really though.  It is a tradeoff.
1 full block (size 1MB) + 1 empty block is the same thing as having 2 blocks of size .5 MB.  With all the advantages and disadvantages that comes with that.
Having empty blocks intersparced within the block chain, has the exact same effect as decreasing the block size.  So there is less capacity, but it is cheaper to run your node, and therefore bitcoin is more decentralized.
Getting rid of empty blocks, has the opposite effect.  It is exactly the same thing as INCREASING the blocksize.

Just because everyone is yelling the words "economic consensus" doesn't make it true.
EX: Coinbase, one of the largest bitcoin companies/exchanges in the world, supports the "compromise" NYC solution.  As does 80% of the hashpower and dozens of other major companies who signed that agreement.
This is not just Bitmain blocking segwit.  The majority of major, economically important nodes, do not support UASF and instead support doing something else.
How many major exchanges out there support UASF?  
The actual facts on the ground seem to show that OTHER scaling solutions have the support of the "economic majority".
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:38:26
Well, his logic is sound.
The problem with milisecond confirmations is that you run into speed of light issues.
Yes, there are more orphaned blocks.  But even something insane like a 10% orphan rate, means that the network is only 10% less efficient.  And in order to get a 10% orphan rate, youd have to have a block time of like 5 seconds.  Which seems like a reasonable tradeoff.
Orphan rate increase doesn't seem like a "massive price".

It's actually called "The economic majority".  
Just look at all the major companies that signed on to the NYC agreement, ex: coinbase, and 80% of the hashpower (so, NOT just bitmain), and a couple dozen other, fairly important companies/economic nodes.
Now compare that to the very few who have sign on to UASF.  UASF has a wallet I guess.

Look, if you believe that nodes vote, not by using CPU, but by their acceptance of the block and using their economic power, thats fine.
My problem is that you were misusing a quote.  The quote, quite clearly states that these nodes vote, using their CPU power, and it says nothing about economic power.  I am not sure how the quote could be interpreted in any other way.  What does "vote with CPU power" even mean, if it is not referring to hashpower?
Satoshi is not god.  It is OK to disagree with him.  And in this situation, you and Satoshi disagree.  
Thats fine.  Just don't make it seem like he was agreeing with you, when the quote says basically the opposite.

Segwit IS a form of extension blocks.
It segregates the witness data and puts it..... in an extension block.
"extension block" is just another word for "extra space that is sent across the network".  It is nothing more complicated than that.  
The idea of the attack is that you publish blocks and withold the extra witness data, but immediately publish it if there is a competing block.
That would mean that it makes financial sense to mine on top of your block, even though you can't verify it immediately.  
It basically causes all other miners to have a large financial incentive to do verification-less mining.
I don't think P2SH provides any financial incentive to do verification-less mining.
The way that it effects nodes is that imagine there are 2 chains.  Chain 1 is 50 blocks ahead of chain 2, but currently doesn't have the missing witness data published.
Now, lets say I publish the witness data to chain 1.  BAM.  Your node has just be reorged.  It is longest perfectly valid chain.  Sure, it wasn't BEFORE, but it is now, because I published the witness data!
I can reorg your node at will.
Now that I think about it, this seems like an attack that would be better to use for some sort of doublespend attack.  It gives miners the ability to reorg really easily.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:28:07
You don't have to do anything.
If absolutely necessary, the Miners could just Soft Fork the additional 2MB using extension blocks.  Doesn't matter what you agree to or not, unless you change the POW or something.

Here is Satoshi's vision:
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate." -Satoshi

Answer: No,  there isn't. 
The dirty secret is that the UASFers talk all about consensus and economic majority, but the facts show that but a single major exchange has come out in favor of it. 
If it really had overwhelming support,  then where are the big players coming out in support?
Oh? There aren't any? Hmm. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 01:24:24
Bitcoin is about the economic majority.
Or did it stop being about the economic majority when Core realized that the economic majority wasn't on their side?
Yeah you are right. I guess bitcoin is actually run not on proof of work, as it apparently is run on Proof of Github repository control.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:22:13
I am not sure why everyone is so focuses on the HF thing.
If miners instead soft forked to allow 8 MB blocks, via extension blocks, there is nothing that you could do to stop it, aside from changing to POW algorithm.
You wouldn't reject anything, because soft forks are backwards compatible.  Your node wouldn't even be aware of the 8MB blocks, as it would just look like 1MB normal blocks to you.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:48:27
Hmm, what if the miner DOES have the witness data, but just waits on publishing them until later?
So it is not an invalid block.  It is a perfectly valid block that you can't validate yet, but will be able to validate in the future?  IE, if you don't accept it now, well you will be reorged.

Also, fyi, Here is what Satoshi's Original vision was:

Not true at all.  You can determine the level of support by asking the major players, such as exchanges.
It is the ECONOMIC majority.  Not, the "user" majority.
And how many exchanges have said that they will support the UASF?
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:43:15
If you have a long memory, bitcoin has had multiple periods of time with massive volatility.  
In the last year or so, the price has either been stable or increasing.
But if you go back, there have been times when it crashed from 1200$ to a 100$, and before that from 30$ to 1$.  
The upcoming date to look at is August 1st, because who know what is going to happen when people make a UASF attempt, and then other people make a blocksize hard fork attempt.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:07:16
For the same reason that segwit is waiting until 95%.
Chain splits are dangerous, and you should try to get as much buy in from the community as possible.
Why in the world should they let them be sabotaged, by forking when you BARELY have the majority?  there is still a lot of time to gather support to make the fork more successful.
There is no emergency.  We have all the time in the world to come together with consensus/compromise.

You don't have to care.  Which is why there is no reason for you all to care if the NYC consensus people "get on board" or not.
How about this.  You guys run your code, and we will run ours.  
Maybe the Jeff NYC compromise code will succeed.  Maybe it will be the UASF.
Lets all run our own code, and let the market decide who wins.  Us who support the NYC compromise will continue doing what we want, and you can continue doing what you want.

You are effectively arguing that small blockers don't exist.  Which I find weird, because many people in this sub are proud to call themselves small blockers.
If what you say it true.  Then that is wonderful.  
Segwit will activate, and then segwit2X, which merely doubles segwit from 2MB average/4MB max to 4MB average/8MB max will ALSO activate 3 months later.
And there will be no chain split, core won't block it, no doomsday centralization china core scenario will happen, no massive node count drop, and everything will be fine.
I look forward to November, when bitcoin can continue to scale and allow for more transactions with segwit2X.

Well this will be an experiment.  It will PROVE if they were right or if they were completely full of shit.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:14:01
Look if you have a different opinion, then you should say it.
Miners are being quite clear, and have been quite clear for the last year.
Miners want segwit2X for a total of 4 MB average blocksize.
You can argue that Nodes will reject this, but you do NOT get to put words into the mouth of miners when they explicitly have stated what they support.
If you have evidence that is different from the overwhelming obvious evidence that miners want segwit2X, then show it.
Imagine that you were to argue that Big Blockers don't want big blocks.  Like, it would make no sense.  
You can argue that big blocks are bad.  
But it is dishonest to go around saying that big blockers don't want big blocks, lol.
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:22:12
sigh..... Ok fine.  I'll bite.
What possible reason could the miners have for activating segwit2X when they could have just activated segwit?
Why go through all this entire bullshit of trying to get an agreement for 4MB average blocks, when they would have been forced to do segwit anyway?
If the reason is asicboost, how does THIS SOLUTION of increasing the blocksize to 4MB average in November, work out to help their goals of continuing to do asicboost?
Even if we go under the assumption that asicboost is the reason, creating segwit2X makes zero sense from that perspective.  They don't gain anything at all from pushing segwit2X, because in both cases, segwit and segwit2X stop asicboost....
Segwit2x doesn't delay anything and gains them nothing if they only care about asicboost.
But on the otherhand, if you assume their motivation is that they want 4MB average blocks, then segwit2X DOES gain them something.  It gains them 4MB average blocks.
How does segwit2X help asicboost???  
If I were an evil miner, who used asicboost, if anything what I would be doing is NOT signalling for anything.  I would force the UASF to happen in hopes that it fails.
Because if UASF wins, I lose nothing, because then I just start mining segwit.  Where as I gain a lot even if there is a 10% chance of UASF failing.  Why would an evil miner throw away their 10% chance of UASF failing??

Small blockers, for the last 2 years, have made claims that if a blocksize increase happens, then node count will decrease, the network will become more centralized, and many other terrible things will happen to the network.
These are specific claims of fact.  
And now we are going to get evidence.  The blocksize is going to increase.  And those terrible things will either happen or not happen.
We will find out soon if the small blockers were correct in their specific predictions, or were they completely wrong.
And if they are completely wrong, then that means we should not listen to their arguments in the future, because they don't know what they are talking about.

One could imagine a version of extension blocks where only transactions that opt in to extension blocks are put in them.
This could be done in the exact same way that segwit requires you to opt in to the segwit transactions.
I believe that is how the current version of extension blocks works.  You send your legacy bitcoin to the anyone can spend script code, and that "transfers" it to the extension blocks side.  And then it can be transferred back to the legacy side just fine, because it would use the anyone can spend script code.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:47:24
Yes, on the main chain it is not anyone can spend. But in BCC it IS anyone can spend.

Is it really so hard?
What big blockers want is 2MB + segwit for an average of 4MB total.
The problem with segwit now, 2MB later is that it allows other people to back out of the deal.  Because they will just activate segwit then not activate the Hard Fork.
Lots and lots of people are threatening to do this, just read this subreddit.
It is not difficult.  We want 2 MB + segwit for 4 MB average, with no possibility of the other side backing out.  That is why we want them to be locked together on bit 4.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:24:59

Number of reddit accounts isnt an important metric.

I THINK it is an attempt to do a blocksize hardfork at the same time as segwit.
It is on the far end of the BU supporter extreme side. 
I am an outspoken big blocker, but even I think that Bitcoin Cash is batshit crazy. 
Segwit 2X is closer to a compromise between big blockers and segwit supports (although, obviously, it is still more of a bigblocker proposal.  Small blockers don't support segwit2X).
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:14:21


In your previous post you literally just said that they support Spoonnet.
So which is it? Do they support Spoonnet or do they not?
If they support it, then they should present it to the community and make a plan to deploy in whatever way that they deem safe.
Why would they do this?  They would do this because you just said that they support it.  And it would stop segwit2X in its tracks, and get everyone on board.
But thats not going to happen.  Because until they publicly express support in a SERIOUS BIP proposal, it is all just window dressing and FUD, and any statement like "Core devs support a hard fork, they just want it to be a safe hard fork!" can't really be believed.  It is basically just them talking out of both sides of their mouths.

Would it be honest of me to go around saying "The safest thing to do is to install my UASF code.  Legacy nodes that don't have the 8MB SF code have provably more risk!"?

Ahhh, ok, I think you are talking about some kind of network isolation attack? (or defense... call it whatever)
IE, if a whole bunch of nodes install BIP 148, then non-segwit signalling blocks wouldn't even propagate. 
Thats an interesting idea that might potentially work in a peer to peer only network.  But at the moment, everyone just uses the relay network and/or a direct link between the big miners.  
Maybe if the relay network was shut down, and a whole bunch of non-BIP 148 nodes got DDoSed off the network then it would work.
Or perhaps they would propogate more slowly, and that would provide an economic incentive to signal segwit?  I am not really sure.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:48:43
Bitcoin the name belongs to Satoshi.  
And I sincerely doubt that he would be in favor of using trademark law to go after someone creating their own new altcoin.
The resources are not being hijacked.  The resources known as the Core developers are not being forced at gunpoint to develop on this new altcoin, and they can spend their freetime doing whatever they want.
It is an altcoin that you think is worthless, so you have nothing to worry about. 
The REALLY funny part about all this is that a bunch of core devs were planning on proof of work hard forking if they didn't get segwit activated. 
So the core devs would have committed the EXACT same sin that you are accusing BCC of. 
Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin because Luke Jr says it is. Bitcoin is run by the economic majority, proof of work, and nakamoto consensus. 
It is NOT run by a proof of github system where 1 project owner decides what Bitcoin is.

OK,  but you just said that you were worried about 8MB.
To clarify, are you NOT worried about 4MB average block size that would come with the "compromise solution"?
IE, let's say that we had a compromise compromise solution,  that ALSO set 4 MB hard cap,  but still included the segwit discount.
So twice the capacity of only segwit. But NO 8MB blocks. 
Would that be significantly better than the compromise solution? 
If not,  and you don't care about the 8MB theoretical blocks,  because they are all witness data and witness data is "cheap" on the network,  then why even bring up 8MB as a counter point to begin with?

Sure, I 100% agree when talking about Hard forks. Thats why you do a soft fork instead.  Soft forks are fully backwards compatible with old nodes.
But what people don't realize is that soft forks can do basically anything.  Including increase the blocksize.  Segwit is a soft fork blocksize increase for example.
Conversely, miners could soft fork and increase the blocksize to 10MB, via extension blocks if they wanted.
Old nodes would continue to work perfectly, and would even be able to mine as normal.  They would just be completely unaware of the extension blocks transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:11:02
Miners are in charge of ordering transactions.
With over 50% of the hashpower, they can implement whatever soft fork that they want, by "ordering transactions" such that transactions that break those rules are never included (ie orphaned).
They could even increase the blocksize using a soft fork, ex, by implementing extension blocks.
The only thing you could do to stop it is change the POW algo.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:41:46
Except that coinbase has explicitly supported the Compromise NYC agreement.  So apparently they DO care.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:25:48
Ok, but if 90% of the hashpower just STOPS mining bitcoin, for whatever reason, then segwit wouldn't activate.  Segwit would expire before it could activate.
It is not just the percent that matters.  It has to activate before the expiration date.
That being said, a 90% hashrate decrease seems unlikely.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:47:46
If the 2MB Hard Fork gets blocked, I think you will see a lot of people change their tune.
The thing is with an extension blocks Soft Fork, you basically only need the support of the hashpower.  (anything that violates extension blocks would get orphaned).
And if the other side disagrees, the only thing that they can do to fight it is a POW change.  And you'd need a LOT of support for that.
I mean, yeah, if someone soft forked and tried to blacklist a bunch of people's bitcoin addresses, that is something that could get enough community support to push through a POW change.  But for something as contentious as the scaling debate?  No way.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:30:26
This whole focusing on a SF as something that is completely different from a HF is really going to bite you.
You can do basically anything with a SF.  Including raise the blocksize, via extension blocks.
Luke, you go around saying stuff like "You don't need overwhelming consensus to activate segwit because it is a SF".  
Will you say the exact same thing if the big blockers change their tune and push through a blocksize increase SF?
I wonder how the narrative is going to change, when the HF fails, and the miners push through a blocksize increase SF.
If that happens, is it all of a sudden going to be totally OK to push through a contentious and immediate HF to stop the evil miners from doubling the blocksize?  
Are you going to say "lets wait a year to do this thing. 
 And only do it if the entire community agrees"?
Doubt it.  
What people need to understand is that Soft Forks are extremely powerful.  AND they can be activated entirely by the miners, if they want it to happen.  Unless you hard fork away, your node WILL follow.  And if you DO hard fork away... well... I don't have to tell you why thats a bad idea. We've got 3 years of comments made by Luke-jr that you can read as to why that would obviously be a bad idea, right?

The code isn't being deployed tomorrow.  It will be written, reviewed, and tested over the next couple months.

Ehh, if I were a miner I'd try to force the POW change to happen, just for the purpose of forking the other side off of the main network in an effort that is likely to fail.
That way, with the opposing side gone, the people left will be the big blockers and the status quo people.

Well we are about to see exactly what happens when a blocksize increase happens.
Segwit is a 2MB blocksize increase.  So if the small blockers are right, then all those terrible things that they have predicted, SHOULD happen in some respect when segwit activates.
And if those terrible things do NOT happen when the blocksize increase activates, and the node count stays the same, ect...... Well then I guess the small blockers were wrong.
We will know very very soon who was right and who was wrong by observing exactly what happens when a blocksize increase happens on the network.
Something tells me though, that when we get actual evidence of what actually happens, one side of the debate is just going to completely ignore the real life evidence and facts as we observer how a blocksize increase effects the network.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:54:06
Go read his actual post.
He was talking about what it would take to get to Visa levels.  So he was talking about blocksize.
How long would it take to get to that point?  Well, bandwidth costs  have decreased by 33% every year for the last 20 years, and this pattern will likely continue for the NEXT 20 years.
So that means that you can increase the blocksize by 33% safely, every year.  It would be however many years it takes to get to X GBs, based on that level of increase.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:32:23
No, the point is not to mine on a NEW chain.
The point is to mine on the OLD chain, but add soft fork rules to it.
This works because if you have 51% of the hashpower, you can add whatever new rules you want to the main chain.  And the only way to get off of that chain is to POW hardfork.
What I am saying is, that using 51% of the hashpower, miners can just add a soft fork blocksize increase, and Core nodes would follow, because it is a VALID chain.

Once segwit2X is activated, the patch really is minimal.  
All you got to do is change a variable from a 1 to a 2.
I am not sure why everyone thinks this is going to be so difficult. 
Also, lots and lots of people have created very simple BIP blocksize increases.  There are like a dozen or so official BIPs that do this.
And even if you make the argument that only core developers know how to make simple changes like this, well thats not a problem, because a blocksize increase is in the official Core Roadmap.  So I expect that they will continue to work on bitcoin even if the users decide to activate the blocksize increase.
I mean, if Core literally put it in their official roadmap, then I don't see why they would up and leave just because their roadmap was implemented earlier than expected.  
It must not bother them too much, if they were planning on doing it eventually anyway.

If don't start making plans for the HF now, then it will be years before it happens.
There is no reason at all why we can't have the DISCUSSION now.
If we don't start talking about it now, in a serious manner, then people like Adam will just go around saying "oh look, this stuff takes time, we should have talked about this years ago" and it will just be delay delay delay like has been happening for the last 2 years.

"nearly a bitcoin god"
Ugg, does Luke-jr have so much free time that he has resorted to trolling on reddit via both his main account AND multiple "throwawayXXX" alt accounts?
I jest.
But my point still stands.  Writing code that signals segwit on bit 4, and then a 2MB hard fork, seems to be pretty trivial.  I mean, luke throws together his blocksize "increase" compromise proposals in week or so right?
I am sure that Jeff Garzik can figure all this out on his own if he had to.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:00:46
UASF can't really do much, if miners are clever about it.
Yes, it gets segwit "activated".  But what happens if Miners let it be "activated", and then just orphan all Segwit transactions. 
The way it works is the "anyone can spend" transactions become "no one can spend" transactions.
Longest chain wins.  And Segwit is backwards compatible, so it will follow the compatible segwit killing chain.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:41:28
The spirit of the NYC agreement is that segwit and 2MB HF are a package deal.
So it would be a 1 time increase from our current capacity of 1MB, to segwit + 2MB HF base blocksize, which adds up to 4MB average capacity.  8 MB/16MB average or higher is not part of the deal.
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:00:08
The segwit block would NOT be valid, according to a BIP 148 node though.
This is because the segwit block would be built atop other NON-signaling blocks.  BIP 148 will reject any chain that has a single nonsignalling block.
Segwit miners do not follow the bip148 chain if it has less hashpower.
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:22:01


But the effects will be observable.
IE, lets say that increasing the blocksize ends up making the network significantly more centralized.  That would be bad, and would prove the small blockers right.
Instead, lets say that the blocksize increase only makes the network 1% more centralized.  If that happens then our current size is provably safe, and we could increase it by a lot before it gets to be dangerous.
But whatever the answer, the DATA will prove who is right. 


Thats not true.  If it was, I would love to see them publicly release a date.  Luke-jr thinks that it will be literally decades before another increase happens.  
I would love to be proven wrong.  But everything that Core does makes me believe that another one isn't coming.  If it is, then they should create a BIP, and publicly support it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:53:02
Correct, we can't do it now. Just like how in the year 2000, we wouldn't have been able to do 1MB blocks. 
But since Internet bandwidth keeps decreasing at the rate of 33% per year, then that means we can safely increase the blocksize by 33% per year. 
Sure, if bandwidth cost DON'T continue to decrease at the same rate that they have decreased every single year for the last 20 years, then we of course shouldn't increase the blocksize.
But right now, we are still on track to do that 33% every year and we see no signs of slowing down.
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:01:03
Only if you have the hashpower.  Core nodes won't follow your chainsplit.  Only rando reddit user nodes.  
Let me know when the 90% of Core nodes switch over to your side, or if you have 51% of the hashpower.  You don't have either.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:34:44
It is not a 51% attack though.  It instead could very well be a 0.3% attack, as the current amount of hashpower supporting BIP 148 is around 0.3% .
When a very small amount of people can reorg your chain, yes that IS dangerous software.  
Obviously hashpower could increase in the future, but thats not what it currently is at.  It is dishonest to ignore the observable fact that hashpower support of BIP 148 is very low right now, and that makes it dangerous.

Coinbase has already come out in favor of the "compromise", and not in favor of UASF.

What I am saying is that since segwit is about to be deployed, this will be our experiment.
If node count massively decreases over the next X months, then Core was right about the dangers of a blocksize increase.
If node count does NOT massively decrease, and there are minimal negative effects, then it PROVES that they were full of shit.
The test network is about to be created.  And we will be able to gather evidence of how a network copes with a block size increase.
And if Core goes around saying "uhhh, we were wrong about 2MB having negative effects, but 4MB is DEFINTELY dangerous" then they can't be trusted, because they were wrong/lied the first time.
This will be proof.  Don't move the goal posts.  If nothing happens, and 2MB works perfectly fine, and works exactly as good as it did with 1MB and has zero negative effects, then Core was wrong. 
Yeah, core did a network test with segwit.  But if it turns out that the network is way more resilient, and the negative effects of those tests end up being greatly exaggerated, then it proves that the original test was overly pessimistic, and it means that we should be more optimistic.
The only thing that I am trying to determine is as follows "Was Core right about the dangers of a block size increase, or were they completely full of shit".  And this real life network test will prove it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:01:44
It would ban their ip, but the entire rest of the network would be following it.  
And then when the 50 blocks longer chain comes around, well now that one is valid, and you are receiving it from a new ip address.  IP addresses are cheap.  How will you be able to tell that the 50 block longer chain is "malicious" when it is from a new IP, and the chain you see now is valid?
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:35:26
No. We mean lots of users, and important Bitcoin companies like coinbaae, that believe that technology has increased enough over the last 8 years to EASILY handle 4MB blocks. 
We mean the users that believe in Sato she's original vision. Satoshi himself believed that it would be quite easy to increase the blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:24:19
The poster that I was responding too originally claimed that Core supports a Spoonnet hard fork.
They would deploy spoonnet because they support it.
Personally, though, I think that this is a lie and/or is seriously misinformed.  
If Core really does support a hard fork, then they should put it in their roadmap, and present a public, serious, BIP proposal.
They won't do that though.  Because all this "Core supports a hard fork, they just want it to be safe" was all just made up BS in an attempt to run out the clock, and hope that everyone forgets about their previous statements of support for a hard fork.

segwit is 2MB average witha  4MB cap.
The idea would to make segwit2x have a 4mb hardcap, so the capacity is more like 3.9MB average with a 4MB cap.
Big blockers would absolutely love it if average blocksize was 3.9mb, with a 4mb cap, and right now regular segwit does not offer that.

Core and the small blockers oppose 4MB average blocksizes.  They think that 2MB is safe, but that anything larger is extremely dangerous.
I never said that small blockers opposed segwit.  My comment was "A small blocker is someone who opposes future blocksize increases that are larger than segwit,".  Emphasis on " someone who opposes future blocksize increases that are larger than segwit" .
That statement is extremely clear.  Segwit is 2MB blocks.  So if you oppose 4MB, that means that you are "Opposing something larger than segwit."
Core did not create any code that would result in 4MB average blocksizes.  They created code that would only be 2MB average.  And they are strongly opposing segwit2X, which is 4MB average.  
If you think that segwit 2X is way to large, then yes, you are a small blocker.
Are you claiming that core DOES support segwit 2X and is perfectly fine with 4MB average blocks?  If that is the case, then they should feel free to merge code that gets us 4MB average blocks.
Let me spell it out one last time so that I am absolutely clear.
A Small blocker would say: "2MB average (4MB max) segwit is fine.  But 4MB average blocksize (up to a max of 8MB) is way to large".
A big blocker would say: "segwit 2mb average is not enough.  4MB average, up to an 8MB max, is perfectly safe".
A "really small blocker" would argue that the blocksize is already to large and should decrease.  But you do not have to be a "really small blocker" to be a small blocker.  Opposing 4MB average is enough to be a small blocker.  And you could continue downwards as much as you want.  IE a "really really really really small blocker" would say that blocks should be no larger than 10 kilobytes.
This really shouldn't be difficult to understand.  There are lots of people who oppose 4MB average.  And those people are happy to call themselves small blockers.
If the term "small blockers" really offends you, then just replace the word "small blocker" with "people who oppose blockers that are 4MB average or larger", because that is what the words small blocker effectively mean.
Edit: You are WRONG about luke-jr.  Luke-jr thinks that blocks are too large already.
Proof: 
"Blocks are too large right now:"  - Luke-jr 4 months ago.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:18:56
Of course you can disagree with a soft fork.
I was merely stating that if the hashpower supports a soft fork, like a blocksize increase soft fork, the ONLY effective way to stop it is to do a POW hard fork.
and I would LOVE it if the small blockers POW hardforked off the main network.  The status quo would stay with the main chain, and the other people would be gone forever.

Storage is not and has never been the bottleneck of the bitcoin network.  Storage is cheap and is only getting cheaper.
The bottleneck of bitcoin for nodes is the real time bandwidth costs.  
Segwit doesn't fix that part.  Saving on storage costs, is admittedly a benefit, but it is a pretty small benefit.

segwit2x is 4MB average.
If we really wanted to we could add a soft fork that makes it a hard limit of 4MB.
Anyone who throws around the figure of 8MB is either being purposefully dishonest or doesn't understand how the segwit discount values work.
The idea of segwit2X is to have 4MB average transaction size.  If we really wanted we could set max blocksize of segwit2x to 4MB, which would result in 3.9 mb average blocksizes with a max 4MB.

Not necessarily.  If the miners for some reason back out, then segwit2X won't happen.

If the miners back out, the big blocker side is done for.  No point in fighting any longer if we lose our biggest advantage, which is the hashpower.

A year ago the argument was "lets find out how the network responds to a blocksize increase by doing segwit, and then we will evaluate the effects from there."
And since segwit is happening, we can be happy to announce that this Evaluation is going to happen!
I just want to see if core was right or not.  
Core has made a prediction.  They have predicted "If a blocksize increase happens, then X will happen to the network".  
Segwit is a blocksize increase.  Now lets see if X really does happen or not.
There is nothing bad about finding the facts, and seeing if people's predictions were right or wrong, correct?  
And if people make predictions, and those predictions turn out to be wrong, well that tells us a whole lot about those people and about how good they are at making predictions.

Here is the problem with that though.
By doing this signature withholding attack, I can reorg your chain at will.
This is because if I withhold the signature data, and THEN publish it later, BAM, you've just been orged.  
Now your node is no longer validating much of anything, because at any time you can be reorged just by a miner publishing their previous witness data.
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:27:32
You don't need wipeout protection if you have an overwhelming majority of hashpower.
Edit: Don't need replay protection either.  Replay is something that effects both chains, so it isn't any different from the legacy lower hashpower chain.  It is a nice feature, but by no means necessary.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:00:09
That is an interesting argument to make, and perhaps it holds merit.
But other people have made different predictions.  They have made specific predictions that nodes will decrease by x%, and terrible things WILL happen at 2MB or 4MB.
And THOSE people's predictions will be put to the test.  And if those people are wrong, then they will be discredited.
That doesn't necessarily mean that a blocksize increase will safe, because of the arguments that you have brought up.
But it DOES discredit people.  You yourself won't be discredited, because you aren't making specific, terrible predictions about things that will happen in the near future.  
I look forward to going back through the history, finding the specific predictions that people have made, and finding out which people were right, and which people were wrong.  
That way, when those same people made more predictions in the future, the community can know which people are bringing up reasonable points (perhaps like the ones you have brought up), and which other people don't know what they are talking about and/or are straight up lieing and therefore should be ignored/discredited.
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:25:51
Nodes have been doing fine for the last 3 years.  And in those 3 years a whole lot of improvements have been made to the bitcoin protocol that reduce network bandwidth.  
Because of these protocol improvements, as well as technology improvements, we could easy take the increase.
The Core developers themselves have said that network improvements of compact blocks alone would more than make up for the blocksize increase that comes with segwit.
And if you take into account general bandwidth costs decreases, yes, that means that you could double it again, and we'd be exactly where we were 3 years ago, which was fine for nodes.
If you cut costs in half, that means you can double capacity.  If you cut it to 1/4th, that means you can quadruple capacity.

The economic majority is who.
Nodes created by rando users on reddit don't mean shit.  What matters is the economy and the economically important nodes.

The variable is call MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE, and yes, you could just change it.
If you want to argue that the code to COORDINATE the blocksize increase, with voting, time limits, ect, is a lot of code, sure.
But we weren't talking about that. 
In my post I said that AFTER segwit2x is activated, you could just change a single variable.  And yes, you could.  Because once segwit2x is activated, you don't have to do any more voting or whatever.  base blocksize is already 2MB, so your new fork of core can just have that one variable change.
Edit: if you want a link the code, you can see it here:
After parsing the comments in that file, it looks like you might have to change MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE, or MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT to 8000000.  So I guess that makes 3 lines of code to get to what segwit 2X is promising 2MB-8MB blocks.
(I believe that if you just change the base block size variable, then it would result in blocks that are mostly around 4MB in size.  So still more than segwit, which is an average of 2MB or so.  But doing the discount thing means that blocks are avg 4MB, but can be up to 8 MB)
It was very helpful of the Core development team to split out the code like that so that people can just make 1 or 2 line changes to it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:07:56
The problem is that the small blockers are unlikely to follow segwit2X.

But if it fills up, then we will have data, correct?  The lightning network isn't going to be deployed immediately, so things should have SOME effect.  
What it was intended to do doesn't matter, because segwit IS a blocksize increase.  So it should be demostrateable evidence of what happens when a blocksize increase happens.
All I want is provable data, that shows EXACTLY how the network reacts to a blocksize increase.  
Well now we are going to get that data!  All the arguments that both sides make will be put to the test.  Will node count plummet, or will it stay the same?  Will the network become more centralized, or will it stay exactly the same?
You should be happy.  If the small blockers are correct, then their predictions will come true.

It is not dangerous if you have &gt;60% of the mining power.  Obviously you should never do this if you don't have the majority.
And it is even MORE dangerous to the 40% that is on the losing side.  It is so dangerous, that even the threat of orphaning would probably cause them to just go along with the 60%.
What people need to understand is that the majority hashpower can almost do whatever they want, because of orphaning attacks like this.  You could even force a blocksize increase to however high you want, because a Soft Fork can increase the blocksize, through extension blocks.
The only response that you could do again this type of attack would be to change the POW function and F over the ENTIRE network, chinese miners and segwit supporters alike would be destroyed in the crossfire.  
And if THIS happened, you can damn well bet that those segwit supporters would very quickly join the chinese miners' side, when threatened with the destruction of their entire business.

Doing a blocksize increase via a soft fork is completely possible.  That is literally what segwit is.....
Which is why the big blockers can just do a SECOND soft fork to increase the blocksize AGAIN. (via extension blocks, or any number of other potential proposals)
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:59:05
Sigh.... Do you even know what extension blocks are or are you arguing in bad faith?  
Is it so difficult to explain your thoughts and point out HOW you disagree?
But to head off what I think you are saying, yes, I am perfectly aware that there is a proposal called "extension blocks" that is not the same as segwit.
But the proposal "extension blocks" is different from the general concept of extension blocks.
Segwit, segregates the witness outside of the BASE block and puts it in an EXTENSION block.  Which is extra space on the blockchain that legacy nodes don't see.
What do you even think base block means, lol?
Segwit is a blocksize increase.  It just does it by creating extra blocks that EXTEND the base blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-08 07:34:33
I looked it up.  You are wrong.
Here is the important line from the spec:
"Extension block opt-in
Outputs can signal to enter the extension block by using witness program scripts (specified in BIP141). Outputs signal to exit the extension block if the contained script is either a minimally encoded P2PKH or P2SH script."
The way it works is effectively like a two way peg.  You send it to the extension blocks via the anyone can spend op code, and then it gets locked in until you send it back to the main chain.

Sure, increasing the blocksize to infinity will cause problems.
But fortunately the only major other proposal on the table is segwit2X.  Most big blockers have put all of their efforts towards that, and have given up on serious efforts to something above that.
So sure, 2MB won't tell us a whole lot about what happens if blocksizes are 1GB.  But it will DEFINITELY give us some pretty good information about how 4MB blocks will work on the network.
What I am saying is, that similar blocksizes will have similar problems.  You can't extrapolate out to infinity, I agree.  But you can definitely extrapolate out to similar block sizes.
And if you think that 4MB is to far of a jump to extrapolate out, well, then at the very least we might be able to exapolate out to 3MB, and then when we get info from 3MB and determine that it is safe, we could extrapolate out further.
If you want to argue that BU is crazy, because it allows miners to vote on blocksize, fine, I'll give you that.  But I wasn't suggesting that.  We can instead do expert analysis on the 1 to 2 MB blocksize increase, and extrapolate out towards 3MB, or 4, or more, as long as we determine that the previous one was safe.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:22:15
The reason that people oppose segwit has been stated quite clearly.  
The big blockers want a more permanent solution to the scaling problem, and they believe segwit inadequately addresses it.
"Temporary" bandaids have a habit of becoming permanent.  And with all the Core developers being so vehemently opposed to any blocksize solution that they didn't write (just take a look at their response to extension blocks, which is 99% equivalent to segwit), it is difficult to believe that they will do anything in the future.
I guess on the roadmap, they vaguely alluded that they will support a future HF blocksize increase.  But they have yet to deliver, because I don't see that merged into core.
Just take a look at Luke-jr's comments, where he says he wants a blocksize DECREASE.  Or Blue haired Matt's comments, where he says he wants a fee market (AKA, he literally wants fees to be high.  That is what it means to support a fee market.  High transaction costs.)
It is better to just wait and do nothing until a real consensus is formed.  The battle that is fought now could determine bitcoin's future for decades.

What, do you think that 4MB average transactions size is equivalent to a raving lunatic?
You DO know that even Core supports a blocksize hard fork, right?  It is literally in the scaling roadmap.
The whole disagreement is about WHEN, not IF the hardfork is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:33:41
segwit2X is what they are signalling for.
Of course, the real battle happens in november when the Hard Fork attempt is made.
Nothing interesting is going to happen on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:20:57
Sure... but as long as you also admit that 100% of these miners are ALSO supporting the 2X part.
By leaving that out, people are lieing by admission.
Segwit2X is what is activating.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:10:08
I am not disagreeing.  
It is certainly possible that the increase of max blocksize to 2MB average, will not cause the current blocksize to increase to 2MB, because they aren't being fully utilized.  
And in that situation, I 100% agree, it gives us no useful data.  I don't think that I have ever claimed otherwise.  Obviously this is true, so I don't understand why you are strawmaning me here.
But if block usage (not block max) DOES get to 2MB, then it DOES get us data.  And it will indeed tell us how the network responds to and is effected by a blocksize increase.  
Personally I think that it is unlikely that block usage will stay at 1MB, though, given that blocks have been full for the last year.
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:23:55
My theory is that it is adversarial development. 
The way that it works, is that there is only one way replay protection, and segwit is not activated. 
So that means that unless you take steps to protect yourself, your segwit transactions can be stolen on on the bitcoin cash chain. (obviously not on main chain). 
So now there is a huge incentive for miners to mine on the bcc chain because of all the "free" money that can be stolen by replaying transactions. 
And the people who get screwed are the segwit supporters.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:40:00
He is definitely trolling.  
The only question is which side is he trolling.  
He has gone back and forth on his support for both the small blocker side and the big blockers.  
Maybe he'll just start running one of Luke-JRs blocksize decrease proposals next.  Who knows?
Here is one of my favorite tweets from him:
In april he made 2 tweets one after another:
"Segwit will be a disaster. I am not going to support it on BTC because I am a bitcoin HODLER. Meanwhile, I do not have a single litecoin."
And then
"“I've tried my best to love Core. But Core doesn't love me. Now I know Charlie Lee has a backup plan and it is called UASF.”"
Like, wow.  I am not sure how someone in the same sentence can both denounce segwit, denounce core, and then also come out in favor of UASF, which as we know, enables segwit.
It makes zero sense unless you know nothing about bitcoin or if you are trolling.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:26:59
There aren't really any BIP 91 nodes, lol.  
In the case where there aren't nodes enforcing a rule, hashpower wins out.

Are you talking about segwit2X? 
Because segwit2X is NOT BIP91. 
It is signaled on a different bit. 
If you want to enforce segwit2X then you should install a segwit2X node.

Sure, it won't accept it.  NOW.  But later on the full block will be published, and that block becomes perfectly valid.
IE, imagine if your block "thinks" it is invalid, and then later on it asks the network what the longest chain is, and what do you know, that block that you thought was invalid, has all of the required information that was missing before.  Oh, and the full chain is 50 blocks longer than the chain that you are currently on.
Bam, you've just been reorged.  
it rejects it now, because it hasn't been fully published.  But other people are mining on top of it, because they know that it is probably valid.
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:53:04

Segwit will activate just fine.  It will activate with the segwit2X proposal that comes with a 2 MB base block size hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:45:46
Well if that is the case, then you have nothing to worry about.
BCC will fail, as the economic majority stays with BTC.
On the other hand, if the economic majority DOES think that BCC is valuable (currently the price is around 500$ for BCC which is a lot..)..... well now you have got a problem.
But no need to worry!  I am sure it will work out fine.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:05:56
Ok, and then when a new IP address that I just created publishes the new 50 block longer chain to the network that doesn't break any rules?
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:10:44
No, that is not how soft forks work.
Segwit is literally a blocksize increase.  But it is backward compatible.  That means that pre-segwit nodes would NOT reject it.
A second soft fork would do the same thing.
A second soft fork could increase the blocksize in the EXACT SAME WAY that segwit does, through a backward compatible soft fork.
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:24:43
Code is right here man.  So you change MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE, MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT, and MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE.
Man, so difficult.  Totally need a dozen experts to change that.
Sure, all the voting stuff takes a lot of code.  But AFTER segwit2x is activated you don't need that code anymore.  You can just change that file and you are done.
And then you just apply your patch on top of whatever the current Core version is.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:48:29
Many members of Core were literally planing on doing a proof of work hard fork if Segwit didn't activate.
So please don't go around giving that "altcoin" thing, when Core itself has show that it was planning on doing exactly that.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:11:09


No.  The plan is to increase the blocksize at the same rate that bandwidth costs are decreasing.  Or around 30% every year.
Technology is still getting better.
We can't handle 1 GB blocks right now, in the same way that 20 years ago, if bitcoin existed at the time, the network wouldn't have been able to handle 1 MB blocks.
But technology keeps chugging along.  Of course, if it stops for some reason, then blocksize increases should ALSO stop.  But right now, technology and costs are continuing to get better and better and show no sign of stopping.
Blocksize increases are NOT a threat to decentralization, if technology keeps getting better and better, like it has done so for the last 20 years.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:57:53
If the hard fork fails, then miners can just increase the blocksize to 4MB using a soft fork instead.
It really isn't possible to stop hashpower, unless you are willing to use the Nuclear Option which is a POW change hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:52:19


Yes.  Thats how technology works.
Hardware and software both get better over time.
And as this hardware and software get better over time, the network is able to handle a larger and larger capacity over time.
Bandwidth costs, for example, have decreased by 33% every single year for the last 8 years that bitcoin has been around.
Meaning that the cost of sending information over the bitcoin network has ALSO decreased by an equivalent 33% per byte, because one of the biggest bottlenecks for costs is simply bandwidth.
And, presumably, bandwidth costs will continue to decrease by 33% every year going forward, at least for the next couple decades.
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:58:12
The code that is currently running on bitcoin core does not do what you say.
Segwit miners will continue to built atop of NON-segwit blocks.  They will put their new block on whatever chain is the longest, even if that chain includes an "invalid" non-signaling block.
A segwit miner has to explicitly install bip148 in order to reject non-signaling blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:12:59
But if the hashpower does a soft fork, then the investors cannot move their investment, unless they do a POW hard fork. 
So sure, investors always have the right to form their own alt coin. But that is their only option.

@_date: 2017-07-20 01:14:44
I am sure that big blockers would be perfectly happy with an extension blocks soft fork solution which makes total blocksize equal to 4MB average.
That is what I expect is going to happen if the hard fork fails.
Miners will just soft fork extension blocks in and there will be nothing that core can do to stop it, because it will be a soft fork.
Well, I guess they could POW hardfork, but now THEY are the ones who have to flip their arguments all around and talk about how hard forks that break the network are OK as long as THEY are the ones doing it.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:40:52
I wonder if you are going to say the same thing when the legacy chains tries to do its POW hard fork?
Or is that going to be different?
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:05:57
You can continue to call the fork whatever you want.  Fortunately the opinion of rando reddit users doesn't matter.
What matters is that the economic majority will just call it "Bitcoin".
There is nothing that anyone can do to stop us from calling it Bitcoin.
The REALLY funny part is that when this happens, and the legacy chain has .1% hashpower, then core is going to do a POW hardfork.  And now BOTH chains are hardforks, and you will no longer be able to use this "but it is a hardfork so its not really bitcoin", because NEITHER chain will really be "bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:48:04
They start doing transactions on the BIP 148 chain, and then lets say that the chain has 1% hashpower. 
Then the 148 chain could be easily reorged by an attacker. 
Less hashpower means less security. No, they don't reorg onto the legacy chain, but you could do an normal 51% attack on it. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:14:37


You understand that this is literally what they are doing right?
Thats what bitcoin cash is.  It is a hardfork.  If you don't like it, then don't use their "altcoin".  Everyone wins, correct?

You are really, REALLY underestimating the attacks that the other side could do, if it came to a metaphorical, all out war.
If miners want to stop segwit, it is trivial to do so, and you don't have to hard fork, all you have to do a second Soft Fork.
All they have to do is orphan all segwit transactions.  NOT refuse to signal segwit.  But signal segwit, so that you don't orphan them, and THEN make segwit useless when it "activates" but nobody is able to spend any segwitcoins.
Soft fork the soft fork is the strategy.  Your node will follow, because the miners aren't doing anything that break your rules.  
At that point your only option is to POW change, will all the insanity that comes along with that.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:26:16

@_date: 2017-07-03 04:35:34
Yes, if price is lower then the segwit2X chain will lose.  That is a given.
But currently the economic majority, and most of the economically important players in the market, like Coinbase, are getting behind segwit2X.
I would love if there was a betting market setup for segwit2X, UASF, and legacy chain, that way people could put their money where their mouth is.
BU is dead, though, I agree.  No major economic players are behind BU anymore.  They are all behind segwit2X.
But, in the long term, if segwit2X wins, staying on segwit2X afterwords is dead simple.  If it loses, then yes, it is done.  But at that point it doesn't matter what code you write so who cares.  If it loses it loses, and efforts should be focused on something else, and the failed segwit2X chain should be abandoned.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:13:44
They corralled them into supporting segwit2X.
Every significant miner is signalling for segwit2X, not bip 91.
It is dishonest to claim that those miners are supporting bip 91 when all of them have stated that they are supporting not that, but segwit2X and NY agreement.
If you want to claim that you don't care what the miners support, and that your node is only going to enforce segwit and NOT segwit2x, thats fine.  
But please don't be dishonest and put words into other people's mouths, and lie about how they support BIP91 when they have been EXCEEDINGLY clear that they actually support segwit2X and NYA.

It is almost as if the  Core team should have started working on this years ago, instead of trying to run out the clock. 
And it is not like the other side is any better. The other side literally wants to deploy an untested P O freaking W change to the network if their UASF fails. 
Remember, if UASF doesn't get over 10% of the hashpower, then it doesn't even activate segwit!
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:02:54
But miners can still activate segwit2X without going through the 148 process.

Ok.... so does that mean that you support 4MB?
Does the jump from 2MB segwit to segwit + 2MB HF (4MB average), prevent you from running your fully validating node?
If it doesn't prevent you from running your node, then that contradicts your statement, where you said that you don't care how big blocks are.

@_date: 2017-06-14 18:57:58
Luke and co are advocating for a POW change as well.  so it is not really different than that.
None of this really matters though, because the UASF chain has less than 1% support right now, and it needs at least 10% for segwit to even activate.

@_date: 2017-07-20 05:56:20
No you would not have that.
Read what I just posted.
segwit is 2MB average blocksize.
I am saying that instead of 2MB average blocksize, you have 3.9 MB average blocksize.  You can do this by setting a 4MB hard limit on segwit2X.  IE blocks can contain 2MB of base block data, AND 2 MB of witness data.
The only way to get 4MB in normal segwit is to make it so the block contains a single, very large transaction, that is entirely made up of witness data.
For segwit2X, if you have 2 MB base blocks, and allow for 2 MB of additional witness data, you can have blocks that are size 4MB, but are NOT a single transaction and are instead a whole bunch of transactions.
It would result in a capacity of about 4X our normal blockchain capacity. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:15:40
If you have less than 10% of the hashpower, then segwit never activates.  
Right now, the UASF chain has less than 1% committed support.
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:13:29
They are running Core nodes. But not UASF nodes. 
Funny how your arguments can go both ways. 
IMO, the vast majority of users favor status quo, which means no BU, no hard fork, and no UASF. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:25:46
"they want SegWit activated."
As does everyone who agreed to the NYC consensus.
The bigblockers are going to have segwit as well.  It is going to happen on the 2MB chain (for 4MB total).
Ironically, it is the UASF chain that will not have segwit activated, because segwit will expire if it does not have &gt;10% of the hashrate (which it doesnt).
So go ahead, follow the non-segwit BIP 148 chain.  Funnily enough, it isn't going to even be a soft fork, because Luke and Co want to POW change.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:53:09
Umm, why don't you just read the stuff they are saying? 
It is no mystery what they want. 
They want segwit + a 2MB hard fork, for an average of 4MB capacity. 
They have been asking for this for 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:07:12
Their proposal is literally just a checkpointed chain.  Thats it.  1 checkpoint.  So it is not even a hardfork or anything.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:17:22

He'll probably work on bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:27:14
"Which the nodes define."
Yes..... And extension blocks would be a valid chain.
Extension blocks is a soft fork, which means it is fully backwards compatible with all core clients.
The Core 0.13.1 and on versions would recognize extension blocks as valid.
Sure, a hard fork would not be valid.  Which is why, if the hard fork fails, big blockers could easily soft fork their blocksize increase instead.  And if their soft fork has the most hashpower, then all the core nodes would follow.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:58:55

Hey, I totally agree on that.  BU does not seem to have the support of the economic majority at the moment.
But that tells us nothing about whether UASF has the economic majority.
Personally I think that bitcoin is strongly biased towards status quo.  It is totally possible that neither changes have the support of the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:03:18
Good thing the developers are not in charge, and were never in charge.
Your assertion is also incorrect.
Multiple developers have put out blocksize increases.  Yes, including "respectable" Core developers!  Luke-jr put 1 out, for a specific example.  The creator of the lightning network also put out a Soft Fork Block Size increase called Extension Blocks.  
There has been a ton of work done by the actual Core Development team on future hard fork blocksize increases.  
The Core devs are in favor of future blocksize increases.  It says so right on the Core Roadmap!
The debate that is going on, has always been about "when" not "if" blocksize increases are going to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:41:04
Also, you have to watch out for purposeful sabotage.
Luke has already put out code that, if implemented, would sabotage the agreement, by purposefully misinterpreting it.  
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:54:13
Exactly :)  Which means we are getting 4 MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:29:44
Then the miners will just soft their blocksize increase, via extension blocks.
What are you going to do?  POW change?  That would be your only option.
You can do a whole heck of a lot of things, with a soft fork.  Even increase the blocksize to 4MB, like the big blockers want.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:20:57
It surprises me why people are confused that BIP 148 has less than 1% miner support right now.
Why would a miner support the side that is threatening to destroy their entire business?  That is way to risky.
Maybe if segwit activates, you won't POW change NOW, but since you've already established that this is on the table, who know what you might do in the future.
It is safer for the miners to just unite and oppose you all now, than risk letting you win.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:44:45
We already have such a group. Jeff is working on it. 
He will have code ready in a month or so, and we will have segwit +2MB HF (4MB average), within the next 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:36:27
That logic works both ways.
If all that you said is true, then wouldn't OTHER people be able to soft fork a blocksize increase, via extension blocks, and then us big blockers get what we want?
I'd be fine with that to be honest.  You soft fork segwit in existence, and then the big blockers do the exact same thing to get our blocksize increase (for a total of 4MB.  2MB + segwit = 4MB average).
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:00:22
They will absolutely be valid transactions.  Segwit is still valid, even for legacy nodes, and it is equivalent to extension blocks.  If invalid segwit transactions are orphaned, or invalid extension blocks transactions are orphaned by the mining majority, then there is nothing anyone else can do about it, and the transactions are valid.
The reason why they are valid, is because the transactions are sent through the "anyone can spend" code. A soft fork is fully backwards compatible.  Legacy nodes follow the soft fork chain, if it has a majority of the hashpower. 
The coins can't be stolen, because the miners would reject the theft transactions.  
The confines of the existing consensus are very broad. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:00:47
OK, let's say the miners attack the main chain with overwhelming hash rate, and do reorgs, ect. 
Then, in order to continue on your core chain, you HAVE to POW change. 
Sure, you don't have to follow the big block chain, but you definitely have to hard fork. 
So, yes, you can force a hard fork if you have enough hashpower. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:52:23
the coop proposal has nothing to do with BIP 148 though.
It is signalling on bit 4, and they have not committed to the 148 soft fork. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:35:22


And how's it going getting &gt;50% of miners on board?  How close is UASF to this goal?

@_date: 2017-06-20 19:13:21

Luke will, thats not the same as the Core development team.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:45:33
Well, they CAN.  The real question is, will they, and what happens next.
For example, they could just orphan all segwit transactions, and only allow legacy, perfectly backwards compatible transactions.  Longest valid chain wins.  Even if that "valid" chain contains zero segwit transactions, because 51% of the network thinks that segwit is invalid.  The segwit "anyone can spend" transaction type, becomes "no one can spend".
This is either a "soft fork" or a "51% attack", depending on your perspective.  
Similarly, you could activate another soft fork, that increases the blocksize by an additional 2MB (for 4MB total).  Increasing the blocksize via softfork is entirely possible.
But, again, this is either a "network capacity upgrade" or a "51% attack", depending on which side you support.
A whole heck of a lot of attacks on the network become possible, once 51% of the network decides to do something.  
Users, could, of course, fire missiles back at the miners in response to this network upgrade attack, but now we are getting into POW HF territory, and extremely adversarial conditions, in which nobody knows what will happen.
But there are certainly a whole lot more cards left on the table, for both sides to utilize.  If the hard fork fails, the war is far from over.

Yes it is routing around Core. 
We are installing the code that we want, and there is nothing Core can do to stop us. 
We WILL be getting segwit.  It will just come with a 2MB HF(for 4MB average). 
Core can't do anything to stop this, because they are not in charge. Users and the economic majority are in charge. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:47:54
They are supporting 4MB average. They are not supporting UASF. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:15:06
I really believe that all these pro-softfork and "hardforks are almost impossible" folks are going to be eating their words very soon.
If the segwit2X proposal doesn't go through due to its hardfork being rejected, the next step for the bigblockers is obvious. Convince the miners to deploy extension blocks, so as to increase the blocksize via a soft fork to 4MB.
The only way to stop the blocksize increase at this point is to POW change. What is Eric going to be saying when THIS happens?
Is he all of a sudden not going to be worried about "the logistical nightmares and philosophical issues regarding forcing all users to accept the change.".
Doubt it. He'll probably just start talking about how User Activated Hard Forks are completely safe or something.
Scatch that, actually, what happens when the UASF gets less than 10% of the hashpower and segwit doesn't activate, because it expires before then?
Is Eric going to magically be in favor of POW Hard Forking then?
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:55:08
Ah, I misread. Apparently there are multiple proposals that attempt to fulfill the NY  compromise. 
Yes, the coop proposal does what you say. But that is because it wasn't created by the participants of the NYC compromise. 
But the Jeff proposal, that is officially supported by the participants of the NYC compromise, does not do what you say.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:49:14
The code is open source.  So anybody can.  
It is not even that many lines of codes....  It is really not that difficult to implement "if X number of blocks signal over Y period of time, then change this one blocksize variable over here".
Changes like that do NOT need as many eyes as possible, because they are simple.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:50:27
We ARE routing around Core though.  We are routing around their one specific decision to not increase the blocksize (to 4 MB average), and we are doing it ourselves.  
Which is different from routing around their code, of course.  
By routing around Core, we mean "we can do whatever we want, and Core can't stop us, because their code is open source, so we can change it."
We are routing around their POLITICAL process, not their code.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:20:23
Not really, no.  
The economic majority is what is in charge of deciding which chain to follow.  And right now, UASF has zero major bitcoin companies on board, who are going to follow the UASF chain, and not follow the bitcoin core chain.
Nodes run by rando people on reddit dont matter.  The only thing that matters is the economically important nodes, like coinbase or something.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:56:31
You misunderstand what he is saying.
He is saying that if the bitcoin price crashes to 1000$, you are screwed, and you won't be able to resell those miners, because nobody will be buying them.
Bitcoin hasn't crashed back down to 1000$, so of course you are making money.  But if the crash DOES happen, then you are screwed.
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:56:45
Lol, you do know that BIP 148 has 0.3% of the hashpower and that if it doesn't get &gt;10% then segwit fails to activate, right?
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:06:05
They can actually do basically whatever they want.
Soft forks are extremely powerful and can do a whole lot of things, if you are clever about them.
You can even increase the blocksize, via extension blocks.  
The only way to respond to a miner who controls over half the hashpower, is to POW change.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:40:55


I think that is up to the exchanges/market/users to decide.  And apparently at least 1 exchange, coinbase, will be going along with the segwit2X hardfork.  
I can call it whatever I want, as can exchanges, as can other users.  And the market will determine what the "real" bitcoin is.
It is not like the other side isn't doing the same thing, anyway.  Luke and co are already planning on doing a POW hard fork, without consensus, when their UASF fails.  And they will certainly call their coin the "real" bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:16:47
Comments like this are why Bitfury joined the NYC agreement.  
They got terrified by the things that the segwit and UASF people were proposing, so jumped ship to the side that definitely ISN'T going to make their entire company worthless.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:30:07
Thats how open source works.
I am not sure what your point is.  Bitcoin is an open source project.
Anyone can make any changes that they want, and the users decide what to run.
Yes, Core can continue to make their suggestions.  And other people can continue to change it.  
This is good, is it not?  We can take all the good things that Core has done, and we can change it slightly, and then get the best of both worlds.  We don't need Core to get what we want.  Open source.  The code is already out there.  If Core wants to continue to contribute to bitcoin, they are free to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:29:25
You can get miners to "commit" to something.  And then if they don't follow through with their commitment, you can punish them later.  
Their commitment now, can be used as a better excuse to punish the defectors.  EX: by threatening to orphan blocks, even if the hard fork fails.  
IE, if the hard fork fails, and it fails because of the actions of some of the defector miners, well, even after the hardfork chain is long gone, maybe on the main chain the orphan rate for the defections will suddenly increase from 1% to 10%.  And even though those defectors "won" by allowing the main chain to continue, they will still lose hundreds of thousands of dollars due to retaliation.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:01:21
That table is not a measure of UASF support.  Basically nobody of any importance supports UASF, where importance is defined as "runs a major bitcoin company/economic node.".
A segwit support will not follow the UASF chain.
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:34:54
You wish that 90% of the hashrate forks off?
You do know that if that happens, then the UASF won't actually activate segwit, because segwit will expire before enough blocks are mined to activate segwit.

Look, if you are going to condemn the censorship stuff that happened 2 years, go ahead.
But credit where credit is due, the mods have been pretty hands off lately.  
Speaking as a big blocker, who has been quite active and vocal on this subreddit, for at least the last year, things really have been quite open, and I have never felt bullied or censored by the mods (now, have I felt bullied and browbeaten by some of the vocal trolls who are arguing in bad faith? yeah absolutely.  But not from the mods.).  
The censorship stuff stopped a very long time ago, but the meme still continues.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:27:22
You can do basically anything with a soft fork.
So, lets say the big blockers push through a soft fork blocksize increase, via extension blocks.  If you block it, does that make you malicious?
Who is in charge of pushing through these opt out changes?  Core?  What if we don't want them in charge?
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:26:54
The scenario would be 1% of the hashpower follow the UASF chain, and then anybody can just attack it.  That is how much support it currently has.  
If the miners Hard Fork, they could sell their coins to the 90% of the economically important nodes, that have already signed on to the NYC agreement.  EX: Coinbase.
"So, yes, you can Hard fork - but you can't force people to follow it."
You can't force people to follow it.  But you can kill the main chain, if the main chain doesn't have any hashpower.  So, the main chain people would be forced to POW change, ie hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:03:03
Well, but if everyone is using asicboost then nobody is.
asicboost has the same effect on the network, as moving from CPU, to GPU mining, to ASIC mining.
It does not decrease security, because although it decrease the "cost" per work, miners will just respond by increasing the amount of work that they do.
EX: if the network does 1 petahash, and cost per petahash gets cut in half, then the network will just change to doing 2 petahashes, for exactly the same cost.
The only security issues come when not everybody is using it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:07:53
Actually, if it has less than 10% of the hashing power, then segwit expires before it can be activated.  Ironic, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:27:56
THE NYA HF is being created by a Core developer (Jeff).  So it will be the same quality as any other bitcoin Core code.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:39:29
Not really though.  So miners, if they really wanted to, could respond by soft forking the soft fork.
So, the way the attack would work, is that miners "signal" for segwit, and then when segwit gets "activated" they just soft fork a second time, and make ALL segwit transactions invalid.
Segwit is backwards compatible, so it will still allow legacy transactions.  
If you don't have majority hashpower, the other side can stop you from doing pretty much anything.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:33:21
Bitcoin is open source.
You can run whatever code you want, and core developers can continue to write whatever code they want.
You can even take the Core client, and change ~4 lines of code in it, and it will be perfectly compatible with a post activation segwit2X chain.
Bitcoin is run on proof of work, not proof of github.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:12:27
I will save your comment for later. 
If the segwit + 2MB HF (4MB average) chain goes through, and segwit gets activated by the miners, will you agree that you were wrong about these conspiracy theories? 
 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:03:13
 They will probably just checkpoint their chain.   So not super complicated.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:27:24
Nor is there any hurry for miners to activate segwit.  
I'm fine with waiting.  No one gets what they want until compromise is achieved.  Status quo has been working alright so far, and the scaling debate was delayed for 2 years already.  It can wait ANOTHER 2 years.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:52:26
I'd at the very least would like to see a futures market pop up.
Everyone is talking about the economic majority, but I don't see any evidence.
A futures market would be evidence.  Either it would support UASF or it would not.  No ifs thens or buts. And we could stop arguing about this. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:24:55
"If segwit is active tomorrow, then we can work on a hard fork, right?"
No.  That won't happen.  With everything that has been said by all of the Core Developers, I have no reason to believe that they would ever support a blocksize hardfork.
If this is untrue, then they are free to merge that Hard Fork code into core.  But they won't do it.  Because they have never supported it, and as soon as they get Segwit, it is game over for the scaling debate.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:58:48
The problem is that the hard fork will just be delayed and will never happen. 
It is now or never. Why give the small blockers what they want, if they are just going to take it and never come back to the table? 
No. What the big blockers HAVE to do is force the network to stay at status quo until the other side is willing to compromise. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:22:22
Sure.  Every node is an economic node, but different nodes have different amounts of voting power.
It is called the economic majority.
If someone else is transacting in 10s of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin every day, their opinion matters more than a rando's node that trades a bitcoin or 2 every year.
And right now, the economic majority does not seem to support UASF.
The market will decide who wins.  And right now, the odds are not in favor of UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:04:54
"Destroy their entire business? How?"
With POW change or by threatening to POW change.  There are many UASFers who even want to POW change irregardless of anything to do with segwit, because it would get rid of asics and make the network more decentralized.
If the UASFers win, then it proves to the world that this group of people, who threaten to POW change, have power.  And because they have power, they might POW change in the future.
If the other side wins, it proves that bitcoin is resilient to change, and that it will be almost impossible to POW change in the future.  
The "compatible with BIP148" is a bit of a trick by Jeff, though.  It is only compatible if they signal for segwit2x BEFORE august 1st, and if 80% of the network signals for segwit2x.  Then it becomes not compatible.  Time will tell whether they actually signal for it by that timeframe (80% is a lot....)
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:38:40
Well then how about Core merges 2MB + segwit Hard Fork (for average of 4MB) in the Core github.  That would solve the debate.  And the "decentralized" Core development team still gets to be in charge.

They are literally doing what you suggested they do. 
They are writing hard fork code and putting it on github and having people run it. All without any support from the official core devs. 
And they can't force the community to go along, but if you want to be able to interact with coinbase or bit pay, or 99 percent of the hashpower and not have week long block confirmation times, then yes, you will have to go along with it.

Ok, hypothetical situation.
2 miners mine a block.  Chain 1 is not extention blocks and has X total blocks.  
Chain2 has x+2 blocks and IS an extension blocks soft fork.
Which chain does a core .14 Node follow?  Which one does a core .14 miner mine on top of?
The code, as is written in the Bitcoin Core github follows chain 2, because it has more hashpower and is a valid chain, and that is how bitcoin works.
Are you actually claiming that a bitcoin core .14 node would NOT follow chain 2, even though it has more hashpower and is a valid chain?
I really can't tell if you are trolling or not, or just merely don't know what bitcoin core .14 code does.  Do you actually believe that bitcoin core nodes do not follow the longest valid chain?
You also do not know how segwit works.  Segwit is backwards compatible.
That means that old nodes WILL follow the segwit chain if is has the most hashpower.  Legacy nodes do not have to upgrade, if the longest chain is segwit.
Do you even know what a soft fork is?  Do you know what backwards compatible means?  Do you know what the behavior of legacy nodes is?

The answer is simple. 
It was never about asic boost and the core developers know that.

Nobody is taking away your rights.
You can continue to call other people's chains "fake bitcoin", and the rest of us can continue to not care, and not waste any of our time mining on your chain.  
You can call us an altcoin all you want, but nothing stops the market from referring to it as "bitcoin".  
How can calling something a name that you don't agree with be infringing on your rights?  Crytocurrencies do not live in the world of trademark or copywrite law.  So whatever name we use to refer to our "bitcoin" chain has no effect on you.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:04:22
No, the blocksize parameter is not just a matter of technical debate.
The technical facts/agreement around the blocksize is that there are advantages and disadvantages to increasing the blocksize.
Increasing the blocksize gives you more capacity, but increases the cost of running a node, therefore increases centralization by some amount.  Those are the technical facts that everyone agrees on.
Now, whether or not the benefits of increased capacity outweigh the increase in node costs, is not a matter of technical debate.  It is a political, SUBJECTIVE debate.  
You cannot prove, with math, that the benefits are or are not worth the costs.  That is a subjective, political debate.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:21:05
Ok then, that is a fun game for us to play.
Would you then agree that extension blocks, which increases the blocksize via a soft fork, and could increase it as much as we want, ALSO does not alter the bitcoin protocol?
Or is that different?
You can do a whole lot of things with a soft fork.

"Really? Your conclusion is: Adam Back wants $100 fees?"
Yes!  Read the stuff that they say.  Specially, go read the stuff that Blue Hair Matt says.
The Core developers EXPLICITLY want high fees.  Because fees are what pay for the network security.  The lower fees are, the lower security the network has.
Them being worried about low fees, is an explicit argument that they use against increasing the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:02:41
No, because any miner that mines a segwit tx would get their blocks orphaned, assuming 51% engaged in this attack.  the people engaging in the attack would have a perfectly valid chain though... just without any segwit txs.

I am going to save this comment for later, and then show it to you, when 90% of the network does the thing that you think is impossible.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:17:08
Because the Core Developers have now said that they aren't going to 2MB Hard Fork, and that is the only way we are only going to get Segwit.
If Core wants segwit to happen, the solution is easy.  They can come out in favor of a 2 MB HF + segwit.  
Actually, no.  We don't need them to do that.  Because other people are doing that already.  So I guess we really ARE going to get exactly what the Hong Kong agreement promised.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:01:00


Because sometimes there is no mathematically provably "best" technical solution.
Sometimes you are deciding between 2 solutions that have a series of benefits and drawbacks, but aren't provably "better" than the other.
The current scaling debate is not a technical debate.  Because all the technical questions have been answered.  The current scaling debate is one of values.  Do you want to have 1 set of benefits and drawbacks, vs a different set of benefits and drawbacks.
And personally, I prefer a different set of benefits and drawbacks than those chosen by the extremely conservative Core team.

Why would any miner follow a chain where the leaders are threatening to burn away all the millions that the miners have spent on POW investment?  It is too risky to go along with people who are threatening to destroy it all.  It is better to just stick with a status quo of running the same Core software that has worked for us for almost a decade.

Well, then those people didn't agree to it.  They aren't in charge of bitcoin though, so it doesn't matter that much.
You are talking about Jihan, but the thing is that basically every major bitcoin company was at the NYC agreement.
Coinbase isn't owned by Jihan, and they are going to go along with the hard fork.

Lets say I get a bunch of miners together, and we activate extension blocks, and increase the blocksize to 4MB average, all via soft fork.
This would be a backwards compatible soft fork that many people support.  
Would you agree?  Or would you call this an attack on the network?  It is exactly the same as what you are proposing.
I have proposed such a thing, that big blockers should just soft fork the network to get their blocksize increase to 4MB, but the small blockers always yell that this is an attack, and that they would change to POW to stop 4MB.

Hmm, it seems that there has been some interesting developments within the last 24 hours.  So forgive me for not being immediately up to date with conversations that are happening in real time.
The Jeff proposal is now in PARTIAL compliance with BIP148, as stated here:
"If I read it correctly, the parameters for activation of the HF are:
If SegWit2X activates before ~sep 20, activate HF on ~sep 20.
Otherwise, activate directly when SegWit2X activates.
Is this correct and definitive?"
But, if the Jeff proposal does not activate before the UASF date, then it can still be activated in the future.  So miners could, in theory, wait to activate Jeff's proposal until after BIP148 expires.
That seems like a reasonable compromise to me, as it does not enforced BIP148, it only gives people the option of using bip148.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:18:00
Yeah, I am kinda sad about the recent developments, although it is not 100% that the segwit2xers are going to activate before aug 1st.
I really wanted the 148ers to try their chainsplit (and likely fail).  That way this whole meme can end, and we have definitive proof, one way or the other, about who the economic majority REALLY supports.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:14:34

Or do companies like Coinbase, no longer matter to bitcoin?
I wonder what the rhetoric is going to be when the segwit2x nodes outnumber the legacy chain nodes?  Will segwit2x be derided as a stupid, populous uprising, from the uneducated masses? (aka, we hate it because it is popular among users.  Never mind that we were talking about 'users' for a year).
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:54:06

Don't worry. We'll be getting segwit..... Once we ALSO have more scaling beyond the amount that segwit provides. 
Nothing was hijacked. The big blockers have been extremely clear as to what we want, over the last 2 years. We want segwit + 2MB for 4MB average. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:05:19
Not according to the economic majority.  The economic majority, defined as, the bitcoin companies that transact millions of dollars in bitcoin every day, don't seem to support UASF.
The economic majority seems to support the 2MB+segwit (for 4MB average) compromise option.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:55:04
Sure, but segwit eventually expires.  If not enough blocks are mined in a short amount of time, then segwit expires.
Segwit only activates if it has 95% of blocks in a 1000 block period.  Now imagine if only 100 blocks are mined.  Then it won't activate.

Status quo bias is a good thing.  It ensures that nobody is able to make changes to the network if there are even a little controversial.  It forces people to work out their differences.

I don't see anything in the post that frames them as the enemy.
I was merely stating fact.  We can get big blocks, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it unless they POW change.
This is not advocating for a POW change.  It is merely stating fact.

Yes.... And that is exactly what we are doing.  That is what the segwit + 2MB HF is (for a total of 4MB average).
Users working on code themselves and running it, because Core has failed to give them what they want.

Oh?  And how many companies have gotten on board with UASF?
How many of them have said that they are going to run their business on the minority hashpower chain?  Hint: Basically 0.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:49:49
If it has less than 10% of the mining power, then the UASF chain won't even have segwit enabled (because segwit would expire before it is activated).  
So ironically, we could be in a situation where the UASF chain has not segwit, but the main chain DOES have segwit.

You can support multiple things at once.
Nobody would be opposed to this existing.

Whats stops the segwit people from just saying "No HardFork", once they have gotten what they want?
Nothing.  The is the problem.  If Jihan activates segwit, the other side will just NOT go along with the HF.
It is all or nothing.  There is zero point in activating segwit now, if your goal is to get 2MB HF (for 4MB average)
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:54:42
It needs 10% of the hashpower though.  Otherwise segwit expires before it is activated on the UASF chain.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:39:04
The issue is that if it has less then 10% of the hash rate, then it WONT even have segwit activated. 
Also, if it was something crazy low like 1% then any moderately sized miner could just start reorging it for kicks and giggles. 
Would you really invest in something where your coins can disappear any minute due to a reorg?

Which is why the big blockers can just soft fork their blocksize increase, via extension blocks.
If the miners are on board, it is not possible to stop a blocksize increase, unless you go full nuclear and POW change.  Soft forks can get the big blockers everything that they want.
You don't have to install anything.  Your Core node will follow the longest, valid chain, which could very well be an extension blocks chain.  It is that or POW change.  Take your pick.
Don't worry, this whole "hard forks are evil" rhetoric will disappear overnight once THEY want to get their own hard fork passed.

Then maybe they don't spend any money marketing?
I mean, this guy sn0wr4in is already doing marketing for them by word of mouth.
Also, they DO seem to have ways to make money.  They state as follows : "Edgeless plans to earn profit solely from player error and from sports betting".
Which is smart!  Who cares if their roulette table is perfectly fair?   Them being edgeless IS the marketing campaign!
Making money when players make mistakes on "edgeless blackjack" is also interesting.

Go read the actual blog post.  
Here is a link:
"We recognize the New York Consensus. Bixin Pool will support Segwit2x scheme as long as it is technologically mature, and is deployed by the community."
Make of that what you will.  But I will say that this isn't exactly the same as denouncing segwit2x, like you are making it seem like.
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:15:07
" But with 51% of miners behind you, you can already do now stuff like this"
But here is the thing.  But the point is that we are already in this situation.
Currently over 51% of the miners do not support segwit, and want something else.  So UASF isn't enough.  
Even if UASF "wins" the war is far from over.  IMO, things are going to go as far as POW change attempts.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:27:14
Someone gets it! 
Yeah, small blockers have been tricked on this. 
All you miners have to do is choose to not signal segwit2X until after Aug 1st, and it stops UASF in its tracks.

Look, this meme needs to stop.
I myself have been a big blocker since the begining, and I will say that the Theymos censorship stuff ended a long time ago.
For the last year, at least, r/bitcoin has been extremely open, and great way of communicating with all parties.  Sure, the users are slanted towards one side, but there really is a pretty large diversity of opinions going on.
Props to the mods for realizing their mistake and changing their tune/policies, and making this subreddit more open.

Rando users on reddit have very little economic power.
The people with the economic power are the ones with the money and the ones that are transacting 10s of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin every day, such as the bitcoin companies
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:45:47
Not exactly.
I wasn't saying that miners can go back in time and REVERT segwit, and then steal everyone's money.  You can't undo a soft fork like that.
I was saying that 51% of miners can reject FUTURE segwit transactions.  So they allow segwit to active, but they just only do non-segwit transactions.  They don't steal money.  They just only do legacy transactions, and make the blocksize 1 mb.  This would be perfectly valid to a "segwit activated" node, because legacy transactions are valid.
So it is not "undoing" a soft fork.  It is creating a second soft fork that makes segwit useless, and would not be stealing anyone's money.  Anyone can spend becomes no one can spend.
It is similar to an empty blocks attack, but instead of screwing over everyone, you just screw over segwit.

They are not 100% incompatible .
There is a magic bullet solution that could potentially bring all sides together.
I am not sure on the specifics, but there are potential improvements to the bitcoin protocol that have been theorized and discussed, that would massively reduce the network costs and the costs of running nodes.
If these network improvements were available today, then many of the arguments about the costs of scaling the blocksize would go away.
The problem, of course, is that writing code and actually creating these network improvements takes a lot of hard work and a lot of time.  So it is unlikely that these magic network improvements will appear anytime soon.

Core doesn't have to do anything.  I said the opposite.  
What I was saying is that IF they want segwit to happen, THEN the network is going to have to add a 2MB Hard Fork along with it.  
It is perfectly OK to stick with status quo, and not change anything.  Because that is what is going to happen unless people compromise.
But it is totally fine if Core doesn't merge hard fork code.  They don't have to do anything.  Other people are going to do the Hard Fork instead of them.  And there is nothing that Core can do to stop them.  Because the users are in charge, not Core.
You can call it an altcoin all you want.  But if every major company and exchange, like Coinbase, switches over, then it IS bitcoin.
And if Hard Forking is really ends up being an issue, then we can easily just make the blocksize increase happen via Soft Fork, through extension blocks.
You can use a soft fork to do whatever you want.  And you can ACTIVATE a soft fork, solely via the miners.  If you don't have the hashpower, then the soft fork blocksize increase to 4MB average, will happen.  And the only thing you could do to stop it is POW change into your own altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:31:38
What matters is the economic nodes.  Random nodes run by people on reddit, don't effect anything.
The one and only thing that you can do to get UASF to succeed, is to get the important bitcoin companies on board, like coinbase.
If you can't get them, then it won't succeed.  And it looks like, so far, these economic nodes are NOT getting on board.
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:31:38
Of course.  Thats exactly my point.
They endorsed segwit +2MB HF (for 4MB average).
And the segwit + 2MB plan is not UASF.  It is looking like it will be incompatible with BIP148, because it is on bit 4.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:38:51


This is false.
It would reject 100% of the blocks.
Because even if you produce a segwit-block, but you build it on TOP of another NON-segwit blok, then BIP 148 would reject it.
UASF does not have 30% of the hashpower.  They have 0.1% of the hashpower, because the rest will follow the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:50:52
Yes. There have been multiple Hard Fork proposals to increase the blocksize, over that last 2 years. And many of them are fully tested and ready to deploy.
