This "article" (if you could even call it that) is really quite stupid in its conclusions and it's written by a 12 yr old.
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:29:49




No. This is a dumb as fuck theory.
They can trace the attackers address just as easily as they can trace their own.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:25:58


What? These are not rules, only additional features. The devs have been adding features for years and it's still called Bitcoin. Why wouldn't it be.
@_date: 2016-08-28 08:11:35
No, you are not. But if you were, that would be even more embarrassing. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:53:28
I won't be paying shit for the downloads through his site. He should reward the uploaders with a percentage of Megaupload profits for the hits the uploader is bringing to his website.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:41:18
1% actually.

Mainstream acceptance is not far away. I expect big things this year.

There's a big difference between an armed robbery and a hack, genius. Here you go:
The stupidity on this forum never ceases to amaze me.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:48:38
Decentralized exchanges don't support margin trades.
@_date: 2016-08-15 06:15:13
If only you'd stop wasting your time on this project and put it to better use. Nobody needs, nor wants, a tonal version of Bitcoin. If you're doing this for anything other than your own amusement, you're wasting your time.
@_date: 2016-08-28 09:09:07
No, I did not. An off-chain computer system that has nothing to do with Bitcoin is not a decentralized system. It is a centralized database.
@_date: 2016-08-28 09:19:02
Nope, that's not what is happening at all. The majority of throughput on these exchanges is on-chain. Not to mention that if you're going to include ANY exchanges then you should include all of them, not just exclude one country because you're racist. All exchanges are susceptible to "washing", if that's your entire argument (and it's a bad one).
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:27:36
"The Leader in Blockchain Security" LOL. BitGo is quite clearly a joke.
@_date: 2016-08-30 07:09:12
What are the "other" things that get interesting from that perspective he's referring to?
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:56:43
I'm not concerned at all about a premine for something like this. What's worse, having all of that in the hands of some anonymous whales, or in the hands of the creators of the website who have the most to lose if they don't uphold a platform that is interesting for people to use. The rest of the article is garbage nonsense. A promotion for Yours (which isn't even out yet, nor do we have any idea wth it's going to look like, so I wouldn't be surprised if this author is affiliated or paid by them) and some links to some stupid twitter screenshots littered with memes, with a profile of a clown who goes by the catchphrase "if it's not a shitcoin, it's a scam". Clearly he's very unbiased lmfao. I guess it's entirely impossible for an altcoin to not either be a shitcoin or a scam, amirite? There's literally ZERO room for any further advancements in this sector, Bitcoin is the ONLY coin that will EVER exist that is legitimate, amirite guize? And then you listen to him speak, and he sounds like he has down syndrome and is LITERALLY just making up bullshit as he goes. Claims that Steem was hacked and the hacker was able to create infinite amounts of Steem out of thin air when in reality the only thing that was "hacked" was the Steem website, someone injected some malicious JS (XSS) and was able to steal coins of some poorly passworded wallets by bruteforcing them. The blockchain was not affected at all. What a complete moron this Tone guy is.
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:16:02
Hahaha, you got nothin'. So pathetic.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:25:19
Why do you think? There's only one conclusion to draw here.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:13:39
Exactly, so this shouldn't even be a thread. Why did you make it?
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:07:46
He thinks progress is awesome, you're criticising something without understanding it, notice the difference?
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:02:19
Maybe your problem is not LN's complexity, but your own inability to grok it? That sure sounds like the problem to me. As the person above you has stated, LN is no where near as complex as Bitcoin is. Just because **you** can't understand something, doesn't mean it's bad.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:41:15

I think you're asking this in the wrong place.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:03:25
Your calculations are far from correct. Math, do you even?
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:51:48
Hahahaha. What a piece of shit. It's sad there are people out there stupid enough to fall for this. The math is simple, if you can't sell faster than you can make a profit from the linear price increase (hint, you can't), then you aren't making ANY FUCKING MONEY. You're LOSING ALL OF IT. Idiots. I seen, I seen, I seen.
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:16:34
Haha, religious zealots. All I'm saying is you're wasting yours and everyone elses time by posting irrelevant opinions.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:20:51
I'm really sorry for your loss man. You'll be alright though.

Sorry for your loss my man.
@_date: 2016-08-28 07:04:29
Does not matter, traffic is traffic, usage is usage. No one should be able to decide what constitutes "real" usage, especially in a decentralized system.
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:55:12
Do you really expect more from a 19 year old with the username "Sizematters"? Just goes to show this sub is full of retarded children babbling nonsense.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:03:17
Yeah, I'm angry about your dumbass comment. I thought that was obvious?
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:13:44
"features", yeah, lets use the term loosely. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:56:40
Sarcasm or serious?
@_date: 2016-08-21 09:06:16
Hey look, no counter argument, what a surprise, thanks for proving my point and demonstrating you have no idea how a blockchain works LOL. What a moron.
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:53:35
Of course they should be, don't be retarded.
@_date: 2016-08-23 10:32:50
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:01:14
...It would be Bitc-ache, if you want to butcher it like that, and it's not even remotely pronounced the same. You're a bitch.
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:05:52
HAHAHAHA wow. That's something.
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:03:58
So what you're saying is if there's anyone we should listen to it's him?
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:20:12
No need to get so salty broseph. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 04:16:59
I understand it perfectly, you are the one who doesn't understand it lmfao. Please enlighten me genius, how is it any different to tracing a publicly known address? Hint: It isn't. There is no difference between a "tainted" UTXO and any other UTXO. Please, go on, I'll be waiting. You're probably the dumbass who made this stupid article, you write like you're having a stroke, and so does the author.
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:37:10
The target audience of Bitcoin is the entire world, idiots included...
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:59:14
Why should we care what you think, when you've just admitted you have no idea what you're talking about?




So yeah, you're right, this does sum up this subreddit, clueless people chiming in with their opinion when they shouldn't be voicing one. Well done.
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:27:53
What's funny about that?
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:25:33
Margin trading means less security, because they need more coins in their hot wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-14 11:38:05
Good for you. Microsoft has nothing to do with Blockstream.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:37:09
I knew it was going to be that video before I clicked it lmfao. Do you not understand that coins need to be on an exchange to trade them? Keep up that circle jerk though clown. Haha.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:37:01
If it's in cold storage there is no problem with that.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:05:56
They do. The only reason to keep your coins in an exchange is if you're trading frequently (day trading for example). Even then, you're playing with fire. I nearly lost 60BTC in this hack but I xferred my coins off BFX only 4 days ago. I was very lucky. If you're not trading, keep them in cold storage and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:04:40
Of course they add things to the protocol, that's how features are added. The difference is that they are not altering the core protocol, they are adding things to it, otherwise pushing the changes out would cause a hard fork instead of a soft fork and there would be no reverse compatibility. Take SegWit for example. Is Bitcoin no longer Bitcoin because of SegWit? In what form these features take I do not know, I'm not proposing (nor is the OP) changes to the core Bitcoin protocol, only additional features and extensions to its tool set that can be rolled out through a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:18:32
Not really. They can happen to any exchange, any time. Some have a reputation for being more secure than others, but there's not really a list. Bitfinex had a great reputation until now though, so it can flip quite easily. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:08:20
Yes. This is sorely needed. What is also needed is a public documentation and a technical discussion on solutions to secure coins for exchanges and new entrants into the Bitcoin business world. Cold storage is not adequate, exchanges need coins on the ready, there needs to be SOME way to secure these "hot" coins. Whether that solution is additions to the protocol or something else, I'm not sure, but SOMETHING needs to be done. Not only would it secure the existing Bitcoin business ecosystem, but it would entice other players to enter the ecosystem as well, because one of the biggest concerns for startup newcomers is the risk of hacks and the challenges in preventing the inordinate amount of damage they can afflict.
If nothing is done, this is not going to be the last time we see an exchange drained of all of its funds, and the larger Bitcoin gets the more severe the damage will be (cost and reputation wise).
Paging Core: @_date: 2016-08-03 10:44:32
Any exchange ending in X is trouble. I've compiled a list for you:
Polo is confirmed next exchange to get hacked. Get your coins out.
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:26:23
Yeah, I like how he uses the word "we" like his full time job isn't just trolling reddit like an asshat.
@_date: 2016-08-15 06:21:55
You have no idea what you're talking about lmfao. If they don't know you own Bitcoin, they're obviously not going to find it if you have a brain, and if they even do they won't be able to do anything with it if it's encrypted. Herpa derpa. Get a clue.
@_date: 2016-08-21 04:22:35
There's nothing to understand, the author AND this tothemoonbtc guy (probably the same person) are as stupid as each other.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:38:31
Plain and simple: You are seriously stupid.
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:54:34
Honestly, they'd be better off implementing this as a browser plugin I think, or at least using webkit. No idea what they're using, maybe they already are? Still, performance seems lacking.
@_date: 2016-08-11 01:56:33
If they don't plan on dipping into their own pockets I hope they get sued.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:04:35
Good lord, you are too stupid for words. Let me know when you learn how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:46:10
It'd be more accurate to say feature. Such a useless project.
@_date: 2016-08-18 11:00:21


Look, we found the OneCoin buyer guys. Lmao. Better these scamming clowns are dealt with now than later, obviously. If they get off the ground in a big way then we'll have a real problem.
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:21:17
Like I said, I don't care if he's doing it for his own amusement, but if it's being done to be some benefit to others, well... it's not... and it's just a severe waste of time and is doing nothing but muddying the waters.
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:57:04
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:05:56
Didn't say that you were stupid, just that you have a loud mouth and you have no idea what you're talking about. Two different things. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 05:12:22
Welcome! First bit of advice: Ignore the trolls and shills. This subreddit is full of them, and you will no doubt witness that for yourself in this very thread. Keep in mind that there are plenty of traders in here trying to advance their short positions by spouting negative nonsense. I've been holding for over 4 years now, it becomes part and parcel. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 07:48:43
What goes up must come down. Patience.
@_date: 2016-04-24 04:01:44
Yeah, HE is the joke when he says that.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:41:57
Finex is not the leading exchange. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:53:25
No. Steem Power does not have the same inflation rate that Steem has.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:45:48
Hahaha, good joke.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:58:01
The bad is things like the Bitcoin price taking a dive because Bitfinex failed to security. Let me put it this way, this won't be the last time an exchange gets hacked. Still though, even with that happening, you'll come out substantially ahead versus if you were just holding fiat. Of course, there are other risks too, but so far we have not been faced with any serious challenges other than exchanges getting screwed over.
@_date: 2016-08-28 09:06:07
Anything recorded on the blockchain is real usage. If it's off chain, then no. If it's on chain, then yes.
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:55:12


Lol no. Firstly, markets are never going to "switch", they'll either offer both options or Bitcoin alone. Secondly, no one gives a fuck. Dark markets might account for a lot of Bitcoins volume, but it's definitely not Bitcoins future. There are far more interesting things to look forward to.
@_date: 2016-04-27 09:46:18
Seems to be a decent amount of news about it? (look at News tab)
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:32:06
Silly conspiracy theories are rampant, exhibit  
This subreddit is plagued with wild conspiracies. I think a lot of them are created on purpose to muddy the waters. I wouldn't say we're letting them stand against our march forward though, but they are definitely frustrating. Btw, this article needs some serious work, it's full of grammar and spelling errors. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:37:13
I think if your articles had better titles people would be more inclined to upvote them: 
It's a sign of poor journalism.
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:46:44
This is true, but we were awfully close. Won't be long before we break it.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:58:22
Yep, this isn't going to end well for the operators unless they actually make good with their customers. I'm just glad I had no coins on there at the time.
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:59:36
This isn't a joke, it's a fact.
@_date: 2016-04-25 12:05:36


Sorta like what you're doing, huh?
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:27:22
Blockstream is not a hated company you idiot, lmfao. They're highly respected. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:58:37
This just goes to show that the core devs have their heart in the right place, they aren't sell outs.
@_date: 2016-04-24 10:07:36
Fun! My prediction: $493
@_date: 2016-04-24 02:47:26
What? Every single halving ever has caused a price rally. Unless you mistyped? I mean, it may not have been on the day of the halving, but it was either the preceding or following couple of months. It is yet to fail, so I don't see why we won't have a halving rally for BTC.
@_date: 2016-04-24 04:21:40
Good point. It's either they do it, or people will buy Bitcoin directly and avoid taxes at all costs. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:58:25
2.2 million retards allegedly have fallen for it so far. Willing to bet their numbers are complete bullshit though. Not hard for them to create fake accounts and figures.
@_date: 2016-04-24 04:18:30
This is how all markets operate, get used to it.
@_date: 2016-04-25 05:11:08
Yes this is correct, it causes speculation hype and buying. It's happened every other halving, so I see no reason why this one would be any different. It's also happened for the halving of every other altcoin too.
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:04:50
He got it spot on last time, so I wouldn't put it past him.
@_date: 2016-04-25 12:00:49
Damned if you do, damned if you don't. He decides to be open and honest about it instead of saying nothing, and clowns like you jump to wild conspiracy theories. He could have just said nothing and given you no ammunition to work off, and if he was seriously working against Bitcoin (which, does not even make sense to begin with) then he would have done exactly that and just said nothing. Please stop being so paranoid and ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-04-23 06:14:42
Why do people frequently say this nonsense? He doesn't think he's insightful, he just talks about things HE finds interesting. Get over it genius...
@_date: 2016-04-25 12:04:21
RaptorXP is a blocksize troll, I wouldn't worry about it. You did the right thing.

Haha so salty. Your comment history is hilarious.
@_date: 2016-04-24 04:15:25
Anyone who calls Bitcoin "Bit Coins" is not worth taking seriously.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:24:12
Consistently, for the last 3 months. That's the part you forgot to add. It means nothing.

Oh it will. It will.
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:19:11
Lightning Network will be good, but I can't help shake the feeling that it's a massive hack. It shouldn't be this hard to scale.
@_date: 2016-04-27 09:43:47
I've done this already, I couldn't find any. Feel free to prove me wrong though.
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:58:55
It is funny because we think you're a joke.

They are, China has the miners but America has the adoption/innovation.
@_date: 2016-04-25 12:02:37
Thanks for your hard work Peter, the fact that you were open about this sort of thing demonstrates you're a good person and care about Bitcoin. I appreciate the sentiment.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:18:29

This changes everything!
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:38:32
Congrats, things happen consistently in a bull market, that doesn't mean we're still in one.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:20:49


So are its fees.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:33:54
You don't get it. Obviously banks don't *want* to do it, that's an absurd suggestion. The point is that they do it within the requirements of the law, and BitStamp is doing **over** those requirements by a **large** margin. This is all rather simple, and KYC/AML is clearly defined. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:09:11
Don't have kids, adopt them. Right? Your example is stupid, fact of the matter is people don't want the burden of looking after abused or crazy pets. It's baggage that not everyone is capable of dealing with or has the desire to. It's like shaming people for not donating to charity. It's not an obligation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:43:34
That's not what he said at all, you're really good at putting words in peoples mouths.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:45
We have a winner!
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:57:12
Hear that guys? It's the sound of someone who doesn't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:00


Here Dad here's some free money I made!
Thanks Son. Hey I might do something with this.
No Dad, that's mine! I'll let you borrow it though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:23:41
You're missing the point entirely.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:20:16
Those are some awfully retarded and vague questions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:18
It's not competition, BCH has no leg to stand on, it's 100% manipulation. That's why it's nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:23:03
You're missing the point. The point is that I don't want somebody else's problem. If you have your own kid or buy a fresh puppy you know that its psychology has not been fucked with. Maybe one day your adopted pet snaps and chews off your childs face.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:22:45
The block chain *is* a ledger. For someone who thinks they know so much you sure have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:47:27
Hahahah, Brian Armstrong is investigating himself. Let me guess, the results are inconclusive? Fucking hilarious. They're already acting like banks.
Anyway, I'm sure the whales on the institutional futures markets won't take kindly to this level of manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:23:07
Well said. Banks can be useful too, and they're sure as hell less shady than most Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:15:12
And you weren't pestered about KYC stuff?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:44:29
Gemini is a far better alternative (simply because they aren't KYC nazis -- they do things within the law, not over the top), but unfortunately they aren't as global as they should be.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:05:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:25
Tell her to mind her own business, you owe her no explanations for your own personal finances. She sounds annoying as fuark.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:09:47
That's misleading. Every other exchange isn't as ridiculous with their KYC requirements, and to trade hundreds of millions on a stock exchange or with a broker it's not a requirement either. They're going over the top to protect themselves, but by doing so they're shafting their customers and ruining their reputation. It is most certainly not required to this level. It is at a very minimal level, but this is obscenely over the top.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:18:58
Yeah, that's despicable, and so are the other examples on there. Not only do I recommend against using Bitstamp purely for this reason, but if anyone who *does* use it ever receives any questions like this they should be blatantly refused for privacy reasons. You cannot be forced to provide that information, they cannot legally hold your money hostage. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:40:28
Pretty obvious that this is a troll.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:44:40
What? This is the first time I've ever mentioned it... And it's not FUD. 
The odds of them holding that much of a reserve are slim to none, otherwise they wouldn't be distancing themselves as far away from the US as humanly possible to avoid prosecution from the feds and SEC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:42:57
And how much have you processed through them? Try doing over 500k and let us know how that goes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:05:39
There's a difference between being responsible with your own wealth and having businesses steal from you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:31
You should buy good coins like RaiBlocks, not Bitcoin which was at the top of a bubble that was destined to pop any moment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:18:57
Bitcoin isn't a bubble, not at all, it's not like over a billion dollars of Tether have been created out of thin air to prop up the price due to Bitfinex's market manipulation. Nah, nothing like that at all. No bubble. Go back to sleep.

It wasn't a problem for me because I've made enough money in crypto for them to respect my process and value my opinion above theirs. I'm the one giving *them* advice, and usually my advice is right. It's also probably not a problem because I got my father involved with crypto and he's made a killing from listening to me. Maybe you could give your dad a little bit of your holdings and he'll show more interest and be more open to the idea. If you can help him grow his crypto he'll start seeing you as the wise one.

"A bitcoin transaction is something that allows you to send coins across the network"
"A mined block looks like a record in the ledger"
"It knows because the network tells it so"
Your questions require no level of depth, vagueness does not accomplish your goal, it only makes it harder to answer accurately. Besides, your assertion that anyone who doesn't understand Bitcoin from a highly technical perspective is not someone worthy of opinion or meaningful perspective is as stupid as your questions are. The irony is that **you** appear to be the "Dunning-Kruger affected guy". Do you know what's more relative to the price of Bitcoin? What's happening in the community. That is something that *anyone* can learn and stay on top of, no technical expertise required. Your questions mean nothing relative to what most people care about, they're just jerk-off posing to make you feel better about yourself for knowing some basic technical underlying knowledge.

They've been doing dodgy things since the start, this is nothing new. They had a massive debt from the exchange hack, they had to pay it off somehow, and market manipulation is the easiest strategy when you own an exchange. Most exchanges do it, Polo and Bittrex do it all the time and will lock out wallets at the same time as massive rallies.

I'd avoid them simply for this reason:  -- it's disgusting behavior and any business who operates like this does not deserve to be in business.

This wasn't "the dip"... Your example was backed by terrible news, this was backed by nothing, it's a slight correction nothing more. When some bad news lands you'll know what a dip is. Or when people wake up to the fact that the entire market is being manipulated by Tether printed out of thin air.

@_date: 2017-12-21 06:08:46
Roger Ver is so dumb. If the problem is being fast and cheap, you could use RaiBlocks which is instant and free. You're competing against Bitcoin by forking Bitcoin, it's a failing strategy, and only a sucker is going to fall for it. As far as I'm concerned, Bitcoin always has been and always will be a digital gold, first and foremost. There are far better "coffee buying coins" out there than Bitcoin, the code-base is just not equipped for it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:36:31


This. People have been saying it about Bitfinex and Poloniex for over a year now. It's just paranoia. Bitstamp has a solid reputation for a reason, so hopefully they see this and get their asses into gear, or I won't be using them in the future (and I hold several million in BTC).

What? Uh, how do you propose selling of Bitcoin if you can't trust a single exchange? It has nothing to do with "blind trust". I don't trust any of them, that's not going to stop them from ripping me off if I need to sell a coin however.

@_date: 2017-12-12 13:33:59
Right, but can you name a trustworthy exchange? The only one I can think of is Gemini, and it's fairly new so it hasn't really proven itself yet. The rest of them have stories of manipulation or frozen or disappearing funds, along with having previously been hacked.

You're going to have to be more clear. What experts can't be sure of what decisions to make?


Define unqualified. Also, define being at the mercy of, how are they at the mercy of unqualified individuals? They are not. They are at the mercy of the ETF rules...


It would be negligent and unprofessional of the SEC to allow rules to... Be rules? Okay.


It doesn't. Not even slightly. Please elaborate on how you understand it to say that.
I honestly have no idea what you're crying about. You're acting like this is some huge injustice when in reality this is how every ETF has worked and always will work. Clearly defined rules for everything. The end.

When you think about it, this isn't very impressive. The majority of "malware" runs in memory to begin with, and then dumps a copy of itself to disk and injects itself into startup routines to ensure it remains active on reboot. The difference here is that it just skips that process, so in reality, this malware is actually less technical than that of regular malware. Unless of course they've devised some clever ways to ensure uptime in memory through other means (perhaps polling rebroadcast from other infected machines).
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:10:38
Anyway, what does Adam Back know about the SEC approval process? Zilch. So you can't even say he's an authority on the matter. I happen to have a lot of experience in this area, so if anything, since I'm the qualified one, judging by your comment, you should just automatically assume I'm correct.

@_date: 2017-02-24 02:09:13
Not a chance. At most a couple of hundred dollars, but probably more like $50-100. This rally has been building for a long time now, it has very little to do with the ETF. I personally don't see it getting approved.

...What the hell are you talking about. The community consensus has literally zero to do with the ETF or the SEC. It's written there plain and clear, IF there is a hard fork, the coins of the majority fork is what you own. Stop conflating two entirely different things. The SEC doesn't need to give a shit about community consensus, it just needs the rules for the ETF to be clearly defined, and they are.

Yeah, because one Chinese miner decided to throw a few million dollars at it. Hardly what I'd consider support.
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:25:08
The single rich Chinese miner pumping millions of dollars into BU to try and persuade the Core devs to increase the blocksize is ultimately going to fail. It's all a big bluff. He knows that if BU is to succeed then the split chains will ultimately devalue his investment far more than any potential gains he could make by a blocksize increase. It's just political posturing, and the Core devs are not going to cave to terrorist demands. He's wasting his time AND his money, so whatever, let him be, let him drain himself. The market is not stupid enough to fall for it.

@_date: 2017-02-10 06:24:10
It's simplistic and naive for a few reasons:
1. It's not factoring in the long term implications of the blocksize increase (the decreased security for example), due to the drop off in node support due to increased bandwidth requirements and costs.
2. It's not factoring in the conflicts that could arise (probably will arise) from a hard fork. These conflicts will have a far more negative effect on the price than any throughput bonus that could be obtained.
3. SegWit DOES increase the TX throughput, and it does it in the safest way possible. There is no reason why a blocksize HF should occur if we haven't even activated SegWit yet.
4. There are better scaling solutions in the pipeline, we may not need a HF at all.
I'm sure there is more, but that'll do.

Ah, so let me get this straight, all of Roger's crying stems from the fact that he wants to be able to do 0conf txns "securely". Well, they're practically as secure as they've always been, but even if they're not because you may have a txn sitting in the mempool longer, that's YOUR responsibility and not the responsibility of the network. The technology does NOT allow for secure 0conf txns, it never has and never will. That is what third party layers like Lightning Network are for. This is a purposeful and efficient design philosophy, and since Roger Ver is not a software developer and has no idea how software development works, he does not get it -- not even slightly.
@_date: 2017-02-21 02:18:25

No one gives a shit about Bitcoin Unlimited, it's all just sockpuppet nonsense. It's a massive bluff by a single rich Chinese miner trying to influence Core. The people throwing hash power at BU are well aware that if it was actually successful then the two chain split would reduce the value of their investment significantly. Much more significantly than any potential gains they can make by a blocksize increase. The bluff will ultimately fail anyway. Let him waste his money.
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:43:16




Okay, and I don't disagree with you here at all. It's not possible to know what will happen in the event of a 50/50 hardfork. 


Sure, but what is the alternative? There has to be SOME sort of direction covering this event. You can't just leave it out all together, and I think this is the only logical approach. Do you have a better suggestion?


Developers should have nothing to do with the ETF, that's a conflict of interest. 


These issues are never going anywhere, it is the nature of Bitcoin and its governance model unfortunately. Decentralization has its pros and it has its cons.

@_date: 2017-02-09 10:24:31


They already are and will be doing this.


They will, however there is clear greater majority within the technical community in favor of one direction over another. It's kind of like how the majority of scientists believe climate change to be real. Sure there are some scientists with PhDs who claim it is not real (and a lot of them are funded by the oil industry), however they are the minority. The SEC will side with whoever has the most support, and they will weigh that based on the perceived technical influence of the individual.
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:35:12
It is you who does not understand the issues. You're conflating technical consensus with an ETF ruling that only requires clearly defined rules in the event of a hard fork. It has literally zero to do with the consensus process and everything to do with the after effects. Like I said, you're very confused.

"Them"? You mean "it"? The Big Bang **theory**? It's not fact, hence it being called a theory, you moron. I think it's probably a misguided theory to be frank, but still, it's a theory.


Why are you so strung up on the Big Bang theory when I didn't even mention it once? I'm willing to bet you have an elementary understanding of it, anyway.


Wrong again, I'm not an atheist.

The clause is not highly controversial at all, it's common sense. The consensus bickering itself is controversial, but it has nothing to do with the ETF. The SEC doesn't need to give a shit about community consensus, it just needs the rules for the ETF to be clearly defined, and they are. You're very confused.

Yes, there is zero proof Tether is backed by any reserve, and they refuse to be audited and have purposefully distanced themselves as far away from the US as humanly possible to avoid prosecution. It's crystal clear that it's a massive fraud, but don't expect anyone in here to admit to it because of "price up, good!" mentality. the r/bitcoinmarkets subreddit will at least be honest about the subject, if you care to look into it further.
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:26:30
There are actually altcoins out there with promise though:
* ETH (which MAY be threatened when RootStock is released though)
* SiaCoin (more of a technology, but it has a coin backing it. Decentralized storage has huge potential to be a game changer)
* Decred (solves the governance problems we're currently facing in Bitcoin)
* Monero (interesting privacy implications, COULD have a big future in the darknet markets, but probably won't ever hit mainstream)
A few of the up and comer scams to watch out for:
* PIVX (has little to offer and the developers appear incompetent -- this is going to burn a lot of people)
* DASH (massive premine and early manipulation, although it has interesting innovations, so I use the term scam loosely)
* NEM (A different consensus algorithm is not enough to make a coin, it needs more than that)
* MaidSafe (It doesn't take 20 years to make a coin, you're getting no where)
* Lisk (Javascript is a garbage language, why would be trade Solidity, Ethereum's untyped language for another untyped garbage language)
* Ark (Pump and dump buzzword salad coin, look at their whitepaper for a good laugh)
The list goes on. There are only a handful of interesting and viable coins out there, the majority of them are scams, lack innovation, have terrible teams or hold no promise.
By the way, I'd also add that if it weren't for Steem's terrible inflation rate it would probably be worth a decent penny right now. The system has gaping holes, and I'm not sure the developers have any interest in fixing them. It had promise, and could still be recoverable if the devs put in the work to fix the system.
Shout out to golem, it has an interesting concept behind it but I'm just not sure it will be possible to pull off in a way that is more cost effective than the centralized system we already use for supercomputing. If I'm wrong about this then it will be worth a lot, if I'm right then it'll be worth nothing.

This is not the case. Jihan is not earning all block rewards through his pool, he only receives a small % of it based on his contributing hash power (which in reality is probably quite low). He does however receive ALL fees, because he owns the pool himself and it's a business model. He has a lot more to gain by fees than he does block reward. There is of course a threshold where if it drops far enough then he will start to lose out overall, but we haven't got there yet. I remember reading some posts from others who crunched the numbers and from memory it was somewhere around $500. You also need to factor in his ability to leverage short the market.

Most Bitcoin users get their Bitcoin news from somewhere, and there's not a single media company that I'm aware of that isn't publishing negative news about this whole debacle. I've had family members contact me and ask me if I'm selling all my Bitcoin because they've read about what's happening in MSM, and I've had friends who also hold that don't use Reddit share the same sentiment because they read Bitcoin news websites. It's not just Reddit I'm afraid, although Reddit is definitely the worst culprit for the negativity and toxicity. It's probably where most of it (maybe even all of it) originated.

It wouldn't be ironic at all, that case is also covered by the amendment... 


Why wouldn't they be down with it? As long as it is clearly defined and investors understand the repercussions then they're free to make that ruling if they so please. You're acting as if the SEC is concerned with fairness or profitability. It is not. It is concerned with clearly defined rules, regulations, laws, and order. If you lose all of your money that is not the SECs problem so long as they are legally covered by the well defined rules of the ETF.

This. Bitcoin is digital gold due to its size and first-mover advantage, and nothing is going to fill that role like Bitcoin. Even if the fees are sky high and transactions are slow, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. Digital gold does not need to have low fees, and it does not need to be blazing fast. I hope this isn't the case, but if it was it would not mean the death of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is here to stay. The only thing that COULD destroy Bitcoin would be a BU hardfork.

He wouldn't though. You need to consider that he earns ALL fees from his pool, but he only earns a small fraction of the block reward because he does not control all the hash power through his own mining equipment. There's a threshold of course, but BTC would need to see above $5000 to offset it (as a rough figure). It's more rational to rake in fees (something you can control) than to pray for a Bitcoin bubble (something you can't control). Long term of course, he has more to gain by Bitcoin scaling, but this isn't going to be happening forever. He's aware of that.


Bitcoin is still going to remain the number one crypto, but scaling tied to individual incentives is a different subject.

So if a miner does hit this node rejection, is it safe to presume the nodes will compete to redistribute the block themselves as a segwit actived block? Or will that invalidate the block, and it will need to be re-mined?

Can we make it official policy to move all scaling discussion elsewhere? It'd really reduce the astroturfing, spam and bickering on this subreddit. All the bickering is making Bitcoin look a lot more divisive than it really is which is a bad look to newcomers, investors and the media, but in reality it's only a handful of very loud people causing all of the drama.
Also, to clarify, when I say scaling discussion I don't mean posts like "SegWit release date announced" (that's not scaling discussion, it's a feature announcement), I mean posts like: "What is this BU vs Bitcoin thing?", "What is the blocksize debate?", "Why are there two rivalling subs?", "do you think we need to increase the blocksize?", "this vs this", etc.

Do you speak for the SEC now? How do you know what they'd rather. You're typing as if you're apart of the SEC decision making process but in reality you're just some random guy guessing based on your own biased feelings...
Bitcoin is ALWAYS going to have controversy in the pipes, it is the nature of the system due its governance model.

Define "main". If by main you mean most likely, then no. If by "main" you mean most popular, then yes. Popularity however is not a measurement of worth. The flat Earth model was once the most popular. Again, it's a theory, not fact.


There's no such thing as a science "believer". Again, you don't understand what science is. A Christian who doesn't understand what science is? What a surprise!


Who cares what the mainstream hivemind promotes? Since when does being mainstream give something more credibility? Christianity is mainstream, and it's one of the most irrational belief systems a person can have. 


Logic, rationality, verifiability, reproducability. Do I personally verify the proofs? No. Can I? Yes. Do hundreds of thousands of scientists across the world verify them in controlled settings? Yes. The ability to be able to is what is important. I can't verify anything a religion has spouted, that is the definition of unverifiable. That is why mathematics has proofs and religion has faith. Can you verify your skydaddy? Or do you just so desperately want there to be more to life that you're willing to *believeeee*?

One of the most admirable things about the core devs is their unwavering dedication to upholding their moral code. They can see the big picture, and they make decisions with the ethos of decentralisation and security above all else. They have been targeted by bribers, government officials and special interests to either sabotage or exploit Bitcoin, and despite the potential millions of dollars worth of gain, they still do what is right. Very few people on this Earth can say that they would not abuse their power when faced with the potential of millions of dollars in the pocket, especially when you consider what a thankless job it is.

Honestly, this is one of my biggest gripes. I can't look past "risk" whenever I see RSK, and I'm surprised the creators didn't see this for how obvious it was. Why not just RS? There's no reason you HAVE to do 3 letters, just because Ethereum and Bitcoin do it isn't a valid reason... RS makes a lot more sense anyway. Even RST makes more sense. It's a terribly dumb marketing move for them to stick with RSK, ESPECIALLY considering how jumpy cryptocurrency users are and the fact that the platform relies on handling finances and investments. It's kind of incredible.

They don't need to have written the segwit code to be contributing to Bitcoin. That's a fallacy. 


Who cares. You can make the same argument about BU. They're all under Roger's thumb.


Name them, are you talking about people who are no longer Core members? Then you can't call them Core. I can only think of two by the way. 


Then you have nothing to back up your false claim.


Wrong. A soft fork is better than a hard fork for many reasons. The overal direction of governance is one that prioritizes decentralization, that is exactly what is required.


That's the entire problem, it cannot be done without sacrificing decentralization.

Your problem is and always has been marketing. It's not going to market itself, you need to spend some of your dev budget on it. It's the only reason SiaCoin is still so underpriced and has such a low market cap, even though it's been around so long. It's a bit unfortunate, because coins like PIVX get 40mil in vol when they're just a fork of DASH with shitty P&amp;D developers. You need to take a page out of their books and replicate some of their marketing tactics. I'm not saying go full marketing, but SOME needs to be done, otherwise SC investors, users and supporters are going to get tired of waiting and leave the project. It's unfortunate that it is that way, because I know how much amazing work you're pumping into this project, but that's the way the cookie crumbles I guess.

We're not talking about SegWit contributors, we're talking about Bitcoin contributors.


His views on the topic were clear 8 years ago. You have no idea what his views on the topic would be today. 


Hard forks are dangerous, look at Ethereum for a good example of why. They have the ability to create contention, they have the ability to be politically and technically attacked by state actors or special interests. There is no reason to risk having two competing chains, if it happens then Bitcoin is as good as dead and won't be trusted again. Hard forks should be reserved for VERY critical and important upgrades with no possible alternatives. They should be a last resort.


SegWit offers other improvements to the network, one important one being the move from quadratic to linear sighashing. This prevents an attack vector that would be present for a 2mb hardfork, and is a big reason why even if a 2mb hard fork is to happen SegWit should be activated first. So no, I don't think you can say "without all the complications", because if anything a plain hardfork will have more complications.


Decentralization has its limits, there is always going to be a pyramid structure of power because some people need to hold the keys to the castle, namely the Github repo access in this case. However they are still confined by the expectations of the public. BU is even more centralized in that manner because it has less developers and is politically manipulated by Roger Ver and his lackies.


If you want to be realistic, look at the numbers. The number of nodes relative to the number of new Bitcoin users is actually declining over time, not increasing. The data does not support the assertion that a bigger blocksize or more users would result in more nodes, it supports the opposite assertion. As time progresses, SPV clients will increase in adoption further reducing the number of full nodes. Also, Moore's Law is in all practical terms dead, so we cannot assume a steady increase in consumer technology to compensate for this either.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:58:00
The appeal of Bitcoin is that it is not under the control of any individual. Once that is gone, it is no longer appealing. Controlling a worthless asset is not appealing. Comparing the fiat system to Bitcoin to draw conclusions is laughable. Milking and manipulating is the only real avenue of control the Bitcoin network will allow for it to retain value.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:23:25


RootStock is built on Bitcoin, it already has first mover advantage. Bitcoin is the biggest network by far, so if it had smart contracts you can bet they'll get used over Ethereum's smart contracts, unless Ethereum manages to catch up in market share in the mean time, which is highly unlikely.

You clearly have no idea how SC works if you think the coin components only purpose is being a "scammy appcoin", it has far different properties to Bitcoin so that it is particularly suited to its use case, and a blockchain that was written entirely for its use case. Bitcoin was assessed as a possibility, but refuted for many solid technical reasons (of which can be found on the blogs and forum).


Software dev requires money. A premine (within reason) is not a valid reason to hate a coin, they've already proven they're putting the money to good use. If it was a pump &amp; dump, sure, hate the premine, but it's clearly not that. Innovation costs time and money.




They are entitled to a founders share, again, software dev requires money, and they also crowd source -- the founders share (which can't be called a founders share because it's not only for founders) was a design decision made to incentivize a decentralised development process.
If you think the Core devs work on Bitcoin purely out of the kindness of their hearts then you are sorely mistaken.

One of the many reasons SiaCoin is better than Storj, they have their own highly optimized blockchain. It's also been flying under the radar for a while now because the creators aren't marketing whores like all of the other altcoins (PIVX I'm looking at you), so it's still nice and cheap. (the founder) is actually well known around here.
Anyway, this is bullish news for Storj competitors and for Ethereum, but quite bad news for Storj.

Ah, so it uses a consistent file format. That makes sense actually, because the only way around it that I can think of would be to encrypt the contents of your wallet with your key, but the client doesn't actually ask for your key until it sends a transaction and it can still see all of the transaction history etc before that point.

This is true, although old-money is not too interested in straying from their tradition of buying gold as their store of value. Bitcoin is the store of value for the new generation, the technologically savvy generation who is comfortable with handling it. We'll get the old institutional investors eventually, but first we'll need to reach more market saturation in the younger generations. These older investors are complacent with their traditional investment vehicles, they've been investing in gold all their lives, but most of the newer generation hasn't even touched gold before, so they have no complacency and old habits to kill. I don't think an ETF is a requirement, it would sure help but we'll get there eventually regardless, it'll just take longer.

Says who? I think that's a fallacy. Ethereum has problems, solidity is a bad and insecure language. Maybe if Ethereum had no problems then what you're saying would be the case, but since it does, if RootStock is implemented effectively then it will easily overtake Ethereum in market share within a couple of years. I understand what you're saying, and I do agree to an extent, but that only applies to people who are already programming on the Ethereum platform.

It's something I've considered. If I do decide to sell, I won't sell everything. Probably half, and try and hedge it elsewhere until all of this blows over. It's a double edged sword though, if BTU survives and is worth a decent amount then you get to make a bit of money through the doubling but Bitcoin is a failed experiment as far as I'm concerned. If everyone sells their coins as soon as the markets go live (as I'd hope they do), then you won't get much value out of the doubling, but at least Bitcoin is back on track. In either case though, getting to the hard fork point is a bad look for Bitcoin in general.

So, brief explanation of the code snippet: if a miner mines a block and does not signal SegWit on that block when distributing it to the nodes, then the nodes running this version of Bitcoin Core will reject it. In other words this is user activated soft fork code. The interesting part to me is that this is only for that time window (between Oct 1st 2017 and Nov 15th 2017 inclusive). What happens after Nov 15th? The enforcement then disappears again? So how do the developers ensure SegWit sticks? What's to stop miners from reverting back to no SegWit after this time frame?
By the way, I think this should actually get activated sooner than that. At the moment, the miners are just playing delay tactics. They lose money to fees if they get BU (and probably lose their investment since BU will kill Bitcoin), and they lose money to fees if they get SegWit. The longer they drag this out, the more money they make in the mean time. Let's move their hand faster. As soon as a UASF is SERIOUSLY on the table, the miners will cave. They have no choice. Otherwise, this is going to drag on literally forever.

Look, if you don't believe me all you have to do is try and withdraw your funds. If it's not a scam then you'll get your funds, and you can reinvest them. But you won't get your funds, because you'll never see them again. I can promise you that. There's not a single chance in hell you will EVER be able to withdraw. THAT'S why it's a scam. Just because you see a number on their website go up doesn't mean your investment is going up, in reality your investment is 0 because you'll never see your money again. Try and withdraw, I DARE you.

Yeah, that applies to regular miners for sure. Unfortunately Jihan is the one causing all the problems though, and he makes most of his bank from fees now. He's only getting a small % of the block reward through his pool because he doesn't have the total 17% of hashing power to himself, but he gets 17% of the fees. So yeah, like you said, what a racket.
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:53:22
I'm not surprised Bram likes the idea of a PoW change, considering that he could put mining software all over the world into one giant botnet through his P2P torrent software. I think a PoW change might be a good idea if miners are forcing our hands, but keep in mind people like Bram probably have ulterior motives.

I'm just sick of weathering the storm. I've seen them all coming, and stuck by the "it's okay, it'll be back soon enough", which is true, but it takes a longgg time. For those who didn't sell, we've been waiting patiently for 2 years to get back to the ATH. It's finally here and now this happens. Who wants another 2 years of this? It's tough to stay strong when it's a lot more effective to just sell and buy in at the bottom.

Hahaha, chump change? Oh the naivety. Someone like Jihan can make close to $100,000 a day in fees. Miners are not morons, they aren't going to hand control over to a bunch of completely inept developers who will destroy Bitcoin AND reduce their fees to practically nothing. Every single day that Bitcoin doesn't activate SegWit is another 100k in the pocket for Jihan.  That's 3.1mil USD for a month of delay. Like I said, this is purely a delay tactic. They don't care who controls Bitcoin as long as it maintains its current trajectory and they make profit.

Here's a thought, educate yourself before being a spokesperson for the laws surrounding crypto. Thank you. BTW, the end bit of "I think you think the blockchain is a database or message passing system" was supposed to be a counter-troll I preusme? Because the blockchain basically *is* a database, a decentralized distributed one, and a message passing system would meet the description as well if you consider the fact that nodes are broadcasting and propogating transactions and the blockchain across the network, messages can be attached to transactions, and transactions are basically messages themselves in rudimentary terms. Albeit both are vague descriptions and they do not elaborate on the differences separating the traditional from the blockchain like the fact that it is immutable and permanently validatable because it is a merkle tree structure, but the blockchain definitely does fit those definitions. Was that their attempt to have her say "no, I don't think it's those things"?

Most people here won't tell you this, because they don't want Bitcoin to drop in value. But the truth is: You should probably sell unless you're EXTREMELY confident in Bitcoin. It's in very uncertain terms at the moment, and losing a few dollars is better than losing your entire investment. And yes, the bubble is over because it never began... People were dreaming of a bubble, but it hasn't happened. It's been over 2 years since the bubble.

If there are two conflicting ideas, only one person can have ultimate decision making power. One person has to cave. There is no false dilemma here, there is no third option. Either he keeps the coins despite his wife's wishes, or he caves and lets his wife decide his own asset management for him. Like I said, this is all rather obvious.

It's been called overly complex by many trolls. Nobody worth listening to has called it overly complex. No reputable or unbiased source has called it overly complex, only people with agendas, trolls, or idiots. That is why no one is taking your silly argument seriously, because it's flat out nonsense. If you think SegWit is too complex to be rolled out then you're basically asking that Bitcoin code never be changed again. That's just a completely idiotic concept to begin with. The difference between this change and the DAO is the amount of effort and testing that is gone into and is going into validating that the code will perform as expected.

rofl. Why do people post such dumb nonsense? The previous so called "shoulder" is at around 650, so why the hell are you drawing a trendline at $750?... Embarrassing. Do these idiots really think they'll influence the price on Reddit by posting garbage like this to cause a drop so they can cash out a short? Get real. The halving is in one month, there is zero reason for a drop to $400. Learn how Bitcoin behaves and you might actually make some money. Btw we already broke 740, your prediction was a failure within minutes, well done.

Uh... Console errors mean absolutely nothing.
Firstly, if you're getting console errors chances are they're either missing resources (like images not being found), or some mild javascript errors. In the case of javascript errors, nearly all of these will be benign and not affect the functionality of the site, and for the ones that do generally these are never a problem either because the likelihood is that it's a client-side app, and the security weak points will always be with the API back-end.
Further to the above, quite often you can just not log anything to the console, so the conclusion that all sites without console errors do not have errors is just absurd.
"Console errors" is not a useful metric at all, and it's quite hilarious that it's in there. Makes me question the integrity of the entire report.  
As for the rest of the report requirements, a lot of these are very use-case specific. Not all websites need all of those things, and they may be covered by other processes or not required at all because of the way the website is built. This report makes a whole heap of unfounded assumptions, and it almost reads like an advertisement for Coinbase.

7 month old post is no longer relevant on the "there's no reason" for this front. The reason is the halving, obviously. 
Secondly, the "don't tell your friends to get in", "don't tell your family to get in" is just bad advice. How do you think the price rises if nobody tells anybody about Bitcoin? Better advice would be "don't tell them to get in too late". Right now is a fine time, this has only just begun.

That doesn't prove a thing:
Source: 
Antonius Aquinas is an author, lecturer, a contributor to SGT Report, The Burning Platform,  Acting Man, and **Zero Hedge**.
So, some guy who has a blog-style website shared his "article" on two websites.
If you want a credible source, look at the actual Vatican report referred to on this guys blog: 
Also note that this is from 2011... So, not exactly "news", is it? And I don't see those quotes attributed to Pope Francis either, so not sure why he's being mentioned specifically. In fact if you ctrl+f the document "Francis" or "Bergoglio" isn't even mentioned once.
So, a blogger falsely attributes some 5+ year old quotes from a group of people in an organization to an individual who wasn't even part of that group, and then these shitty websites pick it up as "news", lo and behold. Awesome.

I mean, anyone who thought Ethereum was going to overtake Bitcoin as a store of value and currency is and was absolutely deluded. That was very obvious from the start.

Ethereum is going to face MAMMOTH scaling hurdles, bigger hurdles than Bitcoin has faced. At least we have proof now though.

That's becasuse there isn't one. It's just a meme propogated by blocksize trolls. SegWit is fine, it is nothing compared to some of the future changes that will happen.

1. Linking religious claptrap that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
2. Linking to fake news website.
3. Linking to article with 0 references. 
4. Using said fake article on fake news website to express a religious opinion:


Luke, we don't give a shit about your religious beliefs, keep them to yourself. This is not r\Christianity or r\Catholicism. All I can say is that we're lucky you're not solely responsible for any technical or social decisions to do with Bitcoin, if you can't see the obvious boundary that should be drawn between the two.
Just an example of the other nonsense on that website: 
There's page and pages of it. The fact that a Bitcoin prominent "Core developer" doesn't even have the sense to realise this is a garbage source is saying a lot. His bible thumping is one thing, but this is something else entirely.

Not really. The majority of Bitcoin holders are wealthy, a USD crash will not affect the upper middle class as much as it will the poor. Historically during fiat currency problems we've seen gold used substantially. This time it will be Bitcoin since it is far more convenient and can be used to actually replace the failing fiat system due to its ability to be used in ecommerce which is a SIGNIFICANT portion of current commerce. I've owned and held both, but I no longer hold any gold because it's simply inconvenient and Bitcoin will outperform it majorly. The ONLY threat would be if the internet goes down, but that's extremely unlikely and if it did happen then gold and Bitcoin would be the least of anyones concerns, we'd be dealing with an extinction level event.

I agree, I personally think that's what Ethereum will do, but given what I've read from Vitalik it looks like he's in favor of the "benevolent dictator hard fork" approach. I think it's a horrible decision. The DAO investors knew what they were getting themselves in to, they knew it was a risky venture. Not all investments pay off. Time for them to take some responsibility here. The future of Ethereum is at stake here, and it has far reaching consequences for all of the crypto scene. There's more on the line than the DAO funds here.

I want to get the Bitcoin Cash coins out of my Bitcoin Core wallet. From what I've read, all I need to do is install the Bitcoin ABC client, load up my Core wallet, and then I can send the coins wherever. The problem is that I don't particularly trust the Bitcoin ABC client, how do we know it hasn't got some clever backdoor in it to send our private keys somewhere? I get that it's open source, but backdoors can be obfuscated. Is there another client that can import my Bitcoin Core wallet to get the Bitcoin Cash out, that is better known and trusted?

Why are some people giving genesis mining shit? I don't see you promoting Bitcoin in public you little ungrateful pieces of shit. Part of the reason it took so long to get to this price is the complacency in this community. The majority of you just sit on your asses and cross your fingers hoping to get rich. Actually contribute to the ecosystem or stfu.

The point is that you're just talking out of your anus.
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:37:26
1. Because the price has already bottomed.
2. Because the sharp dive we already took was insiders aware of this coming up.

I think a close second is the "I'm not confused about garbage like this because I choose not to pick it up". Firstly how does he know it's garbage if he refuses to bother to learn about it, and secondly that's a great translation of "Everything I don't understand sucks".

I stand by my statement, you don't know how markets work. I saw this dip coming from a mile away, we'll be back over ATH within a month or two. This 25-30% retrace happens for every bubble. I'll be sure to remind you again that you don't understand how markets work when that happens. Also, back up your shit with a link to my comment, you little bitch.

@_date: 2017-08-03 07:01:41
Thanks. I'll xfer my coins to a new wallet, then I guess it doesnt matter if I import my priv key to a dodgy client since the coins have moved to a different private key on the real Bitcoin chain. I'll also use a VM to install the client so it can't steal my new real wallet.

You mean like 99% of Catholics who hold a position of power? 
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:05:21
It does involve moving them around, but only very minimally. Moving them around once is enough, in fact, if using a mixing service, because the trail is instantly cut. So you get maybe twice as many mixed transactions as you do regular, hardly a burden.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:04:47
Yep. We need more services and businesses.
@_date: 2016-11-03 09:33:03


I would be. That isn't going to happen. People keep going on about how Bitcoin is risky/riskier than traditional investments, but I think that's more of a meme than anything. Bitcoin is solid technology, it is not going anywhere, the risk is minimal as far as I'm concerned. Hell, I'd say the risk is much higher investing in many traditional businesses.
@_date: 2016-11-05 03:26:00

@_date: 2016-12-14 12:12:45
Yeah, I imagine this will have a very positive affect on the Bitcoin price. It also makes selling Bitcoin a bit more tricky (because now you can't sell for large sums of cash easily and avoid paying the tax on that), which is likely to keep people holding.

Woah, what a revelation. Thank you Galileo. It couldn't possibly be that more money is in the crypto eco-system as a whole, so therefore Bitcoin is a lower majority than it used to be because funds are dispersed and diluted. Nah, not a chance. Bitcoin is clearly just dying.

Great question. You're spot on. Downvoting these garbage threads is all we can do. I think the big blockers are acting like "Ver is important" to pretend like they have an argument, because if they're united behind some "important figure" they feel their cause is stronger. Ver sees his small collection of shills idolizing him and lets the power get to his head, but doesn't even realize these people are just trying to sabotage Bitcoin and don't actually admire him but are using him as a pawn because he is not the brightest and is unwittingly playing their hand for them. At the end of the day it's just a small group of special interests trying to sabotage Bitcoin and manipulate a clueless pawn to do their dirty work for them.

I think the amount of overlap something like Siacoin has against something like Bitcoin is laughable, to give you an example. A blockchain is nothing special, all it is is a chain of blocks. It's probably the least interesting part of all of these start ups. You can't just presume they're all closely related because they use a block chain.

This isn't a good thing, as we have already learned the hard way by the almost daily exploits and weekly hard forks that Ethereum is being hit with. The sidechain model is perfect for this, it allows for a separation of concerns so any security threats do not sabotage Bitcoin's own security.
The rest of your sentence is just buzzwords for smart-contracts. RootStock is nearing completion, so it won't even matter very shortly. I'd also add that Ethereum has not yet proven there is even a solid use case for smart contracts.
@_date: 2016-12-03 11:15:47
Notice how he didn't reply to you? Yeah, probably a \r\btc troll.

I'd say the communities are on equal footing, after all they share most of the same members, but you're right about there being a clear leader, yes.


But as we've seen this may not necessarily be a good thing if the leader does not listen to the community. There were a lot of people against the DAO hard fork, and if Vitalik went that route instead it may have avoided the whole ETHC versus ETH nonsense to begin with.  


Most of the community is united, there is only a small fraction of trolls trying to act like their side is well represented when in reality it is not. If Ethereum's community was as large as Bitcoin's do not think for a second the same thing would not happen over there. It already did happen during the DAO debacle, just on a smaller scale. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 12:28:22

This is the job of Bitcoin contributors (primarily core, but others are welcome as well). If they aren't going to speak against this obvious BS then Bitcoin stands no chance. There are a very few number of people educated enough on the topic to leave a meaningful comment. It's easy to waffle your way around making Bitcoin sound bad because you can just make up any amount of BS you like, but refuting BS is a lot harder.

@_date: 2016-12-05 14:09:04
I'm a software dev, I made plenty of malicious software in my youth (including large botnets, remote access trojans, keyloggers and so forth). You can blame your own inexperience for your lack of understanding. An infected machine will poll for bitcoin wallet files on a short interval, and as soon as it sees one it will buffer it in memory (or write it to disk as a copy) and send it over the wire as soon as an internet connection is made.

No. Only Bitcoin Uncensored hosts (like junseth) are doing that, and other Bitcoin maximalists. But there is only a small group of them. Most Bitcoin users are happy to see things like this developed. Stop blanket shoving everyone into the same group.
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:54:26
Yeah, this could be done by monitoring on the router level. I'm sure it's been done plenty, and if they were actually stealing data their heads would be on the chopping blocks. At the end of the day, it's a trust game, and a "if you do this you'll go to prison" game because they WOULD be caught.
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:14:42


For sure, I don't disagree. If you have a specific target in mind then there are far easier strategies. This firmware would really only be for a very global and massive attack, but it would need to be well orchestrated and it would need to happen with precision to drain as many wallets as possible without interception. It would also be a massive scandal because someone will figure it out, especially now that people are already suspicious of this firmware.
If you 0-day the router you'd still need to 0-day the machines on the network as well. I'm sure there are a ton out there though, that the top researchers are aware of or manufacturers and rogue employees have put in place as back doors. There's already a massive blackmarket for 0-day exploits and they can go for hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars a pop. All of this shit is pretty scary to me. I think one of the big problems is that people tend to store such large amounts in a single wallet. If people had different wallet files for each thousand dollars or so that they own, and kept them all in cold storage and only touched them when they ran out of money on their other wallets, it'd be far less worrisome. But it also makes it annoying to bulk-purchase things with this strategy (like say you wanted to buy a new car, you then have to unload 20 different wallets).
Maybe this is something some intelligent wallet software could take care of. You send your coins in, it splits up your coins into many different addresses across many different wallet files (you specify how much BTC per wallet file), and the software also has the ability to bulk load wallet files as well if you need to pay for something that is expensive.
I know people who have 500+ coins in single wallet files. They handle their cold storage properly, and the only have their wallet files on disk when doing transactions then delete them once they're done so it isn't sitting there idly on the system, but it's still a single attack vector so it's still pretty scary. Hopefully as the ecosystem matures more solutions for security are developed, I think it's definitely one of the main challenges Bitcoin faces. If nobody feels safe then nobody is going to put substantial amounts of money into it.

Not even remotely comparable. Anyone can do that, but not anyone can modify the source code of Bitcoin like the BU clowns are doing. Also, core "developer" not core "developers", you idiot.

No thanks. These are never going to be consumer level, and even if they did become consumer level in a few years time it's already too late. Solutions for this problem need to exist now, not in 4+ years. Besides, if Intel or anyone else actually tried to do this they would be caught. SOMEONE would see the data leaving their router and then Intel would be liable for a lawsuit on a grand scale never seen before. Basically, [what codear said]( That being said, we need affordable solutions. I don't trust the Trezors, I don't trust their software primarily. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:31:29


Yes. I really doubt they'd give a fuck. Unlike you, investors aren't going to lump every single Bitcoin user into the same category based off a single persons Reddit thread?

@_date: 2016-12-05 14:28:57


Only if its a password protected wallet, otherwise it's as simple as dumping the wallet file. I'm sure they could still make quite a lot of money from targeting non-password protected newbies. 
In either case, if targeting known memory offsets was not an option for whatever reason they could try other tactics like logging keys. It really depends how low level the ME firmware is and what sort of high-level access it has to the OS. If it could interface with WinAPI it would be extremely easy to come up with attack vectors for obtaining the decryption password, like hooking the password window using SetWindowsHookEx or something similar. I'm not sure what safety measures the Core software has in place for this sort of thing, if any.
You wouldn't target every operating system and every wallet, you'd target the popular ones. Probably Windows and Bitcoin Core software would be the best bet. All it takes is for one (or a small group) of clever rogue Intel employee(s) and the jig is up. Steal half a billion dollars in coins and hiding would not be difficult. I don't think it's an "if" this happens, I think it's only a matter of time. Especially if the market cap of Bitcoin keeps rising. It's going to be the most hacker/thief targeted financial network on the face of the planet.

@_date: 2016-12-10 23:57:26
There are no problems with this.






How many people use gold as a currency? Yet it still retains all of its value and in fact gets more valuable. 
Only people who lack an understanding of the most very basic of economics do not understand this obvious fact. That's why if you look at the usernames of the people who actually think this is a bad thing you'll see that it's the same group of people who are consistently posting dumb shit all over this subreddit. to name a couple. They quiet often have ties to as well. So either they have an agenda, or they are truly bottom of the barrel. In this case however I think, unfortunately, they're just not very smart people (to put it lightly). Oh well, not everyone can understand the simplest of simple, even when it's repeated to them on a weekly basis.

Sounds like the Brave browser model. I think it has merit. However I'm talking about single websites here. If YouTube for example was to start charging every person on their website a small fee per video they watched then not only are they severely limiting their user-base (children and 3rd world countries) but they're also creating a barrier to entry (it's annoying to sign up for payments, not everyone has a credit card, you can no longer embed videos on your website and be guaranteed people can see them, and so forth).  Also they would lose a LOT of money to payment processing. That's why the Brave model is interesting, because it gives you a fallback of advertisement if you don't want to pay, and it can work for all websites.

Sorry, you're right. You only have to open the port if you have a firewall blocking it, so it's not usually "necessary regardless" since most machines do not default to whitelist port blocking (they default to blacklist, for most linux distros where iptables is relevant i.e. Ubuntu). Windows also prompts users to add a firewall rule. In most scenarios you won't have to open a port in some special way (short of pressing allow for the Windows prompt), only port forward, but if you have strict firewall configuration then you will. :-)

You're assuming that Litecoin devs have agreed to something that they haven't. Just because Jihan wants it doesn't mean it'll happen.

@_date: 2017-04-06 12:05:31
Doing some analysis on their mined blocks we should be able to determine Jihan's personal hash-rate versus what is other people mining on his pool. I hope someone can figure this out :-)

The dip has nothing to do with F2pool, f2pool doesn't mean jack shit to Bitcoin. It's already obvious that we have to UASF, and it has been for months, no one cares what he has to say. Litecoin is a different story, f2pool has 40% share on there.

@_date: 2017-04-06 23:35:16


Uh, so what?


He didn't back down, he sticks by his assertion, as do Luke and Peter. He does regret speaking about him in such a cavalier manner, but that's about it. 


Nonsense, UASF was on the table long before EB came around, and it's STILL going to be the way we move forward.


I'm not insisting that at all, he owns a very small percentage of the community. They just happen to be the most vocal, because they're paid to be.


Yep, I am certainly insisting that. Their actions do not add up at all, which is why the Core devs have a problem with them. If something is illogical then there's obviously an agenda behind it. People were trying to insist that Jihan and Ver were just "really stupid", but look what happened, turns out they had hidden agendas after all. Somehow this was surprising to people. This is just another case of that.
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:47:58
Don't bother, you're responding to a shill: 
I'm having fun tagging them all.

You already tried this nonsense in another thread where I already explained to you that you're the one with the reading comprehension problems, and here you are again. Starting to wonder if you're just trolling:

@_date: 2017-04-06 03:01:56
Something something UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:01:10


So you mean like Litecoin and Bitcoin? Because that's exactly what happened in this meeting. If consensus was not reached, then Litecoin would have UASF. Anyway, I'm getting tired of replying to you and your retarded posts. You clearly have an agenda, spreading these baseless claims with zero evidence whilst Bitcoin does the EXACT same thing... It's just absurd, and no one is going to take you seriously. Post some evidence that the developers need to seek approval from some Jihan Illuminati or shut up. They are in no way forced to follow his lead, but if he cooperates it is of course easier for everyone. THAT is the position we are in. Not some oddball conspiracy you seem to believe.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:34:34
I'm not sure you know what a straw man is, because my arguments are far from that. They are objections based on barriers that will be introduced through the system you propose. Sure, you can make solutions around them, but no matter what you do, at the end of the day (UNLESS it's coming directly from the ISP, which isn't feasible) the current system we have is much simpler for users. The simplest systems usually win.
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:47:04


Who cares if it's necessary or not, the point is that this is a low-level detail that need not be exposed to the user. It's just bad UX to do so.

@_date: 2017-04-03 12:00:48
I'm really not though. How does Bitcoin solve the problem? Buying Bitcoin is much harder than using a credit card. That's just an added barrier. Bitcoin does not solve anything, it introduces more challenges. If everyone was already using it, sure, but they aren't and they won't be for a longgg time.

He said pick one, are you a fucktard or are you a shill? I'm thinking both.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:49:58
Actually, if you look at the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus meeting, the Core Devs ALSO agreed on a blocksize increase. The only difference is that they didn't keep their promise, and that is part of the reason we're in the mess we're in, because now miners have a grudge against the core devs for flipping on them and are a lot less receptive to the wishes of Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:42:05

Too dumb to realize the difference between "what happens to their own coin" and "deciding what happens to private entities mining equipment" it seems. Hint: The COIN is decentralized, the mining equipment IS NOT. You're an idiot.

We're forced into UASF territory at that point. I foresee a future where the vast majority of Bitcoin's battles are fought with UASFs.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:57:54


Again, you do realize Bitcoin Core have been fighting with Jihan in closed-door meetings for months and months? Hahaha. This is not a Litecoin problem, it's a Bitcoin AND a Litecoin problem. If you can even call it a problem.


They don't "have" to do anything, it's just easier if they cooperate. If not, a UASF happens. Again, why are you so dim? How many times do I have to repeat this?


See above. Please, just stop. You're making a fool out of yourself.

@_date: 2017-04-06 21:41:14
Hahaha, so they have a circuit design that supports it but they weren't using it? Yeah okay. They were just passing up on a 30% efficiency saving for no reason at all. Sure sure, we believe you. I guess you just went on a tweet deleting rampage for no reason after the news dropped too, huh? Keep up the great work Bitmain, you lying pieces of shit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:00:59
Sure, if you want to believe that gmaxwell is lying. I see no reason to think that though. He distanced himself from all of the other shills when he learned of their hidden agendas, and now he's distancing himself from the block extension guys for the same reason. In due time all will be revealed.

@_date: 2017-04-15 11:49:37
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:28:15
I think it's just a problem of miners having far too much leverage. There needs to be protocol changes to reduce the amount of mining centralization and distribute the power accordingly. If that is done then the problem is almost non-existent, a single person will not be able to direct the market in such an obvious fashion.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:10:00


It's also an exploit.

@_date: 2017-04-09 02:44:04


Core is reasonable. You have no argument for why they are not, other than nonsense fed to you by Ver and his sockpuppet army.
@_date: 2017-04-15 12:05:22
I understand his point, but I can't say I agree. If the alternative is years of stagnation and inflating fees then we can almost be certain other coins are going to catch up to Bitcoin in market share, and then surpass it, simply because they will have more features. Bitcoin isn't THAT much bigger than the alts to rely on first mover advantage alone. Not only that, but if the fees get big enough then we'll have a new problem on the plate, miners will start rejecting changes simply to keep the fees high.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:31:17


Why are you so opposed to a blocksize increase anyway? SegWit + blocksize increase if the blocks become full is actually the best scaling strategy that we have... The Bitcoin devs should actually take a lesson from this meeting. Not to mention that if Lightning Network is actually a success at increasing scale then it won't need to happen anyway. No harm done.
@_date: 2017-04-12 08:29:34
Actually, it has been and will continue to do so. Litecoin is up almost 50% today. Anyway, stop being salty, this is good for Bitcoin.

ASICBOOST itself is an optimisation, I don't think anyone is denying that. It is however an optimisation that Jihan had no right to. The context is what's important.
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:32:05

Right, causality. If there's no weird mind-bendy shitfuck happening and we live in an entirely causal universe then everything should be predictable given enough processing power, data input and some insane algorithm that can actually calculate the trajectories. Everything is predetermined, and we're simply observers of this unravelling of predetermination. But apparently quantum mechanics is hinting that it may not be so, due to superposition. That's about all I know, minus the "observers collapse the wave-function yadda yadda", and other bits and bobs.

Your post history says it all :-) We really need to start tagging you shills.
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:12:05
We have a cultural problem in Bitcoin and crypto in general as well. People seem to think that everything is fair game if the Bitcoin network can handle it, regardless of ill intentions. For example, people are arguing that Jihan is well within his rights to do what he did, and that regardless of it being immoral it's perfectly okay and fine because "Bitcoin couldn't handle it, and it should have", or rather, "Bitcoin should not be vulnerable to this to begin with". Which, is sort of true admittedly, it shouldn't be vulnerable to this, but that is still not the correct attitude to have. Just because Bitcoin should or could handle a specific scenario or attack, doesn't mean we should throw all of our personal morals out the window and try to purposefully be as greedy and short-sighted as we possibly can. People take the "greedy rational actor" thing way too far, simply because they hear it's a game theory reality. There should at least be some level of decency that goes with that territory though. These people will still be (and rightfully should be) judged by their immoral actions, and should still be held accountable for doing something that jeopardises the well being of Bitcoin for some short-sighted, selfish, greedy reason. Just because they're acting like a "greedy rational actor" does NOT mean that we should be perfectly okay with this sort of behaviour. If society was run like this we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are as a species right now. Bitcoin is never going to be a 100% fool-proof and impenetrable system, and so we cannot rely on it to ensure everyone behaves accordingly. It's the same for the real world too, that is why we have laws, we are not dealing with a perfect system in the real world either.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:49:39
Right. So if Lightning Network is really a scaling solution then we have nothing to worry about because 50% will never happen. If not, then clearly a scaling solution is required, and we fall back to Satoshi's vision of blocksize increase. Win win as far as I'm concerned.

The good news is the vast majority of people who matter see straight through it, it only looks like the other camp has some support because of all of the paid and unpaid shills and trolls they have. In reality these people don't even hold Bitcoin. I'd be very surprised to find someone who both holds a significant amount of Bitcoin and GENUINELY sides with Bu, Ver and Jihan. Then there's only one word for that person, and that word is: moron. All they would be doing is damage to their own investment. It would be irrational.

Sure, so he may be done 50% of the product in the event he's done zero front-end work and has finished the entirety of the back-end. You are right. Still, I think it's more likely he's not done any development because he's the type of person who would hire a team of people to develop this platform, and as such he would have front-end and back-end people working at the same time. If it was a single man making a service, then I would agree it's not an indication, but this is someone who has millions in funding. Best case scenario: 50% complete, most likely scenario: barely even started and he's at the point of receiving mocks from the designers.

Breaking the devices is the only way to ensure companies change their ways, because it hits their pockets.

Please, you aren't really that naive are you? They're saying this to save face. They were contracted by Jihan to provide an alternative to SegWit that did not stop his ASICBOOST advantage. It's all mentioned by gmaxwell in the mailing list.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:54:15

Hahahaha. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:28:21
What sort of FUD ridiculousness is this? Haha. The only reason Jihan has power over Bitcoin is because the devs refuse to roll out a UASF any time soon. Unlike BTC, the LTC devs were in the process of doing it. That's the only reason he has backed down so fast. But unfortunately, there's no threat of a UASF for Bitcoin, so Jihan has not backed down on the Bitcoin front. Maybe if the BTC devs were actually decisive and swift the whole SegWit drama could be already coming to a close by now...

You're entirely wrong. Charlie Lee isn't in control, and neither is Jihan. The community is in control. The majority is in control. Again, if he blocked SegWit, the devs were about to UASF, why is it so hard for you to wrap your head around this?

-_- You can't be serious?  It isn't in any official software yet, of course it has slim support among nodes and miners, and miners were resistant to SegWit, of course they'll be resistant to a UASF.

@_date: 2017-04-15 12:18:25
You're exactly right. I understand what Greg is saying, but I can't agree for the reasons you've laid out. I can see this working very poorly for Bitcoin.
There's also other things to consider, like:
* All other altcoins are less risk-averse, so they will have these fancy features far before Bitcoin gets them. Bitcoin's first mover advantage is not THAT big as to stop a fancy competitor coming in and stealing (or even replacing) Bitcoin's market share.
* Rising fees gives the propagandists something to whinge about, and it gives the miners another incentive to prevent larger blocks for more income.
Do nothing really does seem like the worst proposal of them all. It also says "if people hijack Bitcoin, it takes us years and years to do anything about it", that's a bad look.

Both Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd are adamant they are funded by BitMain, and the chat logs of the the block extension guys clearly show they're lying here, so it's not a conspiracy at all. If there's any conspiracy I'd say you're a shill for suggesting that "this is too far".

Glad to see that Jihan has finally agreed to stop being a cunt. Well, for Litecoin anyway. I suspect forcing Litecoin to UASF, and then everyone in the Bitcoin camp seeing how successful it was, would be bad for Jihan, so his best move really was to back down here. Seems like LTC will be getting Lightning Network before BTC after all.

I'm not sure your post conveys that message well enough, because it seems a lot of people are confused. Seems a lot of people are reading it as you just don't support a SegWit UASF at all.
In either case, can we presume you're working on a less obtrusive UASF SegWit BIP? 
I hate to say it but I think you may have undone some progress with this post. Now a lot of people are going to be spreading "I don't support UASF because I saw one of the Core devs say it was bad somewhere", without actually understanding what you're really saying.

@_date: 2017-04-03 14:50:45
I've already debunked this bad argument:
* People only pay for Netflix because there is no free alternative. If people could watch the same stuff with some advertisements at the start and not pay, they would most certainly do that instead.
* The majority of Spotify users do not pay for premium. They use the free service with ads.
* I doubt uploaded.net has millions of users. I've never even heard of it and Google says very little about it so it's obviously not too popular. In any case, there are far more people who use free fileupload services than there are people who pay for them.
I'm sure it could be done cheaper and better, but that doesn't make it an enticing model to users.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:45:18
Naww, I gave you one piece of insider info and the other one fell through, how will you ever cope? You're lucky you even got anything.

Runs in the background opening all threads in Firefox tabs as they appear on Reddit, on all of the Bitcoin related subs.

Hahaha. You've got to be kidding. There's not a chance BTC won't at least double in value due to SegWit activation. It is HEAVILY suppressed right now and it STILL manages to maintain its value somehow. That's extremely bullish.

Wrong. The miners voted. You know, the ones with the hash power. The ones who are the ONLY ones capable of signalling through their OWN hash power...

That's a very short-sighted perspective. It is much more than that. If you truly believe Bitcoin is nothing more than a pyramid scheme then perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree?

Haha, okay, so your argument is that both Peter Todd and GMaxwell are lying, and that you think it's just a coincidence that extension blocks does exactly what SegWit does without stopping ASICBOOST, and that the fact it doesn't stop ASICBOOST has nothing to do with it, and the fact that the EB devs basically admitted in chat that there's no reason other than political ones to activate EB, and that there's a specific proposal that outlines why EB has to be done instead of SegWit. Yeah okay, your logic skills are outstanding dude, keep it up. You're a real beacon of rationality. 
Do you know what else is strange? About 99% of your posts are related to EB. I'm almost inclined to think you have something to do with the project. Who spends all day painting EB in a positive light unless they have an agenda? Your posts reek of thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

Your clarification isn't needed, I understand exactly what you're saying, the problem is that this can't be fixed. This is the result of PoW. Bitcoin Core will NEVER change it's consensus algorithms. Bitcoin is never going to change to PoS. If you don't like it, you can support hybrid coins like Decred that alleviate this problem. That is their mission statement.

Bahahaha, uh, the only person here with comprehension issues is you. He's clearly stating that the Bitcoin community had a problem with the Ethereum "rule change" but has no problem with the Bitcoin "rule change" to "prevent an optimization" (aka asicboost), and that it's a contradiction.

Nice website and all, but I don't think this model ever has any chance of working. People are far too lazy and self-entitled to use this sort of a payment model. Also the picture with the 5c ad should have a watermark on it saying that it's a screenshot, it looks like an actual video that can be clicked and makes it seem like your page is broken. Kudos for trying, and I do wish you luck, but I personally have no faith in this business model. I really do not see it working, ever, and I've seen a lot of startups attempt this route with no success. Blogging platforms have tried it to. It just doesn't work. The barrier-to-entry friction makes it too much hassle for what it's worth imo. People might hate ads, but they don't hate them enough to use something like this, and the ones that do just use adblock and have free content anyway.

3. He was blocking SegWit to maintain this advantage in secret, under the guise of it being related to philosophical differences.
As someone else said in another thread: "You don't hold back a 19 Billion dollar paradigm shifting technology + network back for personal gain". His behaviour is disgusting.

Awesome. So, using Bitcoin as a personal asset to me would seem to mean buying things with Bitcoin directly. If I was to convert some Bitcoin to fiat, and then immediately use that fiat to pay my rent (and the conversion is only done to facilitate that rent payment), is this considered a personal asset, do you think?

ONLY on advertised listings. Non-advertised are 0%, which is the majority. Only suckers pay for advertised listings. Localbitcoins is as close to free as humanly possible, which is why they have no competition, because you can't undercut free. It's also the reason no one would switch to another website.

They have a 1% cut on ADVERTISED listings, but most of their listings are not advertised, and those are 0%. Entirely free. They make VERY little profit, and this is why they have no competitors. Because there is no room to undercut. It's quite obvious and simple.

I will admit he is well spoken and raises an interesting perspective, but BU came out on top. Their point about a hard fork resulting in a similar split to that of ETC and ETH is terrifying to say the least, and is more than likely exactly what will happen. That would be a horrible outcome for Bitcoin. A hard fork should always be the last resort. Oh, and they're 100% correct about the rBTC community being full of retards. There's no doubting that, just go look at their drivel.

Not true, that would only be the case if there weren't alternative scaling solutions. Also you're operating under the assumption that any short term scaling is required and letting a fee market develop is not an adequate solution, but it very well may be (and from what we've seen so far, is).

I always claimed it was not profitable, I never said it was a not-for-profit (like you misread), and I never said they make very little profit (again, you can't read). Their 1% fee on ADVERTISED listings goes straight into the pockets of devs, maintenance and servers. That's not profit, that's upkeep cost. Very few listings are advertised, why would you when you can just use the 0% fee option and it makes barely any difference at all? Most suppliers (of fiat or Bitcoin) go dry quickly enough as it is, without paying fees.

You have no reason to believe that. Deluded people with large egos can think many irrational things:
As for having basic crypto and programming knowledge, so what? I doubt he has programming knowledge by the way, the things he wrote come across as written by someone pretending to have programming knowledge, not actually possessing it. Programmers do not speak like he does.
Besides, even if this only held water for an hour it still could have been plenty long enough to accomplish his goals of muddying the waters.

I think that's the key take away here, and if one isn't confident in forming their own analysis then it becomes a game of trust.

How would you verify that the cards are authentic &amp; unspent without spending them? How will you verify the amount of money on the card? How will you prevent people from spending them once they sell them to you? 
 
Am I missing something, or is this totally infeasible?

Wow, you sound so wise. Not.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:01:17
Yeah, this reeks of conspiracy. The fact that Gavin is all over this just goes to show how slimy he truly is.

No evidence has been provided. Seems the trolls have already begun to surface though, well done.

A lot can be deduced. You're just making terrible excuses that fail to pass a basic logic test. It's all about character.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:56:55
The simplest conclusion is that he's in on it.
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:36:28
Because he's not Satoshi and he's pretending to be.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:46:28
Hahaha, it was only a matter of time before people started claiming this entire thing was some rouse to discredit Gavin. Such a dumb and obviously false conspiracy theory, but whatever. You could just as easily claim Gavin was in on it, was thinking they'd get away with it, and the end goal was for Craig Wright to come out as "Satoshi" in support of big blocks. At the end of the day, this is just baseless and wild conspiracy, and more than likely completely off base.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:41:36
Like I said, Satoshi would have had his own version of a test net. The only requirements to do so would have been:
* A different value of ADDRESSVERSION field to ensure no testnet Bitcoin addresses will work on the production network
* Different protocol message header bytes (0xSOMETHING instead of 0xF9BEB4D9)
* A new genesis block

@_date: 2016-05-05 03:49:04
I was hoping he'd say "how do you trace cash?" when the CNN reporter cut him off, but he did well nevertheless, except for agreeing that Bitcoin has been used for terrorism, because we have no evidence of that, and he was too wishy washy about Craig when it is very obvious to everyone that Craig is a hoaxer. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:18:18
Odds are he's just a total idiot, not some genius mastermind conducting a global psychological experiment.
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:57:01
Seems like a bit of a cop out really. We rely on the influential people to set the record straight, these are the people the general public listen to. If they are too scared to be vocal then the fraudsters win.

Only idiots do not already know this. So, pretty much all of I'm afraid. It's funny how they've managed to make a name for themselves as Bitcoin's lowest common denominator. Well, funny and sad, I guess. Oh well, not everyone can have average-and-above levels of intelligence.

I get that, but I guess the idea is they want to prove I didn't buy those coins with drug money or something? I don't know, I don't really understand the whole "proof of source of funds" thing to begin with, seems dumb.

@_date: 2016-05-05 15:27:08
It really does not sound plausible in the slightest. Why do people entertain such obviously wrong and stupid ideas?
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:07:33
Nobody believes it. Gavin doesn't believe it either, he's either blatantly lying or his account was hacked. I'm going to go with lying though, because ever since all of the big block drama started he's been an obvious snake in the grass.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:14:54
SegWit has always been the priority, not 2mb blocks.
@_date: 2016-05-06 02:31:55
Why are you assuming he was fooled and he wasn't just in on it, thinking that the public would be fooled?
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:04:36
Dumb blog post is dumb. Fails on the very first point. If you can make an assumption within REASONABLE doubt, then you can make the claim. His argument is basically: "We cannot say thesilentwitness is not Hitler, because we don't know thesilentwitness, and maybe Hitler is actually an alien from another planet with the lifespan of 1000 years and his death was a coverup by the Illuminati."
Humans can know very little with 100% accuracy, that is not how they operate. We work within the fringes of reasonable doubt. BTW, if you want to start talking about logical fallacies and jumping to conclusions, Occam's Razor states that it is far more likely that Craig is just an idiot con artist than some mastermind misdirection magician wizard deceiving the entire world with some radical grandmaster strategy.

@_date: 2016-05-03 11:01:19
I think that was always the plan, but I wonder if they'll still go ahead with it considering the amount of rejection his claim has received. Will be interesting to see how this continues to unfold.

@_date: 2016-05-02 07:51:51
If it were true it might be, but it's not, this guy is a con-artist. His body language screams deception, his words do not add up, there is zero proof, he is not being cooperative in providing further evidence. All of this screams are very loud "phony" signal.
I think Hal was probably Satoshi, Wright knew it and since Hal has now passed away he knows he has nothing to worry about in terms of the real Satoshi coming out and disputing Wright's claim.
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:58:44
Maybe Gavin is a liar and has been for a long time?

Vitalik has stated numerous times that Ethereum is not to be used as a store of value, so this is great news for Bitcoin. People can use smart contracts whilst they wait for RootStock, and keep their coins in Bitcoin at the same time.

Ver is a big block troll. In reality, most of the BTC community is happy with the direction of core, and leaving the blocksize as is. But Ver and his legion of bots and retard-monkeys like to pretend they have a lot more influence and support than they really have. No one is really sure if his goal is to destroy Bitcoin, something to do with his own greed incentives, or if he's just stupid.

Plenty of tests would have been done on a different disposable blockchain/test net. Developers don't do test transactions on the main chain. The Bitcoin we have now has its own testnet, and Satoshi would have had one too.

No, Vitalik directly stated Ethereum should not be used as a store of value. Satoshi would never say it because that is one of the entire purposes of Bitcoin. It is not the purpose or goal of Ethereum, it never has been and it probably never will be. Vitalik has always been very clear about this.

Don't you feel bad for trying to subvert something for the people? How does that sit well with your conscience? I don't understand people like you. You only have one life, you could at least use it to help others instead of being destructive and greedy.

It's a demonstrating of the lightning network. It's an example of how far they've progressed so far. Basically, they've got it all working, now they just need to polish &amp; work on a user interface and then it'll be ready for the live Bitcoin blockchain. We'll hopefully have something by the end of the year. The Lightning Network will increase the TPS limit from 7 TPS to something larger than that of the credit card processors (45,000 TPS for Visa, to give you an example).

@_date: 2016-05-02 08:06:04

Well, there goes the hopes of new highs. First it was Hearn, now this. Whenever Bitcoin is having a good run some trolls have to come out of the wood works and attack it. It's only a matter of time before this con artist are caught, but that won't stop him tarnishing Bitcoins reputation in the mean time.

You're a fucking moron. This video is dumb as fuck, the guy doesn't even understand the Big Bang yet here he is criticizing it, and you clearly don't understand it either. This is the sort of shit 16 yr old stoners watch and think "woah, I'm so woke mannnn". "The big bang is something from nothing", no, the Big Bang started from and is an expansion of an infinitely dense singularity. Only people who have not actually educated themselves think the Big Bang came from "nothing". You won't find a single professional claiming it. Willing to bet you're about 16, I was as naive as you were at one point, it's cute.

App looks good, but the name is really bad. Sorry. You should rebrand. I don't know why I have to tell you that "lawnmower" is a horrible name for something that has nothing to do with lawn mowers or even mowing lawns.

It's simple, jealousy. These people resent Bitcoin because they missed out on getting rich quick.

Well if it is it would be horrible for Bitcoin, because this guy is a terrible Satoshi. But thankfully we have nothing to worry about because he's a con artist, or he'd provide adequate proof.

I'm angry because I'm being blunt? Okay rofl.
@_date: 2016-07-19 01:32:26
*facepalm* Alright dude, alright. If you can't tell the difference between those names and "lawnmower" then I'm afraid you're too stupid for words. I'll give you another example: "Peg" would be fine, but "Refrigerator" would not. "Box" would be fine, but "Airconditioner" would not, "Rectangle" would be fine, but "dishwasher" would not. You know there's a lot of different types of dishwashers yeah? Can I make this any more fucking clear? Yeah, they're both objects, but clearly there's a big difference. The name is retarded and you should feel bad for not realising how retarded it is. Either you're just arguing for the sake of arguing, or you truly are an idiot. /end

Why doesn't he? Because he's not Satoshi.

Or maybe he's a liar, that is the most likely scenario.

You are actually brain-dead. Your charts were not accurate at all, you're just dismissing all of your failed predictions in favor of your non-failed ones, which happen to also be the minority. That's what we call bias and delusion. Stop gambling with the money of beginners, you ultimate dick.

That's a really stupid suspicion. People with Bitcoin experience would go in for an interview and they'd have to be like "oh, nah, we're not really doing anything with Bitcoin, we just put that there to lure people into interviews"... You can't lie about that sort of thing, it does not work.

The miners are deluded, they think a Bitcoin that they own and control is one that people will want and use. Their ego clouds their judgement, they've lost their way, they're detached from reality. They're short-sighted. They are evidently not aware of the damage that is going to result from their short-sighted greed. Because of the amount of money, power and control they've attained so easily they believe they're special, that they're untouchable. When you have an ego the size of Trump it's easy to think that everything you do is and will be perfect. It's not that they think they're undermining it, it's that they think they'll be able to make more money by being in control. The reality is far from that though, the reality is that the vast majority of the network despises these cockroaches and will refuse to use JihanCoin out of spite, they're just too stupid to realize it.

Prepare to receive the response that it requires a "federation". Point is though, it's only "not trustless" because SegWit isn't activated... Once segwit is activated it will be trustless. This is just another reason out of the hundreds why SegWit needs to be activated.

You're incredibly out of touch with reality if you don't. If the improvements to the network are not blocked at every whim we'll see 10k this year. It's not unreasonable at all to consider a 10 to 100x increase from there over the span of 10 years.

Ethereum is nothing like Bitcoin, you're comparing a technology platform to a store of value. Completely different things, not even comparable. Like I stated, Bitcoin relies on its current structure to survive, if that goes away then it becomes a joke.

Yeah, I've seen it. It's tiring. ETC has done irreparable damage to Ethereum. It's going to be a stain on Ethereum for the rest of its existence. So many people have asked me "Have you heard about that Ethereum thing? What about Ethereum Classic, why don't I buy that instead? It's cheaper!"

Bitcoin's average txn value is ~3000 because it is used as an investment vehicle. A comparison to credit cards is quite useless. What I would be interested to hear is what the average transaction size is for gold sales/purchases and silver sales/purchases. These, I would suspect, would be much closer to Bitcoins.
