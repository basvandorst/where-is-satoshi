So when blocks are 8GB and you have to pay thousands of dollars per month to run a full node, and only businesses then run nodes, isn't that still "some ludicrous payment system for the rich"
And when those businesses get to decide network policy based on being the only users of full nodes, is that not utterly reflective of a plutocracy?
[According to Lazlo]( Satoshi stated quote


Which is interesting since Satoshi was almost assuredly dominating the CPU mining race at the time he wrote this. If GPUs had been delayed, who knows, maybe he'd have a 2-3,000,000 BTC fortune instead of his purported 1M.
Either way, Bitcoin was clearly never about solving poverty.

Completely agreed! Understood completely, but you know who else understands *even better than I*? Greg Maxwell, who has XX,XXX BTC to his name at minimum and who has contributed thousands of man hours to core development. Or maybe Adam Back, whom you could say similar things about. Lest we forget Bram Cohen, creator of BitTorrent. All of these authors have *strongly* condemned XT.


Yes, yes, we know. 3 tps sounds pretty bad, and it is bad. Unfortunately technology just isn't that capable today. In a few decades, technology very well could be exponentially more capable. But we just don't know that for sure until it's right in front of us. If a true clear and present existential crisis happens between now and then due to the block size, you will have full consensus from core devs to increase the block size.

You mean like Coinbase is already doing in a way that scales to billions of people?


If you knew the history of DOGE you'd know they created it after a joke on Twitter went viral. They didn't do it out of spite. Hardly. And who cares even if they *did* do it out of spite?




Oh, so Coinbase, Circle and Xapo don't count as using Bitcoin. Where did you learn that Coinbase wasn't a Bitcoin business? Is it because you can't control your own private keys, or because Coinbase doesn't work with BTC?


Oh, so you're invested in Monero. Gotta talk your own book now, totally understand.

The approach Electrum uses is extremely common. It is effectively the same approach taken by OpenBazaar, [block explorers]( and most colored coins implementations. Extracting L1 data from `bitcoind` is highly common, Electrum is just the tip of the iceberg but it clearly will not survive even 2.5MB blocks.
Projects that will suffer from larger blocks:
- Electrum
- OpenBazaar
- DarkWallet
- OpenAssets
- ANY block explorer

Just to add: the aforementioned naive bloom filtering SPV is essentially Mike Hearn's [BitcoinJ]( If you thought Blockstream was the only party with a potential conflict of interest here, you'd be incorrect seeing how much BitcoinJ stands to gain on its competition by this move. You've likely also not considered Gem.com, Chain.com, BlockCypher.com and other full-node-as-a-service companies that would just *love* it to be as hard as possible for you to run a full node so as to force you into buying their services.

1. Scaling social media sites has been done a million times. It's *really* been done. It's been done, a lot. Scaling blockchains has NEVER happened before in human history. What seems like a flawless idea currently could end up being a horrendous mistake. In the face of extreme uncertainty, minimizing resource requirements when mistakes happen makes disaster recovery easier and faster. It keeps the network agile at its core.
2. [Conformal Systems has proven the absolute *maximum* block size the network can currently handle is 320MB]( **and that's only if we all run ten clustered high performance servers each**, utterly demolishing decentralization because almost no one aside from companies have the resources and technical skills to do that. Hence 320MB undermines the entire point of having Bitcoin by destroying all but a handful of full nodes running in datacenters. The very most you could hope for at that level of destruction is 2,240 tps, which isn't NEARLY enough to handle all the world's coffees. Even if you snapped your fingers and billions of people adopted Bitcoin tomorrow, the vast majority would be trapped on Coinbase.com no matter how destructively you want to bloat the chain.
3. [Electrum server dies at 2.5MB sized blocks]( The approach it takes, of parsing L1 block data, is effectively the same approach taken by ALL block explorers and most Bitcoin 2.0 projects, all of which suffer disproportionately from larger blocks.
In summary, don't act like you can just "press a button" and all of Bitcoin magically scales.
If the black swan of the millenium happens and billions adopt Bitcoin tomorrow, most will be trapped on Coinbase no matter what you do. Contrary to popular belief, altcoins won't be able to cope with that demand either, and Bitcoin won't die if you can't send nickels for pennies.

That's funny because Excuse me? I am arguing for making the airport lines more flexible by adding a $10,000,000 VIP only line, so that you can decide yourself whether you want to wait 5 minutes to clear VIP security, 6 hours to clear the average security line, or anything in between. Or outsource that to your servants!
You need access to the airport to go places. VIP lines provide you that access. You have to pay for that. It is better to have fine-grained control over which line you wait in because it allows better adoption to market conditions. Easy as that.

Electrum server's approach, of parsing L1 block data from `bitcoind`, is extremely common. All block explorers have to parse txindex too, so you can kiss your ability to run a local block explorer goodbye when blocks get big enough. This is a good thing for companies that want to charge you money for proprietary access to a full node's transaction history index. It's also a good thing for the NSA, because they get to know which addresses are yours unless you can look up that data locally with a raw `bitcoind` skeleton, and if you could do that, why do you think block explorers *exist*?

To what?
Electrum server parses txindex, which is extremely common. ALL [block explorers]( do this. ALL Bitcoin 2.0 projects do this. OpenBazaar, pending rewrite, and DarkWallet similarly rely on federated full node servers, because it's inherently more secure and private than naive bloom filtering - you can do it over SSL for starters.
The closest you can come to Electrum with the inferior naive SPV bloom filtering approach of BitcoinJ is to run your own full node as a Tor hidden service and connect only to your own trusted node over Tor. The process is all but certain to be out of reach for most users, and is much more involved than just having a federated network of full nodes you can trustlessly connect to over SPV proxied over Tor, which is how Bitcoin should be done.
The security, privacy and uptime advantages of Electrum server, combined with the client being a longstanding success (since 2011) and simple to audit are why it's the default Bitcoin wallet on [Tails]( The only people ok with killing that model are using inferior software or are experiencing high levels of cognitive dissonance because it completely refutes their crutch argument of Bitcoin being able to magically scale at the push of a button.

Which is why the  advice around here is to keep your money in cold storage. However, if you need to move in and out of fiat currency efficiently and instantly with low trading fees, you just can't avoid regulation. No matter what the block size is, centralized exchanges will remain popular.
And I'd rather have regulated centralized exchanges than regulated full node operators, which is one step away from redlisting being forced into the protocol.

@_date: 2015-07-09 15:48:33
Parsing txindex is *heavily* IO bound work. In Electrum's case, the server builds a UTXO tree from txindex that can be served asynchronously to thin clients for on demand lookup of address histories whose private keys are *not* in the server's local `bitcoind`. Block explorers obviously have to do something similar. DarkWallet, OpenBazaar and OpenAssets too.

People aren't running nodes because there's just not enough incremental benefit at the margin. Crucially, the undisputed privacy and autonomy benefits of running a full node vs. SPV are 1. REAL, and 2. significant enough to convert SPV users over to full nodes if the cost of running a full node is sufficiently low. If instead of squandering Moore's Law, we keep the system *lean*, full nodes eventually *will* become sufficiently "free" relative to SPV to then take over as the preferred wallet for everyone. This will result in a more private, resilient, decentralized and autonomous Bitcoin network over the long run.

Tie up your savings in an account that needs your lawyer's signature and a security service's, in addition to your own signature to withdraw $10,000-$20,000 per day, valued by distributed oracles at the current market rates. No more than that could be withdrawn for X% of your fortune per day, if you're an early adopter it would mean you could under no circumstances be completely robbed. I get excited by this, so maybe it needs only your signature to withdraw up to $300, but it needs yours and Xapo's to withdraw up to $600, because let's say Xapo is intelligent and makes a native open source Bitcoin wallet that you can actually trust, and provides multisig signatory services on top of that.

I really appreciate your insight here as a sysadmin. I'm very curious for your perspective on which is worse:
1. Running out of capacity assuming it takes you 48 days to recover if you mess up after pressing the "increase capacity button"
2. Running out of capacity
Subtleties to this debate include:
- Blockchains being a royal PITA to "reboot" - the bigger the chain grows, and it grows *relentlessly* 24/7, the more resources and the longer it takes to recover from mishaps
- `bitcoind` is just the skeleton of a Bitcoin business. Block explorers, wallets like Electrum, projects like Open Bazaar, and most "Bitcoin 2.0" innovations require parsing `bitcoind` base data. I *strongly* suggest running Electrum server, which is [literally unable to handle 2.5 MB sized blocks, let alone 8 MB, let alone 8 GB]( The services that drive the most value in Bitcoin are disproportionately affected by block size increases, making the cost of recovering from mishaps at bloated blockchain sizes exponentially more devastating.
- SPV fundamentally comprises your privacy compared to running a full node. Sadly, we have to both aggressively cull blockchain growth *and* pray for Moore's Law for full nodes to be comparable to SPV. Most people don't believe in full nodes for home desktop, and I strongly disagree, as I believe home desktop full nodes are infinitely more private and secure than SPV, hence chains supporting home PC full nodes, even if they provide 80% of the features of a heavyweight resource hog chain like BitcoinXT, will be objectively superior to chains where running a full node is costly enough so as to be inaccessible for most folks at home
The critics argue there is a crisis based on the lie that Bitcoin "dies" if you can't send nickels for pennies. They refuse to see the greater vision, and instead resort to attacks based on perceived conflicts of interest, seeking to discredit the makers of HashCash and BitTorrent, literally speaking, both of whom strongly condemn XT.

The price of hitting the chain could be $1000, but if you and billions of other people are using BTC already by then, a person born the next day is going to use BTC, too. If they can't make a payment on chain without paying $1000, they'll *still use BTC*.

Without a native, distributed ledger token like BTC, you'd need to trust the banks not to misrepresent settlement on their "transparent" ledger. For instance, if they used a BitUSDtoken, such a token would be quite literally worthless without a trusted issuer converting BitUSDtoken into actual USD in a bank account. Conversely, BTC is a bearer instrument: either you have it or you don't.


What little immutability the banks could claim their self-signed chain to have is completely irrelevant because they could rewrite their own chain at any time seeing as they trust each other to sign blocks. If they're just trusting themselves anyway, it isn't clear at all what if any advantages a blockchain has over a jointly administered SQL database.

No, no they don't. They may have a replicated SQL DB, though. Maybe you should try launching an altcoin based on MySQL. Do let us know how it goes.


You surely can't be so naive as to believe the BitLicense is the last ever piece of regulation directed at Bitcoin. Bitcoin is being aggressively pursued by regulators. Have you been living under a rock?!


Let's turn this question around. By your logic, since Monero has an unrestricted block size, it's a sure thing to win out over Bitcoin. Gee, have you thought about dumping all your BTC for XMR?
And the real question is why wouldn't you rather test out your utterly untested and completely experimental megablocks on a sidechain? There's a 100% chance of you splitting BTC permanently into two networks if the XT fork goes through, I hope you know. If you think any of your words on Reddit are swaying the brightest minds in Bitcoin, who built the system and vehemently condemn XT, you have another thing coming.

1. 80%+ of all BTC never moves from cold storage
2. of the 20% of all BTC being employed in commerce, most of it is low value and demands lower security or lower privacy and hence can be accomplished with payment channels and sidechains which are near perfectly trustless, or on off-chain processors like Coinbase which aren't trustless but which get the job done
3. of the 5% of high value transactions, ALL will be able to make it onto the chain, in a timely fashion. We don't need 8GB blocks for that, at all.
Everyone wants the block size to increase, but some level of discomfort before RBF is universally deployed in wallets simply doesn't warrant this mass hysteria. The short term risk of angering newbies is being blown wildly out of proportion. People who have *already* jumped through the numerous and costly bureaucratic hurdles to trade their first fiat currency for BTC, are ALREADY SOLD ON BITCOIN. You aren't going to convince them to stop buying bitcoin if it costs $0.50 more and a couple hours if not days to send it to cold storage, when they've already encountered costs higher than that amount to be there.
Beneficially, aggressively culling blocksize gives you the long term reward of full nodes on the desktop, SPV itself being retired in favor of a much more trustless P2P network that is infinitely more resilient to outside interference. On the other side of "conflict of interest" accusations, which inclusive of the one I'm about to make are completely FOS, this is a bad thing for Mike Hearn's BitcoinJ. It's also a bad thing for tons of Bitcoin 2.0 startups who are betting on sidechains either dying or becoming irrelevant thanks to it being possible to bloat the main chain endlessly and cheaply. All that at the cost of hammering full nodes and heavy base infrastructure, making redlisting and lifting the 21,000,000 coin supply cap in response to the same kind of ridiculous mass hysteria that is playing itself out right now, more feasible.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:47:00


Agreed completely!
However, a big bank can easily afford 8X or even 2000X the price of this amateur spam attack. Increasing block size alone is moreso a delay tactic or a kick-the-can than an all-encompassing solution.
The *real* all-encompassing solution is Replace-By-Fee. You would submit a transaction, and if it took too long, you UNDO the send and REDO with a higher fee.
Your analysis overlooks two critical components:
1. this recent gem from Electrum server operators, that [Electrum itself will not survive blocks larger than 2.5MB]( So there's certainly a tradeoff to the delay tactic of kick the can, which wouldn't work against adversaries with larger budgets.
2. there are two ways to make it more expensive for a spammer. 1) bigger blocks, and 2) higher fees.
Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin won't die if you can't send nickels for pennies.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:56:35
Which would you rather lose:
- Your ability to send nickels for pennies on the blockchain (you would still have this ability through payment channels and off-chain payment processors)
- ALL of your BTC in cold storage
Clearly the sanctity of cold storage savings outweighs your ability to send nickels for pennies. Why optimize the system around sending nickels for pennies? Did you invest your savings into BTC because you wanted more bedsheets on Overstock? Or because you wanted a safe haven asset outside the political and financial system. Again, which use case is more important. It's very clear cold storage and decentralization are what attracts real users to invest substantially in BTC.


1. It's better to see the purported failings of any system when it's still small, rather than with 100M more users.
2. Yes, transactions will fail as load exceeds available resources *at any block size*. RBF. 80% of all BTC never moves from cold storage. Why optimize for the lower value usages of the system when without decentralization, Bitcoin would be PayPal 2.0?


We wouldn't even be having this conversation if not for a PR push by Gavin and Hearn, which is why I have serious reservations with the resulting mass hysteria, as should anyone.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:37:14
Cool that you're running a relay. However, my point is more that bitcoind is the *skeleton* of a business. It would be fallacious to act as if the skeleton alone is all that is needed to run a Bitcoin business. Almost any Bitcoin service or API *parses* bitcoind's base data or plays with it in some way to make it more consumable by the public in ways that drive value. If you look into the Electrum server or Insight block explorer install or usage docs, you'll see. Most colored coin servers similarly parse L1. This work is *heavily* IO bound.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:46:29


0-conf transactions would still be protected with First-Seen-Safe RBF, which is already being adopted by miners. You can only increase the miner fee and re-submit the tx, not change where your BTC is headed.


Yes, or with payment channels since the channels have instant confirmations and near zero fees.


The approach Electrum uses is extremely common. It is the same approach taken by OpenBazaar, [block explorers]( and most colored coins implementations. Extracting L1 data from `bitcoind` is highly common, Electrum is just the tip of the iceberg but it clearly will not survive even 2.5MB blocks.
Projects that will suffer from larger blocks:
- Electrum
- OpenBazaar
- DarkWallet
- OpenAssets
- ANY block explorer
Perhaps the project won't "die", but at best it will end up running only in expensive cloud computing clusters completely destroying those project's autonomy and usability by the individual.
Read the [Electrum server docs]( (for Electrum), [Libbitcoin server docs]( (for [OpenBazaar]( and any of the colored coin server implementations like [OpenAssets (NASDAQ)]( and you will see block size increase disproportionately affects some of the most useful and active projects in the space. Sadly, many of those projects are either ignorant of the risk or perfectly happy to constrain their "open source" services to expensive cloud computing clusters that conveniently only they can afford to run. At a certain point, the open source nature of their projects become an empty talking point primarily for reassuring their largely non-technical userbase that is none-the-wiser.
The only use case not disproportionately affected by larger blocks is the most simple of all cases where you have a naive bloom filtering SPV wallet with pitiful privacy and security. The very best you could do there is connect it directly to a `bitcoind` instance running as a Tor hidden service.
