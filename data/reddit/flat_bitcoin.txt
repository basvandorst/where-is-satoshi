If you have 1BTC in your wallet and I have 1 BTC in my wallet, we can both put out 1BTC into a channel, and then shuffle them back and forth, making payments, without needing to go 'on-chain'. LN plans to do this not just between two people but long chains of people. Plenty of videos on youtube to get the basics (just be wary of the guy who writes on yellow bits of paper, he frequently mixes things up, like calling LN a sidechain)

Lightning network is not a side chain (I head blockstream is working on other actual side chain projects(?)), it doesn't use different coins, it uses Bitcoin. It's basically a way to move bitcoins back and forth between people off chain, back and forth back and forth, before settling on the chain at ... some point.

I love how people on here take analogies and poke holes in the parts that obviously are not related to the points at hand. Me and my girlfriend have separate finances, and I use PGP, sheesh, someone else paid your fees, saying fees aren't a problem, just because you are in a situation where you didn't pay them, is retarded. let's take away the analogies and make it simple...

if 2 is offline it doesn't need to enforce consensus, and in fact can't because it is non-mining. It can enforce "what chain is bitcoin" regardless of if it is online or offline, that only depends on when it is online, what rules it uses. (because they and the person they are transacting with have decided they, by using these consensus rules, are transacting Bitcoin rather than random-shit-coin-fork)

Transaction fees, and the fee market however do not scale linearly with block size, so a small block size increase would reduce the fees a large amount.

It's not insane itself, it's just insane to scale to that today. On chain scaling is fine, is just has to scale slow enough for hardware to keep up, problem is that may be too slow (and LN will blow that out of the water, in terms of tx/s/chain size anyway)
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:17:19

Both of your assumptions are correct. In the first case, Alice can't send via Bob to Carol if Bob has a zero ballance with Carol. (in this simple three person network)
Second, yes, Bob could route a payment back through Alice to Carol if those channels have enough funds. This is really what, hopefully, stops you having to close and reopen channels a lot, with a well connected network you can route, and rebalance channels a lot easier (hubs may even offer *negative* fees at some points if the rebalancing of channels is more profitable than on chain fees for closing and opening channels!)

Bullcrap. BCH currently has less overall tx with more inputs and outputs. depending on how you want to define "transaction volume", they have more transaction volume than BTC (total input and output addresses), and if they had more *of the same type* of transactions as BTC, eg single/few input outputs, they could handle ~4-8x the transaction volume. Love BTC, back BTC, but don't talk nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:17:16
Sure, you set a block height, and you say after block x, only [smaller blocksize] blocks follow consensus. The previous chain remains untouched, and you have smaller blocks. If you mean you cant change the blocks in the chain on disk created before the 'smaller blocks' fork, then sure, you can't change the chain, but like I said above,fixing Bitcoin now doesn't require blocks so large that we need to worry about ever needing to make them smaller again.

My node is a non-mining *...non-transacting...* node


How? How does my non mining, non transacting node do this. Say, unlikely, but say that all mining nodes and all exchange nodes change the rules to, say, dis allow smaller than 0.5BTC transactions, what power does my node have in that situation? Sure it can check the rules, and see that they are not the rules I say are Bitcoin, but it has no sway, it's just sitting there, on a chain with no hash power.




Nope, developers can make as much code as they want, only mining nodes, those with hash power that can actually create new blocks can *actually* chance the rules.
I was talking about hard forks, as soft forks can only be a subset of already existing rules, but regardless my node still has no power. If I change my code to soft or hard fork new rules, or likewise spin up one million similar nodes, they have done nothing to change Bitcoin

This is not true. Bob has two channels one with Alice, and one with Carol. If he starts with 0BTC in each and Alice sends him 1BTC, then his channel with Carol still has 0 ballance on his side and he cannot send her anything, as OP alludes to, he would have to settle his Alice channel on chain, and open a new channel with Carol before he could send her funds.
However, in a very well connected network, not just the three person one listed here, he may be able to send that 1BTC back via Alice and through other peers to Carol

once you are in one block, to get 8 more will be an average of 80 minutes over the long term, but that varies block to block, day to day based on hash rate, difficulty and luck. Right now, a good guess would be more like [68 minutes](

It's around a few dollars I think, problem is that it makes little sense, and is high only due to current imposed limitations. $ per block is a much more usable figure, because it will only slowly change, $ per transaction can and will dramatically change as soon as block size is increased, or LN is widely used etc.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:57:03
I did not invest, I am just interested in the tech.
The average is not just what people are willing to pay, it's what they are willing to pay in the current market. If blocks were not full, the fee wouldn't be $20. Anything more that a couple of cents is too high IMO, Bitcoin is an electronic cash system, it needs to compete as such. 
People argue that fees are only high now, and we just have to wait for LN, that is a fine argument, I disagree and think we can have the best of both worlds, but both camps I think would agree that at least in future, fees need to be cents or fractions of cents. 
Yes, microtransactions, buying coffee, buying a car, getting paid, all what I expect to be able to to with BTC. Bitcoin is a *electronic cash* system, buying coffee is absolutely one of the things it is for. 
The lowest (non segwit) fee for 5 days is around 100sat/byte, or about $5, but there is no assurance in the current system, because the same small blocks that cause high fees can cause wild swings in mempool backlog, maybe your 5 days becomes a month without access to your funds.
I don't know what that chart is showing, average confirmation times for what? the first confirmation of successful transactions? if so (not covering that this doesn't show all the transactions that were sent but never even made it into a block), that is *terrible*. Again don't compare it to VISA, compare it to what is possible with the tech, average first confirmation times should be slightly longer than the block time, eg just over 10 minutes with a healthy fee market. 
If you insist on talking about competing with VISA, sure it beats it on tx time, but does about 500 times less volume, push the current network to VISA levels, and 1/500th of transactions would get through, and fees would be totally mental. 
If somebody is willing to pay high fees ... Sure, and someone forced the price of gas $100 a gallon, some people would still pay for it, does that mean the system of distributing oil is working as it should. Does it mean that oil is available to a large user base? Can now only a small fraction of people actually afford to use their car?
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:30:49
Yeah, I fully see the value in any node for network performance, and redundancy. In my head, that is a very small value on the network, and I would assume the large and increasing number of transacting and mining nodes would be more than sufficient, but I said elsewhere on this thread, I would consider running my node if it indeed had any notable effect on this. I would be interested in seeing any studies or anything relating to how big of an effect nodes like mine have on such network performance. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:07:14
Yeah, I missed that bit of your logic, how did the 'bunch of non-transacting nodes pull hashing power away'?
If miners choose to mine different rules then yes, your chain is less secure due to less hash power, that has nothing to do with nodes like mine?
for your previous post, I think those two are exactly what I was talking about in the OP.
1 - this security is provided by the miners, and the PoW they provide
2 - this coin-value pair is created by people trading coins via transacting nodes
my node plays no part in either of those

The LN white paper says we will need larger on chain blocks to scale, smaller block size is a step backwards from a position that is already two steps behind. 


It is 'overkill' for a certain volume of LN traffic, it is far less than is needed for the size LN will grow to


effectively being the prime word, in reality, adoption has stagnated at 10% and looks like it will take a long time to get anywhere near to 100%


This is not a problem, like at all. 500KB is 25GB per year, that's *26 years* of full blocks on a $40 2TB hard drive. 


The whole blokchain will sync in a week on even very poor hardware, syncing up a full node is not something you do just for fun and expect it to be done in an hour, never will be, doesn't need to be.
The bigger problem is syncing *new* blocks, and I suggest people read about how compactblocks and the like work


Centralization is not a problem with 1MB blocks, smaller blocks are not needed for this, and IMO, even much larger blocks will impact this very minimally today (Larger blocks on Core would have been done long ago if it didn't require a hard fork)


*When bitcoin was worth basically nothing and doing such an attack was therefore basically free* Blocks are already always full, so there is no attack needed to 'bloat the blockchain', suh attacks would only serve to push up fees and delay other transactions, and I suggest you go price out such an attack.
This is the only point I somewhat agree with you on. Block size in BTC needs to be limited *somewhat* to allow a healthy fee market to form to keep miners paid, this would be IMO keeping the mempool about 2-5x the size of a full block. Small blocks limit transaction growth, that is *needed* to increase mining revenue in future. Currently block reward is around $170,000, divide that by 1MB 2000tx per block and the average fee would be $85, and we want mining revenue to go *up*, much better to pay this 170k over 200,000 transactions at 85c each right? (What 133MB blocks that the LN whtie paper talks about would give us in tx count)

You keep just saying random stuff, are you saying that I'm arguing that or what? Confused as to what the point of such comments is
You could always balance between cost and speed, the problem is the fee floor, and range.
That page shows unconfirmed mempools tx going down, pending fees going up, anyway more reflective data is the [average transaction fee]( not limited to an arbitrary time frame, although I would suggest what is interesting is ~Jan-2017 onward, after the 1MB limit started getting hit, sure doesn't look downwards trending to me. 
 
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:10:40
Output $ value is irrelevant. The block you list has a lot of  many input-one output transactions. BCH and BTC are being used for different type of transaction, driven probably by fee price. These BCH blocks have fewer overall transactions, but higher total input-output. Comparing the two chains on overall transaction count is not that useful.

You are correct,and not the first person to think about this, have a look at part 10 of the white paper; Lightning Network will require large on chain blocks to scale (133MB for everyone on earth to open and close 1 channel a year I believe)
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:28:45
Because with on chain transactions that bandwidth needs to be shared among all nodes, on the LN it is segregated. 
If you send a transacton on chain, that say 250 bytes needs to be sent to a node, and from there it travels to all nodes, costing each node at least 500 bytes of network bandwidth, and 250 bytes of disk space.
On the lightning network, when you set up a channel it costs that same amount, but then you can send technically an unlimited amount of transactions and the bandwidth used for those are only between you and your peers, it does not need to be relayed between all, or in fact any nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:40:47
Fees. Fees happened. For every $0.10 tip you flick someone, you have to flick a miner tens of dollars kind of kills the tips. (Or were tip bots running off chain? That seems like it'd be ripe for exploitation!)

It would be like buying gold. On chain would be like going down to the bank in town, paying and getting a bar, you get a real gold bar but it takes a while. 
Going to the exchange is like going to the corner store, paying and instantly getting a note saying "redeemable for 1 bar of gold", you get the note right away, and can trade it at the corner store for cash or other things, but when it comes time to actually get you real gold bar, you have to give the store owner the note, they go down to the basement, unlock the safe and get you an actual gold bar, this is like when you send Bitcoin from your exchange account to your real wallet, and again it takes a while
This is why storing your Bitcoin on an exchange is a bad idea, because everyone has a bunch on note's that say they are worth one gold bar, but all it takes is someone hacking the exchange, eg stealing the gold from the safe, and all the exchange users are left holding worthless notes.

Because it requires a hard fork, this is *the* only reason, it makes sense in every other way. People here will say that it doesn't matter that Bitcoin becomes far less usable, that the price is impacted, that user uptake is slowing, and that it will have to claw all those losses back afterwards etc etc because you only have to think 'long term' and just be patient and wait for LN. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:50:38
I know of nothing stopping the community changing the block size back down, it's a hard fork, just like changing it up, and comes with the same risks, the risks of a 'smaller blocksize fork' however are none, because fixing Bitcoin now doesn't require blocks so large that we need to worry about ever needing to make them smaller again.
I agree a blockchain increases in size too much is dangerous, but we have lots of headroom, eg my node runs on a [32bit Atom N280]( the whole PC cost me $50. You can buy [an old PC]( that is [*20 times faster*]( for $150. 


My node was off for about 3 days, it caught up 515 blocks in just around 10 hours, so it's already able to process around 8 times faster than is needed, that's a PC that is slower than my mobile phone. The CPU in the $150 PC above ballpark should handle *100 times the current transaction load* (even more with future code optimizations) 


Yeah, they learn that 'that online coin thing' is a "scam", it only slows down wide spread adoption, by scaring users, increasing regulation (to protect these people) and [pushing people away]( from a currently non-working Bitcoin. 
EDIT: Fun to note also that that $150 PC would cost you $9 in Jan 2017 money if it was invested in Bitcoin. Invest $10 now so you can run a node in 2019 :D

"Mining node" in my OP is any node that has hashing power behind it, any node that has the ability to  create blocks. My node cannot.


I agree, what I'm saying is that their checks and balances are worthless, as they neither have a say in the consensus rules, or the value of the Bitcoin.


*Only* in line with the transacting nodes, if mining nodes and transacting nodes use blocks with new rules, my node has no sway. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:09:15
Nodes are like banks in that they hold your funds, but they are very different. When a bank holds your money, you have to trust them with it, they *could* do anything they want with it.

Nope I don't. BCH has low fees and plans to expand transaction volume keeping the low fees, BTC plans to roll out LN soon(ish) and dramatically lower fees. You'll see an uptick in ability to actually use Bitcoin in future. There are plenty places that still accept Bitcoin today, but the high fees make small purchases largely intractable currently.

- Non-full blocks lowers fees dramatically / over full blocks raises fees dramatically
- Block size increases (of a suficent size) create non-full blocks (yes, not forever they will eventually fill up I'm not saying otherwise) 
These two lines above are what my original comment says
Now, as always on reddit it seems, it has been turned into a scaling debate ...
- You say that we cannot scale blocks to cover transactions because the adoption curve is too big, and blocks would have to get too large
- I say that even moderate block size increases would be sufficent to make Bitcoin work as intended again until LN gets here
There is no point discussing the two opposing viewpoints above, because a) your not going to change your stance b) I am unlikely to change mine c) we are talking about unknown future metrics that cannot be proven one way or another.

If you are running a non-mining node, you really havn't helped much. Your node will transmit transactions to other nodes, helping the network be more resilient, but this is probably unnecessary with the amount of 'real' mining and transacting nodes. 


You have likely received and transmitted *all*, or very close to all, network (mempool) transactions. Every node does, and every node has 100% of the confirmed transactions.


The value is the total value of transactions that have been made, like every  node


Non mining nodes do not 'process' transactions

AFAIK the only way to do this is to limit / increase the number of peers you connect to

You have to vent the heat, no other options. Cooling the hot air is silly, it will cost you more in power than the miners use. (Cooling itself can't be done in a closed system, that heat still needs to go *somewhere*, you'll just be using a lot of power to push it outside in a different way) Each miner is like having a medium sized electric heater, 1 miner will most likely heat a small space like a garage with no ventilation to over 30°C in a few hours. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:20:23
if 2 sends some bitcoin, 1 mines that transaction into a block, 3 is irrelevant, in that it can't change the tx, or the consensus rules between 2 and 1
If you add a million malicious nodes to the above, nothing would change, 1 and 2 would prune out the ones not following their rules, 2 would send tx to 1 to include in a block.
Are you saying Bitcoin could be taken down by many malicious full non-transacting non-mining nodes? Because that would be cheap.

No, like block reward averages to 10 minutes, BCH and BTC will always average to 1:1 profit over the long term, with price and hashpower shuffling around accordingly.

Proof required, but IMO it doesn't matter, you can't tell spam and valid transactions apart, if a transaction is in the mempool paying fees, it is a valid transaction like any other, the system needs to process it like any other transaction, and if such 'spam' transactions can disrupt the network, it is a problem with the network and incentives that run it. 
EDIT: return in kind? jees, don't be so petty 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:07:50
Yes, but more precisely, the amount you send is irrelevant, and if you are in the top 1000-2000 [highest paying fees in the mempool]( you will very likely be confirmed in the next block, and if not very very very likely the one after that.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:37:36
Yes, I agree, the government will want control, and the way to take that control is slowly, by being better. This is the same reason I disagree with implementing private transactions in coins, the first person that will try to tear the system down is the tax man. 
This argument really does not belong here though, if you think there is no way to remove Governments control over money, that is usually the goal of most ardent crypto supporters long term

Yes, it's on bitnodes, it is a full node, port 8333 open.
The first one is the one I'm debating, it validates blocks yes, but has no power to influence the network one way or another.
The second one, my node might be helping in that it creates another point to relay transactions etc, I'm not sure on that though, I don't think that is an issue, I doubt non-mining non-transacting nodes help with the speed of the network to a great extent(?) and I'm sure they don't help with the security. If these type of nodes are shown to actually improve the networks *performance*, that might be a reason for me to continue running it.

Anyone can act like a bank using Bitcoin as a backing, but it's exactly opposite the point of Bitcoin. If Satoshi Nakamoto ever moved any of his coins, IMO the network would fork them off the network, no problems.

Yes, if it is unconfirmed for more than a week, it goes into the genesis block, and Satoshi then owns your coins, little known feature of the code
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:08:16
I think the thinking otherwise come from the early days, and the white paper, where all nodes were mining nodes. Saying that, I still run a full node that does no mining or transactions, it may not help much, but it costs me basically nothing, and I just like having a full copy of the blockchain: P
As a non miner you help the network by transacting the fork you believe in, and doing your part in assigning value to it. (Doing this on your own node is better for you and the network)

But *we don't have too*, the two options are
- don't fix the system, pay a higher fee, get working transactions

the second one is broken down into two options
- wait for the LN to fix the system, and deal with high fees now
- fix the current system, have low fees, and continue to wait for LN

I'm saying this is only true for other mining and transacting nodes. And you can easily prove it; I can make 100 million AWS non-mining non-transacting nodes, that choose whatever rule set they want, that would be an overwhelming majority of nodes, and they would make no difference to the two consensuses that make Bitcoin Bitcoin.

Yes, more so now than ever, 0-conf can no longer be trusted. You should wait multiple confirmations, 6 is usually the number people go with, but you can go with any number you feel comfortable with above 0, before you can count that transaction as being yours.

You could think of the blockchain as a series of large boxes, all stacked one on top of the other. A new one is added to the pile around every 10 minutes. Inside each large box, are many little lock boxes with a combination locks, each one is a Bitcoin address, and inside each little lock box is some amount of Bitcoin. That blockchain is stored in the Bitcoin network, and will exist on the network whether she has an app or not.
What she has in her wallet on her phone, or her PC or on a paper wallet, are the combinations to one or more of those lock boxes. When she want to spend some of her bitcoin, she pulls out one of the lock boxes, uses her combination (private keys) to open it, and takes out the Bitcoin. She then puts that Bitcoin and any others she wants to send into another little box, locks it with a new combination lock provided by the person she is sending the coins too, and puts it back into the newest big box on top of the blockchain. 
This is not 100% accurate to how Bitcoin really works, but it is close enough to give an idea to someone non-tech literate. The little lock boxes due to the math used, are all but impossible to break open, so if people loose their keys, those Bitcoin are lost forever, never being able to be unlocked by anyone. It also means that anyone that gets her list of addresses and keys, can access those Bitcoin and send them just as she would, there is no higher power to go to in Bitcoin, if you loose your keys, that is that.
The 12 word seed is just a way to wrap up all the combinations to all the addresses that one wallet software has access to, in a nice way that humans can understand, rather than numbers or 1's and 0s. The wallet software can take those words and transform them into the list of all address and combinations (private keys) that that wallet has access to.

The bigger the blocks, the more it costs to store process and transmit them, the larger the cost of hardware required to run a node, the smaller the group of people who can afford to run nodes will be, and the less nodes there will be. At 4 or 8MB this makes little difference, but will become a large difference with double or triple digit MB blocks if done in the near future.

@_date: 2018-01-11 00:20:33
Induced demand is not what I'm talking about, that just means demand will go up after the block size is increased, I said *fees* do not scale linearly. 
Say you have blocks that can fit 50 transactions and a current demand of 100tx per block. There are 50 more tx per block than can fit, this means 50% will be dropped, and the only way to ensure your tx gets into the chain is to out bid others in the fee market, this drives fees up, say to $10 (this number is arbitrary, but is in line with Bitcoin atm)
If you then increase the block size, doubling it to 100, then all the demand for transactions is taken care of, and nobody has to bid anymore to get block space, everyone can pay the minimum fee, say $0.01 and get in the block.
Block space has gone up 2x and fees have dropped by 1000x.
Induced demand means the bigger blocks will probably cause *more* transactions, it doesn't mean they will always just jump up to the level required to overfill blocks when the block size is increased, if you look at most any other coin than Bitcoin, the blocks are large and non-full compared to the market demand.
This IMO is one of the main philisophical differences between BTC and BCH, BCH wants never full blocks, and BTC wants *somewhat* full blocks. IMO it must be a balancing act, that gets users the lowest fees while ensuring miners get paid as block rewards fall away. I don't see how BCH never full blocks can ever achieve this, because non-full blocks with no minim fee means there is no incentive to pay any fee, and miners won't get $. BTC will ensure miners get paid, but atm the scales are tipped far too much one way, causing fees to be much higher than they should be.

Oh sorry! yeah, mis-type didn't mean to waste your time. Basically a wallet can give you *actual* access to your Bitcoins by giving you your private key, or just hold an IOU, just some mark in a database that represents your coins.


Could be, hopefully. Download Electrum wallet (make sure to get a legit, new version, previous versions had a vulnerability), and try to import that private key. Or maybe a mobile wallet like Mycelium, it should let you scan the QR code.
Once you get access to your coins, depending on how much you have,I would consider setting up a new wallet, back up the new key / 12 world phrase etc and transfer the coins there, that will cost you a sizable fee, but then you can be sure that you and only you have access to your private key, and that it was generated securely.

Who knows if he is, or if he has access etc. In theory one person/group having access to ~1/21 of the total supply is a huge risk to the whole market, IMO, in reality it is not so bad; if Satoshi ever moved any of his early coins, the community would hard fork burn them. 
I would think Satoshi is smart enough t have mined some coins later on that cannot be tied to him, hope (s)he/they did, they deserve to get paid.

Point missed. I'm talking about how my node has no power in *any* situation


Mining nodes have hash power to make blocks. My node doesn't mine,It will not "suddenly become a mining node", what are you smoking?


Just what I said, every time there is a fork, miners change the rules, those two statements are synonymous. The chain that remains Bitcoin, is decided by the people, through exchanging nodes, my node doesn't have any power in that situation. I'm just repeating myself here.


Again, just going in circles, it's a consensus network sure, between mining nodes and transacting nodes.

I’m sorry, but you are incorrect. The lightning network is not one big channel where anyone can send anyone anything. It is a group of people all individually connected through channels, all of which need to be sufficiently connected and funded.
Imagine Alice and Bob are sitting on either side of a small table, this is their lightning channel. Alice has $100 of $1 bills in front of her, and bob has nothing. Alice can send money $1 at a time by sliding it across the table to Bob. And once Bob has some of the Bills, he can slide them back over to Alice.
Now behind Bob, is another table, where he sits across from Carol, on this table Bob and Carol have no money, so they cannot move any money between them.
If Alice want to send money to Carol, it cannot happen, because Bob is not sufficiently funded. The only way is for Alice to slide bills to Bob, and for Bob to take those bills off the first table, and put them on the second table. Putting funds into or pulling funds out of channels like this requires an on chain transaction.
How LN works with sufficiently funded channels:
Same two tables, Alice Bob and Carol all have $100 on the table (bob has $100 on each of the tables because he is in the middle)
Alice wants to send $1 to Carol, she slides it to bob, and he has $101 on one table and $100 on the other, he then slides $1 on the second table to Carol, leaving Alice with $99, Bob with two piles, one with $101, and one with $99 (total still $200), and Carol with one pile of $101. $1 has effectively been paid from Alice to Carol. This can only happen if the channels have sufficient funds on the correct sides.

Bitcoin, it's just a bunch of 1's and 0's that people didn't know about, then some people found out about them and paid a little bit of money for some 1's and 0's, and then other people found out about them and paid lots and lots of money for some 1's and 0's too.

The /s was not needed, it is BCH plan, and until LN gets here, it is working *better* that Bitcoin. Full blocks have lower tx count because they are full of multiple input / multiple output transactions, so one of these transactions could be paying multiple people (like the community here have been pushing Coinbase to do), low fees enables you to actually spend a bunch of dust to a single address. Re-do your picture include total input and outputs, circle those columns and the fees column..

I don't know how coinpayments works, but that site, if you look under the graphs, it says "Which fee should I use?" and then says (at this time anyway) "the fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 450 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top."
so 450 satoshis/byte should be a good value to use right now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:37:17
Bitcoin uses that much energy per transaction because it is currently limiting the amount of transactions per second.
When Bitcoin scales, to say 100 time the volume, then each tx will be using 2.15Kwh. 1000 times, 215wh per tx, 1 million, 774 joules etc
Bitcoin and blockchain is always going to use a lot more energy that a similar centralized system, that energy is in securing a trustless p2p system as a whole, measuring it in terms of power per tx, at least at the moment, may not be the best way to look at it. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:00:51
Jokes. Transactions will remain unconfirmed for 2 weeks according the the core code, this can vary up or down depending on the individual node, before they are dropped from the nodes mempool. If your transaction is RBF, you can re-send with a higher fee now, otherwise wait for 2 weeks, and re-send the transaction with a higher fee
EDIT depending on your wallet, you may have to restore your seed or run -zapwallettxes etc before your wallet removes the old transaction and you are able to send a new one. Plenty guides on that just google. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:36:50
I agree the demand is exponential, always has been, and will continue to be for a long time yet.


This is where it's pointless to discuss again, because we are just going to disagree :) Not talking about scaling on chain forever, but IMO there is a lot of headroom to allow Bitcoin to contiune to function as intended until LN. 
My reason is not so anyone can get rich, I really don't care about price, my motivations are thr tech, and IMO the current state of Bitcoin is hurting that by allowing 'shitcoins' to gain traction, influencing regulation, teaching people that Bitcoin is 'expensive and broken', fracturing the Dev community etc etc

what? we are talking about *protecting* Bitcoin by running nodes here, not changing the algorithm. What you just said, would be a third party setting up a mining node on a fork, I am talking exactly about what power my node has to protect the integrity of Bitcoin in that situation.


Angry? foreseed? No, bemused by your lack of understanding of what is being discussed, and pointing out that if you didn't just use Bitcoin on TOR, you might clear your head a bit. 


I said, already, in circles again... Miners control the consensus rules, transactors control what one of the chains is Bitcoin. If the Chinese government overnight took over all their mining operations, and took the majority of the network hashpower, forked bitcoin, and had the longest PoW chain, do you think people would call that Bitcoin? no the people, via exchanges and other transactors decide what chain to call Bitcoin, and what value to assign any chain.

Yeah, looks like their mempool is limited to  ~70k tx, so only fits more recent tx. To get a proper view I would need a mempool that is large enough to never fill and never drops transactions, I may have a play with setting this up getting the data from my node.

Your wallet does not contain any coins, it only contains a list of addresses and your keys to be able to use the coins in those addresses.
The blockchain works like a timeline, an in order list of every address and every single transaction ever made to those addresses.
So if your starting from fresh, no blockchain, you only have your wallet, the list of the addresses you control, but you have nowhere to look up what balance any of those addresses have.
Say one of your address received it first transfer in 2015, you will have to wait until the blockchain has synced up to that point, then your wallet software grabs the block with that address, and goes "oh look, I know about this address now, and it has 1 BTC", so your balance will show as 1BTC, maybe later in 2016 you spent 0.5BTC to somewhere, so when the blockchain syncs to that point, you wallet will go, "oh look, now that address has only 0.5BTC", and your wallet will show 0.5BTC. 
If you only synced the blockchain to 2015, your balance would show 1BTC, and it would let you *try* and spend it, but when you sent that transaction to the other nodes, they, with their up to date chain, would say "this guy can't spend those coins, he only has 0.5BTC"
Wow, that was long, I'm obviously board, basically, you have to wait until the blockchain is fully synced to be sure you know how many Bitcoins your wallet keys actually control, so just wait, and hopefully you have the correct wallet.dat

It is a completely p2p, decentralized cash system, a worlds first, that is groundbreaking, amazing, something that people have been trying to do for decades, in that way it is nothing like FIAT, or in fact 
*anything* that ever existed before in human history. It needs to be able to compete with FIAT and VISA to gain usage, and it can, but compare it's performance to what it can optimally do, not to FIAT, or VISA, 
because they are not the same in terms of control, distribution, decentralization and all the good things that make Bitcoin amazing.


Satoshi told us, he planned it, it was working until full blocks broke it; Block reward diminishes, price goes up, and fees take over. Total miners reward has gone up orders of magnitude; in 2012 when the last 
50 BTC reward block was mined, the price was $12, total block reward of $600, in 2016 when the last 25 BTC reward block was mined, the price was $650, total block reward of $16250. Today, @ 13k, a 12.5 
block reward is $162500. 
You can do the math and make up many scenarios balancing price, tx count, and fee and see that it works to pay miners at all points in the future. Even at an end goal of total world money, everyone doing 2 
tx per day = 15 billion tx = 62 million tx per block @ 1c = $625000 dollars.


Because the properties that made it a currency *have been actively removed* due to not letting the protocol do what it was designed to do. With a block size increase, it would work as it always has, and 
hopefully will when the LN launches, will again.


Because it's not a 4x4 Jeep, it *is* a nascar whos tires have worn out and not been replaced, and it waiting for a better engine, rather than putting new tires on while still waiting for that better engine.


You are abiously taking old information, repeated from Satoshi estimates of 250bytes/tx, in the real world [tx sizes are actually larger](


No need to believe, open global ledger and all, just link me to your, or anyone elses transaction ID's on any block explorer, but you needn't bother because


And what percentage is that, what chance does a 1sat/B transaction have, if it is close enough to zero, it can be counted as such, and more importantly *who* is making those transactions ... miners can 
include any transaction they want ...


How many time do I have to repeat, the benchmark is **what Bitcoin is capable of** not FIAT or any other traditional system


Yes, like I said *for those transactions that make it into a block*. For every tick on that chart, there are multiple times more transactions that never make it into a block at all.


It is, you can pay more or less, within a range, if you pay below the fee floor, your transaction will not go through, it will sit in the mempool, holding your funds up, and then be dropped. I'll make you a bet, I'll send you $1 with a fee of $0.10, and if you ever get it, it's yours, if it's held in the mempool and eventually dropped you send me $100 with a ($20 fee so I actually get it).

Yes, I paid zero for my dinner because my girlfriend payed for it, this does not lead me to write posts saying "Proof that meals are free, paying for food is FUD" lol
We are talking about high fees in *the Bitcoin network* not on exchanges withdrawals, if you want to talk about *GDAX* being low fee, then talk about that.


No it is not, the comparison is not to SWIFT or anything else, it is to what the *protocol is capable of*. This can be debated, but in the best case, it is instant 0-conf and 60 minutes 'fully confirmed'.

It works better in that it can handle more transactions for a lower cost. Agree this may not be "working better" in all definitions.

Yeah, technically not a pre-mine, difference is announcing before mining in 2009 when only a handful of people knew what a crypto currency was. Having one person owning ~1/21 of the whole supply means the same thing in practice.
 Difference is that if Satoshi ever moved any of his coins, the community IMO would most likely hard fork his coins to make them invalid, to protect the whole network from collapse.

AFAIK, you can't disable AMT (at least the ME, basically the same if you have access) without some very tricky hardware modification at the motherboard level. OS for sure has no say, it runs all the time, even if you have no OS or even drive installed. AFAIK if you have a new gen i3 i5 i7 or Xeon, you have ME, sniff your network traffic external to your box, and you can see it pinging.  
There are many routers and even more firmware's, and they are mostly pushed out the door at the lowest cost without ever being updated after they are installed, and all based off similar base core libraries [(Probably even NSA developed ones...)]( . 99% of router manufactures aint writing their own network stacks / firewalls / OS etc that's for sure!

I agree, transactions paying fees are not spam, people *should* use Segwit, but it's their choice to choose this scaling solution (block size increases can't 'not' be used like segwit), if the Bitcoin network can't keep up with fee-paying transactions, caused by a single large business, then it's the Bitcoin networks problem at the core.

Transacting nodes = any nodes that handle transactions. I don't transact Bitcoin myself, I have a small amount I mined a long time ago, and am not planning on sending it anywhere.
In this case of transacting nodes, the more tx they handle the more power they have in deciding the consensus of what chain is Bitcoin, so I say exchange and merchant because they have more power than the small number of single user wallet full nodes.
I agree, if you are transacting Bitcoin, the best way is to run a full node, most users will not, they will run SPV, or probably even through third party like block chain, or never take them out of an exchange. 
In my case, I am only talking about running a non-transacting non-mining node, sorry if that was not clear. I believe many people run similar nodes thinking that they are helping to secure the network.

Well I disagree, it took 6 years to go from 0 to 500KB and another 2 years to go from 500KB hitting the 1MB cap, so 2MB should last at least another year, 4MB a few, regardless, the extra space that a block size increase yields will not be filled instantly, and fees will drop dramatically. 


Of course they do, they scale linearly! I'm not saying they scale to what is required in future, I'm not debating scaling as a solution, I never said long term, or shitcoin or anything else, all I said 


I agree, of course, once blocks fill up again and network load increases, fees go back up, that is obvious. Solely saying that a block increase that allows 2x the transactions, drops the fees by a factor of far more that that.

Right now yes, but block size must increase at some point on BTC, and will continuously increase on BCH. If all transactions are on chain like BCH fees remain low relying on large tx volume. On BTC fees will be larger on chain, but that will just be for opening LN channels, then the tx for a coffee can be fractions of a cent. Both aptoaches continue to pay miners for there service (to be seen what one results in the best network), they just ballance the formula
 - Miners reward = average fee x number of transaction per block

Bitcoin Cash is irrelevant to this conversation. Lightning Network is coming, and if it works, will be 100x better than any on chain scaling, of course. 
Regardless, we can have Bitcoin that stops working, where people (rightly) complain about $5 fees, where you grandma calls Bitcoin a failure because the media is talking about the high fees, where the market cap is cut almost in half.
Or we can have a Bitcoin that scales using the currently available technologies, and keeps it as a low fee functioning system, all the way up past LN. 
If you think the [nodes that matter]( can't run 8MB blocks (not that we even need 8MB blocks today to keep Bitcoin working the way it was intended) you're dreaming. 


@_date: 2017-12-22 11:52:12
Bitcoin is a flat fee per transaction, currently around $40US. So 80% if you transfer $50, but 0.8% on 5K
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:32:19
Miners want it, users want it, merchants will stop using Bitcoin without it, exchanges don't seem to much care.
We do not have a blocksize increase, because segwit requires 'opt-in', it's not a blocksize increase in the way a straight up blocksize increase is, where you can't not use it. Segwit is currently a total failure, if $40 fees have not pushed people into using it, then people either don't know how to use it, or cannot use it because the service they use do not, regardless, segwit as a means to increase transaction volume hasn't worked.
The entire problem *could* be solved if everyone moved overnight to segwit, it could also be solved by people no moving coins around so much, but it seems neither of these things will happen. 
Why go through the hassle of a hard fork? Because it will make Bitcoin usable again, up and through LN.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:03:47
The routing problem is unsolved, it seems the system may tend towards centralized hubs (check out how it looks at small scale already on the test net), it has to be able to cope with DOS and other known and unknown attacks, it is far more onerous on users as they have to stay online to check that their peers are acting in the appropriate way (possibly leading to third parties being left in control of their accounts to stop theft). There are myriad known and unknown problems that LN has to overcome before it "comes", and to say unequivocally "Lighting is coming" (implying it will be here soon and work as a trustless p2p decentralized system) is ignorant.

Faster blocks vs larger blocks has basically the same effect on tx volume and fees. Anyone is free to broadcast transactions, but to force thr average fee up, it costs real money. The larger the blocks the faster you'll go broke trying to do that.

The people complaining do not have control over % Segwit adoption. No-one could complain if that segwit block size increase was done with a straight up blocksize increase, because you can't "not use" larger blocks.

I have done the math, and on chain scaling seems to be right on the edge of being doable without centralizing assuming 18mo doubling in hardware. More doable with better hardware, and more decentralized with less. For the fees, the calculations are the same for BTC, even worse with LN, because less on chain transactions have to make up the same block reward
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:31:26
Very true. Still don't see how either way is a fail.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:06:50
Yes, you need to limit block size, because without some sort of dynamic minimum fee, if blocks are always empty, fees are irrelevant and miners don't get paid and the system falls apart (as block rewards fall away)
Question; 
does that limit need to be 1MB currently for the fee market to work?
if not, then what is the acceptable lower limit on block size currently where the fee market does still work
bonus question, does this lower limit change as the network grows and tx count increases
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:48:16
It is not, BCH and BTC both have scaling solutions that are unproven to work at scale, and have different risks of centralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:42:30
Mempool handling is not part of the consensus rules, so miners can drop transaction in 1 day or hold them for 5 months, or re-broadcast them forever, whatever they want.
I would assume most nodes run software that isn't changed from the default 14 days, but I also assume they can get dropped much faster when the mempool is getting really full.

@_date: 2017-12-25 15:17:04
I have to go, so just quick reply before I do.
It wasn't 'cherry picked', I chose the largest block, with the most transactions.




Now it seems *you* are cherry picking blocks that suit you! :D These full blocks you list have low tx count because they are unusual, they are full with 100 input 1 output transactions, it's also the reason they are the biggest blocks, they are not representative. 
If you look at the [top 20 blocks mined]( on BCH with the most tx, you get slightly *more* capacity than my original quoted 479469 block. (average 41416 per block, 5.9Million per day)
I will say that I am choosing the top blocks on purpose, because low tx count blocks are also not representative of future block as overhead distorts the picture of real future blocks.
I do not know how to find the average tx per KB on BCH blocks, if you do, please reply with it here, and we can re do it with that number. It will most certainly be closer to my block 479469 than your three listed blocks, the top 20 come out at 202 bytes per tx, very reasonable.
Talking on Nielsens Law and Moores' law relating to my post are all done assuming that the current hardware / network requirements are maxing out what is currently available ... absolutely worst case scenario ... and that is not true, my core node, running on a $40 Atom based PC, is on a 1GB fibre connection today, it costs me $80 a month, that I pay anyway. I don't think scaling up from current bandwidth requirements is a stretch at all, especially with improvements in protocols that will come in the next 17 years.
I also disagree re bandwidth. In an optimal system, with the 48611111 tx per block @ say 220bytes per tx, that's 10.6GB * 2 = ~20GB per 10 minutes = 33Mbps, 1/30th of my connection *today*. CPU is a much more meaningful bottleneck IMO


yes $107, but for 37814 transactions, 0.28 of 1cent per. Of course the system wont move from block reward to fee supported if the transaction count doesn't go up, that is the same for any coin.
Now, using my "super cherry picked" block that is low compared to the average of the top 20, and extrapolating, that is the 48611111 tx per block * 0.28 of 1cent = **$137551**
That's **36 times** the $ reward of that same block today, and doesn't take into account any price increase of BCH, that means you could run even lower fees than the 0.01 USD per KB in that block.
(Bitcoin has had zero trouble going from 50 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block, with fees no where near making up the difference, while keeping orders of magnitude more miners profitable due to price increases) 
I am very tired, there could be errors above, feel free to point them out, but don't falsely accuse me of cherry picking data, and then pick the most non representative data available to rebut me with!

What is your definition of 'significant degree', because [blocks can scale]( In fact the *only* logical debate around block scaling at the moment with 1MB blocks is how fast it can and should be done.
Blocks are small now, I would argue too small when there are hundreds of thousands of transactions being held up, but that is subjective. We need [~133MB blocks for 7bn people to do 2tx/day on lightning]( that is not subjective and, IMO, there should be plans to start scaling towards that now.
While the block chain [can]( and will scale, I believe the lightning network can be better that purely on chain scaling, and I hope it achieves that, while staying decentralized and p2p, that aspect of it is unproven though, and until it is, the potential for [centralization]( and [intermediary power structures]( cannot be ruled out.

It is your fault if you choose to use them. My analysis was regarding estimation of *standard* future large transactions count blocks, the ones you choose are very non standard, and they are full for the very reason they are non Representative, and make your entire rebuttal immaterial. 




what errors?


I didn't, and as I said, the top 20 blocks have even more average tx count than the one I choose in the OP


Irrleevant, as I have said multiple times, they are big for the same reason they irrelevant, because they are rare, strange, and full of huge transactions. 


Again irrelevant, this was for *worst case scenaro*, it doesn't matter in real that Nielsen's Law is 10% less than Moores' Law, because the current state isn't maxed out, and we are looking ~20 years into the future, it could be 100% less or 100% more growth, this is a very uncertain guess, because it's the best we can do. And my conclusion is equally as uncertain.






Inconsistent? I think not.

Total nonsense. Move to 8MB blocks right now, and fees would be sensible again tomorrow. The price however would be fucked because Bitcoins rep has been damaged by this, that a shit load of people would use working transactions to get their coins to an exchange and cash out.even faster than they are able to currently.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:42:42
Yeah, I should have said it becomes far more risky when the mempool never clears and varies in size so much. You have to come up with some level for tx fee that you think will make it into the blockchain, predicting future movement of the mempool. 
so we are back to
    $0.26 lemonade
    $5 fees
...or $1 fees, or $100 fees
0 conf is absolutely 'acceptable' at any scale, it's just a risk, one that becomes much harder to estimate when mempool can increase wildly.

The hard facts here are hard to decipher, you can *only* assume, because you cannot look into other miners mempools. 
The first part is not assumption, the mempool is not consensus bound, and nodes can do what they want with transactions. The second part is my assumption, that unconfirmed transactions can last shorter or longer than 14 days, depending on the node.

Also thinking about it now, the block reward doesn't nessesarly have to remain constant, eg, you don't need to keep the miners getting 12.5 BTC per block. If price goes up, miners can be paid the same with less overall coin. I mean BTC has gone from full 50 BTC per block back in the day, to 12.5 now, with fees nowhere near making up the difference. Total BTC per block has dropped, and miners are still profitable!

There hasn't really, there has been segwit, and it's not being used. Show me studies looking at the relation between block size and decentralization. If all large blocks are bad, then why not 200k blocks? Is it 1Mb + segwit a magical number that stops centralization? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:36
Of course not, irrelevant straw man. There is nothing currently existing that would stop such an attack. And if you had billions of dollars to destroy bitcoin, you would have better ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:24:31
OK, I'll explain it.
As a node, you receive new transactions that want to go into a block, and you relay them on, they are whatever say 300 bytes. This consumes a lot of bandwidth, but comes in steadily. 
Now one miner on the network 'finds a block', and decides on the transactions he wants to include, these transactions take up the vast majority of the block size. He makes the block and sends it out to the network to get his juicy juicy block reward.
 
The thing is, if he sends the whole block, he is basically sending a list of transactions, and all of the miners have 99% of this data in their mempool already, so instead, he uses some fancy math and sends just a list of what specific transactions he decided to include in his block.
As the other miners he is sending the block too already have 99% of those transactions, he only has to send a tiny amount of data, and a probably a few missing transactions that the other miners may not already have, and those miners can re-create the full block on their end. This reduces bandwidth needs, and greatly helps block propagation time.
Also propagation time has nothing to do with how long your transaction takes to confirm. Propagation time is *max* in the seconds range, where as block time is ~10 minutes, and you usually have to wait for 3-6 of them = ~thirty minutes - hour to "fully" confirm.

Quote me the white paper where it has "a greater end goal of simply becoming a global decentralized currency system", also the technology of Bitcoin has nothing to do with "devaluation in fiat currencies", Bitcoin works as electronic cash regardless of what it or fiat is worth. 


The white paper talks nothing about what you are implying, you are imposing your own values on what *you* want Bitcoin to be and achieve. I am talking about the tech only, "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". Maybe I am imposing my own values too, but I think I would be with most people in assuming to be workable as a p2p cash system, fees need to be below a certain level (that compete with or beat other payment systems)
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:05:06
So your saying end users should run full nodes? Because, yes OK, I agree, that is a good thing, that helps (not much, depends on the size of their transacting) but also kind of moot, because expecting average users to run full nodes just to use their wallet is  a bit demanding, even with the current relatively small size of the block chain.
IMO end users don't need to. As long as merchants, exchanges, enthusiasts, solo miners, Jochen Hoenicke etc are able to run full nodes themselves, without just SPVing into somewhere else, we are good.

Deleted comment before I could reply ...


Without Segwit Adoption , larger blocks, LN etc and with increasing adoption, it absolutely will go to 1m 2m etc, and low fee tx *already* never get confirmed.
It hasn't been below 80k since around Dec 7th, it hasn't been under 20k in over a month. 
Looking at Nov 10th when difficulty *decreased* ~6% and tx count still went up sharply from around 34k to 170k in the following 3 days shows that small changes in difficulty pale in comparison to people actually doing tx for other reasons
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:47:19
I don't edit my posts to correct myself, that's a douche move, if I'm wrong I'm wrong. I didn't realize BCH plan was to keep empty blocks. 


It's all a balancing act, it's still transactions * average fee, it's just few tx with really high fee vs many with small fee. BCH does not need to replace 12.5 BCH in fees now, it needs to replace 6.25, then another 3.125 etc. 250MB blocks by that time is totally doable. 


The difference is, if Bitcoin stayed at 1MB while BCH was at 250MB under the same tx load, nobody could afford to use Bitcoin. 


They are, it's # of tx * average fee, it's the same, no matter if you have pressure to drive a fee market or not.
I don't know why I'm arguing for Bitcoin Cash's plan anyway, it it is never full blocks, it's silly, and in future it'll no doubt just change to a minimum fee / slightly over-full blocks or something similar before hash rate drops too significantly. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:41:58
Yes, so exchanges need to run full nodes, merchants need to run full nodes. These nodes matter because they make the chain they use have value. Non mining nodes that are not used for transactions have no effect for consensus. 
Say there are the current set of nodes that exist today, and also 100 million new non mining non transacting nodes I spin up on AWS 
If all the current mining and exchange nodes decide to hard fork to introduce new feature 'x'. What do the 100 million non mining nodes do to enforce their now different consensus rules? Nothing.
If all the mining nodes fork to introduce new feature 'x', but all the merchant and exchange nodes do not, then those miners are mining a new coin that has a new, probably much lower value
How about if those 100 million new nodes decide to change their consensus rules? Then they are on a worthless, 0 hash power fork. 


They can't assign value, because they don't deal with value, either in terms of transactions, or hashing power.
I run a node, because it helps the network stay healthy, in terms of relaying transactions, and adding bandwidth etc, but my non mining, non transacting node does nothing to enforce consensus.

Seeing as you haven't and I'm bored, I did look into this. There have been 31588 blocks mined currently since the Bitcoin cash fork. Across all these blocks, the average kb / tx of total block size is: 
*Average: 825 bytes 
*Median: 436 bytes
comparing this 825 byte average to the block I used in my calculations, this is about 3.9 times larger. It's about *40 times smaller* than the average of the three you chose after accusing *me* of cherry picking. 
If I re do my calculations with this, then very quickly, it is:
9696 tx per 8MB block, 1.15GB per day, 420GB per year.
7 billion tx per day = 48611111 tx per block, that is ~~1285~~ 5013 times a 8MB block or roughly ~~10GB~~ 40GB per block.
With Moore's Law 18mo etc etc, it would take 12.3 doublings, 18.45 years = half way through 2035, about a year after the 7bn tx/day in 2034 I guessed at.
Again, these are all *ball park figures* and are based on  *the worst possible case* for starting hardware.

Bitcoin cash's long term plan (AFAIK) is to scale 100% on chain. Core is to introduce LN or other 2nd layer. Scale blocks now, not  to do everything on chain in the future, only to keep bitcoin working now, until 2nd layer stuff arrives. (2nd layer stuff requires larger than 1MB blocks anyway)

Sure, but your stopping transactions that cost under 5sat/B and it's cheap. Try stop transactions under 900sat/B and your gonna need really deep pcokets. You can push fees up, the higher you push them, and the larger the blocks, the more it'll.cost you
Total fees are currently around 150kUSD every 10 minutes. What percentage of that are you going to pay every 10 minutes to push them higher?
In an 8MB block, you going to need to put in 4 times as many tx as a 2Mb for the same effect, and it's going to cost you 4x the $
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:04:47

if it outpaces the increases technology improvement brings, yes I agree, it will have a certain risk.


Yet here you are in a thread doing just that :D


The more I think about it, the more I think there can't be "spam" in Bitcoin transactions. If you can't distinguish a "spam" transaction from a "vaild" one, then there is no difference. If your paying a fee then your tx is not spam, it is just a transaction. If you are sending it to disrupt the network, and it does, then IMO that is a problem with the incentives in the network. 


Nothing to be gained from blocksize increase is silly, it's undeniable fact that blocksize increases, Segwit, or things that reduce tx size benefit network transactions. The risk / benefit is what can be discussed, and more interestingly, compared with the risk / benefit for 2nd layer tech.


Totally agree
Back to the OP, 2MB blocks would result in near zero loss of nodes. Big blocks are not 'evil', and auviewer's post is only true if blocksize increase far out paces the cost of technology.

Peter Rizun; I try not to get involved in any of the politics, I'm more interested in the tech. Is there anything technical amiss with his talk on his GB network?
Yes, I run a full node, have done on and off since 2011, and currently, circumstances are that my node is running on an Intel Atom N280, so not too much headroom there! I also understand as Bitcoin develops, an atom CPU will no longer cut it running a node, and as long as it's still reasonable hardware requirements and not a $20k server I will continue to run one.
I agree with your whole post, lets optimize the block space we have already, block sizes need to be controlled to keeps fees high enough to maintain hash rate etc. I still feel like (and sure I read a study saying) small block size increases would not cause (notable, it will always cause some) centralization, or burden running a node, and I feel like since the BCH fork, any increase is dismissed out of hand, just because otherwise you sound sympathetic to the "BCH everything on chain, 'other team'"


I'm not so sure about that, I believe a lot of people a, can't use segwit because whoever has control of their coins do not let them and b, because they don't even understand what segwit is, just that their fee is high.
Anyway, I enjoy shouting at plebs on here, and you seem to a not be an pleb, and b far too composed in your replies

OK, you ability to just write 20 different thing without thinking about them as you do.. we will go one thing at a time. 


The reason I chose full blocks is to attempt to get an accurate estimate of average transaction size for future blocks because the assumption of all of this is that tx count will go up. My OP I chose 1 specific block, in follow up posts I showed that the top 20 high transaction blocks are similar. 
You are free to choose whatever blocks you want to rebut me, but if you don't see how you choosing the 3 blocks that are full of non-standard 100 input 1 output transactions with an **average of ~ ~~3500~~ bytes per transaction** is not useful or representative, then there is no point continuing this discussion. 
Edit: 3500 bytes was actually only for one of the three blocks, the average of the three you looked at was **~33,000** bytes per transaction!
That's like me doing a study to find what gas mileage commuter vehicles will get if they all start driving long distances. So I choose a set of cars to get data from that drive the most miles currently.
Then you choose a subset of the "high mile car" group, three high mileage cars that also are loaded to their maximum carrying capacity with goods, and say "you only specified 'high mileage cars, look at how terrible these threes fuel mileage is'"
I have said it twice now, I do not know where to get this data, so I must estimate, if you want too then **go find the actual median tx size for BCH blocks**
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:19:40
It costs on-chain fees to set up a channel, and requires you to load BTC into that channel. Why would you set up (multiple) channels with peers who may go offline, may not have the required liquidity, may charge high fees, when you could just set up one channel to a very well connected, rich, always up peer, who charges you less fees because they sell your purchasing habit data? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:35


You can argue this for the long term future of Bitcoin, and you could have very well infromed debate about the speed and efficacy of this aproach. You can't however IMO, argue this for the short term, block size increases now would make a large effect on how well Bitcoin works 
Bandwidth is practically the same for large or small blocks with compact blocks, graphene etc, because your bandwidth is in receiving and sending transactions to and from the nodes mempools. 
I'm not promoting block increases as a long term scaling strategy, but as a way to keep Bitcoin actually working, until 2nd layer tech arrives.

You are correct, the corresponding one for disk drive storage is Kryder's law, but that's not very accurate AFIAK. 
Over the past 50 years, the areal density of mass-storage media has increased by seven orders of magnitude, from about 105 bits per square inch to about 1012. That works out to about seven years for a tenfold increase, on average. If that rate is an accurate predictor of future growth, we can expect to go from a PC that today can store and process 1MB blocks (like that super expensive $200 PC from ebay) to one that store and process 1GB blocks in around **21 years ....**
answer, Irrelevant. Storage will very likely keep increasing at *some* rate and we will be able to store and process 1GB blocks on a $200 ebay machine 


If scaling is kept in line with the above storage (and CPU and bandwidth and memory etc) increases, then this is just not true. 
Now at what rate can we reasonably scale on chain while keeping the system decentralized, that is the question, big blocks being evil though, just dumb talk.

**At least 55% of addresses are currently unspendable.**
* Average fee is 0.001537 BTC
* 54.82% of BTC addresses have 0.001 BTC or less
* Another 19.84% of BTC addresses have between 0.01 and 0.001 BTC. Assuming an even distribution within this bucket, that would make the total percentage of unspendable addresses at 64.5%.
* It's likely that the distribution is weighted more heavily at the lower end, meaning that a more realistic estimate would be around 70%

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:36:29


It doesn't. 
Um, maybe I can explain it through an analogy, it wont be 100% accurate because I'm not going to try and explain invertible bloom lookup tables, and the other fancy stuff that actually makes this work, but it'll give a general idea. I'll just assume transactions are sorted:
Imagine all nodes are people with a phone.
Anyone in the world who wants to send a transaction, calls up any one of these node people, and says "I want to send x BTC to person y"
The node person writes down this transaction in their "mempool" notebook, sorted by name, hangs up and then this node person calls other node people to tell them of this transaction, they write it down in their notebooks, and do the same. In this way, all of the node-people have a notebook with a list of transactions waiting to go into a block, sorted by name.
Phone calls in this analogy are bandwidth. So far, block size has not come into the equation, the amount of phone calls is the same, regardless of the any block size, it is proportional to the number of people who have called up to "place" transactions.
OK, so now it's time to make a block, and put a bunch of transactions in it. One node person wins the right to make the block. now say the block can hold 10 transactions, she takes the first 10 from his list, and wraps them up in a block.
Now to propagate the block, she calls another node-person, and says "I just made a block, it has the first 10 transactions in it", this takes *one short* phone call. She doesn't have to call up, and make a really long phone call where she lists all the transactions, she just says "use the first 10"
Now imagine the block size is 100 times larger and can hold 1000tx. Same thing, she calls up, and says "I just made a block, it has the first 1000 transactions in it", this again only takes *one short* phone call, and all the other node people can recreate the block on their end by getting the first 1000 transactions from the notebook they already have.
**The bandwidth required to tell the other nodes about a small block with 10 transactions is basically the same as the bandwidth required to tell the other nodes about a large block with 1000 transactions in it.**
If, after a node person creates a block, he had to call up another node person, and say "I just made a block, it has these transactions; number 1: x coins from Bob to Carol, number 2: x coins from..." then this would use a lot of bandwidth, and waste a lot of time, because the other node person he is calling already has 99% of this information
I hope that helps.

It didn't really grow too fast, it grew, and the tech stayed still. Well not 100% true, Bitcoin tech introduced Segwit, that enables ~2MB blocks, but uptake on that isn't going well. 
Lightning Network doesn't look good, it looks great... *if* it delivers what it promises. 
In the early days of the internet, there were many new protocols for all sorts of novel new ideas. The ones that *worked* moved forward, and the ones that didn't were left behind, you are not talking to me using Gopher. 
Bitcoin, now, is not working, and without LN soon (or just larger block sizes in the interim, something that needs to happen anyway) it too IMO will be left behind.

What one? I linked a few links
I fully agree we should optimize the blocks rather than increasing them. I appreciate your well put together reply, not like a lot on here, I am too tired to give you such a post back, I will just say: 




I still disagree, they can and will scale, and time frame is the only factor limiting what scale they can achieve. Will they scale fast enough to compete with what 2nd layer stuff can do? no of course not, but they are required to scale, and we are at a point today, and in the foreseeable near future, where transactions might cost someone tens of dollars, that is more than "can't pay for coffee" or "Steam stops using bitcoin" level, that's "I might as well use Western Union to send this $1000" level.
What happens if LN network has issues, if we don't have workable 2nd layer scaling solutions for the next 3 years?
Basically; blocks must increase sometime, the network atm doesn't work for what it was designed for, it's only hurting users and the reputation of Bitcoin, and allowing the waters to be muddied by BCH, I don't understand the huge reluctance to implementing some sensible block size increases (Apart from the danger of a hard fork, but again it needs to happen sometime) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:39:03
What do you mean 100 times faster confirmations? It's not excessive to think bitcoin will scale to any level, but we won't have to worry about 300+ billion transaction levels for a long time yet. 1TB block level tx capacity is orders of magnitude more than any payment system that has ever existed, even cash itself.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:55

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:10:15
Nope, the test LN is on the testnet. Also, as is the idea with LN, it only requires two on chin tx to do a bunch of transactions, so it would probably reduce the mempool if anything. The mempool is full because blocks are too small for the transaction volume, and Segwit is not being used much.

I would say it's less dangerous, as it doesn't require a hard fork, I don't think it's 'easier' and not any less expensive for a full verifying node.
Hard forking to larger blocks has to happen sometime, and with segwit hovering around 10%, either people don't know that the can / how to use it, arn't in control of the way their coins are transacted (exchanges online wallets), or don't mind $10 fees ... I'm not going to guess the last one

You could buy a coffee, or a pizza, with Bitcoin 2 years ago with fees that would beat other payment methods. Bitcoin has been purposefully stopped from doing that today. Line 1 of the white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" it doesn't say "only for large transactions now, small transactions will be available sometime int the future" 
The argument is not that is needs to be able to today or next year, it's that it has literately gone backwards in usability, with only the promise of unproven tech to take us back past where we were. If Bitcoin Core had more segwith adoption or larger blocks, then BCH wouldn't have any legs, but as it stands, they do, and the longer LN isn't here and working, the stronger those legs are going to get.

Sure if you increase the block size to 1GB *toady* only the very well off will be able to keep a copy. Nobody sane is saying we should have such large blocks today. 
Moore's Law doubles capacity every 18 months, this means the PC that today can store and process 1MB blocks (like a super expensive $200 PC from ebay) will be able to store and process 1GB blocks in 15 Years.

If we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one user will make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited, and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to participate in the network with the larger blocks. 
While it may appear as though this system will mitigate the block size increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a block size increase in the long term.

The real question is, why 300kb? There needs to be super solid grounding in data to say that 300kb is actually the 'safe level', as far as I have heard, it's just because "at some point there were more nodes running 'per user', and we need that same amount of nodes"
Also the number 17.7% growth rate, it just keeps being used as a number with no founding, I see "The growth rate of 17.7% growth per year is consistent with the average growth rate of bandwidth the last years", yeah \[citation needed\]
Even then, in 1 week it will be a year since Luke proposed 337 kB blocks, that should be increased by at '17.7%' twice now too right, meaning 466kb blocks? Why are we ignoring two years of bandwidth and hardware growth? Sounds [dogmatic]( rather than scientific to me.
Node count has only been increasing since 2016, even more so I would think now with LN, but even then total node count is a fuzzy number, as a full Bitcoin node that isn't being used for something (transacting, mining, LN settlement etc) does nothing useful for the network.
Smaller block size does little to directly reduce bandwidth. The vast majority of bandwidth (over 90%) is used for propagating transactions between mempools. The only way to limit the number of transactions being submitted to the network, and therefore actually reducing node bandwidth, is for fees to increase, to purposefully limit adoption.
IMO 300kb is madness. LN is still young, remember a year ago and $50 fees? Yeah, that's how you get $50 fees again. Also another contentious fork is good for no-one (Well maybe to purge those who are nuts-jobs, SV sure is making strides /s)
TL;DR, the number; 300kb, 17.7% growth, number of users, number of nodes, required number of nodes etc all need to be based on solid facts and scientific method before you can come to any conclusion on what Blocksizes are good or dangerous. All the facts I see, point to current block size being fine (and unconditionally needing to increase in future)
EDIT: Re 466KB blocks; Looking at the BIP, it does in fact take this into account:


So I fully support this 'blocksize increasing' plan (maybe with a number more than 17.7%, depending on supporting hard data) but only sometime after 2024

U serious? Each public key has a balance, it's called the UTXO set. Each public key, as the name implies, uses encryption, to secure that balance.
If I get your password, your private key, I can steal the balance of your public key. All of this is stored 'on the cloud' in a publicly accessible-to-anyone blockchain. What protects you (apart from you having to secure your keys well) is the size of the Bitcoin keys.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:30:08

I think it would be much more secure than trusting the chain of things that need to be secure to trust a json file from a website, right? DNS, hosting, man in the middle, SSL certs etc.


Yeah, that's what I was thinking, there is a fixed address that contains enough funds to do a number of transactions based on how may update notices are likely required. It sends the whole balance back to its own address and includes some OP\_RETURN data showing new version number, maybe severity level etc.


It'll be 272 bytes with full 80 bytes of OP\_RETURN used (I think?). Not very block chain bloaty anyway :P

That is ... plenty, like 500,000x more than amazon S3. So miners take out that 1/500000th to pay for storage costs, hell, even without including costs getting cheaper, take out 100/500000 to pre fund 100 years of storage, and spend the rest on hashing.

You can't bring it up by 0.1% a day for weeks and not be obviously doing it unless you do it across all nodes. Doesn’t matter if you ramp it slowly, or jump to 50% transactions, it'll be the attackers node(s) only showing that difference.

Unused full mining nodes do nothing for the network. If you are running a full node that is not mining, you are running it for some use, to provide a back end for your business, to relay your own transactions, to run an exchange, to run a block explorer etc. These nodes accept (the still incredibly small) cost of this data because they are getting a use from their node.

@_date: 2019-02-13 03:06:53
Because I'm working with dollars. Miners are paid $10m per day. Difficulty tells you how many mining rigs can be profitable at a certain difficulty, price and hardware hash rate.
$10 million per day at 12.5 BTC per block is a price of $5555 per coin, in three more halving at 1.56 BTC per block it would be $44k per coin. Difficulty is irrelevant to the price on chain fees need to be as it's the $ amount spent on the network that makes it secure, not the actual hash/second or difficulty, both will inevitably change and increase drastically as hardware improves.
It may be that $10m is not enough, (or even more than needed). Simple to figure out the fees if changing mining revenue.

Why do I need a global mempool? All I need is my node running and it's mempool to see the noise. Obviously as the noise increases, it's harder to tease out the interesting bits. Say in an ideal situation, I always have every tx in every block I receive, it would be trivial to see people adding non-broadcast transactions.
If my node has 95% of all transactions for new blocks transmitted, I can quite easily see any rises from nodes putting more than 5% non-boradcast transactions into their blocks, etc.
It all depends on where that number lies, and even in that data from 2016 it was only at what looks to be around half a percent.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:41:19
Seems like a double edged sword, 2016 blocks helps prevent from short hash rate attack, but you could potentially recover from it (today, not having a super computer powerful enough I mean). where as you could kill a network if the attack is over a two week period, or just a bunch of hashing power leaves, and then you have 2016 more super hard blocks to solve. 
Seems like long retarget time makes sense in the beginning, but a shorter one makes more sense today? It would at least help with the crazy hash rate changing game miners play these days.

Yes, with a global mempool you can be sure, with you own mempool you have to use statistics to show with a certain confidence that it is happening.


If the noise level is 0.5%, then what is the point? It's not effective, and certainly not responsible for any of these big mempool backlogs.
You don't even need to be this fancy to prove it's not *just* miners mining blocks of their own transactions. Just log the rate at which your mempool is accepting new transactions vs committing backed up ones to blocks. That will have nothing to do with miners mining non-broadcast transactions.

Miners earn \~6Million USD per day today (peaked at 60 million when coin price was 20k). Say that needs to be 10 million to keep the network secure, and everyone (on earth) opening and closing a channel on-chain once per month. 
10 million per day is 300 million per month needed for miners.
300M / ( 7 billion \* 2) = 2 cents per channel / 24 cents per year in fees to open / close channels.
Not expensive at scale (blocks would have to be far larger) 
At smaller scale it becomes more expensive, eg with 'only' 10 million people opening one channel per month, the fee would be $15 per month. 
Block reward is dropping, on chain or off, adoption has to grow to meet the demand and keep the network secure.

Devils advocate: 
Those who will become the powerful, most used hubs will be the ones who have the largest BTC reserves, enabling them to be reliable (not running out of reserve to make transactions), and their on chain fees will be a smaller % of their costs due to larger LN transaction volumes. 
They will have the most up time, meaning they have the money to run on the best platforms and invest in DDOS protection and general security. 
And most importantly, will have the lowest fees, because they can subsidize them with other value propositions, tracking, user metrics, and eventually accounts.

The analogy is apt, Testla can put a 200kWh in the Roadster today, and block sizes can be much larger than 1MB today.


The 'technology' of larger block sizes currently exist, it *absolutely* make it more useful, and is the *exact* original point of the technology.
I was worried, am still am, about overly large block size increases putting centralization pressure on Bitcoin, but the more I read into the actual work being done, and the real hardware costs required, the more I am starting to believe that on-chain scaling can be progressed a lot faster than I originally thought. Currently proposed 2nd layer tech *requires* larger blocks anyway, the only downside to a small, increasing, blockisze limit today is the risks of a hard fork. I would suggest everyone gives equal time to investigating the upsides and downsides of all scaling proposals, and comes to their own conclusions though.

Fee's were not just because of raw tx volume. The block size has been increased via segwit (and segwit adoption). The blocksize is being used more efficiently with batching. Basically the on-chain network throughput limit has been increased, so the same volume of tx are not hitting the upper bounds as they did in 2018, because the upper bounds are higher. If they increase enough to hit the new upper bound level, fees will increase again.

Ok guy, I'm not look for reasons why lightning can't work, I'm looking for reassurance it will. I don't think they have to use a fraudulent signature(?), they just have to commit an old version of the channel state right? The thing I seemed to have missed is that if one does, as you said, the breach remedy transaction gives the *whole* balance of the channel to them, I had incorrectly assumed they only got their original part of the funding transaction. So you *do* still have to be online, but the penalties for such fraudulent activity will definitely stop all but a tiny fraction.

Increased blocksize is *required* for Bitcoin Core, Lightning network will not work without larger blocks. 
Bitcoin tx can scale linearly with block size.
It's not a slippery slope if the increases are defined in the fork, has to be done at some point
If you prefer 2nd layer, or on chain, it doesn't matter, core blocksize has to increase sometime, I do not know why there has been such a delay in doing it.
 
EDIT: 'hard fork shit storm' is the only real reason I have heard, but again, needs to be done some time.

@_date: 2017-11-14 11:25:40


I think difficulty must be taken into account. Two coins with the same difficulty, but one with 1% of the price will not get 1% of the miners as I see it
10 people mining coin worth $100 will get 1/10th of $100 = $10 each every 10 minutes
1 person mining coin worth $10, *but the same difficulty*, will get the whole $10, but will only find a block every 100 minutes
Why would that 1 person sit there getting 1/10th of the value? (Some people will not switch, because they believe in actual tech values, but it seems miners are pretty profit driven generally) 
Once the difficulty re adjusts, things will even back out, and the 1 person mining the $10 coin will get the whole $10 block every 10 minutes too. but with such a long, 2016 block re-target interval, if a chain gets stuck there, for many weeks ... well, yeah, it seems bad. 


In my example above, it will get high, but I don't think it can get higher than the BTC difficulty, as 90% of the total hash power could never create a higher difficulty than the 100% that caused the difficulty jump on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:04:07
I'm thinking, and I could be wrong; for the sake of argument say, 100% of the hash power is on bitcoin, and the difficulty jumps to 'x', 90% hash power goes to BCH, and the price gets pumped up to above BTC price. The BCH difficulty, while it reacts faster with DAA, will still never go above 'x' difficulty because it has 90% of the hashpower that causes BTC to jump to 'x'. ∴BTC with a lower price, and higher difficulty will never be more profatable to mine, until the difficulty re-targets, and if that's months, that sounds like a problem.

There is value in how many people support your specific coin. A bitcoin copy is not worth anything if you cannot buy sell or otherwise transact it.
There is value in the mining power and consensus that is backing your coin. A bitcoin copy with few low hash rate nodes could easily be messed with if large miners wanted to.
You could make copies of USD notes, without the backing, they are worthless.
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:33:20
Of course. Now how about if its just one block, afterwards everything returns to baseline. Then a few more blocks the same node once again sends through a block that you have seen only 50% of the transactions in it, and this continues, you get many blocks repeating the same pattern.

Yep, password strength is ~~a~~ the problem here. I store all my passwords in a password vault, that is duplicated on the cloud in a few places. My password for the vault has far more than 40.5 bits of entropy, as do all the passwords it contains. There is no problem with me storing it on the cloud, in fact it's a large bonus.
Use fingerprint, use fingerprint + password, enforce minimum password strength requirements, all would solve the one issue here.

You wouldn't see the *miners spam transactions* in Johoe's mempool, of course general transactions would back up if miners are filling blocks with their own transactions, yes.
It would be trivial to for other nodes to detect such an attack though, so they might as well mine empty blocks if they want to do such an attack to backup legitimate transactions, they would loose less money to orphans. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:16:43

In my example BCH would start at a much lower difficulty, but regardless, AFAIK, difficulty is directly correlated with hash rate. It would be impossible for 90% of the hashrate to push BCH difficulty higher than what 100% of the hashrate pushed bitcoin too. 


Isn't this exactly what happened a few days ago? I thought over 50% jumped to BCH, all be it temporary, because BCH price fell, and bitcoin difficulty readjusted. 
I do agree that the threshold would have to be fairly large, maybe unrealisticly so, on the % hash power side, but it depends on the $ value as well, and it seems to me, that can still be F'ed with pretty easily by large players.
Basically I don't want to see any coins messed with based on the cash rich and mining power rich few, rather than on their technical merits. I guess we'll see what happens in another 1610 Blocks

You are comparing second layer options to the base layer. 


Because the bank is a trusted third party holding funds for you. Nothing stopping a Bitcoin bank offering the same options (Also with the option of multisig so you still have control over your funds)


Paypal, credit cards etc are only able to refund you because they are paid to insure your funds against fraud. Nothing stopping you using (and paying for) a Bitcoin escrow


Because they are *paid for*


This is more complex. Mistyping a BTC address is virtually impossible. Sending money to a wrong bank account is not easily reversible AFAIK, unless it is because the funds are not actually sent when you send them.
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:38:36
Of course, but that is missing the point. Transactions first get sent around between the nodes to fill all the nodes mempools, the transactions at this point are full size, maybe 400 bytes. This takes a lot of bandwidth, and this is not limited by block size, eg even if the blocks were 1kb, the Bitcoin network would still receive these transactions and have to move them around to fill everyones mempools.
Once a block is found, BIP152 means that the actual data needed to be sent to propagate a block is very small, someone can correct me, but I think it's like 10kb per 1MB block. This uses fancy bloom filters and what not (there are good videos explaining details), but you can conceptualize it by imagining each mempool is just a list of ordered transactions (already propagated around using lots of bandwidth), when a block is found, instead of sending all the raw transaction information, the node just says "I have a block with transactions on the list number 1500-3000". This is a tiny bit of information that the other nodes can then use to look at their own mempool list and recreate the block on their end without having to actually send the full 1MB block.
You can see this by running your node in blocksonly mode, where it only deals with full blocks and not unconfirmed mempool transactions, is will use far less data ([88% reduction]( , and that node is still pushing full blocks around as it can't make use of compact blocks, so for full nodes, actual block propagation would be in single digits % of total bandwidth used.
Say blocks were decreased to a size only able to store 10 transactions per block, but the network keeps receiving 4 transactions per second, total network bandwidth would be pretty much the same
Say blocks were increased to store 10,000 transactions per block, but the network keeps receiving 4 transactions per second, total network bandwidth would be the same

Yes different exchanges will have slightly different prices and fees. Every bitcoin must go through the blockchain to get to your wallet, so the on chain fee, average ~$15 atm must be paid regardless. (This may be different if you keep your coins on an exchange, as they dont need to move addresses, but this is risky, if you don't have your own wallet, and control your own the private keys, you don't have any guarantee that you wont loose them)
@_date: 2019-02-13 04:59:37


Of course not, I never said otherwise.

IMO, we will not, unless you are talking about 2nd and third layers in the "same coin".

First, make a backup, or two, or three of your wallet.dat in safe place(s)
You should download bitcoin-qt on your new laptop, yes you can set the data directory to be on another disk (it will ask you when you start it for the first time)
Leave it to sync the block chain, this will take a while, probably a few days depending on your hardware. And will also take, I think, about 160GB currently
Once it is up to date, shut it down, (never force close it!), and copy your wallet.dat over the one that the software generted.

A 'Physical Bitcoin' is just the private key. To trade it you have to trust that no one who has ever had it has changed or copied the private (or public) keys. Usually physical Bitcoins use some sort of anti-tampering included, you have to be willing to believe that the private key actually exists inside the coin (it by design should be impossible to tell without destroying the coin, relies on trust), and that it *only* exists in the one place (in the coin, eg it wasn't duplicated at the time of minting, relies on trust)

Bitcoin is trust less, lets you have 100% control of your funds, is openly accountable etc
Banks provide a service, insuring your money, protecting against fraud, theft etc, you can have such service that run using Bitcoin as well by giving up (some) of your control of funds, *if that's what you want / need* . You  can't do it the other way, you can't have 100% control of your bank balance, with the exception of withdrawing it all as cash (far less useful than Bitcoin)


If they provide a service you require, sure.


You are confusing Bitcoin being trustless with people you are dealing with being trustless. Bitcoin requires no trust in a third party that if you send money to an address it will be sent. Bitcoin of course does not ensure people are trustworthy, it has no power to ensure someone will send you what you purchased.




This is nothing to to with banks, this is the law stepping in to help. The law applies jst the same to a Bitcoin transaction, although it'll probably be a lot harder due to Bitcoins (pseudo)anonymous nature.


It's virtually impossible to mistype a valid BTC address.

The graph above shows the average fee hasn't been below $1.40 since May 2017, I assume the spamming is a more recent thing (at that scale anyway). With currently full 1MB blocks and no lightning etc, fees can only trend upwards (ignoring crazy $20 spikes)

If a country creates and backs a currency, then sure, if probably will have value, because it has a country backing it, there is trust (and probably a bunch of gold) there. If *you* create a new currency, be it a fork of Bitcoin or some notes you print out, will you be able to buy anything for it? Not unless it offers something that is better (or perceived better) that current money. (Or a bunch of gold, people will do all sorts of shit for a man with a big pile of gold)

I assume you can have the 'too big' blocks and no transactions will necessarily loose money, you'll just have less hash power in the system due to the smaller fees. You absolutely cannot have 'too small' blocks as payment channels failing to close means real $ lost, and non trust and failure of the system.
How about dealing with spam? at the moment, if someone spams the block chain, transactions are held up, but not reversed, with Lightning, spamming the blockchain will cause actual transactions to be lost if channels cannot close in time, and if you are trying to keep the blocksize as close to full as possible, that would make it easier. How do we deal with that? Some sort of dynamically sized blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:08:56
This is not how its working now, bigger blocks = allows more transactions, but with the same amount of transactions, there is no need to fight for block space, so fees stay low. small block size with more than ~7tx/s = huge fight for block space and massive fees. The fee ratio seems to have gone up much more than the tx ratio 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:06:25
On chain fees are in BTC, $ worth amounts do not matter, transaction numbers do. But yes, as on chain transaction numbers get more and more, without block size increases, fees will go up and up. IMO on chain will be for the big LN hubs primarily.

I agree, I am at the moment interested in looking at the tech, and understanding all sides. And your right, people don't care, and your average persons eyes will glaze over if you mention 2-of-2 multisignature transaction, this is the real issue, because average people will, aside from investing for the profits, choose a regular old bank over any crypto coin because they don't care and they just want it to be easy.  I don't care about now, I care about the future potential, and really just about understanding how it all works.

Fair call, I still think of all this in a very early stage, and we are talking about why Bitcoin should succeed with an example talking 10 years in the future. This is why I usually am talking about Bitcoin in the future. Bitcoin of today cannot succeed, it's slow to 100% confirm, it doesn't have the required scale, its hugely volatile, it's lawful status is largely undecided etc etc. I think it only makes sense to talk about what Bitcoin could be in future, rather than what it is right now.
So I still think the Bank -&gt; self controlled BTC is a bad comparison, but if we are comparing what is available *today*, then yes, you better not lose your seed.


They are not getting it for free, or I should say the individual may be getting it for free, but the credit card companies and Paypal get paid, and make a profit, to enable this fraud protection, it is not free. Maybe an individual is in the position where they do get it for free, and it is cheaper for them, but as CC/Paypal make profit from this, it is not the case overall for the average person.


Same answer, just because you personally don't see where the money comes from (or maybe in an individual case don't actually pay for) for these companies to profit from their services, they are paid for, and they do profit from them.


I don't know how this works in banks where you live. I would guess if they can easily reverse it it is simply because there is a delay in settlement, and they haven’t actually transferred the money yet. (You could just set your BTC wallet to wait 3 days before actually broadcasting transactions I guess!? haha) AFAIK if your bank deposit goes out to another bank because you mistyped the bank number, you'll have a bit of a rough time getting it back again. There is an advantage of banks usually knowing who their customers are though, compared to the anonymity BTC provides.

21000000 BTC / 0.00000001 = 2.1e+15 total Satoshi
2.1e+15 / 7 billion people = 300000 Satoshi per person
The average American has around $4400 in their bank account
$4400 / 300000 = 1.5 cents per Satoshi (and 1 Bitcoin would need to be worth $1.47 million)
But yes, Bitcoin is currently unable to function on such a large scale, it is not really even functioning in a usable way now for normal everyday type transactions
There will need to be changes to increase the number of transactions Bitcoin can handle, and to lower the fees

over the last weeks I have asked many questions of both 2nd layer supporters and large block supporters. I tend to get a lot of unconstructive "FUD" "Troll" replies, but those I get from people who actually engage the question, I seem to get solid evidence based replies more from the large block side, and I'm starting to change my mind. Maybe it is just the complexity of the 2nd layer networks vs straight up large blocks is harder to communicate. anyway, you do not fall into that category it seems, lets see.
Anyone can run a hub, but there are things that make hubs better, larger funds, higher uptime, more trustworthiness to stick to transactions. Even the LN devs talk about centralization of hubs, lower fees due to information gathering on users. How about if on chain fees become such a burden, that only hubs of a certin size can remain profitable?

Got any stats for that? I have found [this]( but it is old from 2016, looks to be average around or less than \~10 (for blocks at the time around 1600tx.) Letting the attack  increase mempool backup by \~half a percent.
Interestingly there are large outliers in that graph too, I wonder if they were randomly distributed or if they were specific nodes, maybe shenanigans were happening back then too, (Even if we take the outliers from that graph at \~100 tx, it would only be \~six percent)






Absolutely, and that is just by mining normal blocks. Someone who is 'spamming' the network, mining empty or full-of-their own transaction blocks is probably not doing it for raw profit today (12.5 BTC block reward) but for other reasons.

Yeah, I don't get it either, sure planned LN etc will take time, but LN will also require larger blocks, larger blocks will have to come to core sometime, so why not hard fork now to increase block size following Moore's law?

I mean, yeah, it's hard to tell. It would certainly incentive it to some degree, (only if the blocks were already full). But so would many other things; anything that increases adoption. Decreasing block size would definitely incentive decreased usage, via higher fees. My contention would be that larger block size has a small effect on demand compared to other factors. Eg BCH has 32MB blocks now, but has a [couple percent the volume as BTC](

I ran a node from around ~2011-2013, and have run a node for the last year or so (Core Nodes). I also ran an Ethereum node for a while, but had problems with geth crashing that I did not have time to troubleshoot. 
I also run a node for backing payments on a small eCommerce site, it's a full node too, but not on hardware I own, so I would say I administer it rather than technically run it.
I think running a node is the easiest thing a supporter can do.

They only would after 2016 blocks, when it became profitable again, in the case of 90% of the has power going over to BCH, that would take like 4 months, all the while the BTC price goes down?

Yes, I probably misspoke, I should say that he himself with his well connected (and large mempool) nodes would be able to tell, not that just looking at his graphs gives any insight. 


What is the actual average number of missing transactions between nodes when they propagate a block?


Yes, it is absoultly possible for miners to mine blocks with only their own transactions. It's possible for them to do it up to a certain % of block transactions without being easily noticed, my assumption is that is a very small % of transactions before it becomes quite obvious.
Again, I don't know the actual numbers; what is the actual average number of transactions that need to be reconciled between miners when propagating a block for an average block of say 2500 transactions?

You don't need total certainty to make relevant conclusions. 


Nope, but if you were to analyze a node and see that only 0.5% of transactions were unknown to you for blocks you receive, you can say that at most, miners are including 0.5% of their own transactions into blocks, this is not useless information.


We absolutely can know all miners are including no more than x% of their own un-broadcast transactions. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 03:58:58


Yeah, the question is where does that noise floor sit. If it's average 1tx per block, vs if it's 10% per block.
Maybe I'll set a node back up again and see how hard it is to pull these stats.


If the noise is a few tx per block, and one node is consistently doing much higher than that, it'll stand out.


slow ramp up doesn't help I don't think as those stats are per node.
Let you know if I actually get around to spinning up a node again. It'll be interesting anyway.

It is only beneficial if it is used for transactions. If you are sending transactions to it or pulling informatuon about transactions from it, you are ensuring those transactions are from the chain that follows your rules.
If it is a non mining node that is not used for transacting, it does nothing for the bitcoin network, its validations of anything are meaningless.

Sure, it verifies transactions, but that does not help the network, it only helps the user of that node, and they are only a user if they are actually *using* it.
Mining nodes decide the consensus rules for their chain. Transacting nodes help decide the value of their chain. non-mining non-transacting nodes can only help propagate blocks, but the network propagates blocks fine, it does not need these nodes. 


If SPV clients connect to your node, your node is helping on the actual "networking" side, as in hepling send and recieve packets, but again, this is not something the network is lacking. It is not helping add to network *security* though, the blockchain concenses, the value concensus etc.

I believe if you have only been tipped small amounts, eg 1020 sat as in  OPs pic, then you have no choice, as 1020 sat is not enough to cover the  on chain fee to set up a channel (or later settle it). Like owning dust  on chain.
I'd like to be proven wrong on that, as I have some small tips on reddit.
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:42:31
Of course it does. I sit next to you, wait for you to do a transaction and enter your pin yourself, man in the middle your blue tooth connection, modify your transaction. Maybe that is something no-one will ever do for your small transactions, maybe it is, who knows, but adding wireless of course ads another attack surface.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:04:09


OK, you sound like you don't actually know what you are talking about now. What do you mean, that statement is meaningless nonsense. Batching *is* putting multiple inputs / outputs into one transaction. Measuring cost per output is how you would look at the cost while taking batching into account.


it is irrelevant because it is not the average cost to use Bitcoin for getting a transaction to confirm.

Sure, like I said, security through obscurity, most likely a robber wont even think twice about even an unmodified private key on a bit of paper (today anyway).


If they are not smart enough, sure, you are relying on the inability of your foe, not the strength of your cipher. If they are smart enough, it is trivially possible. Good, proven encryption already exists.
If your talking security, the OP is not; Make up an cipher based on the OP, run your private key through it, and post it here, I'll happily take your BTC.

@_date: 2019-01-07 04:12:52
What part are you struggling with?
1. There is a total amount of BTC mined per hour, that is worth a total ammount of USD
2. If miners are breaking even (all miners as a global group), then that total $ generated of BTC per hour must equal the total amount they globally spend
Because they are breaking even, they are not gaining or loosing any money, they are making exact ally what they are spending
in real life, likely there will be some profit, but this is ballpark figures, and mining will always tend towards break even;  if there is $ to be made, people will spin up more hash, if people are loosing $ they will turn it off
3. Being kind in my calculations I set electricity cost at a low (globally) 4c/kwh (in real life this must also include some other general operating costs, rent, maintance, miner purchasing etc)
4. in two halvenings when the reward is 3.125 BTC per block, if the price is $1m/BTC, a total of 18.75 Million $ worth of BTC per hour will be created by miners
5. If they are breaking even, eg they sell their BTC with no profit or loss, but for the exact 18.75 Million $, then they are using globally, 18.75 Million / 4c per kWh = 468.75 Gigawatts

@_date: 2019-01-07 03:32:19


Sorry, that is just not going to happen. You can figure that out just by power usage / cost / reward, unless there is some breakthrough in power generation.
Two more halvenings, when BTC reward is 3.125 BTC per block:
3.125 per block \* 6 = 18.75 BTC per hour
18.75 BTC @ $1,000,000 = 18.75 Million $ per hour
18.75 Billion $ / 0.04 $ per KwH = 468750000 kwh = 468.75 Gigawatts if miners are all breaking even
Using the same maths, currently, (12.5 \* 6 \* 4000)/0.04 = 7.5gigawatts being used now if all miners are breaking even.
So, even in two halvenings in 2024, Bitcoin energy consumption will have to go more than 60x to sustain a million$ valuation
Not going to happen.
Just for fun, here are some more 4 year increments:
2024	468.75 Gigawatts
2028	234 Gigawatts
2032	117 Gigawatts
2036	58 Gigawatts
2040	29 Gigawatts
2044	14 Gigawatts
so, maybe, in 2044, the Bitcoin network using twice the total power than currently, could support a $1m price.

So you are saying there is a difference in the transaction data if it comes from an SPV client vs a node?




what is your issue with this statement? 
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:56:55
Yeah, crypto has rules, enforced by miners. Exchanges need rules. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:12:14
Yeah sure, lots of things could happen. Price could rise, but I would assume more likely laws would be put in place banning mining before that would be allowed to happen. Bitcoin could push solar and other returnables to advance much quicker by injecting $ into their rapid development. someone could fill all houses with Bitcoin heaters making the electricity not "wasted electricity". Someone could invent fusion and make it all irrelevant!
I'm not saying "only after x date will $1m per BTC be viable", but really, most likely $1m per BTC IMO will not be possible for quite a while. And as in the OP 5-10 years, IMO, no way in hell. (But please do invent a fusion reactor and prove me wrong, that would be fantastic!) 
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:05:08
Yep, absolutely. Exactly what happened 2017, and it pushed the equation, miners were hella profit, but because of the incentives, that has to be a short term thing. Price goes up, miners make a lot of profit, more people begin to mine, miners tend back towards break even. The coin bull market would have to continuously outpace the mining one :P We saw it happen this year too, bull market turned into a bear market, and mining / hashrate (eventually, longer term plays going on in mining) started to drop.
So maybe it spikes up to $1m, but IMO the 'real' mining backed coin price would have to be in the 100'sk before, and it would again be short term. So maybe Don could get lucky and cash out the $1m peak, but 'investors' in general, will not.
my 2c anyway, not that I have 2c, the only BTC I have is a few satoshi I was tipped on here using the LN, so maybe if we hit $1m I'll have 2c 
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:56:35
The blocks end up smaller in chain sure, but AFAIK almost 90% of bandwidth goes to tx propigation, and grins transactions are bigger. So it's reducing disk space, something that is, compared to other hardware, very cheap.
From what I understand it basically makes syncing a new node much faster and reduces on disk size, while making everything else slower and less efficient.
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:28:46
Right, decentralization is important, I don't define "working" as 3 nodes running in a data centre, we absolutely need as many, diversely run mining nodes as possible. Any nodes that a user connects to must be trusted by that user to be following the rules they want, for an average user, doing average transactions, with the current network, that is of very little concern. And if your full node does not mine, or transact, then it absolutely can't influence the network in any way.

You can't reduce it's energy need, and AFAIK there is nothing to replace PoW. It would be very hard to make Bitcoin miners use green-as-in-renewable sources if non renewable are cheaper. Best just move *all* power generation towards renewable. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:06:43


Sorry, no. Transactions are propagated to nodes so that miners have them to include in blocks. They are propagated to nodes because Bitcoin would literally not work if they weren’t.  Any extra efficiency that can be squeezed out of block transmission based on transactions being well mirrored across nodes using bloom filters or whatever is just a happy side effect.
What the \~90/10 *does* mean is that even if you could get all blocks to be transmitted at 1% of their actual size, you would only be saving \~10% on bandwidth.
By the same reasoning, doubling block size would only require 10% more bandwidth (excluding any advanced block propagation reduction, that would make it even less). Note; they would have to be full too. 
It would only take an 11.1% increase in transaction volume *regardless of block size,* to use the same 10% more bandwidth.
It also means that doubling transaction volume would require nearly double the bandwidth (90% more), again, *regardless of the blocksize*. (Also when Bitcoin gets into a very congested state, because of blocks not large enough for the demand, many transactions enter the mempool that are dropped before they ever make it into a block, increasing bandwidth for no reason, and probably double if you assume the are later rebroadcast with a higher fee)
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:57:29
No, I am saying none of that. What I am saying is very simple. I can make it more simple for you.
Say 1 BTC = $1, say electricity costs $1 per Kwh, say the block reward is 10 BTC per hour.
how much electricity will the Bitcoin network tend towards using?
Miners (from here on 'miners' means all miners, globally) make 10BTC per hour = $10 per hour
Miners are breaking even, eg when they spend is what they earn
They make $10, so they are spending $10
$10 worth of electricity @ $1/hwh is 10kwh
Miners use 10kwh
If miners are breaking even, and the incentive system in Bitcoin means the system will always tend towards that over the long term, then excluding short term fluctuations and extreme conditions, from just the coin price we can ballpark the global energy usage of the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:33:35
Yeah, non segwit nodes see's the 1MB block (it is actually 1MB, not just "seen as") with all the transactions and they are all valid, eg they have the sender and receiver stuff, but the signatures and scripts are separate (segregated and not part of that 1MB), so to the non segwit nodes, all the (segwit) transactions are there, valid and validated (and spendable by anyone).

I kind of agree with this guy, the tax man needs to be able to tax it, otherwise it will be shut down (yes you can't 'kill' Bitcoin, but you can for sure render it basically unusable with enough govt pressure)
For me, anonymity was never a needed feature of Bitcoin, and this guy seems to falsely assume that Bitcoin *is* very anonymous ... it is not.
Money that cannot be printed, that is totally accountable, is totally controlled by the person that owns it, and that is fast and cheap to use, that is what I want from Bitcoin, using it to launder money, not on the list.

If you put $10 into a bank, and then the bank lends out 9 of those $ to 'Bob', you still *have* $10, and now Bob has $9. The total money supply grew.
Now if Bob puts that $9 back into the bank, they can lend out (a fraction, 97% I think) of that money back out, so they lend $8 to Charles. Now the total money supply is much more than the initial $10.
And that repeats. The Money multiplier formula is
Money Multiplier =1 / Required Reserve Ratio
for 10% reserve ratio would be = 1/0.1 = 10 meaning $10 initial deposit, lent out, redeposited, lent out over and over can increase the total money supply 10x, meaning the $10 you initially deposited can create $90 new dollars.
At a 3% reserve ratio, $10 could create an extra $320

But we live in a day where an 8TB drive is like $200. 8TB will store 20 years of 2MB blocks.
BTC is purposefully not scaling block size not because of any hardware limits, but because for second layer options like the Lightning Network to work, there needs to be a fine, manually tuned balance between block size and tx volume to keep miners solvent (at scale) as block rewards drop.
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:43:05
Possible, sure, plausible? Run the numbers on the cost and time it would take to introduce double the mining power that exists currently, vs the payoff. I think you'll find that they would be more profitable just using that mining hardware to mine. 
If they wanted the goal of destroying BTC rather than profiting off it that's different, but also probably not plausible.

You funny guys and your tribalism. I say something that seems against your party lines and I must be a "bcasher". lol
I am looking at the freely available data, and drawing my own, rather self explanatory conclusions.
I’m not against optimization, lets get transactions as small and efficient as possible.


no, it hasn't, there is no "far more capacity now"; Sure there aer lots of awesome things planned, MAST, Schnorr Signatures etc that will increase block capacity, they are not here now, they have not "changed since then"
Segwit was launched three months before fees peaked in Dec. When they did peak it was at about 14%, and currently at about 40% (This *usage* increase is not a *capacity* increase, the capacity increase happened with block 481824 in August 2017)
Segregating witness data does not make transactions any smaller, but as Segwit is implemented makes blocks larger, in a round about, "do some maths to get the answer" sorta way. I'll let you do you [do your own research]( and [crunch your own block data]( to figure out currently the capacity increase Segwit is / will provide the network, but lets say it gives a 2.5x capacity increase at 100%:
In December, according to the [Link I already provided]( the mempool hit upwards of 260,000 transactions.
My statment still stands


EDIT: oh, forgot to address the LN. Now before you pop your top with "narratives" and "corporate bankster controlled bosscoin" garbage; I'm not saying anything about the future of LN, but currently LN only works for small payments, with average total channel capacity of around 0.030 BTC, heck the [total network capacity]( is in the same order of magnitude as [just the pending fees]( were for transactions between Dec and Jan

I politely disagree. ATM's obviously, they provide a valuable feature the Bitcoin network itself cannot. Exchanges, the same, they provide a valuable service that the network can not. Bitcoin does not prevent fraud, the attack surface is different, but if you fail to secure your private keys, just like your credit card number, you funds can be stolen. There are people who 100% will want someone else to hold their Bitcoins, provide fraud protection, insurance, loans, interest customer support and all the other things that banks provide. That can and will be built on top of Bitcoin (exchanges and online wallets are already very heavily used), and are a separate energy expense.

I think you are confusing the definitions of liquidity. Exchange trade vs BTC-as-money liquidity. BTC-as-money liquidity is about the best you can get, it's always available, and can be sent to anyone anywhere anytime.

You have to factor how much Segwit increases the block capacity vs how much transaction volume pressure was put on the network. Sure, Segwit is a block size increase, sure it's at 40% now, but even at 100%, it would not handle the crazy volume of tx going into the network during that time.

No it doesn't. It knows the IP address of the server that sent it the transaction, it dosn't know if that server is the originator or another node propagating that transaction. If it is from your wallet or from your node, that IP is just as tied to your identity as you allow it to be.

Hey, someone who writes useful comments! welcome :D
My, nice, reply to that would be that Segwit was activated before fees spiked, and while there is plenty cool ideas to reduce tx size, Schnorr etc, they are not here yet. 
So to bring back up the original comment:


Since then, the network hasn't changed, has no more capacity, and has not increased (yet)
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:52:58
It only changes if decreased cost isn't associated with increased supply.
I don't think renewables would drop base energy costs a lot, but as Andreas says, if Bitcoin pushes / funds renewable adoption, that is a good thing in general! If fusion or something came up making electricity essentially free and unlimited, then the bottleneck would move from limited power availability to limited hardware availability I would think.

This has nothing to do with demand (there obviously must be enough demand for the miners to sell into, but this is implied, as in the example BTC=$1m, if there was not enough demand, then price would fall). The whole rest of the world can be buying or selling as much BTC as they want, demand or lack of, pushes the price up or down, but here we are proposing that *the price is $1m/BTC*
At break even, what miners make = their expenses
if you know how much $ of BTC is being mined per hour, and we do, then that $ at break even is = their expenses
At break even: 18.75 Billion $ mined per hour = 18.75 Billion $ spent by miners
If the miners are profiting, then total electrisity usage goes down a bit if the miners are loosing, then the total electrisity usage goes up a bit
Ballpark figures are good enough here though, to prove that Bitcoin cannot support $1m per coin any time soon, based on hard, real world limits on electricity use.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:58:19
Correct. Transaction volume accepted by the network into the mempool, not tx volume in blocks. Blocks being full tells you nothing about the fee market, that is decided in the mempool.

Running a node will not hurt anything, I run a full core node, just because I have for a long time, and like the idea of "owning" the whole chain. 
If you want to support the network, the best way is on the economic side; buy *and use* Bitcoin
You can help on the people side; learn how bitcoin works and (nicely and respectfully) help other people understand by passing that knowledge on
You can buy and run mining hardware, and actually cast your vote on the rules of the system by what node you connect to
You *could* run a Lightning Network node, but you will be risking your funds, and some people will say that LN is not ready to be run on main net yet, again research the topic!
To me, most important is 1 Learn as much as you can about how bitcoin works, 2 use Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is Less Secure than Most People Think: Show me the maths and a breakdown of an attack scenario then. This article goes into a lot of detail saying a 51% attack is possible, we all know it's possible, the question is, is it *profatable,* and even more importantly is is *more* profitable than acting honestly. My belief is that the incentive structure in Bitcoin is quite good, and rewards honest actors more than evil ones, especially on BTC where it has so much of the global hash (it does not work so well if you are a small chain using the same PoW as a larger one)
Anyway, believable breakdown of the time and costs required vs the payoff is needed to claim "Bitcoin is Less Secure than Most People Think"

It's a payment system built on top of Bitcoin. [Here is a table analogy I wrote ages ago](
LN provides near instanant transactions between people for a very small fee. You need to set up a channel/s between you and someone on the LN, this involves one of you putting some funds in and paying one tx fee. Then you can transfer small ammounts of BTC around between you, the person you set the channel up with, and anyone else on the LN that is sufficiently connected.
Both parties need to be online at the same time to complete a transaction.
In the future after a time out, or if either party wants to close the channel, another on chain transaction must be made and a fee paid.

I have used qt (core), mycellium and electrum. I was on core qt wallet back in 2011.

I also used the android Mycillium wallet back in the day to play on Satoshi Dice, but have discovered that it stores your private key in plaintext on the device, so not sure I could recommend it anymore.

On the block chain level: When a user broadcasts a transaction, it gets sent to a random node, that node shares it to other nodes, who share it to others etc. After a while, a random mining node will confirm that transaction into a block.
The protocol doesn't track location or IP address of the originating client, and without that someone would need to control all the nodes to know where all transactions originated. 
You may be able to get *some* form of this data by monitoring known addresses, like exchange addresses, but this will be very incomplete and fuzzy data.

Tables are unlimited, but you have to sit at a table, with someone, to join the network. Two per table. You or the other person on the table adding or taking away any cash requires an on chain transaction + fee. (and you cant sit at a table without at least one of the two adding some cash, eg no cashless tables) Sliding money across tables, requires a LN fee, but it's very very small.

Segwit is still only at [~14%]( and when it reaches 100% it will only allow ~1.7x the volume. I'm not arguing if Segwit is groundbreaking or innovative or not, I'm saying that even with Segwit, once we get back into the tx volume we had in [December]( and fees hit double digits again, scaling debates will once again be the topic of discussion.
"Scaling debates are now a thing of the past", nonsense, it will be a debate for years and years to come, maybe [forever](
You can [clearly see that]( current mempool lows are not a result of SegWit adoption, it is [not a result]( of batching either, it is purely that transaction volume has dropped, for what ever reason.

@_date: 2019-01-07 06:22:08
Tx count in blocks is different than tx count into the network;
If there are just enough tx going into the mempool to fill blocks but no more, then fees will remain be low. If there are 10x as many transactions going into the mempool as can fit in blocks, fees will skyrocket, but "settlement count" (lol) in blocks will remain the same.

The incentive for miners is the block reward, 12.5 BTC ~= $100,000 every 10 minutes, regardless of any extra the [fees add](


Miners pulling out will only affect transaction time a lot if a lot of miners pull out in a short time; every 2016 blocks the difficulty re-adjusts and block time once again returns to ~10 minutes. Ad it is directly proportional, eg if 50% of miners pull out, then block times double, transaction times double, and the 2016 blocks will take up too 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to readjust. 


I don't think this could really destroy Bitcoin without a huge percentage of miners all leaving at once, this is what was referred to as the "flippening" by BCH, something that is basically an impossibility without crazy price changes.


They don't, difficulty changes so that mining is *always* profitable, no matter what the price is, or how much hash power the network has.

It is a widely spread misunderstanding that just running a node, by itself, helps the network, you can find many threads on here with people acting under the same false assumption.


Not quite IMO, the miners do their bit to enforce the consensus regardless, but your vote on the economic side does not require you to run a node, you do give up the trustlessness, but you still get to choose what rules you support if you *do* trust in whatever node you are transacting through, your vote counts just the same as if you did it via your own node, in fact the vast majority of such economic voting on chains is done on exchange sites where you rely on someone else's node.

Seeing as I was mentioned, I'll be clear that I agree, and I say "True Believers" referring to myself in that I believe Bitcoin, and blockchain can have a major (positive) impact on the power structures in the financial system (and probably a lot of other systems to be seen).
I am not religious and try to approach Bitcoin in the same way, I love the tech, and believe in the scientific method, I love when crypto gets criticized (in an intelligent and informed way anyway).
If I can add my 2c to this thread, I would also like Bitcoin to become 'the norm', but Bitcoin is not a replacement for *everything* money related, it offers a specific set of features, the most exciting of which have never existed before in the history of any other money system, that are very advantageous for certain use cases.
Other features of a more broad money system, such as banks, insurance, interest, loans etc etc can be built on top of Bitcoin, while retaining those Bitcoin only features that underlie them.
There are problems relating to the broader money system, that are detached from the Bitcoin network, and Bitcoin cannot solve these because they are external to it. Like the one mentioned of getting cash money into another system, this is not a problem that Bitcoin can solve, because it is not related to Bitcoin, but the layers that surround it.

The question here is not if a particular way of running a node or a wallet is insecure, it is if running a node inherently gives you move privacy.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:05:16
This would imply that nobody is using nodes to verify rules, as long as nodes are able to be run by people, *this will never happen*. There will be thousands of nodes running, but it only takes *one* to see that the rules have been changed, and destroy the trust people have in their third party online nodes. 
I run a node to back an eCommerce site, in my case, I do not entrust that to a third party. If someone tries to pay me, and they are unknowingly transacting on another fork, they will very quickly learn that fact, the node they are transacting through will quickly be outed as malicious, or broken, and the person providing that node, probably an online wallet provider, will have just destroyed their business. There is a huge incentive for such services to maintain that trust for their clients.
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:06:48
There will always be transacting nodes (that do not mine), I'm not saying these are not important, I am saying for an average user, using SPV or a trusted third party is more than fine and that running a non transacting non mining node does nothing to help the network. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:14:28
Sure, Batching, Swgwit, MAST, Schnorr Signatures. We can fit more transactions in the same block size, and we will. Again, nothing to do with my comment. If the mempool has more transactions piling up than blocks can take, with or without optimizations, fees will rise. Fees are down, like the OP said, because "no one is using it", I would be less blunt, and say; less people are using it than when it peaked in Jan, but the [point still stands](

The all depends on on-chain fees, LN purchase amounts, LN fees, LN channel funding amount, the cost for you or someone else to keep watch for fraud etc etc I would not be OK with people stealing money in any case. However, the thing is, usually in a LN channel, both people will have funds, if person 1 tries to steal person 2s funds, but person 2 catches person 1 out, then person 2 gets *all* the money, person 1s included.
Watching the channel is something you need to do, but stealing attempts will, IMO, be rare.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:08:15
You absolutely help the network if you are a mining node, I agree, we need as many of those as we can get. 


It doesn't, you can only enforce the consensus rules if you are mining, if your node has no hashpower to create blocks, it can only confirm that miners are following the rules. Your node can influence the *value* of your chain by transacting on it, but you are not required to run your own node to do this (the majority of this value voting on chains happens off chain on exchanges anyway)

I think we are there already, I doubt more than a few % of users run their own nodes to transact, and I don't see it as a problem. The thing that is important is the option, the possibility, to be able to fairly cheaply run your own node, it doesn't take many people running running nodes to keep these other players honest, it definitely doesn't need even a minority of users to run full nodes to do this.
In the case of 5 major wallet providers, there is zero chance they will destroy their business by jumping chains, falsifying transactions etc as long as it is still possible to cheaply run a node.
I think more importantly, it is the *control* of your money that Bitcoin gives you that is far more important not to entrust to a third party such as an online wallet provider. 
 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:37:50
I try to be nice on here! No point in shouting eh! 
But there are things Bitcoin cannot eliminate, was not built to replace, and are still valuable(?). I think sure, if everyone used Bitcoin in "power user mode", had their own wallet, secured their own keys, a lot of those extra things would be unnecessary and could be included in such a comparission, but if Bitcoin becomes widely adopted, the majority of people will not use it like that, they will not want to keep their savings account on a hardware wallet, they will want it secured by a third party (aka bank) that is protected and insured etc etc.  Basically I see no future in which Bitcoin *alone* replaces the entire financial system for which such comparisons usually get done.

Because the blockchain is open, anyone can look at it, there are multiple sites with formatted Bitcoin data pulled from the blockchain. If you do not trust it, I suggest and encourage you to spin up a node and look for yourself, I would be very excited if you were to find something different!

Sounds like you are not quite sure how it works. Processing power has little affect on block time, none with the current block size, it is limited to 10 minutes on purpose mostly due to propagation time. Block size is also limited mostly due to propagation time and storage needs. Processing power we have plenty of; we can get around 100tx/sec/core

I see posts [like this]( all the time. Here is a [post]( from 6 days ago that doesn't seem clear to a n00b to me:




that is why I point out that as you said, you must *use* your node for it to benefit anyone.


I agree, it is on a per user- per use case. I personally would trust an SPV wallet, or looking at a couple of block explorers for even a car sized purchase. Everyone that uses an exchange (seems like the main use of Bitcoin so far) aren't even using on chain transactions, they are buying and selling with basically IOU's, billions of dollars.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:25:13
Why running a node is important: for an average user it is not, for an average user, using SPV or a truster third party is more than fine, just like you must trust such a site to tell you the price. Anyone can run a node, and if they mine or transact on it, they are helping the network, in proportion to their transfers / hash rate, but most importantly and most misunderstood is running a non transacting non mining node does nothing to help the network. 
EDIT: This last point is easily provable, if non-mining non-transacting nodes could influence the network, then someone could easily spin up tens of thousands of them and influence it. The *only* thing they do is help the network route transactions, something that is with the current state on the network, totally nu-needed.

300kb blocks, haha. My 'fun' node runs on a $20 atom PC, but 300kb blocks would allow me to also host some files on it too, sweet! :D
Yeah, the cost / benefit may change in the future, I think as long as nodes remain easy to run, then even if all the major wallet providers were targeted by govt etc, people could and would still easily move to new nodes, again probably making the original attack not worth it.
I believe most people will move to semi-controlled online wallets in future anyway, Bitcoins short history has shown us that people in general are very terrible at securing their keys, and do not want the burden of securing their keys. IMO most people in future will store their coins in a regulated, hosted, insured wallet, that still gives them final say using 2 of 3 multisig or something similar. I would not expect my mother to secure her life savings by herself on a Trezor!


Miner decentralization sure, we need as many distributed mining nodes as possible, while also keeping nodes below some cost to run, while also having a system that can handle the tx load, while also keeping miners profitable. I am also not sure where the appropriate balance is.
But I'm not specifically of the opinion that the more decentralization, the better when it comes to transacting nodes, because as long an acceptable level of trust is there, then they are un-needed, it's the ability to easily run a node that is important, if that trust is ever compromised, and to keep the existing trust in check.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:04:14
So all nodes check the consensus rules, there are two was to 'enforce', one is mining, you actually create new blocks, and help in creating the chain that follows your rules. Enforcing as a miner *is* creating new blocks on the chain that follows your consensus. 
The other way is on the economic side, you want to transact on the chain that follows your rules, to give it value, you can do this 100% trustlessly on your own node (although I would say for an 'average' user, SPV, or submitting a tx through a large online wallet host would be a perfectly fine, very low level of risk to trust the software / wallet provider to be following the correct chain)
If you full node does not transact, and is not mining, it can check the rules, but cannot "enforce" them in any way.

If they have access to a bank, that bank has access to the banking system and therefore, most likely the Internet. If they have access to a bank they therfore probably can have access to Bitcoin via a third party who offers a hosted wallet etc, so not direct trustless on chain, but still access. Only question is if a Bitcoin "bank" is advantageous to them over a traditional one.

If your not trading, don't entrust your private keys to an exchange
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:45:58
I'm not sure that $ transferred vs $ to run the system is a good metric, you want cost to run, vs value provided, this IMO is much better measured in cost vs number of transactions.
Bitcoin is interesting in that when it scales, number of transactions can go up without mining cost going up, in fact the whole Bitcoin system could run on a single laptop if difficulty was appropriately low.
In my mind there are two questions;
1. Is Bitcoin efficient compared to what Bitcoin could be at it's best
2. Is Bitcoin efficent compared to existing systems
 
For 1, the answer is we don't know. Bitcoin could run for a few hundred watts, with energy usage close to or maybe equalling a normal database, but you loose the security that PoW provides. There may be (acceptable) ways to replace PoW with something else, such as PoS, that far reduces network cost while retaining a secure chain, but there are downsides to everything, and time will tell if we can build a better, more energy efficient Bitcoin that retains security.
in the meantime 2. Bitcoin gets *nowhere near* to existing systems. First up, when I see other articles comparing Bitcoin to existing systems (banks) they do it incorrectly. They compare Bitcoin with banks, exchanges, ATM's, etc etc. But Bitcoin does *not* provide a replacement for the entire financial system, only the base layer. Bitcoin does not have fraud protection, offices full of people with lights and desktops running taking support calls, ATM's etc etc, all of these can be build *on* Bitcoin, but if an ATM is hooked to a bank database, or the blockchain it uses the same amount of *extra* power, same for fraud protection servers or support call centres, exchanges etc etc.
Bitcoin needs to be compared to a database (albeit one that itsn't a trustless 100% control of that data type job) The amount of power it would take for a bank to create a world wide, redundant database system that replicate Bitcoin transaction volume *without* the trustlessness, would be a tiny, tiny fraction of the energy usage of the Bitcoin network. A tweet [supposedly uses]( about 90 joules, where as one Bitcoin tx currently [supposedly uses ]( 2340000000 joules, therefore Bitcoin would need to scale to millions of times current volume without increase in mining power (actually mining cost) to get even in the same realm as what a bank could do. Bitcoin (current protocol) will never be as energy efficient as a database can be, because it *is* a database that requires a large amount of extra energy to be expended on PoW.
The only reason this is acceptable is because it provides what a database alone cannot, trustless distributed uncontrolled goodness. The value of this added energy cost, IMO, will increase as adoption and transaction volume does. 
Wow that went on and on, I have too much time on my hands it seems.
Bitcoin is not efficient compared to what it (possibly) could be with changes to the protocol. Bitcoin (current protocol) is currently nowhere near as efficient as the banking system (when comparing like to like), and will never be as efficient. All of this will likely get better in future.

OK, yes ATM maybe not the best example looking far enough foward into a future without cash, you can replace ATM with point of sale device. I think all my other examples are valid. Anything that the Bitcoin network doesn't provide that the banking system does and that requires extra energy usage, cannot be used in a comparison *about* energy usage.

Exactly, do you or anyone you know check that banknotes are real day to day? No, it is unneeded. If you are dealing with someone unrepeatable, or buying large items involving briefcases of cash, then yes, you may want to check.


They are wrong. Wherever your transaction starts from, it *has* to go to some random node, to *all* nodes in fact. Nodes do not know if that transaction originated from you, or is being relayed. And there is no reason your node IP is any less tied to your identity than your wallet IP.

They do it by voting, with $, on what chain they support, they don't need to run a node, or reject blocks to do this, the majority of such 'voting' happens on exchanges on nodes they don't control (but trust to be representing the chain they support)


Neither side will have much trouble, there will be a little bit of time while the nodes sort out who is who, if nodes were able to stop blocks propagating like this, the BCH fork would have killed itself and Bitcoin.


I run two 'core' nodes too, but this statement is just not true, if other nodes pop up that are following another chain, your node will reject them, but this will not stop those block propagating on their own chain, and is unneeded for helping 'core' blocks propagate on the 'core' chain. The two chains will happily split from one another regardless of either of our nodes.
If our "good" nodes can stop another "bad" networks nodes propagating, then it follows that a bunch of "bad" nodes all spun up could stop our "good" nodes propagating, eg you could destroy the Bitcoin network by spinning up a bunch of evil nodes, but you can't.

Mining nodes are perfectly capable of rejecting such blocks, they do not need these other node doing that for them, if there are zero, or 10 thousand other non-mining no-transacting nodes the network will work just the same, they are un-needed for this.
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:52:46
I think some sort of block limit will probably be needed in future to ensure fees pay miners, at least I think "never full" blocks are probably dangerous long term as they rely on high tx volume, that may not exist for a number of reasons.  I supported and still do support a block size increase. Currently, while fee's are not a necessity to pay miners, I would rather have a chain that 'works', I think the double digit fees hurt Bitcoins reputation (I still hear people say oh yeah Bitcoin that thing that costs $30 to send money through right?), and I personally think 4MB or even 8MB blocks would not increase centralization to any degree that matters (I mean I'm running a node on a $20 PC now, how cheap does node cost have to be!?)

@_date: 2018-03-01 07:59:16
Not really. It will help the network transfer packets, eg other nodes syncing up, but really, that is not something that is currently lacking in the network. If you want to support Bitcoin, best is to *use* Bitcoin (unless you can help directly on the development side).
Running a node helps *you* though, if you do transactions using your own node means you do not need to trust a third party node. Note too: I'm pretty sure you can run some light wallets that connect to your own node. 
Also if you want to run a node just because you want to, it's not hurting anything, I have run a node since 2011 that I havn't used for anything in many years, it costs me basically nothing, and I just like having a copy of the blockchain :)

Maybe if the network came under attack they would be of more use, but really an attacker would target the mining nodes (or maybe exchange or large transacting nodes on the economic side) to disrupt Bitcoin.

I'm not going to go search out posts, but I do come across them frequently. I believe the misunderstanding come from the early days when every node was a CPU miner by default.


All I'm trying to do as well.


Right, totally agree, still believe that the cost / benefit of running a full node / trusting a well trusted third party is non positive for most users. But it is up to everyone, 


I'm definitely not saying no-one needs to run a full node, I run a full node to support an ecommerse site, I would not do it any other way, just for the *average user*.


Again I agree, you give up trust, you are *trusting* the node you are connecting to is following the rules you agree with, but again cost/benefit/average user....


If I go to blockchair.com and look up a transaction, there is of course a chance, either they, or a man in the middle, a virus etc etc has modified that data, but again the chance of that vs the cost to an average user of running, maintaining, and securing a full node is probably far less.

Right, that's why I linked to data showing *both* transaction count and outputs are down. Even if it is nullc, data is &gt; something he just says "a statement with no arguments to back it" and all that jazz. 
[Segwit adoption quickly grew to an almost peak around 20th Oct 2017]( since then it's been about the same, since that peak in October, the [mempool grew steadly]( all the way until December. 


This, the core of this thread, is still undoubtedly wrong. Segwit and it's current low adoption did not stem the mempool increase, and it certainly was not responsible for it's decrease.

The one that is Bitcoin is whatever one you deem to be Bitcoin, there are only two ways you can vote on that, 1, mining that chain, 2. transacting on that chain.

Andreas [talks]( about it, I talked about it; what I'm saying is there is a big misconception that is still believed by many, that *just* running a node is helping the network. 
If we are talking about ens-users actually using full nodes, my argument is still that for an average user it is unnecessary; The small amount of trust you give up, for the average user, is far less than the money, time and possibly security cost of having to run their own node for transactions IMO.

Very simplified, but I think well done for your average person to get a grip on.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:49:28
the last link I selected the columns with tx and total outputs for that very reason. As of right now, the average *per output* in USD is $1.78, $1,72, $2.00, $1.88 for the last few blocks, not trolling, if you have a different source link it (may be vastly different if you look at Segwit only?), otherwise, ~$1.80 per transaction is **far** to high to make it even *close* to a good currency 
2 satoshi transactions are confirming is irrelevant, miners can choose to confirm whatever they want, the *average* fee per byte or fee per tx is all that matters while the mempool is non empty. You can argue these fees are higher than they need to be due to poor wallet implementations rather than the actual protocol, but it is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is what it *actually* costs, on average, to get a transaction into a block, that defines how usable it is relating to fees, as a currency, right now.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:37:39
Don't dodge the question, your whole argument hinges on this
is there a difference in the transaction data if it comes from an SPV client vs a node?
Light Wallet --&gt;  Random Node  --&gt; Rest of network
Wallet --&gt; Your Node --&gt; Random Node  --&gt; Rest of netwotk
The "Random Node" in both cases don’t know if your are the originator of the tx, but can track the source of it. And the IP of your light wallet, or your node are no more secure than each other.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:15:35
If they are non mining / non transacting nodes, eg the ones some people erroneously set up to 'help' the network, then no, they would not. I could make thousands of full nodes, following my concensus rules of say 1 day block times, I would reject every other nodes blocks, but because my nodes just sit there, they cannot enforce anything, Bitcoin would happily hum along, slowly dropping my nodes from their peer lists, like nothing ever happened.

It doesn't really matter, if Bitcoin is worth more, then the price will drop, but always rise back up again, if it is overpriced it will just drop. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:36:35
Cool, but this video is all about price, getting rich, sell walls, bear whales, n00b panic sellers, FOMO etc. 
If you want to invest, and try get rich, that is fine, but investment does nothing to help Bitcoin except increasing it's price (something that is largely irrelevant to it's success), it's not fighting the banks, and it's not why *I'm* here.

I have heard of it before, I'll have to read the white paper. Is it using Proof of Capacity to actually enforce it's consensus though? I assumes it was just using some sort of proof of storage to ensure people have the files?

Even if I only send from this wallet, never receive? 
I do not know what an HD wallet is, but I will look it up now. I would rather not convert my wallet if it means having to move the coins.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:16:25


I don't believe this is true, think about it; Nobody can move your coins on the Bitcoin chain without your private key, the rules do not allow it. The only way they *can* move 'coins' from your address without your key is if a) it is on another forked chain that isn't Bitcoin, who cares, just a chain would be worth $0 b) the whole actual Bitcoin chains rules get changed, in which case, Bitcoin no longer exists. 
Bitcoin *requires* that only the person with the private key can move coins, if someone without you key can move your coins, *they are not moving Bitcoin*.
You do not need a full node wallet to fully control you Bitcoin, having your private key is all you need.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:03:03
I assume with my very old wallet, I have all the various forks covered. It seems you can't convert to an HD, and I am wary of creating a new HD wallet and moving my coin into the new one because of loosing forked coins, not sure if that is warranted.

"a statement with no arguments to back it" eh? lol 
Troll - a person who makes a deliberately offensive or provocative online post.
See. what I did here was write an informed post, backed up with facts and sources, to support an earlier one, that needed no explanation anyway because it is quite obviously true.
Regardless that people will [always be discussing future scaling]( when there is more transaction volume demand than Bitcoin can support with 100% Segwit adoption, do you think scaling might be a popular topic again?

I run one just for fun, I don't transact with it, it's not mining, my does not help the network at all. If I were to transact Bitcoin as an Individual, unless I'm maybe doing insanely large transactions, there is no *need* for me to check against my own node, sure it's safer and requires less trust, but checking a couple of different trusted sites, or using am SPV wallet is fine for 99.9% of people.

Crypto fanatics ... argue ? There is no argument there, it's just fact, because they *wern't* flaws with Bitcoin. It's like saying when someone pulls of a large gold robbery, that there is a somehow a problem with gold.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:04:43
I think I disagree with Andreas here, he is saying the people who secure the network must be rewarded, but then says that reward must come from the network, I don't think it does. Say for instance a blockchain based voting system, people would happily run and secure the network and not be rewarded by the network, but be rewarded simply with the fact that it benefits them to have a provably fair voting system.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:12:56
You running a full non-mining node really doesn't contribute much to the network. You node will relay transactions, but the network has no trouble relaying transactions without your node. Because your node is non mining, it cannot enforce consensus rules, only check them, and if it does find something wrong, those who see that would have to trust your node not to be lying, which they wont because they don't know you. If you are transacting using your node, then it is contributing to *your* security, as you do not need to trust a third party node.
TLDR: a non mining full node is only useful for those people who trust it, in your case that is most likely only you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:12:53
Only in a chain-death type situation, where so much hash power leaves all at once that it totally dies before the difficulty readjusts (something I personally don't think can happen), otherwise it doesn't stop working, overall mining reward goes down, less miners, still (on average granted) always 1BTC &gt; cost to make 1BTC

Bitcoin will not fail, it being $100 or $100K or anything in between doesn't mean it has succeeded or failed at the moment, the price is 95% speculation, if you believe in Bitcoin, you should forget about the price. (Although most people "believe" in Bitcoin meaning them believe they are going to get rich from it)

They can't cheat, and don’t require trust for being paid sure, but they are still using your hashpower to vote on the consensus of  the network. If your hashpower is limited, you can basically only use your hashpower to vote for a limited number of available representatives. I’m not sure my idea gets around that, but I’m sure others have had other ideas. 
Surely, ideally, you would want 1 cpu to equal 1 vote, and be able to do that with, or without representatives if you wish?
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:34:57
While this is a noble idea, if a user does not know how to properly secure their keys, they are probably opening themselves up to a larger attack surface that if they were to leave them with a trusted third party. The value Bitcoin brings is that you are *able* to be fully in control of your own funds / private keys, this however is not the optimal situation for *all* people. Not to mention that you are possibly unnecessarily spending fees, and pushing up the global fees to do so.
