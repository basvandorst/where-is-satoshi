Lol, exactly. You are an expert at this.

Really? 20 minutes is pretty much instant versus the days banks take.

True, but God I hate that sanctimonious twat.
I would also not limit it to bitcoin.

Why the fuck are people still using winrar win 7-zip handles rar files fine and is free?

I agree with you.  The problem lies with the fact BCH exists at all.  It existing creates these situations and adds to the confusion of people trying to use either version.  IMO a mature CC should not be forked.

But you get a tangible asset from that effort that has value because it is needed to create and accomplish things in electronics, chemistry, and material engineering.
I am a fan of crypto. I made some money off bitcoin and mined ethereum for over a year at home.  I'm just pointing out some of my concerns with it as a long term currency.

Just buy it, don't wait for the dip, you will just screw yourself.

Pomp it.

Gold is forever though.
Bitcoin is fucked in 20 years when the payout stops, no one is mining, and the entire system grinds to a halt.  Thats the biggest concern I have with bitcoin as well as it being a tremendous waste of electricity.

Is what I am saying wrong?

My rate is $.08 but I had to call it quits just due to the heat.  TVA means cheap electricity but it also means southern summers.

I was going to buy more if it fell below 3000, I missed my chance it seems. :(

I cashed out at 14k and my last bits at 11k.  IMO bitcoin will not be the future solution and will slowly rot away (that said that time is not now, and at least another 5 years away).  Bitcoins value is hurting just about every other alt coin though and as an ethereum and decred miner I am tied to it. 
All that said, it will recover within a few months almost certainly.

I haven't invested in bitcoin in over a year.  I actually did pretty well when I peaked last and didn't reinvest after I sold at 15k USD aside a few dollars I swapped in from decred to bitcoin.   
I just bought in again a few hundred dollars.  Let's do this.
