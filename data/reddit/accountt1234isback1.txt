Yeah I'm watching too. There was a big selloff, which I don't understand, we already expected the FBI was going to auction those coins.
I still expect to see it bounce back up, just like it did during the silk road selloff.

So, since the bot used depositor's money to buy Bitcoin, which is basically theft and market manipulation, that means the real price of Bitcoin is its August 2012 level, which is 12 dollar.

Sorry, but this is a really depressingly unimaginative scam. I hope your financial situation improves.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:37:04


Because they can short-sell Bitcoin and make an even bigger profit.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:24:02
"gambling" aka laundering money.

He should have mined Litecoin instead, that's far more CPU friendly.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:05:10


It probably does deserve to crash if this is true, but I'm not sure if it's really true.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:55:38


How much do you figure it'll cost?
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:30:57
It's 300 bitcoin, not 300 k.
It's 150,000 dollar they lost.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:58:53
They're in hong kong, they follow all the local rules. They could pull a Gox of course, so I never keep more than about 20% of my entire stash over there.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:53:37


It's perfectly possible.
The Bitcoin that they do have, they can decide to use in a double-spending attack.
Send Bitcoin to a big exchange like Bitfinex, who accept deposits after two or three confirmations. Quickly withdraw again to a different address. Now release your longer 51% chain. In your longer chain, you've sent the Bitcoin to a different address, not to Bitfinex, but you do include their transaction to your address. Bitfinex has now effectively paid you whatever you "deposited" on their account. You deposited 1000 BTC? They now gave you 1000 BTC for free. 
Also, owning 51% of the network is the same as owning 100% of the network, because statistically your chain will always be longer when you choose to release it if you simply wait long enough. Thus, when you own 51% of the network, you effectively double your mining capacity.
Is all of this *still* not profitable enough? See if some government or bank is willing to pay you to kill Bitcoin. 
You really can't count on the financial incentive not to do it.

So that means Karpeles is a kind of Bitcoin martyr, who ruined his own life to turn other nerds into millionaires.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:39:56
It's not just that they would 51 our ass, it's the very fact that they would have the *ability* to 51 our ass, which would in practice reduce Bitcoin to the same level as a shitty altcoin.
Websites would stop accepting Bitcoin deposits with just or two confirmations, because they would recognize that there is now a power out there who can choose to 51 them.
It would simply cause a loss of confidence in Bitcoin. That's the reason we don't want them to reach 51%. Frankly, I personally don't like having any pool above 25%, as you can do a lot of nasty shit even if you control a smaller fraction of the network.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:05:01
Oh god. This hurts to read.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:06:51


Nah, it's not a requirement, but it's a nice way to get some extra cash on the side.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:55:27
Real coin? 0.3 BTC lol.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:04:55
It probably *is* Ghash. The only ones who have a financial incentive to use this tactic are other pool operators.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:33:40


That seems to be the case already:
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:41:27
A block-solution withholding attack is not the same thing as a 51% attack. A block-solution withholding attack is against a pool, a 51% attack is against the whole cryptocurrency.
Both require a large amount of hashing power however.

Oh hi, 14 minute old throwaway account writing a wall of text to defend some company.
Nice to meet you.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:46:01


If you think the wild west days are over, you're looking at the wrong places. For me, it's still a lot of fun.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:54:03
This kills the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:42:39




Not if you mine an ASIC-proof coin.
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:29:45
Do you want to crash the price?
Because this is how you crash the price.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:40:48
LMFAO, I sold just when i noticed the crash LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL enjoy ur forced liquidations LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:30:09
That's very good news really.
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:00:15
It's very difficult to know, because the richest addresses tend to be owned by exchanges.
@_date: 2014-05-30 02:05:51
So this is why the price started climbing. People within the company must have known this.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:28:38
That's very weird indeed.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:18:45
Bugh, now I wish I had my trade-stash over at Bitfinex, this announcement is gonna boost the price back up.
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:29:04
The Winklevii have been pumping in the media again
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:54:59


That's a market inefficiency that would be enough to make you rich if it were accurate.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:22:29


I mean right now. The uncertainty is over. We know why the coins were moved, price should go up in the coming hour i suspect.
I doubt the person buying them from the FBI will dump them onto the market. I expect Wall Street is going to buy them up, trusting that it can do safe business with the US government.
