Very blurry on phone but I assume this is life changing software nonetheless.

This explains the price jump in recent weeks.

Oh thank god. Now I can finally fling penny shavings at strangers through Twitter.

Who? The voices in your head?

Your money has moved to stronger hands. LN working as Satoshi intended. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 19:08:56
Who the fuck would want to send a single Satoshi?

The price went up $30 yesterday. What more proof do you need?

Third highest post on r/bitcoin. Not much going on these day?
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:07:22
Bitcoin adoption unaffected.

Scraping together $3,500? That won’t even buy you a used Kia. High school students can raise that amount of money mowing lawns over the summer.

That’s only because the bot armies are finally being switched off. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 17:27:54
Or pay in cash for no fees. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 02:26:22
Any day now.

Too bad that LN doesn’t work very well. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 00:28:55
Well if OP has been cost averaging for the past 2 years he’s probably underwater on it by now. Great pyramid scheme speech though.

Use local bitcoin. Make sure to meet in person so after transaction you can beat the seller and take you money back. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 19:51:35
That would be less profitable than sucking quarters out of payphones. And probably less fun. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 23:07:38
LN been coming for like 3 years now. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:27:01
Neat. What are you buying using LN?
@_date: 2019-02-15 00:05:05
So do huge disappointments sometimes.
