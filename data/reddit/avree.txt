Most obvious astro-turfing attempt I've seen in a while. Negative comments from established reddit accounts, positive comments from brand new redditors with 0 link karma or account karma.

Solid negativity mixed with paranoia. A staple of the community.

Really? I've never had a bank ATM error out on dispensing my money but remove it from the account—worst thing that happens is that the ATM is out of cash and I have to go to another one.

Either way, you're stupid.
You gambled what you couldn't afford to lose and are now considering 'doubling down' to try and recoup losses.
Sure, you could win, but you could also lose. It's gambling. It's dangerous. You could go buy 100,000 lottery tickets. Yeah, it's a waste—but what if it had gone the other way!

You decided to invest a significant portion of your life savings into an unregulated cryptocurrency traded on unregulated exchanges/markets and lost it.
It totally sucks, but it's not Mt. Gox's fault. It's yours.
