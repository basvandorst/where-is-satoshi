Why are you insistent on praising headlights when I give you an opportunity to discuss the value of art. Just because a company designed headlights which are both functional and aesthetically pleasing does not mean that art gets a pass

Art doesn't have comparable inherent function-- I won't argue that it doesn't have function, because I hope you'll have something to say on that matter, but art on its own is missing the the primary requirement for designing headlights; function. This function can easily be judged objectively on a scale from successful to unsuccessful. Art cannot be judged in a congruent way.

I had a company I work with send a payment over $1k to the incorrect email Paypal address. Paypal account had never been used but was registered over 10 years ago with a name that was now incorrect. As the transaction was over $1k this caused a bunch of AML/KYC processes and as a result Paypal is closing the old account.
Literally the next day I got an email notifying me BTCMarkets also ostensibly randomly decided to also close my account, as they had (my determination) re-evaluated my risk level. 


They claimed it was not related to the Paypal issue but are supposedly not allowed to give any more details and have stone walled. Very disappointing from an exchange I have used for 4 years and done a significant amount of trading volume with, never a single issue. Pretty ridiculous in my opinion but not much I can do. I used Coinjar before this, but the fee structure is a bit outrageous in my opinion. I have also never heard of anyone else's account being closed on BTCMarkets, at least not due to such a trivial matter. Perhaps there is something deeper going on in my finances, but I find it very very difficult to believe that the co-incidence of these two events is unrelated. I should also note that they claim to be an ADCCA member but do not abide by the ADCCA code of conduct or by the governing charter for financial services companies. Let me know if you have any insight into this matter.

While there are definitely issues with your political conceptions... I think the real problem he is identifying is not the status quo per se, but the increasingly aggressive and suppressive repression of any alternative or any progress. My initial opinion is that your ideas on phenomenological entropy and structure are based upon some specific and pared back assumptions, even if those assumptions turn out to be true. As such, I do not think you give fair affordance to the alternatives, even though they are not entirely stated. The coincidence of these two things I have identified is that the progress that is so frustratingly stymied is not revolutionary or intentuous but rather basic instead. The issues that we will face in the future are obvious. Yet the true problem is that we already know how they will be handled by our governments and civil societies, based on the clear trends and patterns we are seeing today. The issue does not metastise in the present, but in temporal flux. The winner does not only write history, but they also have designed the future in their image. We have a clear covalence of profit, people, and existential threats (overpopulation, climate change,  etc) yet at this time it's as though our basic principles of physics and the environment that govern valence, thermodynamics, science itself have not failed, but been intentionally compromised in order to provide us with a cruel disadvantageous circumstance betwixt overt and profligate  exploitation, as the other 'laterals' slowly run out the clock. They decided instead of solving or even trying to solve many problems, not only those that we face now, but those future problems that have predetermined outcomes due to the construction of our political hegemony, and instead they said "fuck it too hard and doesn't benefit us", and not an eyelid was batted.

Not that I really give a shit or have an opinion either way but Dave Rubin is funded by Learn Liberty which is a part of the Institute for Humane Studies which is funded by the Charles Koch foundation and he is on their board of directors. Also his relationship with PraegerU, etc. But if you have followed him for a long time, seen him on Sam Harris, his position on Bernie, Rubinomics, etc, and how he basically reversed a majority of his positions, started having completely different ideologically focused guests, and etc, it's pretty obvious. I am sure if you google it there will be plenty of videos that show him speaking from before he partnered with IHS in 2015 and after, because its really diametically opposed and opposite. Just compare him on Sam Harris show to today.

@_date: 2017-09-30 19:07:03
Excuse me but am I missing something? The estate tax only effects assets worth over $5.5 million. It only effects 0.2% of the populace. 88% of the tax is paid by the top 10%. Only an estimated 5000 estates will be transferred in 2017 that are large enough that the tax is payable. After deductions, these estates generally pay around 1/6th of their value. Only roughly 50 small business and small farm estates nationwide will face any estate tax in 2017. The largest estates generally consist of unrealized capital gains that have never been taxed. Why should they get to pass those gains onto their children for free? This would cost America almost $300 billion in a decade. The amount of increased revenue from the vague prediction of increased motivation and work (???) would easily be destroyed by the extra interest and borrowing the government would have to do to offset the cost. The US charges lower estate tax than most countries in the OECD. The founding fathers advocated for an estate tax. If you want to support the repeal of the estate tax, please at least don't lie and say it's for the middle class.

That is a definition of tautology in terms of propositional logic, which is not really relevant as this statement is logically contingent and wouldn't fit into a propositional calculus argument or a truth table or etc. Either way, your rewriting of the sentence does not hold up-- because they are not saying that someone disagreeing is the reason for a disagreement (contraposition), instead, the title/writer is specifically communicating that JihanWu is the reason. You might come sorta close to a syllogistic statement-- but ONLY under a reader's preconceived notion of what JihanWu means. Therefore it's not tautological, even in a logical formula. Take a minute to read the sidebar and some of the posts in the subreddit you linked or again I invite you to write it in a non-tautological way without losing meaning, and in a way that doesn't equate to the same logical formula as this statement.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:10:16

Can you give us an example of how you might write this title then?
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:08:42


That is a non tautological statement. Not in logical or grammatical terms. Its not pleonastic or hendyiadic in any way unless the reader has a preconceived notion of what seeing the word  inherently conveys, which is not a generally accepted form of inferential meaning. Can you identify the instance of tautology that is not subject to a reader's preconceptions?
To make it easier, what can you remove from the statement to make it non-tautological? That's why I asked him to rewrite it in a non tautological way, because as far as I can tell it can't be done in a way that doesn't lose meaning. People are welcome to make any kind of point they want through imitation or whatever, but leave grammar out of it, or at least get it right.
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:22:50

This is what I get:
You failed to log in. Possible reasons are as follows:
    The username, e-mail address or password that you entered is incorrect.
    The balance of your account with the MTGOX Bitcoin exchange is zero.
    Another person has already filed a bankruptcy claim using your MTGOX account information.
    The bankruptcy trustee believes that you should not be allowed to log in to this system.
    Your username or IP address is blocked due to multiple login failures.
    You did not file a bankruptcy claim using the Online Method within the period during which Users were able to file bankruptcy claims using the Online Method.
If case 5 applies, your access will be unblocked after 24 hours, so please try to log in again after that. For those who want to file a bankruptcy claim but are unable to log in to this system, please file your claim without using this system (please refer to sections regarding the filing of an “offline claim” at  
@_date: 2016-05-26 10:12:24
no it doesn't
the only place at which your claim status is displayed is on the claim status page... 
like [this one]( 
Bankruptcy systems aren't as simplistic as that-- they will never just prevent you from logging in as a way of denying your claim. People need to print even denied claim status information for insurance, tax, etc information. Cannot log in doesn't mean denied. That's just not how it works. If you could never log in, that's a different problem.
