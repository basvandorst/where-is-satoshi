The difference between socialism and communism was invented by Lenin and is false, Marx used and socialists not influenced by leninism use these terms mostly as synonyms. Sometimes term "communist" was/is used to describe current movements, taking place in capitalism. According to this definition, communism is a movement in capitalism to create socialism. Socialism is a moneyless, stateless and classless society.
from the SPGB writings:
" [..] common Leninist distortion which has 'socialism' (really state capitalism), with money, wages, the State, as a society existing between capitalism and communism. For us, the words 'socialism' and 'communism' are exact synonyms and thus interchangeable."

"exactly the same way like with cash" - what part don't you understand? you open a shop, you sell something, you pay taxes. you officially employ people, you (or they) pay taxes. Go to any of legitimate businesses which already accept bitcoin and ask them how their taxes are ("not") working with bitcoin.

"I would rather die in our world than live bound by regulatory chains in theirs, so go ahead and sell, I’ll be sitting ready on the other side of the trade."
Lets keep our bitcoins,  petty bourgeoisie, we have nothing to loose but regulatory chains!!! Oh wait.

exactly, how is vis panel discussion "socialist"?
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:40:19
But we do not live in feodal society now, taxes should be a way to redistribute wealth from the elites to the benefit of the lower classes. The solution is taxing the rich, not abolishing the taxes and consequentially social functions of the state together with them.

Obviously Obama, evil central bankers and undercover tax inspectors are behind the canning. Decided to crush revolutionary world-changing cash retrieval box while it is not too late, because without the famous and dangerous injustice-of-taxation-fighting Dollar Vigilante it will fail.

exactly the same way it works with cash. you buy something you pay real price + VAT.
@_date: 2013-06-21 05:05:06
You can't? Almost all cash transaction are taxed, with, e.g.,VAT.

looked at the video, why the road was done that way?

Aren't you exaggerating just a bit?
"when you tax the rich, they cease to be rich" -&gt; no, they become less rich
"people dont work hard to pay taxes to bureaucrats. " -&gt; they don't pay to bureaucrats, they pay to provide social services, and there are a lot of hard working people who like it that way, because they want states to provide that services.

exactly in the same way as cash

The fraction which goes to bureaucrats is small compared to social services, of course could be even smaller, but that is a separate question.
It is difficult to finance required amount of social services by the taxes in most countries, it is certain it would not be possible with donations alone.

Bitcoin is neither anti-socialist, nor socialist, socialism is moneyless (and tradeless) social system, bitcoin and other currencies only have meaning in capitalism and lower stages.
