As a "regulated company" you should be able to report their shady services, no?

I need to start a gofundme page to raise money to come up with a plan to raise money to make a plan to ... start a gofundme page

last time i did any significant buying/selling was through coinbase.  that was a long while ago, i've been holding for a while ;-)
looks like it *might* be climbing back up already so my guess appears to be wrong lol

I'm holding,  Most of mine is stuff i mined.  I sold what i needed to to ROI (and a little extra) and keeping the roughly 1 BTC i got left long term.
completely un-educated guess, my gut tells me close to 300 in the next day or two.  In the coming weeks no later than march have it hovering between 380-400.
Again that is just what my gut tells me and it has been wrong almost every time. lol but if it gets down to under 300 i'll probably start buying small amounts.

while I don't have the data you probably have... i'm pretty sure some other big names said similar things.... "don't worry folks we have your BTC!" while they are liquidating all their office equipment and running for the hills... 
I dont' think CB is doing this but you have to be mindful that it has happened far to much and it scares people.
