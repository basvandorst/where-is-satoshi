Welcome to Reddit. Where you better get your words right.

Your missing what I am saying. If I don't buy any more bitcoin, I would be OK with it. But if bitcoin goes below 6000, I would then be a buyer. I don't want to buy bitcoin at 7k at this moment. I only would sub 6k because at that point I feel it would be stupid not to. If it went sub 6k then I would DCA from there but my entry point is not 7k.

I guess I missed it. Also, i'm not pressured to buy more. I have in it what I want. I just meant if it goes sub 6000 then id be a buyer.  I'm not looking to force a buy.

I'm looking for 6000 myself. I don't want to see it drop that low but if It does, I'm buying.

Don't invest your 6k. Don't invest nothing either.

11 years for who? Maybe you but a lot of people are still just learning about Bitcoin and even more than that still don't care to learn at all yet. Do you really expect people to not ask questions?

Awesome I will do this. Thank you.

At the moment, yes. But there might come a time where a second layer is added that makes everyday purchases the perfect use for Bitcoin. As you know, real adoption is just starting and things will likely change dramatically with Bitcoin over the next 10 years.

Also, Whats a good way for me to test that my 24 word recovery phrase works fine? I didn't think of these things when I bought my first one but I want to make sure everything is perfect with the second. I don't want to get years down the road and realize my recovery phrase is off.

I will order one directly from ledger today. Thank you for the information. I have never heard about spending 2% on security a year.

I guess we would have to define "real" if your going to nit pick my comment. Otherwise, this is just our opinions.

Yea I think the device is OK as well because my xrp has set on it for so long. I also agree that KNOWING it's safe is worth 60 dollars for a new one. Thank you for the information.

Plot twist: The guy helping is the one extorting her and he helped her send BTC to himself. :P

I will just get a new one to be safe. I don't mind getting a new one I just wish I could use this one or give to father to use knowing it was safe.   O well.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:59:30
I will do this. Thank you.
