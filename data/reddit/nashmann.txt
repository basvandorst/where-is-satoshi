It was destroyed because Saddam dared to start selling his Oil in Euros instead of (Petro) Dollars. He even sued for it at the UN and the UN ruled on his behalf.
Btw, the same story as with Lybia. Gaddafi started selling his Oil for their newly created Gold Dinar. He dared to actually expect tangible goods instead of the toilet paper that is the Petro Dollar for his Ressources. Well.. the USA didnt like that one bit and the rest is history.

That gives me another question:
I've downloaded the official bitcoin client but i didn't have to create any kind of account so how exactly does anyone know that this is my wallet?
Are those generated keys tied to the client itself? To computer hardware? What happens when i have to reinstall the client?
