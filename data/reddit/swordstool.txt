Yeah, but I'm hoping it lasts for at least a few months before imploding. Every day is $12 free for me =)

Exactly. OP thinks they should get it for just giving their e-mail address. I'm in for $120! Not much, but if it pays out $363 in a month (like it says  it will), I will be ecstatic (in about 27 days)! If I lose it, oh well. How much are you in for?

I suggest withdrawals until you get your $135 back. That's what I did. I think a ponzi would want you to reinvest rather than withdraw because you think it looks like it's working, right? ;)

It's a scam because they won't just give you a few cents per day for free? Not sure that's enough evidence by itself. Why would anyone give you a few cents per day for free (or "free", if you prefer)? Maybe you should look at is as more of a "bonus" than "free". From a quick look at their site, it's clear they are not native English speakers.

I put in $120 about 11 days ago and withdrew $120 to my wallet on Saturday, so I'm even. Now I'm going to do daily withdrawals, about $12/day. Just did today's and it came through to my wallet. =)

Their calculator says 10KH/s yields $43.80/year (profit). Do you know if you are assuming the same cost for electricity and power consumption?  Just curious about the huge difference between $0.000003 and $43.80! haha!

Oh, they will at some point. Just recoup and get more while you can!
