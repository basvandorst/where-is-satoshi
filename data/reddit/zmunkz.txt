...was this for real?

Good to know! Thx

Whenever I get a full BTC, I send it to a paper wallet created on an isolated Ubuntu instance. Nothing safer than offline, eh? As long as I don't lose these damn pieces of paper...

I wish I had your confidence... I'm selling out half my holdings. It seems to me if this scenario doesn't resolve quietly and we get a fork, there will not be a recovery. What serious institutions/investors will play with a market that can split at the whim of some random developers? I think only chance of a bounce-back is a resolution to this issue that does not end in fork

If you have your coins cold and then bring them online by importing the PK on one fork to (say) blockchain, does that make the coins on the other fork vulnerable? Or is no special action required at all to safely use both coins?

I'm fairly new to the undercurrents of bitcoin as well. From what I've found, there are two different camps bickering about how to solve bitcoin's scaling issues... and instead of compromising, they are playing a game of chicken with a potential endgame of breaking the network into two different versions, which will likely kill the value and credibility of each resulting network. Lots of politics in there too. What to do? I don't know... if you think one solution or the other will ultimately prevail, then just sit and wait. Things will get bumpy, but rebound. If you think they will not agree and cause the network to fork, my guess is the resulting bitcoins (BTC and BTU) will lose almost all value and does not recover.

The actual value will be set by the market as always. If you release double the circulation of currency into any economy overnight, you can expect a corresponding drop in currency value. Put simply, 1BTC trading at 1K would then become 1BTC and 1BTU each trading at 500. This won't actually be the case since the situation also introduces a great deal of uncertainty and instability into the currency... so really, you can expect each to fall well below 500.

I tried to panic and unload a couple but my xfer from cold to blockchain is still unconfirmed after 4 hours... so maybe I'll be saved from myself, lol.

It could... this whole situation has completely undermined the stability/credibility BTC earned over the last year. I'm worried.

So in the fork/die scenario, does pre-fork market value return to the surviving chain? Or does the instability of the event hold down value? I'm a bit of a n00b with this stuff still.

Helpful video, thanks. Where can I go for a good BCC block explorer to watch as it forks off? Also, what's a good site for watching prices of BTC and BCC? I still use bitcoinwisdom, which I am told is not maintained... so I doubt it will have BCC added. thx.

Not if you have the PKs. That is the only piece of information needed to transact with coins on a given chain
