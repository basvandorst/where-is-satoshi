Well, the coins are on the move again. The one that took them has deposited them into BTC-e (at least some of them). Now, hopefully BTC-e will cooperate in further tracking.

Most of the collected details are in the thread. Anyone have any further ideas?
All of the Bitcoin which was stolen from me was sent to 1Jzfd4LXB4i8Txm8F457QaHDmHxZJAJYjv, and all of the stolen Litecoin was sent to Li5k5sYdyWD5gDR9TkaU5vk6tDB63XdQRw.

They're new accounts because I've never had much to say on Bitcointalk or Reddit, until just recently. You'll find my Bitcoin OTC registrations go back much further, and you'll find input transactions into my wallets from even earlier. So, yes, I've been dealing with it for years, but during a temporary lapse in keeping it all safe, it all went away. It wasn't an unsecured testing server, it was a machine at home doing a few tasks. One of which was some development work, which is where ElasticSearch ended up being exposed to the Internet when it wasn't supposed to be (yeah, my fault, I know, there was a bad port forward). Normally, I didn't leave $200k sitting on that machine, but I was in the process of consolidating coins and moving them off to some cold storage, and that's when it all took place.
I didn't post what I've posted to have people remind me what I could've done (I'm well aware), just to see if anyone could assist me in tracking down who took them. I know people want to imagine they were all just sitting there unsecured for years, but it just isn't the case. Bad timing and bad decisions, but I'd still like to seek out who took them.
