Yep, seeing it not collapse to 3000 means the volitility is going down. 
It also means the insane returns are about to go away

Bcash isnt rare. Its just the latest pump and dump alt bitcoin.
The only difference, more people got screwed into it. 
There is only 1 bitcoin. There are infinity alt coins.

Its super rare and a hedge against government currency.
Transaction fees or not, if you are afraid of your government currency, bitcoin has historically been better at holding value. 
South Korea + African Dictatorships have already proven this concept.

Ive been running a business for 3 years, and I'm finally pivoting and want to try something new.
The problem is that I genuinely lost faith in the USD + I think the returns on crypto would be greater than starting a company. 
The returns have been insane, with my understanding, I feel its foolish of me not to invest my 3k/week in cypto, but rather employees and infrastructure. I really do expect minimum 1000% returns over the next 2 years. I'm almost wondering if I should be using my time rather than money to make progress on my goals.

Still decentralized, it does require an infrastructure. 
Also, its still rare.

Eh, I'm expecting a coinbase takeover. Make all transactions through banks like boring paper money. 
But then an alt coin will take over and be quite a technology.
