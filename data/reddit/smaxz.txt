i'm getting it too, but its just a "error occured, report bug" page instead.
out of curiosity, how close to questionable accounts/activity do you have to be for coinbase to flag your account? will a withdraw from btc-e do it? recent mixing?
i mean the ledger based tech crypto is founded on makes it pretty easy to be completely innocent and not 3 degrees of separation from a quite seedy underworld.
of course fiat it just as bad but not as traceable.

So checking [  it seems over a thousand zero fee txn's went through today, is that correct?
I submitted a low fee txn today as I saw the mempool size becoming pretty reasonable and it confirmed in a lot less time (hours) than expected.
although i think side chains are the way forward, its good to see one can still roll their own for a reasonable price if they are willing to wait or make corrections in the future to push through.

I blame F2Pool and their choice in apparel as the major contributing factor

this does not surprise me.
if you have more than an negligable amount of coins you wish to keep safe than they should be in a multisig address just in case "lightning strikes" and there is a collision of your private key.
however improbable, the possibility exists.. not for your targeted privkey specifically but for random ones, as this experiment reveals.

a standard core node? how do you get it to rebroadcast automatically like that?
also curious how to get an estimate of the txn size prior to sending.. i see features to set price per byte but nothing to decipher what the actual txn size will be for given amounts.

I think antpool has a pretty dedicated following for the mining of Bitcoin.
If they start mining BU there will be defectors for sure.

i think an empowering resolution would be not only to reprimand the accounts used in this behavior but notify all the victims and inform them of whatever action has been taken.

thanks for the compliment. translation basically is: this happens, strap in cause whales will take their profits, fear must keep the hoards from buying up just to leech profits down the road and.. ultimately, establishing terms of steadily increasing/decreasing value helps entrench the concept that this can stand the test of time.

save all the wallet .dat's you find and name them wallet.da1 wallet.da2 etc accordingly.  
  
get a new core wallet up and running. after it is completely sync'd it will have created a wallet.dat that is empty. i would say delete this but for safety sake rename it wallet.new and copy wallet.da1 into this folder as wallet.dat when bitcoin-qt is not running.  
  
now restart qt (core, the graphical wallet, your node.. many names but refers to same program) and any previous transactions or current balances should appear.  
  
repeat for each wallet.daX you have recovered.  
  
good luck!

when given multiple choices and one of them is "leave things as they are and see what happens" then that generally becomes the decision most lean toward.
The chances of "do nothing" being chosen rises invariably the more additional options are added to the mix.
explain to them that if bitcoin 10x in value they could turn that $307 in $3070 and see if they bite.
then explain the value of a diversified portfolio.
also explain what the bank is doing to them with positive reinforcement by giving them treats every 10th deposit.

probably better suited for altcoin subs, but before this drops off main page let me leave some data for you.
proof of work can be divided into separate algorithms. difficulty correction can be studied as well as propagation times and treatment of orphaned blocks.
there are proof of stake coins like blackcoin.
there are proof of chain coins like clams.
some coins combine methods for diversity like novacoin (pow and pos.)
there are coins that use proof of service like darkcoin/dash masternode reward system on top of pow.
other coins piggy back off another blockchain for whats generically known as merge mining.

 its not as easy as you think to give bitcoin to prominent figures.
i tried to send like 1/4 btc as a tip to the owner of a business i have a good relationship with, and they said thanks but no thanks.

interesting I accidentally checked destina.com initially which redirected to air canada immediately.. 
wonder how long destinia has accepted bitcoin, I've always used cheapair and love that I now have an option.
assuming destina is AC's domain and redirect I wonder how long they have owned that url and whether destinia.com generates enough revenue to put them on air canada's radar.
air canada accepting bitcoin directly. would be pretty big.
personally I would like my own bitcoin cabin traveling class equipped with gaming laptops, massage recaro reclining seats and customized rgb seating pod.

this is good to hear..
something as simple as:
"Default fee for next block is Xsatoshi per byte totaling xx fee for your tx to process immediately. click customize to select your own fee and see an estimate of the time this will take for the bitcoin network to validate" 
Would be stellar.
