The efficient market theory (which I agree with) states that all the known information is reflected in the current price. 
Every price it’s at, it’s at for a reason. With a fixed supply and an increase in demand, it’s easy to see why we are in a ‘bubble’. Just use dollar cost averaging (investopedia is your friend)

I wouldn't say thousands. I don't remember what the block reward is at currently but its probably less than 300 a day. Im also talking about how early adopters lost hundreds of bitcoin that were worth pennies each so we have no idea what the real total supply is.

Shshshshshsh 
Don't spread this kinda information yet.

I personally thought it talked too much about the history and didn't dumb it down enough, and go into the history of the failures of traditional banking, and he solutions bitcoin has for them.
It was entertaining though.

Lol, too much skin in the game for people to let that happen

WHAT 9000?!?!?!?!

You have magnificently refuted all his points with only a vague sentence that neither attempts to elaborate on its own point, and adds no value to this discussion. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:04:39
I would say no

Your last two statements cannot exist at the same time.

Exactly why the price should rise
Regardless of demand. The value
Of fiat will naturally go down in a predictable way

Sure, if the alternative wasn't collapsing the economy harder, I'd say it's an easy choice for the government. But the most powerful government in the world doesn't simply run out of money to bail people out with. And everybody has their hand stretched out, from colleges benefiting off student loans to Wall Street.

Its just that markets are made of people, and people have a long memory, and will ultimately make the recovery harder if an economy isn't stimulated. But I see your point as well. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:22:02
Supply is 61 trillion

I know what you are getting at, but perhaps there is an area in the middle we have yet to discover. Perhaps in the future, software that is ubiquitous and impossible to take down (like bitcoin or etherum) will govern certain market systems, if not all, effectively eliminating the government from requiring the federal reserve. 
That part I'm all for. 
But a societal collapse because public utilities cannot be supported  cannot be advocated for. I dream of a world based on the automation of food production, water production, clean air production, energy production, and for all these services to be performed with blockchain technology or whatever successor it may have, but these things require government funding whether you want them to or not. We are not at a point in time where people can vote for AI government to magically implement things (by voting with blockchain technology) to optimally run a country. We will still have to rely on people. 500 years from now maybe all countries will be taken down by bitcoin, but I'm only here for another 50.

It's like that movie Tron where the users have special privileges and the AI (in this case the industry) want to determine what the users, and the digital people can do. 
Throw in some Segwit buzzwords, some USAF and you've got the making for a movie. 
I have no idea what the fuck is going on, but like everybody I can pretend
