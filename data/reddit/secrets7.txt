Bitgold is not a Crypto. It's money stored in Gold that you can use a debit card to spend. You can also redeem it as Bitcoin, to banks or whatever. 
As it's stored in Gold there is no risk of the company getting shut down by regulators like with Bitreserve which has no regulatory approvals.

Yeah, that guy was the very first to mention Bitgold on reddit, days after the press release when they announced their financing. I'd bet 1000 bitcoin that he works for Bitreserve and is just slamming competition.

Its comparable from the consumers point of view. Decentralization is of interest to libertarians, but the end value is Paypal like functionality without the fees along with the added value of a storage &amp; investment medium like a Bank or a Gold ETF.  Transfer money, store money, spend money etc..
I think the main conceptual difference between pecunix would be that instead of IOU's you are holding actual gold, in your name and stored in a Brinks Vault. That can't be hacked as there is no digital currency to take. It's a digital transfer system instead. 
Obviously Soros and Sprott being being behind it along with a Public listing adds some peace of mind that Bitcoin exchanges don't have after MtGox and all the other thefts.  This lack of security is what keeps big banks or corps from investing in Bitcoin, while they might be more willing, and already do, Invest / Speculate in Gold.

The company Bitgold, mentioned earlier in the thread, addresses this issue by storing the Physical gold with Brinks, insured, in numbered cubes and does not do fractional reserve lending. As a publicly listed company they are also liable for accountancy audits every quarter to verify reserves and they have no ability to access or use customers assets. 
As the Gold is stored in Vaults with Brinks they cannot be hacked or lose the Gold in digital format. 
If you want the physical product you can just ask them to ship it to you.. 
Bitreserve on the other hand are operating an illegal and unregulated bank with their "transparent reserves" in bitcoin and obligations in real currency. One hack or collapse in Bitcoin prices and they are done, insolvent and bankrupt

Basically he says that Bitgold has the potential to change the market for investing in gold and that its the same thing as Bitcoin from a consumer point of view in that it's a Digital method of transacting value. However, it could be better than Bitcoin because it has a tangible Value and that makes it more stable. He goes on to say that Bitcoin hit a peak valuation of $4bn and he thinks Bitgold could hit multiple times that valuation. Currently it's at $250m
He invested $3m into it Pre IPO so he's sitting on a $24m win after the first 5 days of trading
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:19:27
No, An IOU is I promise to pay you in Gold if you ask for it. This already has the Gold registered in your name. 
Look at Bitreserve. They hold IOU's with funds stored in Bitcoin, but obligations in real currency.. That is risky as hell should they get hacked or Bitcoin tanks overnight. They have $1.5m in total holdings. Bitgold just traded $50m in 4 days on the markets and is getting big name investors like Bitreserve never managed. It's Bitreserve done right with the risk eliminated. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 04:19:23
Sigh, ignoring your down-voting of simple statements of fact there is no magical duplication required. 
It's not storing a digital currency which can just be taken, its operating a storage facility and transfer system. 
Paypal don't magically replace dollars, they just reverse the transfer. I don't know if Bitgold will actually reverse transfers or not should your account get hacked or someone ships you a box of rocks, but they could, unlike Bitcoin where you can see the wallet your stolen coins are sitting in without being able to do anything about it. 
They do have an ID verification system so at least they can see ID and phone numbers of anyone setting up an account. That limits the opportunity for fraud somewhat, although of course they can't account for crap passwords or a failure to implement the 2FA
@_date: 2015-05-07 20:49:32
If they fear rapid inflation is on the Horizon you might not want to put millions of their dollars into Bitcoin.. It could gain or lose 25% at the drop of a hat. 
Your options are:
 wire the money to a bank account you set up in the US.
Thats it.
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:31:17
What if they can't pay because they don't have anything backing the IOU??
[The Hunt brothers](  bought billions in Silver futures contracts and then demanded delivery. The sellers were unable to find silver to settle the contracts because they had nothing backing them. 
The difference here is 
     You ask, you Might get Gold 
Vs 
     You already have Gold. 
Either way, what is slowing widespread Bitcoin adoption is that it is an intangible asset which is constantly being digitally stolen or worse, lost. This solves that issue, whilst still providing much of the benefits. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 01:13:52
Gold is extremely stable over the long term.. Far more so than any other currency you might point to. It rises with inflation, falls with deflation. In real terms the price barely changes outside of short term fluctuations. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:24:53
Bitcoin adopters will probably be the earliest users of the service. One of the applications is that you can transfer Bitcoin into your Gold account and then spend it with the debit card. 
Also, as a concept the idea fixes a lot of the issues with Bitcoin, while maintaining the benefits. Eg, Tangibly backed digital currency that is actually spendable anywhere, at the street level and managed by a publicly listed company with an audit trail
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:53:49
They are public and have all their financials published. With $30m in cash and no debt I don't think they are "Struggling to keep head above water" as you suggest. 
They issued bonuses to new accounts and then if those accounts didnt log in for 60 days they pulled the bonus. 
Fair enough when you consider this would otherwise be  $12 worth of real gold sitting in a vault untouched for all eternity. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:10:30


To prevent people buying Gold with stolen credit cards and then withdrawing to Bitcoin. They don't want to become fraud center like Bitreserve / upworth who are basically a bitcoin tumbler at this point with 700m in transaction volume and only 10 hits on google news. 
They are a public company and have to hold themselves a higher standard than all these other set ups which are just trying to cream what they can before getting shut down by the regulators or before they owners scarper with the balances. 
The fact that Bitgold is setting up their system is compliance with the regulations and forgoing revenues they could be making shows that they are setting up for the long term rather than the quick hit.

This is no different to trying to withdraw $10k from a bank without ID. It's illegal for them to comply. 
Not only that, the company is worth $400m and publicly listed on the TSX, not a pink sheet exchange. They have no use for $10k in stolen user funds and could not use it even if they did take it.

He is obviously refusing to provide ID and is trying to shift stolen money or coins, but cant get them through a bank so he tries Bitgold and then runs to Reddit to try and shame them into releasing his money. 
Allowing fraudulent funds on their system is exactly why Egold was shut down so I fully understand why Bitgold want to do things legally..

We know the identity of the specific user who has made these posts because their situation is most definitely not a common one on the BitGold platform."   
For 99% of users, if we require additional information in addition to the typical KYC, we do not suspend the account, we simply request the additional information from them. **In this case, a suspension was absolutely necessary.** My apologies if I had not made the seriousness of this situation more clear.
OP is a fraudster. Bottom line.

Hello new account created to respond to this topic. OP? Is that you? 
You need to provide ID when you open an account. Op said he was asked for documentation when withdrawing, which would be verifying that ID. 
All his other posts are about the trouble he is having shifting large amounts of money, $200k - $500k through the banking system, locally and internationally over a period of many months. 
Bitgold then said in this case it was necessary to suspend the account as oppose to just looking for verification. 


For 99% of users, if we require additional information in addition to the typical KYC, we do not suspend the account, we simply request the additional information from them. In this case, a suspension was absolutely necessary. My apologies if I had not made the seriousness of this situation more clear.
Read into that what you will. I read a fraudster or thief trying and failing to get past KYC regulations in multiple financial institutions.

He said it right [Here]( and then edited the comment when I called him out on it. Note Edit history 15 hours on a 3 day old comment.  See also the comment two below when he says he has "prolonged Personal Experience" of trying to get money through the banking system. 
I wonder why you felt the need to create an account to cast all this FUD.. Your well written thoughts indicate you are educated enough to understand KYC / AML regulations, but apparently not educated enough to understand why a public company would enforce those regulations. 
Maybe you are competitor taking advantage of the situation to throw in a few digs. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:27:09
Goldmoney are about to launch a Bitcoin Exchange though which is why Shiff's comments slamming Bitcoin all the time are so strange. On the community forums the CEO listed a bunch of features that are due to be added in the next few weeks and one of them was "Crypto Buy". 
If it follows the path of the other currencies they have that would mean buying or selling Bitcoin for 0.5% margin with no exchange fees. They already use this rate to accept Bitcoin to Gold transfers.

He has this gem buried in there. I edited the previous post at the same time you posted the reply - Goldmoney Accumulating Bitcoin every day - 


This is the amount of Bitcoin they take daily in trade for Gold, which he then either sells or holds as he sees the market going. That's where the 17,000 Bitcoin came from originally. 
Granted, he bashes Bitcoin an awful lot of a guy who accepts so much of it, however I guess that's no different from Peter Shiff bashing USD while accepting them for his gold either. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:27:53
Well, it does make for a very easy way to spend Bitcoin with a debit card by redeeming it as Gold. 
It also makes a good way to tumble coins as you can buy gold, then redeem again as Bitcoin 
Also, it's not an IOU.. It's actual nominated gold deposited in Brinks. They have $1.5bn in Gold under storage and got more deposits this month than Bitreserve got in the last 18 months. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 08:31:49
Ask for the gold to be shipped to you if you dont like the counterparty risk.. Otherwise just use it for the free transfers or low transactions costs.. 
Bitcoiners always like to cite the counterparty risk, but this has many benefits over paypal or credit cards or even bitcoin. Counterparty risk is something every transaction outside of Bitcoin has.
On the other hand the counterparty risk is a lower risk than Bitcoins risks such as Counterparty theft in exchanges or just straight depreciation and price swings.

The model is built to target institutional or high net worth clients rather than retail investors. Its addressing the risk of hacks / theft, creating an ability to get insurance on coins under storage and creating a solution to confirm source of the coins by buying them direct from miners and then tracking the history. This is very important for institutional investors. 
  
Main elements -  
  
- They will buy the Bitcoins directly from Miners so institutional clients can know the history of the coins and know that they are not connected to theft or crime in any way.
- The crypto will be consolidated into blocks and stored cold with Brinks. Buyers will then hold ownership of the blocks which are insured for loss or theft. It's the same way they allocate ownership of Gold bars to customers. The ownership can be transferred to other people creating free currency exchange or shipped in physical coins, or picked up at the vault if you want.
- This is fairly big for hedge funds who don't have the infrastructure for buying &amp; safely storing Crypto in bulk and would be concerned about hacks in exchanges, screwups by staff charged with storing the crypto or AML regulations resulting in coins being seized. They have bylaws in place that prohibit such investments and this solution address's those weaknesses.
  
In my opinion, this could drive a lot of demand into the market from big institutional players as it creates a frictionless onramp and ultimately it's good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:58:02
They have $2bn in metals in vaults and storage fees are 0.12% annually. That's $120 for every $100,000. It would take a long time to dwindle away. 
Also if you use the Gold for payments or transfers over $500 a month the storage is free.

The firm is taking a page from its history in precious metals, and proposes physically storing bitcoin and ether in vaults across the globe. The mechanism, called cold blocks, seems like something from a James Bond movie: They’re engraving parts of the cryptopgraphic signature, which is used to bind the buyer with the value, on three different pieces of gold stored in three separate vaults. "It’s like having three physical golden keys," he explains.
  
  
One key will be stored with an insurance provider, the second with an auditor, and the third with the vault provider. That way, Goldmoney’s financial statements can be audited and clients can be insured against theft. Investors will be able to trade ownership of the metal key.

You can buy crypto with Gold or fiat. The store Gold, Platinum, Eth, BTC etc and any of those can be changed into any other one or transferred to another account holder without exchange fees.

Keeping your crypto on a USB in your bedside locker might work for you, but it's not going to work for a hedgefund or a High Net Worth individual with a lot of it. 13% of Bitcoin are said to be irretrievably lost though forgotten passwords, lost cell phones, corrupted hard drives or burnt down houses and how many hundreds of thousands were lost in hacks, thefts &amp; exit scams? There are new stories about it every week. 
None of the existing exchanges have their holdings insured and most of them are not even doing independent audits. Having audits and insurance negates third party risk because you still get paid out if there is a problem.

This is basically the problem that Goldmoney solves. They can ship you gold, but they will also hold it for you and you can spend it with a debit card, changing to cash at the current spot rate. Its like an ETF where you get actual gold instead of an IOU

That depends on what you want the crypto for.
