 \(It doesn't have the apostrophe, just like `theyll`\)

Hey guys!
I just solved it! It was a sudoku, as u/kallebo1337 said. Thank you very much u/ZoTrAcK for the puzzle, it was very funny!
After solving the sudoku \([ I used all the 81 numbers in the bip39 mnemonic generator \([ as raw entropy and it gave me the 24 words which I used as the seed to recover the BIP49 address using Electrum wallet \([
I hope it helps someone with future puzzles and I also hope our community keeps enjoying of this kind of games that are so empowering.
