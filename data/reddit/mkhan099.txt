Here is a way to use your credit card and pay only %1.85 percent is fees. This is a little bit more work but the other upside is you can purchase a lot more than the usual $750 per week limit they put on credit cards.
Step 1:
Go to CVS and purchase 4 my vanilla prepaid debit cards and load maximum amount of $500 in each. Daily limit is $2000. Each card will cost an additional $5.95. You can use any credit card to purchased $2000 worth of debit for a cost of $2023.80. But almost every single credit card offer %1 cash back on all purchases, so that cost is actually $2003.50
Step 2:
Go to any Publix and get 4 western union money orders with your prepaid debit cards for $500 each which will cost you $0.89 cent each, for a total cost of $3.56. Money orders are as good as cash, and can be deposited to your bank without additional cost.
So for $2000 dollars of cash you only paid $3.50 + $3.56 = $7.06. That is only 0.35% of the total cash amount. 
Step 3:
From your bank you can do same day wire transfer to coinbase for a fee of about $30 (depending on the bank).
So to add it all together, so far your cost has been $30+7.06 = $37.06. 37.06/2000 = only %1.85 percent. In addition to this if you use gdax, you will not pay any transaction fee for buying/selling crypto (there are many youtube videos on this)
The biggest advantage to this technique is to be able to purchase more than the weekly limit while technically still using your credit card and cutting your fee down by half.
