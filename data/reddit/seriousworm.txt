Btw, I'm working on a Bitcoin market for Android apps.

Is it OK if it's a standalone server application, running on the JVM (written in Scala)?  You could access the generated page from your browser, it would be exactly like any other page.

It's ok, cool, no need to duplicate existing functionality. :)
@_date: 2012-02-16 10:23:34
OK, thanks.

What's the memory sweet spot frequency for this card?
@_date: 2011-07-06 19:18:13
I can. Did you follow my instructions correctly?

Haha, thanks for the answers, although I don't remember asking that many questions. :) I wish I had some extra btc to send but if I do make a similar evo alg (and I probably will) I'll definitely send some of my profits, if I make any.
I attented an optional evo alg semester-long course in my college led by a programming god called Marko Čupić. The full name of the course was (translated) "Solving optimisation problems using evolutionary computation algorithms in Java".
Feel free to pm me your donation address, though.

Moneybookers. Works well even for people in Europe but not in the EU.

Actually, no, you can't.

If you pay zero electricity fees, sure. If you have a 300W+ solar panel array, sure. Otherwise, no.

Haha, I was thinking about making a bitcoin automated trading GA-based bot last night before going to sleep. Now I wake up and I see this. :) Well, congrats.
Now, what kind of GA is it? A standard GA or one of the specialized variants? Have you thought about other kinds of evolutionary algorithms? Do you only use single objective optimization? Have you thought about using NSGA-2 or a similar multi objective algorithm, does that even make any sense in this kind of evo alg application?
Is your problem space continuous or discrete? How about particle swarm optimization? Differential evolution?

Have you looked at Scala / Akka? The combination is perfectly suited for highly concurrent, high performance, safe and readable code. It's easy to transition from Java to Scala and in any case Akka supports Java as well. Also, I'm pretty sure the JVM is much more suited for this task, as opposed to a Javascript VM.

How come you haven't looked at Scala + Akka? It's a modern highly concurrent type safe combination, based on the actor model. Scala provides an awesome concise language, miles ahead of Java while still running on the highly performant JVM, while Akka provides the concurrency and allows easy scaling. All Java libraries are of course available, too. You can even hot swap code easily with JRebel (free for Scala users).
