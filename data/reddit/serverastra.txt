Nobody bought anything.
And we got small publicity (reddit brought hundreds of times more exposure than bitcoinblackfriday.com).
I think site operators made little marketing of their sellers, thus little traffic. It does not help our webdesign is due to being updated for a long time.
Either this or that Black Friday is not that good, Cyber Monday might be better.
I know we have small target group of users (who needs unmetered european servers or vps's in USA?) but the count of visitors is really low (from Europe). And barely distinguishes from our usual posts on webhostingtalk.com
By the way if someone here decides to buy, the promo code is BITCOIN and it's only for Bitcoin direct payments.

I see, this is a 2.5" system, we can bundle it with 6x750GB sata drives though (Seagate Momentus 7200.5 750GB (ST9750420AS))
But it will cost a bit more (+10 euros per month) as these drives are not Desktop cheap.
Also I must tell you that we follow the ToS, so no spam, warez, ddos, open relays, botnets, open proxys etc are allowed in our systems.
We do not forbid Legal activity (like Tor for example or VPN or Hosting) but will prevent our network from going into antispam lists and other reputation reducing lists.
We give 24 hours to fix small abuse and 6 hours in case of CP or fraud.
There is also a 3 abuse limit per month after which we ask for ID and residence proof.
Hope this sorts out any questions for you.
If you have more, don't hesitate to contact me or info
Have a nice day! :)

Dear xaoq, the drives you want to use are possible to install on the following systems:
Supermicro Centauri (max 2 drives) (SATA3)
Intel Pluto (max 2 drives) (SATA1 only, old system)
Intel Regulus (max 4 drives) (Intel r040 RAID card)
Intel Jupiter (max 4 drives) (SATA2)
All of these systems are available. We can install 2x2 drives during the day only though (as they are not that popular)
But I can give you a discount on 2x3 TB drives - we have them in stock, there is actually one Centauri ready with them.

We will surely change the design, unfortunately it is heavily inscribed into our crm...
As soon as our main website  (css3 + html5) will be ready all of the payment processing will be handled there (because we are fed up with security holes in whmcs).
This will allow us to change our showcase website's design on a brink.
The one you see now is a design from 2007 finished in 2008 and applied in 2009 :).
Please don't cringe, just pick a service and check them out.
Kind Regards,

That's surprising because we do get orders and payments in Bitcoins regularly.
Just not this day...

I did not notice this yesterday,
The Supermicro platform would be better for you, here is why.
The CPU [Intel Xeon E3-1230 V2]( in it is 1000 points passmark benchmark faster then the [Dual Xeon E5450]( And you can customize the memory to be 16 GB DDR3 1333 (or 1600 mhz) and of course ECC for a small additional fee. And the hard drives are 2x 2TB SATA3 without a problem, as well as our offer - 2x3TB for the same price.
IPKVM is included free of charge as always.
100 mbps unmetered as well.
Feel free to contact us for a quote, or just order from our website directly.
Looking forward doing business with you :)

Seems like they do convert it automatically.
We keep prices in euros but receive payments in Bitcoins for now (they don't offer transfer to our country in Euros or USD but we are negotiating it).
