What do you think about USDT (Tether) moving out from OMNI to Ethereum? What pros/cons does it has for Bitcoin?

Puerto Banus (Marbella, Spain) is one of the spots where the multimillionaires go for living and holidays. It's full of rich Russians and Arabs among others who enjoy the good weather, luxury shops and the port full of big yatches. A good place to promote Bitcoin.

Pre-mined... check. &gt;&gt; Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet own 1M of the first BTC mined
Centralized around individual or organization... check &gt;&gt; Bitcoin Core developers 
Rolled back blockchain to revert transaction (WTF)... check. &gt;&gt;  Bitcoin rolled back in August 8th 2010:
[…] 9. That time someone hacked 92 billion BTC into existence
On 8th August 2010 bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik wrote what could be mildly described as the biggest understatement since Apollo 13 told Houston: “We’ve had a problem here.”
“The ‘value out’ in this block is quite strange,” he wrote on bitcointalk.org, referring to a block that had somehow contained 92 billion BTC, which is precisely 91,979,000,000 more bitcoin than is ever supposed to exist.
CVE-2010-5139 (CVE meaning ‘common vulnerability and exposures’) was frighteningly simple and exploited to the point of farce by an unknown attacker. In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error.
So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In layman’s terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process.
The fix was the bitcoin equivalent of dying in a video game and restarting from the last save point. The community simply hit ‘undo’, jumping back to the point in the blockchain before the hack occurred and starting anew from there; all of the transactions made after the bug was exploited – but before the fix was implemented – were effectively cancelled.
How serious was it? Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir Van Der Laan is pretty blunt about it, telling me: “It was the worst problem ever.”
Perhaps, but bitcoiners have seemingly been trying to trump it ever since.[…]

Considering is Puerto Banus (Marbella, Spain) probably mainly with money laundry. Lots of rich Russian, Arabs, Germans, British... go there for holidays and living. It's a sunny and luxury destination within Europe.

Then better contact them, they will assign you a kind of relationship manager who will give you the correct approach. I think you do it right as could be helpful in the future to document such a large buy.
@_date: 2018-10-28 08:21:03
What do you mean in person? Go to their office with the cash? They will require you to do kyc (know your costumer) and AML (anti money laundering) compliance. If no problem with it you can safely do it with Kraken.

The protestors was smashing another police in the ground and decide to hit with a metal bar the police with the gun... also the guy was dressed with full fight gear. I see it as legitimate defense by the police.

Some people think the same about taxes. Anyway just move out of China.

Yes, I am sure. There are not easy on ramps fiat-crypto in HK so the ATMs take advantage of it.
In Europe is very easy with SEPA transfer to Krake/Coinbase pro.... and EUR/BTC pairs, but HK banks are not friendly to crypto and not many HKD/BTC pairs.

They will do a chargeback. Probably the paypal account is stolen and Paypal will not take care of your loss.

How do you buy Bitcoin in HK? (I have seen very high fees in HK)
@_date: 2019-12-09 01:56:34
How much are the fees? 7-10%?
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:52:05
 \[...\] The fee for both cash in deposits and cash out withdrawals is 1.5%. Exchanging between any currencies available on the app comes at a flat fee of 1.5% too. So for example, if you want to [buy Bitcoin with cash]( using HKD, the total transaction will be around **3%**. \[...\]
Thanks for the info. Not bad to be an unfriendly crypto place like Hong Kong. (Quite difficult to buy/sell there).

It's running on a DPOS basis. Binance owns all the nodes. If they want they take your funds or reverse transactions.

Not in China. Liable executives will have to respond with their personal assets of they are considered guilty.

Buy Bitcoin with cash in China must be more expensive. What is the price spread compared to your EU exchange gateway?
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:04:31
The OP already admitted in the comments that not all of the 1200 BTC belong to him. Probably law enforcement is investigating why he is managing such funds (could be considered money laundry). Also sure he has breached the terms&amp;conditions of Binance due to that.

Is there any place where to check the Bakkt historic daily volume?
Maybe slowly, but seems it is increasing.

There is a 8% interest gain for lending WBTC (wrapped BTC in Ethereum) in Compound. Is it interesting or worthy to use it to increase the BTC stack of a holder? Anyone has experience with BTC and DeFi platforms?

You can see today's volume (142 BTC futures), but not previous days ones.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:57:46
Bakkt was disappointing the first day with only 73 contracts/BTC, but I think it will start gaining volume as the time goes by.
Yesterday it made 142 contracts and today already 152. 
Let’s see in future weeks!
