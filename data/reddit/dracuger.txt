Everyone is over paying causing the situation to be worse. Reminds me of all the panic sellers. I would suggest +100 sotoshi/byte but not over 200!
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:23:48
Yeah it really annoys me when people FUD bitcoin fees that don't use Bitcoin, I never paid $20+ fees, nor have had transactions stuck. Had a $10 fee once, and a bunch of $4-7 fees using Segwit. But then again I know how to read graphs and figure out what's a good fee to pay today. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:56:19
Honestly I agree, it needs to get down sub .50 cents, but it will be hopefully soon. I just wanted to point out that it's not as high as people claim. Bitcoin will 100% need to be easy and quick to move, I don't accept the "it's not currency, it's a store of value" argument, it needs to be both, and was originally intended to. Looking forward to atomic swapping and lighting network!

I'm upvoting this entire thread, we don't talk about this stuff enough, and I think it's important. 
Here is my 2nd transaction I was charged the same 0.00046666 fee but total cluster was 184 sat/B average.
The wallet I used for this was freewallet, which I'm not a fan of, and only keep small amounts on, but after this I may use it for all my small transactions till the over all fees drop. 
$6+ is still wayyyyy too high, but if I randomly found this, I'm sure there are better solutions. There should be a Reddit that we can discuss transaction fee "hacks" so we can best more our coin for cheap. 
This site has a nice visual graph of fees:  
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:44:46
Make an actual transfer and you will see different.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:19:59
Yes it was from a Segwit address, and was a multiple output transaction from Freewallet. Over all was 180s/b but my transaction was small. 
Yeah I can send a letter across the United States for cheap, but doesn't mean sending 1KG of gold will be as cheap. Or even a million dollar painting. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:46:13
What high fees?! I just made 2 transaction from Freewallet one was $5 and the 2nd $6, they were both sub $100 transaction, it's was decent, still a little high but no where near the $+20 people are crying about. If I sent from a respectable wallet that allows custom fees it would have been $3. Did I mention it took 10mins to confirm too! 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:51:46
I've been trying to tell people this all month, I've paid $6 for all of Jan more or less, and that's using freewallet with non custom fees. All this FUD of $30 fees need to stop. People complain that are not even using Bitcoin! Seriously.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:54:20
This was my transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:36:49
That's the average block fees, a lot of people are paying over
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:33:40
The issue is majority of people are over paying. I can with draw cash from my credit card (pay high advance fees), and transfer $20 and convert it to Euros via Western Union to my friend across the world for $60+ dollars of fees. That just makes me stupid, and doesn't reflect what it costs to transfer money. I know people are paying $20-30+, some have paid 100s, they just don't understand how this stuff works, all I'm saying. And these stories are what's being reflected as what the current state of Bitcoin is as FUD! This isn't what it takes, use wallets with custom fees, that use Segwit and you will be fine. Can't figure that out it's $6 using freewallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:28:56
Roger Ver has claimed many times BCash is the Real Bitcoin. 
Just one of many tweets about it, this is my only problem with them as a community, the childish claims of being the real bitcoin, they also on the  handle and do nothing but trash Bitcoin, very bad image for the crypto community! New comers are getting scared away from this childish behavior. It's like Coke trying to campaign they are the "Real Pepsi", only thing that would tell me is Coke is a shit thing to be, and Pepsi is King.

We need ppl that buy high and sell low. Cuz you know that's exactly how some of of are able to cash out at ATHs, and then buy back with more then what we originally had. It's unfortunate everything can't make a killing on the market but it's how it works. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 08:55:56
No not gonna lie, I felt the FOMO when it shot up to 8,200 in a day! I thought this is it "last chance to buy under 10k" but then got busy, and lazed out. Thank God. Gonna buy in the next few days. Hope the min o do it doesn't shoot down to 5k... Lol...
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:25:30
Just like all the people that bought at $1.2k and panic sold at $200-400. I was lucky I missed that ATH and get in when that wave was dumping. Now I'm just a professional HODLer.

This chart is just like market cap, you can't go in and buy 51% of all bitcoins at a set price, not shoot the price up! As you start buying/renting you will start pushing up the price. Once you start buying in the 1-5% you will start driving the prices up like crazy. As demand will be high, as other will still be renting and trying to outbid you for hashing power. 
As a miner I would love to see someone try renting 51% of the total network hashing power. They would surely fail, and us miners would make a decent boost in earnings.

I bought some games on humble bundle with Bitcoin in 2015ish when they first started accepting Bitcoin.

I only have one reason. It's still all in the green if I just zoom out. Even people that invested a year ago should have at least doubled or tripled their money. Even at the last crash in 2015 if those guys that bought in at 1.2k HODLed they would be swimming in cash. Don't be one of those guys. 
"Yeah man I got in at 1.2k, but once i saw it falling I acted quick and sold while I still could only lost 80% of my investment, thank god I managed to get out with something  - Said no one ever...

This is the exact thing that sets people apart. Some play it safe and move with the crowd. That's what causes people to buy blackberry stock at $100+ a share because its a sure thing (it crashed hard afterwards). Others take risks, and risks are risky, so some pay off and some don't. Most people don't like risk because they were burnt once or twice in their life time, or know someone that was. This is why I personally don't take financial advice from most ppl because I don't like to go the norm. Thank God I've managed to start investing in Crypto in 2013, most ppl still think I'm insane and don't understand. I don't tell anyone how much I made, because I gave up on trying to convince others. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:47:02
Honestly I can say one important thing for this "bitcoiner" generation: We have a much greater general understanding of the economy, risks of investment, and probably clearer goals on what we need. This is referring to the average person in each group. Of course some baby boomers are sharks when it comes to investing, but majority don't know much other than "everyone is investing in blackberry stock, may try and put some money aside to buy this sure thing". 
Growing up seeing the Adults talk about investment, and finance I though they had it figured out. It's only when I grew up I realized they have no clue, and do too much on advice from others over a cigarette break, or socal drink. 
I'll have to admit internet plays a huge part in this as one of the other comments said, we don't trust to words or advice from others and "Google it", which is key, because it's easy to get access to the source of the information, and base decisions a full picture.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:17:00
Check out NiceHash if you wanna invest a little time (Maybe 4-8 hours getting to know things), or MinerGate if you just wanna mine and not invest more than 5mins setting it up. You should have a GPU from the last 2 years to test the waters, or look into buying a gtx 1070ish if you also game. It's a fun start.

I think the progression is:
Weak mortal&gt;Oak&gt;Stone&gt;Steel&gt;Diamond 
Diamond is reserved for the few that owned pre the great $1,200 crash of 2013, and went all in at $200 to buy more. 
There is a legend of a stage after Diamond but till now, the true test hasn't happened yet. Remember this when the time comes, and everyone else is selling, it will be your chance to double down and buy more to become the new level of ball master. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:11:52
Of course the flip side of the tactic is "I sold all my bitcoins at $7200, and re-bought it at $7,800, $8,200 and today it's at $9,000." or on a bad day, the today's price will be $6,300. 
But no one ever talks about it when they lose. Just saying. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:37:34
I know, which is why I don't use it, however, you must admit its the quickest toe in you can get into mining with almost zero knowledge. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that is serious about mining.

@_date: 2017-11-13 11:21:30
100% with you on that, because as you see the build-up you gain the courage to buy that first investment. By the time you figure it out, and actually, buy you end of around the peak of the rally. It will correct, and you will question life, but from my experience ignore the urge to sell and HODL and you balls will turn to steel, and next dip you will be in here telling the other noob buyers to HODL for the next dip!

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:19
My personal game plan to invest into bitcoin is to spread out the investment, rather than one big buy going all in on your savings, to instead make a monthly buying plan. I sometimes wait a few days/hours if it's going down to try and catch the bottom, but I still buy. If its up, I try n buy quickly. Even if your buying in a large amount, I find it nice to spread it out over a day or 2, usually i get a decent average.

That's 100% correct, I think the point OP is trying to make is for people that just see Bitcoin as something that makes profit for them, and know nothing about the tech.

That's kinda how the news business works. On any subject really. These people are not experts on anything really.

Because it went to $1 to $1200 to $200, THEN from $200 to $20k to $7k, we are cool and better off then last ride, technically I expect it go go down more and it's will still be just another year in Crypto. I won't be phases with $2k before summer, and stays there for another year, before going to $200k by 2020. 
Vets are in it for the long game don't care about 2018 profits because we already made 100-7000x our original investment. Just like the people that got in at $1.2k and sold off at $200, a lot that got in at $15k+ will sell off before $2k and swear off bitcoin for life.

If really asked because I wanted to actually discuss it. It's a problem BitcoinCash is it's name and it's NOT bitcoin they should really stop trying it steal the Bitcoin name, and focus on their fork. Here in r/Bitcoin I know it's clearly a dumb argument but over in r/BTC and on Twitter it's giving newcomers a bad impression,  on Twitter is a huge joke of just bashing bitcoin. 
The argument stupid logic. Wouldn't other projects like Bitcoin Gold or even Litecoin serve a better use case than BCH? Why does it even exist? For miners and bitmain to profit as long as they can? I want to actually know which coin are more vanilla whitepaper than BCH because I think it's super overvalued and there are a lot of better projects that are more deserving of the marketcap. I guess time will tell.

I bought at $300 (years gap) 2k 3.5k, 5k, 7k, 8k and stopped once it started going 10k all way to 20k and now back to 9k. May buy more at 8.5k and keep going.
