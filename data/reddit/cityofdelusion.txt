My first guess is they restored a database from before you sent your coins. The fact that coins were withdrawn 30 minutes later is no problem, because instawallet has shared wallet anyway. Wait for support to reply!

maybe draw a bitcoin and put it on CoinDL, this could be in demand... for articles on bitcoin, random bitcoin related sites...

I'm not into mining business, but I know I read somewhere its combination of FPGA and ASIC.
I googled and found an old FAQ entry, which was removed recently. Maybe they changed their technology?

You forgot to consider one factor... BitFury is FPGA only and could be reprogrammed at some point, used for other things. ASIC miners don't have that luxury.

Martingale betting only works with unlimited betting. Here the maximum bets are limited and that is why it doesn't work long term.

10-20% of transactions are from satoshidice.com ...

On homepage you can see:
limits 500 per transfer, 1000 for cash deposits, 4000 per per day
Depositing 1001 is asking for trouble, sorry!

I checked the page, didn't register yet. I'm wondering, can sellers enter the price in USD/EUR or only BTC? So when you'd enter EUR price, BTC price would adjust accordingly. The exchange rate can change a lot in a short period and this would provide some stability.

Your service would be very fine, if it weren't for this:

Thank you so much for replying... if you'll continue to improve on your site with such enthusiasm, I think it has a bright future.
But to clarify my comment... it was a more general observation, I don't have any plans selling stuff, yet. About exchange... I really don't know, my guess is there shouldn't be much difference. When I convert currencies, I use google "xy usd in eur" and they probably use interbank rates, but feel free to use any exchange.

If it looks like pyramid and smells like pyramid...

You're right, it doesn't matter. Nuff' said :)

To be fair, deflation IS unsustainable in debt based currency. Debt based currency needs exponential growth, otherwise the house of cards starts collapsing. One of the reasons I like Bitcoin is the fact, that it's not debt based!

Why short WU, when you can long Bitcoin instead? Don't know what timespan you had in mind for shorting, but value of USD might drop considerably in 5 years.

I'm not sure, but your toys seem a bit pricey. I usually buy cheap stuff from ebay, so maybe that's just me. They look good though...
Also, I think there is a lot of supply in Bitcoin world, not much demand... for now. I bought a nice bunch of bitcoins, but don't really spend them if I don't see any benefit over using my CC. If sellers used some discount for paying with bitcoins, it would be a lot more tempting. I don't see many shops doing that yet.

You have bet history on homepage, each line is 2 transactions. Or you can click some random blocks on blockchain.info and search for 1dice.
