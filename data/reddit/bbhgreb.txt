He and Jiang zhuoer(btc.top) and Yang Haipo(viabtc) all said they support that core focus on the '1MB settlement chain' roadmap.
It does not mean they will support it tough. They will still focus on the onchain scaling roadmap of BCH chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:14:07
Even this is a good thing. 2 teams focusing on different possibilities , Bitcoin wins with whichever chain succeed. 
It is also good to focus on developing your own chain and compete in fairplay, instead of shouting each other on social networks.

It seems he thinks its good to handle BTC to core :)
Ofc he will still work on BCH, but fair competition ?

Imagine what will happen in this situation :
LN+SW + permanent  1MB , yeah ? Everything goes well we got tx exploded to 10k per second. Suddenly a bug found (or Chinese/US government decided to do AML check on big LN nodes , like what they did this Feb.)  , and LN goes down .  What are we gonna do ? Main-chain has 1 Mb blocks which is 7 tx per second, now how do you deal with the 10k tx per second volume? 
Who can promise there is no bug in LN+SW?  Who can take the responsibility of a system failure worth billions, trillions dollar? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:31:42
That came out of the conclusion , if Core have a solid plan to do on-chain scaling (just like the Hongkong consensus agreement 2MB+SW for example)  , not permanently limiting it on 1MB, all problem we have now will be solved . Miners will activate SW + LN, we have a plan B to backup in the future , everyone happy .
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:03:04
The Roadmap from gmaxwell (A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages) is inspiring . I like his discription of ' we develop innovations by layers'.
However ,as the infrastructure of a multi-billion eco-system, it is hard to balance between innovation and system safety/stability. And that is all the argument came from.
My personal opinion , SW+LN is awesome and we all love to see it ( including the miners, which most people get wrong. Miners are not opposing SW actually). In the meantime, dear core members, please take some time to consider increase mainchain blocksize as it is really important that we have the option to go plan B if SW+LN fails ( no one can take the responsibility if LN fails and we have only 1MB mainchain to backup).
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:40:49
It is not the right effort to improve the propaganda in my mind. No matter how good Burger king tastes and how good their commercial is , there are always people who loves McDonald's .    
CORE VS BU and split might be fun for somebody , but it really hurts a lot of people. We can sill try to make two parties go ahead together at least not give up now.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:21:22
From my understanding (reading published materials and post on social media both on weibo and twitter ), there is a basic misunderstanding that most people don't take seriously .  
Most people thinks miners ( BU supporters) are against SW , otherwise why are they not activating it?
The fact is =====miners are not against SW+LN, in fact they quite like it ======  Who doesn't want to see an awesome payment network on bitcoin to fk over visa? 
So why the hell the miners don't activate SW?  Let me help you out with the logic (If you think miners are enemy, you still need to understand them to fight them, right? SO listen! )   For a infrastructure of multi-billion dollar eco-system , bitcoin wants innovation as well as safety and stability .  It is hard to balance those.  Miners like innovation too, LN on top of bitcoin layer , no problem.  However, we need to prepare a ==PLAN B== in the unfortunate case where   LN fails or paralysed by the government .  In miners mind, on-chain scaling is a PLAN B, is a safe-heaven.  When LN fails or (big nodes) 'regulated' by government we still have the mainchain to use, if we don't have PLAN B , we are screwed .
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:13:17
OK I apologise if my word offended you . 
What am saying is , the world is not working on binary system .
' Not activate SW' is not equal to ' Opposing SW' , do you agree?

Have you ever read through my post mate? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:09:34
Your comment is very constructive Sam .  But does the core-team think like you do?  I'm sure a compromise can be achieved for the greater good if both sides can sit down and talk again.

Because most of big blocker supporters are in China, and core teams in western countries. I think there are misunderstandings in between.
I'm trying my best to establish a bridge for both side to talk with each other again. 
Regarding to your comment ' I agree we need a plan B, but I don't think blocking plan A is a great way to motivate people.'   I agree with you .  Why the miners ( I know some miners in person) blocking SW is because , they think this is the LAST CHANCE they can put impact on core .   Some core members are strongly intended to limit block size to 1MB forever , if core do not have solid plan of on-chain scaling , miners can do nothing after the activation .  All they want is a promise and a solid roadmap , really. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:17:03
I like the idea of a civilized conversation.


I need to know how much credit you can give to this statement . Can you give a rough percentage so that I can go back and talk to my miner friends .  I'll try to convince them write a letter. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:49:02
Yeah the accusation of Blockstream is probably just based on conspiracy . Do all core members understand the big-blockers real demand ? That is the interesting question to be asked. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:32:06
Thanks for your reply .  


I hope I was wrong.


I agree with you and I don't want freezing neither. That's why I'm here.
I was not talking about black-swan bugs that no one can predict.  People have to live with black-swan events and solve them when it comes . OK lets leave bugs alone, another part of miners concern comes with governments .  As my understanding , LN nodes have risk of being centralised . In my imagination , all the big wallet providers, exchanges , or conventional financial organisations are more likely to be big nodes in LN.  Let's assume , one-day regulators in China and US decided to shut down all big nodes in China and USA ( under whatever reason, AML for example) , what shall we do ?  
This is a risk with reasonable chance , yes?

From past 24 hours, we can see:
1. Miners are decentralized.  (Slush pool and miners have shown this )
2. Miners are not all profit driven. Show your friendly attitude and respect, they will defend the bitcoin network for the ideal.
3. Miners are an important part of the community. We have big trouble without them.

Soft forks has advantages over HF, but it has potential problems too ( core admits this ) .  Your ' do whatever you want , I don't care' attitude on this problem is not quite responsible, is it? 
The UASF is not even supported by any core devs , its just a troll campaign by Samson Mow
OK let me ask this single question, do you want a civil war on bitcoin community mate? 
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:30:25
I think this man and Roger Ver are two extremes in each side of the argument. None of them helps in this situation , only tearing apart the community .
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:49:53
How is UASF a safer solution ?  You think the miners won't react to this? 
Samson Mow probably doesn't hold many bitcoins, he doesn't care about bitcoin civil war or bitcoin go to dust. He has his game company as his main career.  (Wuups I fell into conspiracy theory ) 
A contentious hardfork is no good, however, the miners have never intended to do a contentious hardfork (ignore trolls like ver). On the other hand, a consensus hard fork is so much better than UASF. UASF right now will almost certainly cause a civil war , UASF is just like a  contentious hardfork from node's side, I can't believe anyone supporting UASF while against contentious hardfork , they are the same thing in my mind.

@_date: 2017-04-20 14:50:33
Do you really believe what you are saying, mate? They are the ones who pull a huge amount of money in when almost nobody else recognizes what bitcoin is able to do.  I myself did not have the gut to invest that much tbh and I regret it every single day. 
In my opinion, they are the opposite of short-sighted , they are quite adventurous.
You seems like a reasonable man DJ, think about it. When you invest millions $ into some machine which can do no shit but to hash, your focus is really on the long-term grow of the industry rather than short-term profit. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:01:35
It is ironic you said that, considering how litecoin SW voting got 60%+ so far.  You got support from a pool who has 30%+ hashing shares now you blaming mining centralization?
@_date: 2017-04-04 01:22:21
Blocksize increase ----&gt; Mining centralization   
It seems to be the default mindset in so many people, can I ask why is that?  Asic has been out for several years, have all the miners be centralized in China ?  In fact from these years of scaling debate, we clearly saw how decentralized miners are. Miners from all over the world divided into different groups arguing and attacking each other lmao.  IMO they will only be united under one condition, that is when facing an external attack on bitcoin network . 
On the other hand, SW+LN has potential centralization risk too, LN nodes almost certainly will be centralized based on how the system works.   But it is not a reason not to go ahead, yeah? I'm sure we will fix the situation if potential LN centralization is on its way, though. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:22:12
You think miners want to make bitcoin go fail together with their billions worth gears?

@_date: 2017-04-03 19:18:52
Erik 's twitter is about the SEGWIT2MB proposal that rootstock team just proposed.  (His thoughts is published in :
 )
I believe this compromise plan is the quickest way to get segwit activated without a civil war.  Currently, Andreas Anopolos also agrees on this compromise plan quoting ' Agreeing with Eric. Segwit2MB is far from ideal but better than more scaling war. A political, not tech solution. ' 
@_date: 2017-04-04 01:11:08
Andreas did not ( at least I don't know ) 


He has his gaming company to backup so he doesn't really care if bitcoin fails.  ' A bitcoin civil war , that's so cool ' that's probably what he is thinking.
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:55:12
OK. Thanks for clearing the tech details.  So SW has no extended block just an optimization of how the data are stored ? 
He probably just making metaphors for non-tech-savvy people to understand better (just like me)
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:47:28
Man I know you don't like miners for whatever reason. They are a very important part of the eco-system and they have been protecting the network from attacking for so many years, didn't they?
Ignoring their requirement and blaming them based on conspiracy theory is something doesn't make sense.
Accusing miners want to seize control is equaling to BU supporters blaming core working for Bitstream's monopoly.  (Both of the statement are trolling :)
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:32:51

@_date: 2017-04-21 14:40:44
You are saying core is researching on implementing big block solutions after SW activation?
I think that is all WU and jiang want.
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:29:26
A translated version is as follows:
A simplified comparison between Extended block (EXTBLK) and Segregated Witness (SW)
Some people asked me about the difference between these two scaling solutions recently. I’ll do a brief comparison now (for non-tech-savvy), and a detailed version later if I have time.
(1) EXTBLK and SW are all based on the ‘block-extension’ data structure. The ideas between the two solutions are similar. With few modifications on the codes, SW compatible systems can be EXTBLK ready.
In SW, signature data are extracted from the 1MB block, and put in the extended blocks
【1M block】（tx data）
【1Mblock】（non-signature data）+【extended block】（signature data）
In EXTBLK , some tx data are extracted and put in the extended blocks
【1M block】（tx data）
【1Mblock】（tx data）+【extended block】（tx data）
(2)  EXTBLK and SW are both upgraded through soft fork
‘Old’ nodes can choose to not upgrade and still be functional. 
In SW, ‘old’nodes can not see the new SW signature data. They can only see a tx that ‘anybody can spend’.
In EXTBLK, ‘old’ nodes can not see where the coins of a new tx are going.  They will only see that certain coins be sent to a special address and disappear. 
For users who do not want to upgrade, they can still operate on previous versions software and put txs in the 1MB block (with higher fees).  ‘Old’ nodes do not need to sync the extended blocks, so there is no worry about the size of data to keep for a full-node. (I personally do not think this will be a problem from the start).
(3) EXTBLK has the function of SW
EXTBLK has characteristics of SW（BIP141）.
EXTBLK solves the Transaction Malleability problems, supports LN and rootstock smart contracts, just like SW has promised. 
(4) Cons of EXTBLK：
The code of EXTBLK has just been published, people need some time to review and modify it.
 EXTBLK uses softfork to upgrade, so there will be technical debt（the same as SW）. However if the community is so afraid of a HF, there is no other way but to take the debt.
(5) Conclusions 
EXTBLK looks like the best solution so far for bitcoin scaling.  
It satisfies almost everyone’s demands and overcomes several main obstacles of the scaling problem:
(5.1) Community does not want HF, does not want to split.  
EXTBLK is a Softfork upgrade.
(5.2) Community do not want BU’s block size changing. 
EXTBLK block size is fixed, currently at 6MB. A further scaling will need another full network consensus SF.  Again, ‘old’ nodes can still operate if you choose not to upgrade. 
(5.3) We love SW.
EXTBLK is a block + SW solution and LN compatible.  EXTBLK and SW have almost the same data structure. If you support SW, there is almost no reason for you to stand against EXTBLK.
P.S. I’d like to emphasize the point of view of us ‘big-blocker’ 
(1) ‘Big-blocker’s only requirement is bigger blocks, no matter hard fork or soft fork.
(2) ‘Big-blockers’ are not opposing SW.  Instead we are against 【SW without big block】, against 【SW + 1MB】.   If we are opposing SW, we would not have signed the ‘HongKong agreement’.  (HongKong agreement is something similar with the recent SW2MB proposal , in which the miners activate SW and vote for 2MB later )
(3) The confrontation between Core and the ‘Big-blocker’ is not due to SW.  The problem is due to the fact that 【CORE IS STRONGLY OPPOSING BIG BLOCKS】. Core has been opposing any proposals with big blocks, they even came up with a 0.3 block shrinking idea.  ‘Big-blockers’ do not trust that core will remove 1MB limit after SW, they will likely to say ‘use Blockstream if you not happy with 1MB mainchain’ 
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:20:37
Yeah I don't know where my thought went wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:00:03
The proper way of doing it is like this, you buy BTC now, send it to bitfinex or okex, convert it to B1X+B2X, sell B2X and shot the same amount of BTC at the futures market at the same time. 
Because 2X fork is different with BCC and BTG, there is a huge risk in this trade. 
The 2x fork is treated by big blockers as an update, not a candy drop, so there will not be a replay protection nor difficulty adjustment. So there should only be one chain left after this, B1X or B2X , only one.
If B2X wins after the civil war ( You can't deny the probability), you will basically lose everything in this trade.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:25:18
Nice :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:50:12
I know what you are saying man, but that is not the reason.
When BCC fork on 1 Aug there was not so high a different price; 
2X was planned a long time ago and this different price was only built today.

The term is called 'backwardation' by the way :) 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:37:45
I didn't.  Firstly I don't think 2X fork will bring down the price :) 
Secondly, I think there will be traders to do some arbitrage on this 7% difference.
