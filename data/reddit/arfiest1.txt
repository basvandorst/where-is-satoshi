I mean, wouldn't it make sense to sell your altcoins if bitcoin is on a dip? Since it would sooner or later rise?

Bitcoin would be hacked

If 1 bitcoin ever reached 1 million dollars and you have stored it on a wallet ( e.g Jaxx ) and Let's say that the transaction fee &amp; time on bitcoin is crazy high ( like now But 1000x more), How would i sell the 1 bitcoin? And do you guys think that there would be a solution to the transaction fee &amp; time problem? 
Edit: grammar

I'm currently storing my bitcoin in my jaxx wallet but I dislike the transaction fee so I would like to swap to electrum wallet which supports segwit (I think). How can I transfer my bitcoin from jaxx to electrum with no fees? ? I've heard about transferringmy jaxx private key to electrum but I'm unsure how to do that

What you mean "How is it going to get hacked again? " When Was bitcoin ever hacked?

Why are you asking about someone elses opinion about What you Should do with your btc? We aren't your financial advisor.

Why is bitcoin illegal in macedonia

If all of the bitcoin miners went out to Labour strike for Whatever reason, would it disable transactions?
