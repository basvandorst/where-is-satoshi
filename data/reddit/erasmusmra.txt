Ridiculous. Most people's power bill will cost them more than the company will get in bitcoins from the mining.
Maybe it's not meant to be a scam but essentially that's what it is.

That doesn't explain why they would be mining at a loss. If they wanted to speculate it would be cheaper for them to buy coins directly.

SRS is given free reign when it comes to doxxing, threats of doxxing and vote brigading while regular users like OP is shadowbanned for saying "hey, come check out this threat I made about bitcoin!"
I do not mind the rules, but I do object to the lack of evenhandedness displayed by reddit admins.

Such a botnet can pay for itself in 10 days. I'd say that's a pretty good deal.

I'm still profitable. After the block reward drop to 25BTC the price of bitcoin has gone up and the difficulty has gone down. Those who weren't profitable dropped out leaving bigger profits for the rest of us. Mining right now is about as profitable as it was exactly a year ago.

It's SRS. What did you expect?

I'm baffled too. One theory is the average bitcoin miner doesn't know if he's profitable or not. Over the next weeks or months we should see a drop in difficulty.

Looks like there was a 13 BTC transaction fee reward on 25 BTC block.

It's doing like 200 writes/sec. The disk is the bottleneck.

I never knew there were so many ponies.

Let's hope not. More likely the contracts with card companies do not permit surcharges.
@_date: 2012-11-25 02:37:07
And like y2k it will pass without anyone noticing.
@_date: 2012-12-07 00:22:47
Still mining at a profit even after block reward halving.

Ah.. they spread freedom by violating the property rights of others.

I hate reddit admins.
Why don't they do something useful and shut down SRS instead of harassing regular users.
@_date: 2012-12-03 01:13:25
I'll believe it when I see em.

Search options and categories need to be improved. Hard to use the site at the moment for anything outside of the major categories.

That actually makes a lot of sense. It might have been coupled with fears of ASICs hitting around the same time. If BF's ASICs are even 10% as good as they claim, they can push all GPU miners who pay for their own power bill out of the game.
