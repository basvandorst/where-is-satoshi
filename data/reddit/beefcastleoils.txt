I'm not really understanding what the public and private keys are exactly. 
Private key is for buying stuff
Public key is for receiving.btc?
But what is the key? Is it the address that i give to someone if they want to send me btc?
Are address only used once? When inopen my wallet a get an address I'll copy it and then go to an email.and email it to someone. Then go back to my wallet. But now if I click request addt, theybgivw me a new one. Is the first addy that I sent in that email useless now?
Sry for so many questions. IM JUST CONFUSED AND FEELING STUPID
