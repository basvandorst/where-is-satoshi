thank you, I wasn't sure what kind of response is get here. Last few months have been wild ride. Hopefully for all the other investors it goes to the moon. For me, I'm happy with my decision.

I sold out today. had the feeling of impending doom the last couple of days. I don't think this exponential growth is sustainable. decided to play it safe and leave with a small profit. might be kicking myself in a month but we'll see. I still have faith in bitcoin and will buy back in after the crash.
edit: I'm gonna buy myself a new motorcycle

anyone have any experience selling bitcoin on coinbase? 
If I sell and deposit to my coinbase wallet, how long until the transaction is approved &amp; the money is in the wallet?

when we run out of gas and the world as we know it collapses, gold will still have value. bitcoin? we might not even have electricity...

what's your moon? 10k? 100k? 1mil?
 Bitcoin is gaining more attention by the day. The more attention it gets, the more people are out there looking to scoop up your satoshis when you cash out. Every time bitcoin reaches a new high, people sell. Every time bitcoin reaches a new high, people buy. 
I think your 90% is high. Sure theres a lot of people looking to make a quick buck, but I think theres also a lot of Hodlr's, seeing it more as a long term investment. 
Sky's the future for bitcoin. I don't think it will ever replace fiat but it's already becoming a more accepted currency. In 10 years it would make no sense to cash out of you could spend bitcoin

"the best time to buy bitcoin is today and yesterday"
buy when its high, buy more when its low. can't predict when it will drop and by how much. if you don't buy now you might be asking yourself the same question next week at 9k. 
my suggestion, follow the market really close for the next few days, it will probably drop below 7k a few times, if it does, buy. if it doesn't, buy.

by bitcoin when its high, buy more when its low. always hold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:56:38
buy when bitcoin is high, buy more when bitcoin is low and always hodl.
 It could be back up to 11k by the end of the day. Way things are going, it will be at 15k soon enough. You're still early to the party.

im new to this but so far my strategy has been to buy when bitcoins up, and when its down, buy more. my idea is to hold for 10 years and either cash out or if it becomes more mainstream spend it

when do we sell? 2028?

the right time is now. even if it drops after the fork, it will come back up. if it doesn't drop your losing out on satoshi by waiting 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:57:31
100,000,000 Satoshi = 1 bitcoin. I'd say it's better invest $1400 at $6500 than in waiting for November. The price may drop after the fork but it will go back up. If you were waiting for the drop to invest and it doesn't then you've lost out

why did they freeze it?
