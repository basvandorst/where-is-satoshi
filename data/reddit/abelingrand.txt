So you could say that there is not only one bitcoin value but as many values as exchanges possible ?

It changed recently: 
They now insure both

For sure !
If you have to choose between an unsecure wallet on a Windows machine full of viruses with poor password and encryption and sticking with Coinbase’s security, you should probably stay on Coinbase.
On the other side it’s not that complicated to have a mobile wallet or a hard wallet with a seed phrase for recovery stored securely elsewhere..

Tranks it’s clearer now !

It depends on your level of trust in Coinbase/GDAX.
What makes bitcoin special in comparaison to traditional bank acounts is that the one holding the private key is the one controlling the bitcoins associated.
When your assets are on Coinbase, they are stored on wallets owned by Coinbase (they have the private keys) and they wont give you this private key (for more complicated reasons)
So if you keep coins on their service, you should trust their security. If they get hacked or an employee decides to steal the private keys there’s nothing you will be able to do.
By storing them yourself you become in charge of your coins security.
Coinbase is a bit different than other exchanges singe your assets are insured. This means if it got hacked or an employee stole everything you would get reimbursed your losses.
TL;DR: depends on the trust you have in their security. But it’s not advised to reproduce traditional banking centralized scheme with a currency that allows you to « be your own banker »
