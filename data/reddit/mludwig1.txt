If you're a college student then this shouldn't even be a question.
Obviously: invest now and mooch off friends.
Better yet, invest $150 im booze and sell it to your friends for BTC, at a profit of course. :P

So if order # = queue &amp; everyone buys at least a jalapeno: 22944 * $150 = at least $3441600 of unshipped hardware?

There has been much discussion on the topic.
To sum it all up: general consensus is it would be similar to the US alcohol prohibition but on a global scale. And those countries who oppose the ones prohibiting it would begin to back it. Ultimately, some believe a prohibition would be a boon to bitcoin and actually increase awareness and adoption.

Wait, are we saying there may actually be a niche/demand for a bitcoin best practices thread? (hint, hint)
@_date: 2013-03-17 16:57:03
Pics or it didn't happen

Ok, so lose 2 thirds to order number deviation and canceled orders.
Still, $1mil for something that (like Satoshi) doesn't exist...not bad. :-P

What [volatility?](
EDIT:        i know lol
@_date: 2013-03-17 15:00:09
| I'd be surprised if the wasn't SOMEONE working on a valid competitor 
Yes, didn't Satoshi say something about "moving on to other things

To facilitate the "catching on" of bitcoin. i have been toying with the idea myself. basically its us middle-men that take the risks merchants won't. we take the risks out for merchants to feel secure about adopting bitcoin, and by doing so we help to establich the mainstreaming of bitcoin economy, which ironically reduces our risks. it's a win-win, the only risk is not getting any merchants to be your clients. (that and bitcoin crashing, but as i said, we're pretty much fighting that by simply providing this service)

buy bitcoins. spend bitcoins. nevere sell bitcoins unless you have to (short on rent, paying off a credit card who's monthly payment you could be spending on buying bitcoins, etc.)

The camera button blinks. I assume it has something to do with the (i assume) sync indicator continuously showing/hiding.

So accept it and post a "bitcoin preferred" sticker on your shop. even if noone would use it, the increase in bitcoin awareness alone is worth it. Hell, act as an exchange as well and who knows, you just might be able to start your town's bitconomy.
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:48:40
Its not a scam, its their business model.
they would go bankrupt due to bitcoin volatility if they didnt do it that way.
obviously they're not going to sell bitcoins for less then they paid for em.

Great, so BFL mines $63k a day then ships us "used" ASICs. So much for buying "new" lol.
