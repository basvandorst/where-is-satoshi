Paper money could be dead before 2100!

Yeah but at least start with 3 not just 1 monopoly!

That is like bch and bsv which are fragmented not diversified!

Disagreement is a great thing but it does not have to be like that. Disagreement means we all want it to be better so don't be self-destruction but rather self-constructive!

The collapse of fiats like 2008 or maybe worst 1929

:) that's funny!

If you support Bitcoin then why you continue to use fiats?
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:19:10
Bitcoin is not being controlled by anyone and it should belong to everyone not just a group of core devs! This will defeat the purpose of the vision.

Checks and balances with 3 groups, if only one group then monopoly plus Bitcoin belongs to everyone not just a group or a few groups.

It is just a naturally evolution!

Now everyone is asking "What's Bitcoin? or What's Cryptos?" which is great; however in 1-2 decades kids growing up will be asking "What's fiats?"
@_date: 2019-10-05 02:38:18
It needs to be tested for years to come just like how Bitcoin was back 10 years ago!
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:46:37
Any amount in Crypto is a great amount!

You can refer to the ones you trust

We need to be better than banks in order to reach mass adoption in the coming years
@_date: 2019-09-17 06:33:11
Are exchanges better than banks or worse?
@_date: 2019-09-17 06:46:41
Most exchanges are actually worse than banks if not all and this is the number one reason why Cryptos will take longer to reach mass adoption. We need exchanges to be better than banks and we hope to be able to compete!

Price is one thing but the Blockchain technology is another!

Emotions and inexperienced so only trade/invest what you can afford to lose in this volatile market!

1 btc is 1 millions dolars when 1 bit == $1
