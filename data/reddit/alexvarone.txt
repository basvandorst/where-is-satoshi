I use bitcoin as an additional savings account. Risky? Yes. Worth it? Yes! Welcome to the Bitcoin community, sir.

Nope, pretty sure I could show my boss this website.

Love it!

Great for low-priced items as well. Maybe you want just ONE stick of gum, a pencil, a pen. I'm looking at you, public school system.

I disagree. Eventually addresses will become simplified as the technology becomes more &amp; more mainstream. My mother would rather "send coins to Adam" than "send coins to 1p837hw83Hfp90ublsY2G". Thoughts?

Have you considered those without access to banking?

Totally depends on your situation. I would say on average I buy only $100 worth of Bitcoin. If I had more money, I would buy more. Less money, buy less BTC.

Good ol' Moore's law.

Let's hope! Just got word about Mtgox implementing the necessary changes to their code. Looks like the price will be going back up as everyone will be turning fiat back into BTC.

There is NO malware in App Store version. Avoid download.com &amp; cnet.com.

I can't even read the new symbol from the article on my phone. No good!

Anyone know BitPay's status on the situation?
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:17:17
Then why not: .001 Bitcoin per X visits. Or something along these lines.

My concern is that although Bitcoin price will rise again across exchanges in the next few weeks to come, I am uncertain Mtgox will recover to the average price.
I've heard that it would easier to get USD back rather than BTC if it were to come down to a lawsuit. Somebody please correct me.

Coinbase.com is a great service and web-wallet (not an exchange, but a "broker") if you're in the US and want to spend a minimal amount. No need to verify personal information (driver's license / proof of residence) and can link directly with your US bank. You can do more research first, but they are extremely user-friendly and have an excellent interface. I trust them with some BTC on there that I use as a "hot wallet" but if you're looking for extreme security, you're going to want to look into cold storage. Welcome to the community, sir!
Edit: Didn't see that you live in the UK. This is fairly irrelevant. :-)

The name does not play any role in the functionality of the exchange. Gox could not handle the volume therefore their lack of customer service and has bad coding. Yet, we'll wait and see how things play out.
