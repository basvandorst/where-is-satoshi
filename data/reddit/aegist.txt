Damn, these lyrics are even more powerful given that I just lost the vast majority of my holdings by over leveraging a couple of bad shorts on BCH. I'm actually hoping BTC doesn't pass 11k, and in fact drops back to 5k so I can recover some of my stupid losses.

Jimmy - TOOL
What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability,
Suddenly look away,
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him,
By coming home.
Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
You're too scar'd to realize this,
You are the voice that's been calling me back home.
Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light and wondering,
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb I.
So glad that I have found you.
I am but wide awake and heading,
I wish that I could see you,
Turn and run to play.
Dreams are fading,
Carry my ancient soul.
Carry me into the light.
Aim your body heavenly,
Enduring a memory.
I’ll come to your light,
Hold your light.
Hold your light where I can see it,
Hold it,
Hold your light,
Eleven, Lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory,
I'll move,
To heal,
As soon as pain allows so we can,
And both move on together.
Your light,
Eleven lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory 'till,
And one are one,
So glow,
I'm heading back home...

Seriously, other than very tight stop-losses for very precise trading, stop losses in crypto just cost you money.
(at least, assuming you are longing coins which you know will eventually go up)
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:08:35
I can understand that. I recently made a massive mistake and lost the majority of the coins I had been holding onto over the last two years. Not nearly as big as the perceived loss of your brother's, but a substantial loss for my life, and it constantly comes back to mind, hitting me with new thoughts about what I would have been able to do with that money. The freedom I would have finally had. The support I could finally provide my family. The assistance I could give to my friends....
Luckily I didn't lose everything, and I'm just focusing on not making the same mistakes, and rebuilding my holdings again. 
Most of the growth has happened in the last year anyway. It really doesn't take long in the scheme of things, even though I'll never forget how much ground I lost with that stupid mistake. 
Anyway, it's nothing compared to what your brother experienced, and I'm so sorry he chose to end his life...whatever the ultimate reason may has been.

Hi Most of you are probably wondering who and what rbutr is so: rbutr is a genuinely viable solution to the overwhelming problem of misinformation, deception, lies, bias and scams on the internet.
rbutr simply tells you when the webpage you are visiting has been disputed elsewhere on the internet. 
Here, see the concept in action on our own homepage: 
That link will take you to our homepage within a rbutr frame, which will show you that there are two articles written about rbutr (criticising us). If you click through to them using the arrow at the top right, you will also find your way to our own response to them.
That frame isn't the primary method of accessing rbutr (actually, it isn't quite ready for public release yet and has many bugs, but we're almost there) - a browser extension in Chrome or Firefox is, but the Frame stands as a simple way to introduce you all to the concept.
By directing people to the best critique/contradictory arguments from the page they are currently viewing, everyone online will always have access to the information most relevant to where they are. They will find out if the information is false or misleading, or if the thing they are looking at is a scam. rbutr will work because it is not authoritarian - it is simply a map to 'someone else', 'somewhere else' who disagrees.
Everything else is up to the users (just like the internet was made to be).
I think rbutr is the next step beyond search. Want to find information on something? Go to Google. Want to know if that information is good information? Check the rbutr links.

OK, serious noob question here:
If 3.6M worth of bitcoins have been lost, does that mean that those bitcoins can never be re-mined?
My understanding is that bitcoin has a hard limit on the all time number of coins that can be mined - and thinking of all of the coins which have been lost to landfill and fires, does that mean there is a real potential that one day we will run out of bitcoins to trade? (ie: Mine them all, and then lose them all)

Treat Bitcoin like a savings account. 
If he has savings already, put 10% of those savings into Bitcoin.
If he has a regular income, put 10% of his income into Crypto each week. 
Of the Crypto he holds, Bitcoin should probably make up about 50% of the crypto holdings, and the rest should be made up of 40% strong AltCoins (ETH, XMR, NEO, etc) in whatever combination you come up with, and 10% in speculations. 
As an aside: I love the idea of spending $5-20 every week on a coin worth a few hundred satoshi which might one day be worth several dollars. It's really unlikely, but as long as the average value of these coins goes up over time, then you're already doing infinitely better than the average person who buys a lotto ticket every week - and you still actually have a chance of becoming a millionaire out of it. (yes, very very slim chances - but still better chances than lotto!!!)

I only discovered it when I investigated margin trading. I never understood how you can Short something you don't own. It finally made sense when I learned that you literally borrow someone else's coins and sell those. But of course in order to borrow those coins, you need to pay them interest.
In the end I decided to not waste my time learning to day trade, realising that I could sink months of work into it and still lose money. Instead I should enjoy the easy money made from HODLing, AND now with this gained knowledge of margin lending, I can make a high rate of return on my Bitcoin as long as I risk leaving them in an exchange like Poloniex (which is the real risk here.)
I figure I will always leave a portion of my BTC in loans from now on (but never all of it). 
Even 0.05% a day is an annualised return of about 20%, which is a massive ROI by any investing standard.

The third time it bounced off $250 after MtGox was the perfect time to buy in. 
It had shown its ability to be worth over $1000. It had shown its resistance to going below $250. It had received massive amounts of attention globally, and still not be hacked or broken or shut down.

I think the reasoning for that is because no amount of blocksize increase is ever going to practically solve the transactions per second problem needed. 
ie: to reach *current* visa transaction levels we'd need 600mb blocks: 
And that's just VISA. Today. 
If bitcoin simply cannot reach the functionality originally imagined and sold, it is much better to not waste time and resources trying to achieve the impossible, but instead, choosing a more practical goal/purpose and working towards that.
(and/or supplementing the original technology with second layer technology which can deliver the original vision)

I'm reading a book atm called The Road to Ruin (by James Rickards). I'm not far in (and not certain I fully accept its premises), but one of the key points in the argument it is building is that the IMF's continued development of their SDR "currency" is creating an artificial central currency upon which all other currencies will be based, and through which central control will be possible.
Or something like that. Like I said, I'm only at the beginning of the book, but it is an interesting read.

The Progeny Fed should be as reliable as the blockchain itself because the idea is that the software which manages the conversion of BTC to ProgenyCoin is fully automated and controlled by the software which sets the whole ProgenyCoin up. 
There should be no capability for manual manipulation within the system on this point. Once the exchange rate is set, X BTC goes into the "Fort Knox", and Y ProgenyCoin comes out of the Fed.

That would be amazing, not only because of how elaborate and confusing it would be, but because this episode was so perfect. 
Imagine them going to the trouble of creating such a perfect episode, and then pretending it never happened, and creating a second (hopefully as perfect, but in a different way) episode which carried on the story down a different arc.
If they could pull that off, then that would be historic.

As is alcohol, nicotine and chocolate. But your comments weren't about helping people to understand the nature of human addictive psychology, it was to perpetuate a negative stigma that all people who use *illegal* drugs (implying illegal somehow makes them any different to legal drugs in the way they work) are morally inferior.
I'm just pushing back on that because I am one of the people who used to believe it.


And plenty of people continue to use for years without addiction. Many illegal drugs (specifically of the psychedelic class) are anti-addictive in their nature and are being researched for the potential of helping cure people of serious addictions, like alcoholism, a massive problem in society which has nothing to do with "ILLEGAL" drugs.

You could. Usually you can get up to 0.5% per day, but because everyone has been told to withdraw their BTC from exchanges, AND because so many people are trying to short BTC there is a massive demand for BTC loans and no one to loan it. So you can lend it to the margin traders at 5% (maximum price) on Poloniex.
Information about lending is in the last section on this page: 
@_date: 2017-07-14 03:54:28
You all know that everyone has been told to withdraw their BTC from exchanges before August 1, right?
What do you think happens when there is no BTC to trade AltCoins with? The AltCoin holders have to keep lowering their price to attract the smaller pool of BTC available to buy it. AltCoin prices fall.
Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:33:53
I have made this loan offer for up to 60 days. So whoever has my BTC has control of it for 60 days - it is up to them to close the trade they have entered into (or be forcefully liquidated by Poloniex if the trade moves too far against them).
I expect they will close the trade before the end of August 1 though. They might hold it until August 2, but I can't imagine anyone holding a loan at 5% interest per day for longer than that.
But obviously I would be very very happy if they held the loan for the full 60 days. I'd get something like 20x return on my investment. LOL

I have a bit locked in at 4.998%
I watched the lending amount drop to 0BTC about 36 hours ago, so could have easily locked in all of my BTC at the max of 5% per day.
This made me just throw the BCC fork idea out the window. Speculation aside, 5% interest per day is fortune making returns. I don't expect it to last past the fork, but you never know how stupid people can be or how unlucky markets can be for margin traders. They only need to hold it open for 2 weeks and I have doubled my loan amount.

"we're all addicts". Sounds profound. Lacks any real meaning in this context.


If we're all addicts, why is it sad that the users of AlphaBay are addicts?
It is pretty clear that you want to perpetuate the social stigma of 'drug addict', and your attempt to connect it to general biology is disingenuous at best. Just because you don't think that you know any casual heroin users doesn't mean shit. It neither means it doesn't happen, nor does it tell you anything about the usage of all of the other drugs (from paracetamol, to methamphetamine, to alcohol, to magic mushrooms).
Every drug is different, and plenty of people do use most illegal drugs (MDMA, LSD, mushrooms, ketamine, amphetamines, etc etc) on a casual basis without problem.

Oh, no, you may be right. It was someone else above and I am probably the one who misinterpreted!
yes, keep growing that BTC balance! (I think AltCoins will bounce back in price in August, so get gathering and get ready to sell after they jump up!)
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:13:04
Only if I only get 1 days worth of interest. I already have more than that, and there is a chance that the trades will be held open for longer than to the fork - I could be collecting 5% interest, compounding, for 3 or 4 days, maybe even longer.
And unlike the fork, this interest is guaranteed. I am already speculating enough with alts, I don't need more speculation.

3 weeks ago I made a Facebook posts to my friends saying "If you've ever thought about getting some Bitcoin, now is the time to set everything up. I don't know when the right time to buy will be, but it is coming, and you should be ready for it."
At least one friend then later commented (last week) something along the lines of "If someone had have bought Ethereum when you made this post, they would now be down almost half of their investment. This is why you don't give investment advice..."
Completely missing the point that I never gave investment advice, didn't mention ETH, and entirely made the post because I knew the consolidation was happening, and the point is to be ready for when that consolidation finishes.... And that is when you buy...

You should buy bitcoin because there is a very reasonable chance that it will continue to grow in value over the coming years at a similar rate to what it has been growing over the last 7 years.
Why have confidence that the pattern of the last 7 years will continue moving forwards? Because we're still on the cutting edge of the technology and, more importantly, adoption.
I live in a suburban area, and only now are roughly half of the people I ask telling me that they have 'heard of' bitcoin. We're only just entering the stage where the average person has heard of it once or twice. When I ask them if they know of anyone who has any, the answer is always no.
When everyone knows what bitcoin is, and many people have some - that is when you can start wondering whether we're at the top of the growth curve.
Until then we're still in the adoption phase and the increasing demand vs the capped supply will push the price up relentlessly.
If you like to read, and want to know why Bitcoin should have any value at all, I highly recommend Paper Promises by Philip Coggan: smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1610392299?pldnSite=1
It was a big part of my personal revelation that allowed me to see how important BTC was. (this youtube series is also a good summary of the same sort of information: 
One final note: BTC isn't the be all - end all. It is the first step. Many other currencies have built on top of that which BTC has created. Keep an eye on these alternative currencies, and decide if you like any of them as well. Personally, I am a far of Monero:

No shit. But addiction is 98% psychological - which is why gambling is just as big a problem as any drug addiction.


You're trying to force me into a corner I have no interest in being in. You're the one who made the sweeping generalisation about all DM users being addicts. My singular point here is that not every DM user was an addict. In fact - literal fact - most drug users are not addicts. No matter how much you want to focus on the addicts and ignore the rest, the stats on this are perfectly clear:
So even if Meth is much more popular than mushrooms, most meth users still are not addicts! They are recreational users. 
So my singular point remains exactly the same: Stop perpetuating the myth that all (illegal) drug users are (miserable destitute) addicts.
