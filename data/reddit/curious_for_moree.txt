Can’t believe btc trading volume in Russia is so huge. 
My friend from Russia says even young people aint aware of bitcoin.

And why you choose it over, for instance, owning a house you can lend? 
For me it’s something new that will be our future.

It’s literally me searching for the market opportunity

Probably, that’s because of the city itself.  People from urban areas are more progressive than those from the rural areas, which are the biggest parts of Russia.
As for this infographic, such huge volumes can be explained by a specific number of traders/investors, like 10 big players were in. So we need more data to make it clear.

Have the same feeling

It’s not too late to invest in btc

Also me in April, when Bitcoin broke 4k
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:03:36
So true

Reminds me of the Dark ages...
People don’t want to understand the underlying technology. And why? It’s easier to blame it for...literally everything

I did buy, but I should have bought more!

I waited for it for so long, that I can’t believe it

I visited the site in incognito, it helped to catch the rocket.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:03:20
What a severe winter we survived!
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:36:19
Upd: now you can see the rocket when reload the page
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:24:15
Wish you bought. Typo!
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:30:51
Yep, I also love it
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:33:24
It’s the best decision I made

It's an easter egg. Please share if you find it!

I’m always bullish!
But i don’t believe in predictions. You can not predict any situation. Remember when a Chinese president said that he was for blockchain/crypto development in China, it caused a spike. No one can predict that.
