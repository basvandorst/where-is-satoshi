That is great but don't get your hopes up of getting that money back in the near future. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:57:06
New hands that don't know what they are doing are going to buy at say $100 and invertible watch it fall below $50 and just end up selling. The only new hands that will survive are the ones that either wait until it actually hits rock bottom or the ones that use it as currency. No one will know the true price right now until Mt Gox comes back online.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:50:02
If the wealth ends up in weak or new hands it just crashes the price even more. People need to use bitcoin for what it was created for, to buy shit with. Until that happens it will be stuck in this exact cycle until no one has any confidence in it at all.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:36:41
So how does that even happen? One huge crash and everyone is out.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:47:31
Holy shit, this is exactly the trend that is happening.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:07:00
Apples and Oranges my man.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:25:04
No problem, just trying to help ;)!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:12
Rock bottom would be below $50.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:40:16
Is that an accurate price? Did people just lose their asses?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:29:32
The reason I never got in to bitcoins in the early days was because my computer was crap (still is) to mine for any of them. Once I came to that realization I totally forgot about them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:45:12
Not saying they sold everything. Just saying that even some of the early adopters are dumping their money and realizing their gains. Referencing what Mordan said, he called those people stupid, which in fact they are probably laughing at how much money they made on this.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:09:01


No they didn't. People were making more money in that market than they are in today's market.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:53:43


You just hit the nail on the head.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:45:20
People are going to buy and then sell which will cause it to crash again. 
Basically people will buy them cheap when they open. This will cause the price to rise and allow some of the people that got burned to sell. This is called a bull trap and inductive of a crash.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:34:31
No no no. The money in my account is not going to lose 50%+ in a day. I can also use it to purchase anything I want in the world at any given time. This is the purpose of bitcoin but will never be realized unless everyone that is "investing" in it gets the fuck out. It is a currency not a commodity.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:46:40
Every time a bubble bursts I see multiple people claim, "I invested at TOP and now it is at $x, I lost my life savings." Not to mention the couple of posts of people stating their intentions that get upvoted like crazy and they actually go through with it. Only to get an update post from them during a burst saying that it was a horrible idea.
Most people that are investing in Bitcoin are younger and don't have any idea on how to wisely invest money. They just see a lot of high figures and all the people that have made a bunch of money (mainly early adopters or people that forgot they had X BTC) and want a piece of it. So they look at that $6k they saved up their entire life and decide to dump it in BTC right at a high point instead of paying their tuition because they don't know any better.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:03:23
What about all the old bitcoins that were sold off yesterday? You gonna call those "early adopters" idiots when they are holding real money while you have a bag of imaginary internet coins?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:26
Wait, wouldn't this make it extremely unstable? The only reason it is going up is because everyone can predict when to buy them for cheaper.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:07
This is what made them jump so high in price in the first place.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:27:15
I think Bitcoins biggest problem is that it is not really a currency anymore. It is being traded like a stock. Since it is not backed by anything it could theoretically skyrocket to thousands for no reason other than speculation. This is the same for gold but gold can be physically handled and exchanged for goods with little to no problems. 
Bitcoin is rising way to fast to be sustained. The market needs to be saturated and traded as currency, not as a "stock." The bigger holders need to start buying shit with their bitcoins and I don't mean to pay for their web hosting or reddit gold.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:05:25
Large business are only accepting Bitcoins now because they are trying to get the money that was basically minted over night. If people don't have anything to spend them on then they just sit there. So when business like this lambo place start accepting them they are gaining customers that they never had before. When they accept the BTC they just exchange it anyways, that means they are basically accepting USD and not BTC. This in turn will be the downfall of BTC as well. When the BTC go from people that made money and want to spend the BTC as a currency to a business that just converts to an investor that jumps in at whatever floor is happening at that time it becomes next to useless. They are just filtering out the people that made money and giving it to people that have no intention to spend it as currency.

If you have no idea what you are doing either leave it alone for LONG time or sell now and don't worry about it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:05:53
Gold is 50% Jewelry, 40% Investment, and 10% Industry. This means that 60% of gold is actually used for a purpose and is consumed. This makes it a commodity.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:47:00
Gonna take a day for the market to settle. On top of that only NA and part of EU have seen this so far. Wait until AUS and Asia see whats happening. Might go lower.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:07:00
Well considering those are the people that made it go up in the first place, it is going to take a while before it skyrockets again. On the other hand, Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a currency and until it is used as one people will continue to laugh at everyone investing in it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:50:56
The reason it has no effect on its usage is because no company is actually accepting bitcoin and keeping it. They are immediately converting it. Accepting it is just allowing the people that have made a bunch of money off of it to spend it. It does not hurt businesses at all but they would be retarded to keep that transaction as BTC. This is also the reason that will ultimately fuck Bitcoin over in the long run.

They are imaginary until they are consistently used and worth something. My account balance is regulated, tied to something tangible, and is protected. None of those things apply to bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:02:43
Yes it links a wallet to your account and you can either accept or deny the transaction. Here is the sub that discusses the bot that does it Here is the "Quick Start Guide" 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:32:44
Just having 10 of those would be life changing for a lot of people.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:44


Why would that create a solid footing? Now you just have investors that are playing chicken with each other. The first person to sell that has a large amount dictates the market at that point. Kind of feels like everyone is getting played out here.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:11:44
The majority of people in bitcoins are trading at MtGox. This is simply because that is all they know. This inevitably means that it will go lower because the people that still want out are going to sell. Just like I said once that price increases a bit all the people that bought in high are going to try to not get caught holding the bag and sell as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:45:34
They were literally printing money and raising salaries for no reason. Totally different that what could actually happen in a country with as much politics and regulation as the US or other large power. Hyperinflation usually takes place after a civil war, break down of government, or rampant corruption.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:17:01
No it is not a commodity. It is a currency that people can use when they purchase things. Gold is a commodity because it is used to create things but happens to be of great value because of demand. Bitcoins basically break down as a "medium of exchange." The reason we saw the crazy amount of value in Bitcoins go up was because people started treating it as a commodity and started holding it. This created an artificial marker that allowed the demand to become extremely high while the media picked up on it. In the end it has caused a crash and will continue in this cycle until all confidence is lost or people start using it as an actual currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:09:05
A commodity is a product that is used to create other products or consumed. Bitcoins are just a "medium of exchange" just like USD or EUR. Sorry you made a bad decision and lost your ass.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:57
Just to give you a hint, 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:34:15
This is why the market is fucked. Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a currency. Until it is used as one on a large scale we will see this shit over and over again.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:10:33
If the price gets under $10 I will slowly buy until they reach $10+. Then I will just hold and wait for the cycle to start again. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:49:57


@_date: 2013-04-11 20:52:31
The first problem here is that you are treating it as an investment. It is a currency not a commodity. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:03:05
It is still crashing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:18:03
This shit happens all the time. This is the same reason why people don't like paypal as well. Ask any retailer or person that takes credit card or paypal as payment, I bet they will all say they get then in the range of 3%-5% of all transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:00:43
What I would do for just 50 of those lol.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:56:42
People will use them to chargeback. At that point the BTC are already in their anonymous wallet. Which means getting them back is pretty much impossible. They can just claim you never delivered and you are out the money.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:49:05
Why? If you had the BTC you currently have and it got up to $1000 this week and sold, you wouldn't be happy?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:27:16
Funny how it is pretty much the same chart.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:12:17
I am sure everyone that bought in over $200 is probably selling.
