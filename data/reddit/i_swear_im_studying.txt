I believe that the messages are only kept on the blockchain for two days then removed to keep the blockchain somewhat small.
Edit: Although this is still a big problem for mobile phones because of internet use and battery drainage.

Your client will rebroadcast the message after the two days with exponential back off if an acknowledgement isn't received. But you are right if your client is off and the recipient hasn't checked in 48 hours he/she won't get the message, at least until your client comes back online.

I use quickbt.com, but they only accept interac. Some people on localbitcoins.com will accept paypal I think.

Press f8 when the computer starts (shift f8 for Windows 8) and boot into safe mode and run an anti-virus off a USB drive. If that doesn't work then use a Linux live CD or plug the hard drive into another computer.

I did the same thing but luckily found out about BitID before implementing anything. My original idea was that the payment processor could store addresses and allow for BitID logins that send your address to the merchant. I like your persistent session idea because shipping costs might need to be added to the payment. I have heard of SQRL before and I'll definitely look into it more.

Looks like that address is a broadcast address, so this is probably just an attempt to spam that chan.

Also note that you will need a ~600w power supply with two 12 volt rails, which will cost ~$60.
