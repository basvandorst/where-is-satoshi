First time i see someone who has his dad's contact number saved as a first and last name. I would assume you are either both very formal to each other or he's your step-dad. 
Which wont make a difference just saying.

I counted only 8 words that start with a capital letter.. That's a bit low considering the amount of words..

Can we get a clue as to whether we are looking for a seed or private key? Please..?

I miss that guy who once posted " Can we stop posting btc has reached it's next logical price level" i mean where are you mate? Yeahh btc reaching 17k was very logical for you to the extent you couldnt handle it anymore and created a post to try to stop it. 
To be honest im not bored of anything you claim you are bored of, on the contrary i cherish every post and every meme and every fucking atm.

Cool designs! You can always add other cryptos as payments, or designs \(hmm\).

Is this.. the bull run?

If BCH gathers the most hashing power and it's the more profitable network for miners. Then BCH will be BTC in a process called "flippening"
I hope this doesn't happen
But it's a reality

Actually to me the headline meant 73% preferred stocks over bitcoin..

Do your own research about bitcoin and through it you will realise what are the grounds that these people are basing their claims on. Then decide for yourself if these claims are fair or not

If BTC breaks below 3.2k this year than this record will be broken since 2019 will have a lower yearly low than 2018. 
For this to remain true last month BTC should have bottomed at 3.2k.

Well if you think about it most of us coming here day in day out hold some coins. If this guy claiming he has 10 btc will make him a target in the next 10 years well sorry to tell you that we are all sitting ducks

Get Vitalik on the line.

Should add a third option that's just $999

The bigger problem that faces Bitcoin from quantum computing is the fact that it can crack your private key.
But i agree that if quantum computing became a thing, your Bitcoin wallet will be the least of worries.

I agree with what you said but there is a point to make that at 10k it was sort of hanging on the 10k support level for quite some time. So you can speculate that it might keep this support level and go up. But when it broke 10k and is now 8.5k yes it is a better deal but now the possibility of it going even lower is much higher than when it was holding 10k.
So one might wait for a better price think 6k. But is the risk to miss out worth it on the long run? I think it's not. So the best thing you can do is Dollar Cost Average whenever you get the chance.

Hey man. Just do it. Post the tx ids and get on with it. I believe that you deserve to have your money back, but i know and you know that there is more to the story. Let it unfold. Reddit thinks your shady and have all the right to think so. If you really want our help you know what to do.
Waiting for your next post.

They have never been hacked until the day the get hacked. Binance was never hacked until 2 days ago and was considered extremely safe. These things happen. Security measures are put in place for that reason.

When BTC dumps all other coins dump. I did not mean people follow these people knowingly. They just create fear in the market by dumping BTC. The market reacts by selling on all other altcoins as well.
