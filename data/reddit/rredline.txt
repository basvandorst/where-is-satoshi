I used it to purchase a small amount. Note that it is not meant to be used as a BTC wallet. When you send BTC out of the app, it only gives you a few options for the amount, including an option for sending all of it. You can’t select any amount that you want. It also took almost a day for my BTC transaction to go from a pending status to actually being submitted to the network. I also found it odd that I didn’t get charged a miner fee. I received the exact amount that my balance was in the Cash app.

I wouldn't be bragging about Ethereum's scaling ability right now. It also has insanely short block times which will make it extremely difficult for nodes to keep up and stay in sync with larger blocks in the future. I see ETH going through a lot of changes in the future in order to scale.  
In the not too distant future, there is going to be a huge crypto collapse, and I figure all except for maybe a dozen or so coins will be dead or just play money. It's going to happen very quickly, and most people won't be able to dump their shitcoins for Bitcoin and the few others that will have value. People are going to get rekt hard and wish they had left their funds with the "real" coins. The ones with good devs working on them, who spend more time improving their product than on attacking other projects or marketing fluff and making promises. And don't think for a second that Bitcoin isn't going to be one that people will value.

If that ever happens, I won't care because I will be too busy enjoying my fleet of Lambos. To the peasants who will still care about such things, I believe LN can keep track of fractions of a Satoshi (just like gas pumps keep track of tenths of a cent). Another possibility is that Bitcoin would fork and enable a few more decimal places. Maybe instead of eight we would end up with ten decimal places, and the smallest unit would be a ten-billionth of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:47:46
I think scaling is a much bigger concern at this point than anonymity. I agree that it’s better to get the flood gates open before adding features that could hinder that from happening in the first place. I just don’t see how any of this can be stopped. Crypto seems like an inevitability to me.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:17:26
What is more reliable than everyone agreeing to something?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:02:55
We can just keep adding more decimal places with forks as needed. There should never be a need to add more Bitcoin outside of mining rewards. The threat of quantum computing will force us to make some sort of changes as well before a significant portion is "lost forever." There may be a grace period where people will be able to send all of their Bitcoin to a new address format that will be safe from quantum cracking. After that period is over, all unclaimed coins can be considered gone forever (nobody can spend them even with the private keys).

I'm not sure why you keep defending Ethereum because I never singled it out as a shitcoin. I said that there will be a handful of "real" coins, and that Bitcoin will be one of them. I never said Ethereum is going to die.  I attacked "shitcoins" and you immediately got defensive about Ethereum.

@_date: 2018-01-10 16:46:57
I referred to shitcoins, and you immediately brought up Ethereum. I didn’t single it out. By the way, if I had to guess at which coins will still be around many years from now, I would put ETH on that list. In fact, next to BTC, my biggest holding is in ETH. If it goes to the moon, I’m rich. If Bitcoin goes to the moon, I’m rich.

Your TREZOR wallet (and any other HD wallet) automatically generates your receive addresses based on your seed words and, if applicable, your passphrase. It will generate an unlimited number of addresses, and it's all done behind the scenes for you. As long as you have your seed words and passphrase, you will always be able to access your wallet without ever needing to know anything about the addresses or how they are generated.

I really have no idea. Even if it was evenly distributed among the current holders, once mainstream adoption occurs, I would expect a VERY disproportionate distribution to occur until its value settles. There will be an extremely high demand for a limited amount of newly mined BTC, and a lot of holders who won't want to sell. It just doesn't seem all that relevant to me, especially considering how disproportionately fiat is currently distributed. Most people in the world have a net worth of nothing (or less!), and a very tiny fraction of 1% own a ridiculous percentage of all the money.

Segwit enables far more transactions per kB of space on the blockchain. Mast and Schnorr will make it even more efficient. All BCASH did was make the blocks bigger. They took the easiest and least elegant path, and Bitcoin proponents argue that it will lead to centralization of BCASH's main chain. I would argue that it already is centralized, and it will only become more centralized as the max block size gets increased.

No current crypto can handle large-scale

Opening and closing channels for every transaction would defeat one of the main purposes of Lightning which is to reduce the number of on-chain transactions. You will be able to "lock" your funds on the main chain so that you can spend them off the chain. You could send and receive funds from thousands of transactions using the Lightning payment channel before settling back on the main chain. Within the Lightning network, transactions will be nearly instant (no confirmations needed) and fees should be extremely low (if any).

@_date: 2017-12-29 22:45:01
Opening and closing a channel for every transaction would completely defeat the purpose of using Lightning. You don’t WANT to close the channel after each transaction. You want channels open for as long as possible to reduce on-chain transactions. And no, you will not lose youR BTC if you don’t close a channel. The only way that could happen is if the other party deliberately broadcast an old state to the main chain, and you failed to respond to it after a certain amount of time. It is dangerous to attempt cheating people this way because if and when they do respond, it will prove that you are cheating and you will forfeit all funds you had locked in the channel to your victim.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:30:04
There is always a possibility of the network connection going down. I've already pulled out my credit card to pay for something only to be told that the network was down. First world problems.
The solution is very simple: Use a different channel. Don't have one open? Open one. If the channel you usually use isn't working well, close it and move on. If you don't have the funds to open a second channel, then you have bigger problems.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:20:56
To be fair, Litecoin certainly could handle the current transaction rate of BTC without any congestion. However, no crypto can scale on-chain anywhere remotely close to VISA/MASTERCARD levels. You would need blocks in the GB’s/minute range to keep up. Not happening. Additional layers such as Lightning are absolutely necessary to move crypto forward to where we all would like it to be. It is the most exciting tech in crypto to me at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:28:20
If you have to pay to open a new channel, that cost will be spread across all future transactions using that channel until it closes. I don’t think it “must” be cheaper than the transaction you want to make right at the moment of opening it.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Lightning works. It absolutely is trustless. If it weren’t, nobody would use it. If you send funds to me on over LN and then deny having sent them, I will have cryptographic proof that you did send them. Neither you, nor anyone else on the LN network can take those funds back without my permission. If you do, you risk getting penalized when I close my channel.

Lightning is a layer that will work alongside Bitcoin and other cryptos. It will allow developers to create new ways to interact with the blockchains. It doesn’t really mean anything for altcoins other than giving them the ability to participate in the network as long as their chain tech can support it. Many already can support it, but others would require a hard fork to incorporate the necessary tech.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:17:13
You completely misunderstood the numbers that you quoted. I am on my phone and not willing to explain it. If successful, Lightning will be huge. It will enable thousand of Bitcoin transactions per second, mostly off-chain with occasional settling on-chain. Thousands of transactions per second will be a reasonable expectation, allowing many cryptos to compete with VISA and Mastercard.

There is no possible way to scale thousands of TPS on a decentralized chain. It’s not even remotely possible given current tech. It would slowly turn into a corporate controlled coin over time as adoption ramped up, and that would defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.

I don’t think it matters how centralized or decentralized the Lightning network is as long as the main chain stays decentralized. If Lightning becomes centralized, what would that mean for all the users? What harm would come of it? And what would stop people from running their own Lightning nodes similar to how they run Bitcoin nodes? As long as the transactions are trustless, your funds are safe in the channels.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:54:43
My questions weren't rhetorical. I am not saying that I want centralized Layer 2 solutions. I am genuinely asking what could go wrong? If corporations tried any shenanigans, what would stop others from running Lightning nodes? Won't they be competing with each other over who offers the best services (lowest fees, best throughput, no censoring, etc.)? Will it even cost much to run a node? How can a bad actor in the Lightning network survive?

It’s based on how much space it takes in a block, not the amount of Bitcoin being transacted. It’s possible for a higher fee to send 0.001 BTC than to send 1,000 BTC. It depends on how fragmented the wallet is and which address(es) the wallet software decided to spend from.

Bitcoin is way faster in terms of settlement. A credit card transaction can be reversed WEEKS later. A Bitcoin transaction is practically irreversible once it is confirmed (\~10 minutes).

Yes, but I think it goes even deeper than that. People will lock funds into many different channels, and you will be able to send funds to anyone on the entire network of channels. For me to send you Bitcoin across the Lightning network, I don't think we both necessarily need to have a channel open with the same third party. Funds will route across the network similar to how Internet traffic gets routed. I believe you will also be able to transfer from one cryptocurrency to another across the network as well (atomic swaps). I will be able to send you Litecoin by spending some of my Bitcoin.
I don't think people realize just how big Lightning is. It has the potential to change crypto forever and make it a viable currency for daily use.

Yes, and if they are in a legacy wallet and you want them to be in a Segwit wallet, just send them to the receive address in your regular (Segwit) wallet which begins with a "3". Unfortunately, doing so at the moment is very costly due to the mempool being packed. I would hold off on doing that. Any new coins you receive you can put in the regular wallet, though. You will still have access to the legacy wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:30:04
It's trustless from the sender to the receiver, regardless how many hops it takes across the network. Nobody has to trust anybody else. The worst thing that will happen to someone on the network will be for their open channel to be inaccessible when they need to use it. That's why you may want to have a backup channel open. Otherwise you would need to open a new one and wait for it to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:07:25
Based on my reading and limited understanding, it will be virtually limitless. I've read some claims of millions and even billions of transactions per second. How efficiently people can interact on the main chain (opening/closing channels) may still be a factor in limiting how useful it is, and more tech, larger blocks, etc. may still be needed.

Someone please correct me if I am wrong. I think if the channel is closed before the originally established closing date, the other party will have plenty of time to respond as a way of reconciling the transaction history. If the closer removes a transaction(s) as a way of trying to cheat, the other party’s records will prove that the transaction(s) took place. There may even be some way of punishing the dishonest party, but I am not sure.
I don’t think you can close a channel early and then immediately have access to the funds. This is to mitigate fraud and abuse.

How can a bad actor “steal” funds or otherwise do something that negatively impacts another participant? If there is a disagreement, it hurts the one who is being dishonest. Do you really think there is a way to cheat on the network, and the Lightning devs just haven’t realized it yet?

The Lightning network is trustless. You do not need to trust any party on the LN network that you open channels with. If they try to steal your coins, you get to take everything in the channel. People who try to steal in the LN are going to have a very, very bad time.
The worst thing that will happen to you is that the channel will be inaccessible when you want to use it. You use a different channel in that case. You can also force the other channel to close early. Lightning is actually pretty fucking amazing.

Right now you pay less to spend from a Segwit address, but only because others are still spending from legacy addresses. Luke is technically correct, which by the way is the best kind of correct.
An analogy would be that if everyone got a 10% raise, nobody would have more spending power. However, if YOU got a 10% raise today but most other people stayed the same, YOU would have more spending power.

Yet somehow TREZOR managed to implement a clean and easy to understand solution just days after SW was activated. Just have the existing BTC appear as “BTC Legacy” and add a new one called “BTC.” Add a help link near them which redirects to a webpage explaining what happened, and explaining that funds can be sent between the two wallets. Eventually users can disable “BTC Legacy” and won’t even see it anymore. How is this not a logical and easy solution to implement?

I call myself a liberaltarian because I am kind of in the center on fiscal policies (but extremely left on social issues). I am just super fascinated by the tech and see the potential benefits of having world currencies available to everyone on the planet, where governments can’t fuck with the supply side, and nobody can stop transactions (permissionless). The idea of streaming money (possibly coined by Andreas) sounds pretty amazing as well. I follow a lot of people on Twitter who are involved with crypto, and I get annoyed at times by some of the political opinions that I don’t agree with. They have more than just one interest, so it’s unreasonable to suggest that they stop talking about non-crypto-related topics. Just ignore the stuff you don’t like or unfollow them if you can’t bear it. Every time Andreas posts something about supporting LGBT rights, he gets attacked by people who just want him to shut up and talk about crypto.

I can understand your frustration, but it really was extremely stupid of you to send such a large amount of Bitcoin to a stranger. Bitcoin isn’t PayPal, or Venmo, or Bank of America. There is nobody to call when you send Bitcoin to someone on a promise, and they break that promise. Once you broadcast a BTC transaction to the network (and once it’s confirmed), it’s like mailing someone an envelope full of cash (actually it’s even more final than that!). It’s gone with no recourse. That’s by design.
Yes, people can be assholes, but come on. Why would you do this? The only way you can get it back is if the person who controls that BTC sends it back to you (or you find a way to steal or scam it back from him).
It’s stories like this that make me feel that most people cannot he trusted to be their own banks. I really do think that custodial services (banks) will be necessary in a crypto world. It would be chaos without them. Those who want to be their own banks, and are willing to accept the responsibilities that come with it, will be able to do so. But for the majority of everyday transactions, I see banks being involved. I don’t even see it as a bad thing because at least people will have a choice.

It's a giant "FUCK YOU" to the system when someone mines an empty block. They are intentionally not including any transactions in the block and just taking the newly mined BTC but without any fees. They choose to give up getting rewarded thousands of dollars worth of fees in order to keep more unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, thus keeping fees higher for everyone.
Bitmain is just salty because BTC continues to thrive despite all their doom and gloom over block size and Segwit.

Yes, it can happen. Even with a different recovery phrase, someone else's wallet could generate an address that yours already created. Both cases are just EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. It's so unlikely that we accept it as being practically impossible.

Most info I find online states that hardwares wallets are cold storage. As for hacking the firmware, of course it's possible, just not likely. Definitions aside, you must agree that if you have your wallets stored on a TREZOR, and you also have the wallets on paper, the TREZOR does a MUCH better job at securing them from theft? If I gave you my TREZOR, you would likely never gain access to my funds. You would never even be able to guess or brute force my passphrase, and that's if you managed to get past the PIN or uncover the recovery words. If someone got ahold of my paper wallets, the funds are gone.
Can you at least show me a link to a reputable site that classifies hardware wallets are hot storage? I couldn't find one.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:44:01
For the record, I agree that it needs to be easier to understand how to use in order to go mainstream. It needs to be trivial for an average person to understand how to use and to secure their coin. People need to trust that their money is safe and reliable. Unfortunately, a lot more people are going to have their money stolen because of their ignorance about "how it works." Software needs to abstract almost all of the complexity away from the user. To us tech nerds, they already do that. To an average person, it's extremely confusing.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:36:41
99.999% of the time, a hardware wallet is not connected to an Internet device. A smartphone wallet is hot. A computer wallet such as Electrum or Exodus is hot. Hardware wallets are cold wallets because they are offline almost all of the time. Cryptocurrency transactions require the Internet, so no matter how you sign your transactions, a connection is required at some point.
Hardware wallets and paper wallets are cold storage. Also, I would argue that hardware wallets are safer because if someone steals a hardware wallet, they still have to get past the device's security (PIN and/or passphrase). If they steal a paper wallet, that coin is as good as gone.
How would hacked firmware get onto a hardware wallet if you need to approve the update on the device itself? I suppose it's possible that a hacked version could make its way onto the official TREZOR website, or the company could be behind it, but it's a very, very unlikely thing to happen. At some point, you have to trust SOMEBODY and SOME METHOD of storage. I just don't see how anything is safer than a hardware wallet, especially while maintaining a decent level of convenience for spending out of the wallets.

The keys never leave the TREZOR device. There is no software that could be secretly installed on a computer that can get the private keys off the TREZOR. Only a firmware hack on the TREZOR can change that. I don't think it's possible to do that without the owner noticing when they attempt to use it again.

@_date: 2017-08-12 00:42:03
Unless the PC is kept offline, it is hot storage. The keys are on the PC, which can be compromised. Even if encrypted, someone can at least try to brute force their way to your wallets if the keys are on a PC connected to the Internet.
With a TREZOR, I don't think you can do any brute forcing. Every time you guess the PIN incorrectly, you have to wait DOUBLE the amount of time to guess again. After just a few wrong guesses, you have to wait a very long time to try again. And even if you DO get past the PIN, you have to brute force or guess the passphrase!
And again, firmware cannot be uploaded to the TREZOR without your permission. You literally have to okay it by clicking on the device. You also have to click okay for every transaction signing, so you have an opportunity to verify the amount and address to which you are sending funds before confirming it. PC's are more easily compromised because malicious software creators find holes in much, much larger, more complex, and more open systems (i.e., Windows) and also take advantage of the common user's ignorance (i.e., phishing attacks).
Nothing is 100%, but I secure my crypto with TREZOR, and I haven't lost any sleep worrying about it. Hardware wallets are the only way I would ever recommend it with large amounts.

Trezor and other hardware wallets are cold storage, not hot. Using a Trezor with a good PIN and a passphrase is one of the safest ways to secure your crypto. Even when connected to a compromised computer, a hardware wallet will protect you. Anyone with a large amount invested should be using hardware and/or paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:40:26
I completely agree. We are waaaaay earlier than 1998 in terms of maturity and acceptance. I was going to say 1990 as well. In 1998, probably more than half of all people in developed countries had at least experienced the Internet. A very large percentage already had daily access to it. As for cryptocurrencies, it's still a very, very tiny percentage of people who have experienced using it, let alone able to explain what it is and how it works.

Other than scaling, I really think this is the biggest issue facing mass adoption. I don't believe there is a way for people to "be their own bank," at least not until some new decentralized, trustless tech is developed.

I believe it is unrealistic to expect an average person to secure their own coins. People are simply too lazy, careless, etc. I believe that Bitcoin will take off eventually, but people will still be using banks (credit cards) to spend. That will also allow them to make disputes in cases of fraud. Some WILL use their own wallets to spend from, and it will save them in the form of CC fees, which will likely be driven down much lower from where they are now to encourage people to continue trusting banks with their Bitcoin. Unless there is some unexpected and awesome new way of securing coins invented, I just don’t see billions of people securing their own funds. It would be an absolute disaster as people lose their private keys and get them stolen. The constant thefts alone would taint crypto currency enough to scare people from using it. It’s plenty easy enough for careful, detail-oriented techies like many of us, but not for the masses. That said, I am still very optimistic about the future of Bitcoin. I just don’t think banks are going anywhere. People will still want and need them.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:21:45
So many arguments Schiff made against Bitcoin also apply to gold. Contrary to what he says, gold has value for two main reasons. It’s (relatively) scarce, and people agree to value it. It’s not because of its intrinsic value that is has value. We can make jewelry out of plenty of other, even less scarce, metals.
Bitcoin is decentralized, digital scarcity. It is transported and stored more easily than gold. It is censorship resistant. It knows no borders. It’s highly divisible. It cannot be counterfeited. Simply put, Bitcoin is better than gold at being a store of value. Once layer 2 solutions mature and scaling issues are solved, Bitcoin stands to be the best money the world has ever known.

Funds secured on phones are not even remotely as secure as those on a TREZOR. For starters, most wallets on phones don’t employ the use of pass phrases. That means that if someone accesses your device, they need only your PIN, which can be known or guessed by those who know you. Or maybe you are asleep or passed out drunk, and someone uses your finger to unlock your device. Then they can steal your funds from your wallet, possibly needing only to know or guess your PIN of you added that to your wallet security. Think about an unhappy lover or spouse, or an untrustworthy friend. Many people have lost or had their funds stolen from phone wallets. Far fewer have had the same issue with hardware wallets. I realize there are probably way more phone wallets in use than hardware wallets, but I bet the rate of failure is far far higher with phone wallets. Anyone storing large amounts on phone wallets is taking a big risk and should consider using a hardware wallet as a “crypto safe” for large amounts. Keep a smaller amount on your phone wallet for casual spending and refill it as needed.

Why would nodes and/or miners refuse a transaction based on the fee amount? I think you are confusing nodes (mining or not) with wallets. A wallet may stop you from specifying a fee if it is beyond a certain threshold (to protect you from mistakes), but I’m not aware of any rules to the Bitcoin protocol that will reject a transaction due to its fee size. In fact, mining nodes in particular should be very glad to accept those transactions because they are the recipient of the large fees!

Most people using Ledger/TREZOR employ passphrases. I've never even seen that on a phone wallet. People generally keep them safely stored as well and don't travel everywhere they go with them. It's also far harder to discover people's PIN's by watching them unlock a hardware wallet. With a TREZOR Model T, not only can you not really see the screen while they are unlocking it, the numbers are put in random positions on the screen, and good luck figuring out their passphrase. Even with a key logger on a computer you won't be able to get it if they use the device to enter it.
I'm not saying that you can't be smart about securing funds on a phone wallet and be *relatively* safe, but equal effort put into a hardware wallet will be more secure.

That is correct. Or you can just enter how much BTC you want to purchase, and it will take it out of your bank account automatically and purchase BTC with it in one step.
You can purchase BTC using Cash App and have it sent to your hardware wallet all within minutes. It’s the best buying experience I’ve had.

I don't see how more decentralized mining would have changed things. Maybe your average hobbyist miner wouldn't have been as quick to switch coins, but the general effect would be the same. Miners follow the money. Sure some would mine for less profit to help support their preferred coin, but most won't. Unless both difficulty adjustment algorithms change, there will be predictable periods where it makes financial sense for a miner to switch coins.
Personally, I would like to see Bitcoin adjust their EDA to help mitigate the effect of a drastic decrease in hash power (and drastic increases, but especially decreases). Otherwise, depending on market forces and other circumstances, an attack can be made and send BTC into the dreaded death spiral.
Someone can correct me if I am wrong, but I imagine that if both BTC and BCH had similar, quickly adjusting difficulty algorithms, each chain would end up with a more stable hash rate that is proportional to its coin value versus the others.
That said, I would love for some more options in the mining equipment scene, especially with smaller (cheaper) models with comparable efficiency. I would even mine at a break even point just for the fun of it.

Yes it will show up. Many wallets produce a new address every time you click to receive. Some will produce a new one once the last one has Bitcoin sent to it. Your wallet is smart enough to keep track of them without your needing to understand how it does it.

If you don’t work somewhere where you have access to some code (preferably well-written), then you are going to have to find tutorials online. It’s also not a bad idea to pick up a book on C Just don’t be discouraged if you have trouble understanding everything. Learning a language takes time, and so does thinking in an object oriented way. Once you learn one OO language, you can pick up others very quickly. It’s also good to go back and re-read a book after you get some experience. I read one years ago and only picked up like 20% of the concepts. After a few years of getting involved at work on projects, I went back and re-read it and lights were going off and gaps were getting filled in my understanding. Also go to Microsoft’s site and look for documentation on the language. They have very thorough guides on learning all the basics through advanced concepts. You don’t have to learn in any order either. Skip through a book or guide to whatever you want. Read about classes, properties, and methods until you totally get it. Otherwise it will look like you are looking at gibberish when you look at code. Also note that most code sucks. I’ve worked at several places and with many, many different people. Most people’s code is total shit. Well written code is pure fucking art.

Being completely, 100% accurate makes me pedantic? Fuck you. Don't imply that the current system is hamstrung with 1 MB blocks, and *pedantic little fucks* won't need to correct you. There is enough misinformation and misunderstanding out there as to how all this stuff works. I just wanted to point out that your implication was false. If only one other person reads this and comes to the realization that S2X doesn't mean increasing from 1 MB blocks to 2 MB blocks, then it was worth it.
And no, I did not know what you meant. Every day I read people claiming that BTC has a maximum block size of 1 MB, and that S2X doubles that. Whether that's being stated through ignorance or malice, it needs to be called out as false.
A mature person would have accepted that their claim was false and politely moved on from this.

I just downloaded it on my iPhone, and I can definitely see why people are upset about it. It most certainly does default to receiving BCH, and it lists the BCH wallet first on the Home screen. If I was new to Bitcoin and didn’t know the history, I would be confused as fuck. This app is definitely going to mislead newcomers. The overall presentation seems to imply that Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are both “Bitcoin” which is false. It would be far less confusing if the name of the app wasn’t called “Bitcoin.com” which again is misleading to a newbie. Visiting the site will just mislead even more. This is some shady shit.

In the early to mid-90s, the Internet was mainly being used by academics and techies. It was viewed as too complicated and difficult to use by most people. That’s where we are now with Bitcoin. It’s as easy for most of us here to use and understand as it was for techies to use and understand email and web sites in the early ‘90s.
Once software evolves some more, Bitcoin will be ready for the masses. Many of us think that Bitcoin adoption is going to explode in the next few years similar to how Internet adoption exploded in the second half of the ‘90s.

In other words, you were wrong and I was right. I don’t see how I was being pedantic by calling you out for perpetuating what seems to be a common misconception. The “2” in S2X doesn’t mean “2 MB.” We’ve already had blocks larger than 1 MB and will continue to see more.

On-chain scaling to what level? I don't think anybody would agree that 1GB blocks would be a good thing, but mainstream adoption of BTC would require on-chain scaling much greater than that. There is no way to keep BTC decentralized without off-chain scaling solutions. 8MB blocks are NOTHING, and 1GB blocks are NOTHING compared to what would be required to process thousands of transaction per second.
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:58:10

My opinion may be unpopular here amongst techies and early adopters, but I think most people are less likely to lose funds by storing them on Coinbase. Most people cannot be trusted with their own money, at least not until something better than “write down these word and make sure nobody else ever sees them” comes along.

I don’t think it’s possible. How would you remove a valid pending transaction from the mempool which is stored on thousands of nodes, many of which are actively trying to mine it into a block?
You would need to make that pending transaction invalid somehow. I don’t know if any wallets would allow you to try to spend the same inputs from the pending transaction to a new address(es). I also don’t know how the network would react to a second transaction being broadcast using the same inputs which exceeds the balance of those inputs due to the first pending transaction. I think nodes might reject the second transaction as invalid? Can someone confirm
By the way, this sounds like a shady thing to do.

I’d like to see an example of an exchange (or anyone else for that matter) blacklisting or refusing service to someone with CoinJoined or mixed coins. Even if someone did implement some sort of software to blacklist these coins, how far up a transaction chain would they go? What if the CJ is ten transactions deep and took place months ago? What happens if, as others have pointed out, most coins end up having a CJ in their history? You can’t blacklist everything.
Let’s say somebody sends CJed coin to an exchange and they refuse to “accept” it. What does that even mean? Once you realize you have the coins, you can’t reverse the transaction so now you (the exchange) own the so-called bad coins. What do you do with those coins? Burn them? Send them back out to one of your customers during a withdrawal and declare them “clean” again? That sounds crazy and subject to abuse.
I want crypto to succeed, but people are not going to accept Big Brother monitoring their spending by forcing exchanges, employers, businesses, etc. to track everything and trying to link every transaction to a person or entity. I understand the desire to mitigate money laundering and other crimes, but it can’t be at the cost of entities, government or other, from violating what most people would consider to be fundamental rights to privacy.
If you asked people how they would feel if they were told that all spending must go through a government monitored database, they would tell you to take a hike. And yet that’s not far off from the type of system we would have if we don’t make a stand with privacy.
If XMR can be bought and traded on exchanges, then what is the problem with mixed BTC?

My guess is that they have a minimum due to not passing along any Bitcoin network fees to you. If you purchase 0.1 BTC and withdraw all of it to another wallet, you receive the full 0.1 BTC.
Doing it this way stops people from spamming small transactions out of their Cash wallet, causing a large number of BTC network fees for them to eat.

You’re sending from a different number of inputs. One of the bad things about most wallet software is that they give you no control, or even any insight, into the UTXO’s that make up your wallet’s balance. It’s good for most users because they don’t understand how that even works. But for more advanced users, it would be nice to see and be able to select the inputs from which to spend. I believe Samourai does this on Android (I’m on iOS). Wasabi Wallet does it too. As for hardware wallets, neither Ledger nor TREZOR do it
@_date: 2018-11-03 05:40:27

Can someone explain the use case for this? It sounds very cool, but this isn’t intended for storage of large amounts of BTC, right? Is this something you would use to mix some BTC before sending it to someone when you want it to be more private and difficult to trace? I use a TREZOR for storage, and moving BTC from there to a Wasabi wallet would likely make it less secure?

You can change it to show BTC in bits. Go to Preferences &gt; Display Currency. There’s a setting at the top called Bitcoin Display Unit. I believe a bit is what you are calling a micro BTC. It’s one millionth of a Bitcoin. I am using the iOS version, so Android might be different.

I just checked my BRD BTC wallet, and it is still generating non-Segwit addresses. I don’t see anything is the settings either. How do I enable Segwit?
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:53:12
For large amounts, use a TREZOR or Ledger. For small amounts and carry-around funds, try Edge Wallet. A lot of people like Bread (I think it’s just BRD now), but I think it’s missing some very obvious features like Segwit and the ability to easily send all funds out of the wallet (sweeping). I also find their support for BCH questionable. I like Edge Wallet a lot, but some people are turned off by having to register a username and password. It’s actually not used the way people assume it is, though. I’m okay with it.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:20:49
Maybe people can look through the source code and confirm whether or not there is a way for that to happen. Or maybe a way for the arbitrators to pull it off. If that is their plan (which I highly doubt), they would wait for it to grow much, much larger. By that point, some people will almost certainly be reviewing the code base for such an attack. Nothing about the Bisq project says "scam!" to me at this point.

If you’re willing to spend a bit more, I highly recommend Intel NUC’s. I have one sitting on a shelf running Bitcoin Core and Litecoin Core. I plan to run a LN as well on it eventually.

@_date: 2018-11-03 05:50:27
Yeah I think this is the idea. Get all of your BTC from your TREZOR wallet into Wasabi and mixed, then back into a different wallet/account in the TREZOR. It could be a new account in your existing wallet, or create a whole new wallet (maybe with a different passphrase for example).  You can even do it in phases. No need to do it all at once.

If what you say is true, then even staff at a company that is built around crypto have been fooled/mislead by Roger and his nonsense. Just imagine how a rando who finally decides to research “what this Bitcoin stuff is all about” feels. People laugh and brush it off like people are just too dumb to sort it all out. Not everyone who has taken an interest to Bitcoin and crypto spends every night on or Twitter or reading blogs about it. There is a lot of confusion out there and proponents of BCH are the cause of it. It’s what they want because without it, their shitcoin would have died right out of the gate. Instead it is lingering around like a festering wound, clinging to life by stealing the Bitcoin brand.

As someone with a strong background in math, I disagree. Most programmers don’t even deal with high level math. It’s interesting that you mentioned crypto. One of Bitcoin Core’s standout devs is Greg Maxwell, a self-taught programmer. The two best skills/traits that I can think of for good programmers are logical thinking and communication. Logical thinking cannot be taught. Language can be taught, but being able to use a language to communicate effectively is mostly a skill. When I think of all the best people I’ve ever worked with, they all excelled at logical thinking and communication. And I never said that six months of anything would make you a good software engineer. I said it would give more *practical* experience than a four year degree.

From my understanding, there will be a lot of LN channels where one end will rarely be seen online, and the other will be online almost always. Nobody will need to have a 24/7 node running to use LN. It’s only when one party wants to use the channel that both nodes need to be online. People’s hot wallets on their phones will be seldom-online nodes. People are already talking about other cool stuff like watch towers that will help to keep everyone honest and prevent people from getting defrauded in some rare circumstances. I find it all very exciting, and most people have no idea this stuff is coming. If it takes off, it’s going to happen so fast. Only ten years ago, hardly anyone had a smartphone, and now we can’t imagine not having them, with Internet access, turn by turn GPS, making financial transactions, arguing with randos on Reddit, etc. It’s weird how quickly we adapt and forget how things used to be.

Without watching the video, I’m going to guess it’s because when you sign and submit a transaction, you don’t know who is going to mine it. Even if you did know, it would be very inefficient if every transaction with a fee had to add an extra output for the miner. The way it works now is maximally efficient where the miner takes all of the leftovers as fees.

If people are spamming the network, it will cost them fees to do so. It will likely get their channels ignored/banned by the network as well, causing them to have to open new channels to start attacking again, which means paying fees on-chain.

Yeah banks aren’t going away. Crypto is just going to cut into some of the ways they currently make money such as (high) fees to transmit. People are still going to want loans, and people will want someone to call if they get ripped off. I’m 100% behind Bitcoin and crypto, but I won’t feel comfortable sending funds to an address that pops up on my browser during a purchase, with no recourse if they say I never paid or if they don’t send the product I ordered. I am fine with using banks to send money in those cases (and deal with their fees) as long as I can transact from my own wallet for transactions made in person or to people I know and trust.

Use Square Cash app to purchase Bitcoin, and transfer it to a hardware wallet for cold storage and/or Edge Wallet for hot storage.

I’m not sure about Android wallets. A lot of people like Samourai, and I assume Edge is also excellent for Android.

Of course I can't, and neither can you. I said "I don't see any correlation..." I didn't say, "There is no correlation." If there is one, I haven't noticed it based on my (relatively) small sample size. I have known many very good developers who had advanced degrees, and many who had only high school diplomas. I have also known some who were not very good, some with degrees and some without. One thing that I will say about the successful ones with only high school educations - they are ambitious and driven. They probably had to be in order to get to where there are. Please note that I am absolutely not suggesting that people with degrees aren't driven, or aren't as good as those without. I'm saying that I haven't noticed a correlation. I also firmly believe that a degree is not *necessary* to be successful.

They fluff their job postings the same way people fluff their resumes. Oh, and don’t fluff your resume. It’s good to be confident about what you know, and humble and honest about what you don’t.

I think he lost a boatload of money and got very affected emotionally. He says he hasn’t sold so really he hasn’t lost anything other than big gains that he was so sure were coming soon. He also has his own ICO coming out soon which will work on the Ethereum chain, and maybe he feels like he has to stop crapping on ETH and stop being such a BTC maximalist. It may be a combination of an unexpected price course for BTC and ETH, and a bias for wanting to increase the chance of launching a successful token. Honestly, I still think he is
super smart, but I’ve lost some respect for him. I can’t decide on exactly what has caused his sudden and dramatic change in tone when discussing BTC. He seems bitter that it’s not mooning in price right now, but we just aren’t there yet with technology. Lightning may change that in the next one to three years, and then we may be ready for the gigantic price increase that he was so certain was coming now.

Oh no it isn’t. Let a node operator try to take it from you and see what happens. VISA could steal your USD. A LN node operator can try to steal your BTC, but they will fail and you will get ALL of the BTC in the channel, including funds you already sent to the other side. In other words, if they try to screw you, you screw them back. Bitcoin doesn’t care who you are or why you did what you did. All it cares about is math, which is on your side if someone tries to steal from you. Comparing a LN channel to a VISA gift card is not at all a fair comparison.

I think it’s insane that we send so many young, bright, financially broke people to college for CS degrees. Companies should take people in as interns or low paid apprentices where they can work alongside experienced developers. They will leave a six month job with more practice experience than any four year degree would give them. I know and work/have worked with many programmers/developers, and I don’t see any correlation between ability and educational background. I a not suggesting that a degree is not worth anything. I just don’t think it’s fair that people feel that they need to get a degree (and go deep into debt) in order to land that first job. Thankfully it seems that most employers don’t require a formal educational background and count experience (which is far more valuable!). But without a degree, getting that first job can be difficult.

Larger chains lead to more centralization. It’s that simple. BCH is already vastly more centralized than BTC is. It’s not even remotely close.

I don't think we disagree on much. My main point is that a *formal* education is not necessary to be a great software engineer. I also think that apprenticeships offer a better way for the inexperienced to grow into a career in CS. It would also give employers an excuse to bring in entry-level employees at an even lower rate. Most entry-level positions have at least *some* expectations such as a degree or some experience. I'm talking about an even more entry-level position where you get a shot at showing that you have the ability and drive to become a valuable contributor *eventually*. I see it as a win-win for both potential employees and employers. Employers get low level employees willing to work for very low pay and do some of the shit work that experienced people would rather not do, and inexperienced employees get to avoid spending years and thousands of dollars on formal education, and instead get to earn a little money while getting started on their (hopefully) careers.

Limited quantity will be its downfall? Can you explain why you mean by that? Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be sent quickly and easily across and distance, and even in very very low quantities. We can even adjust it down the road to add more decimal places if needed. How can there be a limited quantity of something that can be sent easily and in very small quantities? Where we put the decimal point and whatever we call a unit is completely arbitrary. That’s why it makes no sense when someone complains that “a Bitcoin is too expensive.” Uhhh, then buy 0.1 BTC. Or 0.01 BTC. All that matters in the end is how we agree to value it against goods, services, other currencies and stores of value, etc. For some reason, people have an irrational attachment to the unit price.

Legacy can send to Segwit and vice-versa. I believe the benefits of lower fees come into play when you send out of a Segwit address. That's why it is currently a good thing to have your BTC in Segwit addresses. That way your next send will take up less data and therefore have lower fees.

Can a duplicate address be generated? Yes.
Is it likely to ever happen in a billion years? Probably not.
It's considered so rare that we consider it to be "practically impossible."
Even if a dupe happened, what are the odds that there are funds in it? Maybe they were spent out of it millions of years ago?
It's good to ask these questions, but know that Satoshi thought of it years before most people reading this ever even heard of crypto.

What I mean by sweeping is the ability to say, "I want to send ALL of my available BTC." It should adjust itself if you change the fee setting as well so that when you send, it sends ALL of your BTC. I think it's fine to have a few settings like "Regular" and "Economy" but an advanced section for fees would be nice. Maybe have it show the sat/byte in parentheses after the words "Regular" and "Economy" (these would be dynamic and change with current market conditions), and also have an input where you can specify the sat/byte yourself. I understand that most users would be fine with never using the custom fees or even understand what sat/byte means. The interface is already clean and minimalist, and I would keep it that way. Maybe just have a check box somewhere to show the advanced fee settings. Or maybe have you go into the app settings to enable them.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:40:44
It will be interesting to see what this does to the Segwit transaction percentage. It will give us an idea of just how much Bitcoin comes out of addresses controlled by Coinbase. BTW, I have to wonder if they haven’t been working really really hard to get this done while fees are so low. They have a lot of very small UTXO’s in legacy addresses that they probably want to spend while the sending is cheap, as they receive all new funds in Segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:23:22

I have no doubt that I understated the probability. It's good enough just to know that it is so rare that it's not worth worrying about. Even GUID's are far more likely to be duplicated at a mere 2^128 number of unique values. There are 2^160 (I think?) possible Bitcoin addresses. That means there are more than 4,000,000,000 times as many Bitcoin addresses as there are GUID values.

Once your wallet uses receive addresses starting with a 3, you'll be using Segwit. Spending out of a Segwit address is much cheaper than spending out of a legacy address. Eventually, the vast majority of funds will be stored in Segwit addresses. I sent a few transactions using a TREZOR, and I was only paying a few cents worth in fees.

I am not downplaying math BTW. I myself have a background in math. The kind of thinking involved in math is very similar to that required for programming. Everything in programming is cause and effect. It's very predictable but can get very abstract and difficult to follow at a high level, just like math. Learning asynchronous programming comes to mind (as does learning abstract algebra!). Excellent programmers tend to be very strong mathematically and have strong communication skills. Code is language after all.

Someone correct me if I am wrong, but there are WAY MORE than 2^40 combinations of words. Shouldn't it be something like 4096^24? That's ~5x10^86 or 2^288. That would probably be more than the grains of sand in the entire observable universe.

It absolutely is possible to generate an address that was already generated by another wallet. I don’t know for certain, but I think every wallet may eventually generate every possible address. With infinite time and usage, collisions are a certainty. However, the likelihood of having two wallets claiming ownership of funds in the same address at the same time is so low that we act as though it were impossible. It’s just not worth worrying about. Bitcoin addresses make GUID’s look common even though GUID’s are so vast that we can generate billions of them at a time and not worry about possible duplicates.

It's that way now. People paying more than 5-8 S/byte are overpaying. This is a problem with wallets which do a terrible job at setting/recommending fees. I've made several transactions over the past few days using Bread, and I selected the economy option every time which was around $0.10 per transaction. Even though there was a warning about longer confirmation times, they all got confirmed quickly.
Writing a check is a very different way to move funds, and "confirmation" times are MUCH LONGER than they are for Bitcoin. Same goes for credit cards because they can be disputed. Cash certainly has Bitcoin beat with $0.00 fees every time, but there are many reasons why most of us on this sub would rather use crypto than cash.
Fees are already low for Bitcoin, at least for now. Layer 2 will make them lower and keep them lower. The days of paying a percentage of your transaction in fees are coming to an end. The telecoms would still be gouging us for long-distance phone calls if the Internet hadn't come along and sent their consumer-unfriendly business model packing.

We need someone else to manufacture ASIC miners that are on par with Bitmain’s in terms of efficiency. And we really need a smaller-scale model so that people don’t need to invest $2K+ to enter the mining scene. I know there are already smaller models but they aren’t efficient enough to warrant using them other than as a geek hobby. It’s already cheap and easy to set up an effective node. Mining should be the same. If it were easier (cheaper) to get stared with mining, it would help to decentralize it.

But nobody can stop you from opening a channel directly with the person you want to transact with. Even if everyone wanted to stop you from sending Bitcoin to someone on the LN network and you couldn’t open a direct channel for some reason, you could still send it on-chain. Also, I’m not super knowledgeable on how routing takes place, but I was under the impression that most nodes along the route would not know where a transaction originated and where it ends. Only the sender would know that it was the first hop, and only the receiver would know that they are the last hop. Kinda like how TOR works? Regardless, I don’t expect people to have problems routing payments on the LN network.

Most programmers do not need much more than 8th grade level math to do their jobs effectively. If you plan to get into crypto, well then I'd say cyptography is a good area to study. Not once in my career have I needed to use geometry, trigonometry, calculus, etc. Maybe some basic algebra came in handy a few times, but not much more than that. As someone else has already pointed out, it depends on the *type* of programming you are doing and the industry. For example, I would guess that someone working on video games would need a lot more math skills than most others.

As you stated, wallets aren’t people. Also, the OP is referencing usage of Bitcoin. How do we define “a person who uses Bitcoin?” Someone who sent or received Bitcoin in the past year? The past month? Someone who simple owns some BTC? Does it have to be full control or does custody count?
It’s a difficult question to answer, but I think we can all agree that adoption is very, very low. That’s why the value of Bitcoin has the potential to grow much higher. I think people who laugh at a $100K Bitcoin price are in for a shock in the not too distant future. I really don’t think $1,000,000 per coin in the next 5-15 years is crazy either.

The mining issue could be solved, but nobody is stepping up to the plate to manufacture smaller (cheaper) but still efficient ASIC devices. Millions of relatively tiny miners could help to decentralize mining. Mining doesn’t need to be a business. A lot of us run nodes because the hardware is cheap to run it. The cheaper mining devices are not efficient enough to justify running them. Otherwise a lot more people would probably mine. If the landscape has changed much in the past several months, someone please tell me. I would love to run a small miner even if it doesn’t generate much BTC. Last time I checked, you needed to go all in and spend $2K from Bitmain and then you are at their mercy on delivery, payment options, and support.

Putting all transactions on the main chain is a big blocker fantasy. It is simply not possible to store that much data on a decentralized blockchain. To do that would take massive computing power (and bandwidth and storage). Every transaction needs to be validated by every node, not just mining nodes. It's just not feasible if Bitcoin needed to process thousands of transactions per second. Look at what is happening with BCH mining right now. The largest mining pool refuses to mine blocks larger than 2MB due to technical reasons.
If Bitcoin (or any other decentralized cryptocurrency of which there are none right now) is to be used on a massive scale, layer 2 and side chains are the best known way to handle it. The landscape is going to look very different in a few short years once the tech has time to mature.
Regardless, I still don't understand your point. EVERY node, mining or not, needs to validate every block and every transaction. Adding miners isn't going to "add computing power to make that happen faster."

That’s what I’m thinking. Coinbase will still make money each time you buy Bitcoin from them, so there’s a fee each time you refill your BTC wallet. Since it’s a percentage, it’s kinda the same end result as if you were paying a small percentage per transaction instead. It’s just all front loaded instead. This actually seems like a cool idea. You could get around paying them any fees at all by getting your Bitcoin from somewhere else, sending it to your Coinbase BTC wallet, then using your SHIFT card.

If you are participating in the sending/receiving of funds on the BTC blockchain, you need to verify EVERY transaction, not just your own. Or you need to trust that someone else is doing that for you (custodians).

S2X will increase max block size to way more than 2MB. I think it’s closer to 8MB. The current chain has a max block size of around 4MB already. Someone please correct me on the actual numbers. I just know that we already have max blocks of more than 2MB despite people incorrectly thinking that the “2” in S2X means 2MB max block size. Of course reaching those numbers relies on Segwit adoption which is slowly moving along.

I’m not being rude when I say this, just brutally honest. The main issue is that people are careless and lazy. Before I trusted my TREZOR wallet, I tested my backup by sending a small amount into my wallet, then wiping the device and recovering it and confirming it was restored. How people just blindly trust themselves with large amounts of crypto without having gone through a recovery test is beyond me.
Also, we need something better than “remember these seed words” in order for crypto to go mainstream. Yes it’s easy. But also, yes people are too dumb and lazy to be able to do it. I really don’t see any way for people to manage wallets 100% on their own. I think we will need trusted third parties to help with it. Even some of us early adopters are getting burned with HD wallets.

I don’t understand why people think banks will disappear if cryptos become mainstream. People will still want/need to borrow money.

Transacting Bitcoin isn't just "cheaper" than other methods. It's A LOT CHEAPER. I pay ~$0.10 per BTC transaction now. What is the minimum that VISA and MasterCard charge? How about a wire transfer? You could send $1,000,000 worth of BTC to someone and pay $0.10 in fees. And it will be confirmed in minutes.
That said, I look forward to Layer 2 solutions bringing the costs down even more, and creating infrastructures that will allow Bitcoin to scale to a level that is required for mainstream adoption.

Square is not really a Bitcoin wallet. It will show you how much you “own” in your Square account, and it will let you sell some/all of it back at the current price. It will also allow you to withdraw some/all to any address you want. However, when you make a withdrawal, you cannot specify any amount you want. You can choose to withdraw ALL of it, or select from a list of fractions amounts. That alone makes it unusable as a Bitcoin wallet. On top of that, withdrawals seem to take a while to actually get broadcast to the network. I did a few withdrawals, and each time it took several hours to show up. So both of these things make the Square app unsuitable as a Bitcoin wallet. What I suggested is that you withdraw it from Square into an actual wallet such as Edge, Bread (BRD), TREZOR, etc. Then you will have full control of your Bitcoin, and you can send any amount you want almost instantly.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:32:59
How am I moaning? All I did was state how a lot of people feel. The network was under direct attack, and not having SegWit fully supported by Bitcoin Core gave Roger and his cronies something to harp about with their social attacks. It’s in the past and the community is moving forward. I fully support what Core is doing, and I think they are on the right path, regardless how we got here. The big blockers are getting scared because shit is starting to hit the fan. Their scaling arguments are weak against Layer 2. It’s slowly becoming a reality, SegWit is ready, and holdouts like Coinbase are finally giving in. It’s exciting to think was two or three more years will bring after Lightning has a chance to mature.
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:15:32
The reasoning is to minimize potential losses due to theft, but it introduces additional risks due to complexity. My recommendation would be to use a TREZOR Model T. You could minimize risks by partitioning funds into multiple wallets by using multiple pass phrases. This could also be used to satisfy a criminal holding a gun to your head by emptying only one of your wallets.

Wallets need to go to the next level before mainstream adoption IMO. This is easy for most of us, but there is no way most of my family and friends could be trusted to figure this all out and not lose or get their funds stolen. It would be a shit show with lots of thieves taking advantage of those who are not tech-savvy. Layer 2 solutions will likely bring big improvements to this area.

I have been following him for many months, and I find his latest change of heart (tehe) very strange. Basically we lost the gains from the past two months. I realize the momentum is down overall, but how is a two month reset switch the death of Bitcoin? And he announced that he will be using the Ethereum network for his ICO? The same Ethereum that he trashed and said was headed towards zero? This is so bizarre coming from him.
With regards to what he says starting at 1:18:50, he is absolutely correct. People are way too stupid and/or lazy to manage their own private keys. Until there is some newer, easier way to secure and recover private keys, there will never be mainstream adoption where people are using the real wallets and taking true ownership of their funds. The best we can achieve is for people to trust exchanges like Coinbase to keep their funds safe for them.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:00:11
This was completely unwarranted. I agree that we needed Segwit sooner. It could have helped a lot against the social and network attacks made over the past few months against Bitcoin. For something so central to the scaling debate, it shouldn’t have taken this long for Segwit to be fully supported in the Core client. That said, here we are. Now it’s fucking show time. The storm is coming and Bitcoin is poised to rise above all of the shills and doubters and big blockers.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:04:09

I was referring to money being complicated, not Bitcoin. In many ways, crypto is simpler than fiat. If you want an eye opener, google “fractional reserve currency.” Money literally gets created out of thin air by banks, and it is just business as usual.
As for Bitcoin, there are a few much needed improvements before being able to have mainstream usage. Scalability is the obvious one, and we are hoping for Layer 2 solutions to solve that one soon. Other areas that will need addressed are simpler wallet UI’s and a rock solid approach to security that almost anyone can understand. If Bitcoin went mainstream today, theft and scams would be so common that people would be scared away from it. It would be WAY too easy to trick people into giving up their funds.
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:24:20
You are intentionally misrepresenting my claim. That is not what I or anybody has said here.
What I am saying is that adding more miners doesn't have any long-term effect on the average number of transactions that can be processed per block, per hour, etc.
When more miners start mining (i.e., the hash rate goes up), the rate at which new blocks are mined goes up proportionally. However, a difficulty adjustment will eventually be made to put the average number of new blocks mined back at once per ten minutes.
In other words, the number of miners (hash rate) has no lasting effect on how quickly transactions can be processed. And regardless how many miners there are, there are still limits to how many transactions can be processed per day because there is a limit to how many transactions can fit in a block.
@_date: 2019-09-08 21:47:51

That doesn’t mean that people should be able to trick others into buying something falsely advertised as something else. Yes, let the free market decide the winners and losers. But let’s also try to protect people from fraud. It’s bad enough that BCH has the word Bitcoin in it, but to label it as simply “Bitcoin” and the real Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core? That’s straight up fraud meant to confuse newbies.

Most people can’t even explain how money works. It’s WAY more complicated and fucked up than people realize.

I understand why people make this claim, but I can’t think of any way a TREZOR Model T can be exploited other than tricking the user with a phishing site or swapping a send address to a thief’s address. The transactions are signed by the device, and you never type any PIN, passphrase, or seed words into a computer. It really is a wonderful device.
