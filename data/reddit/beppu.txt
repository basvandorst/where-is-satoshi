**Fractional Reserve Banking is Legalized Lying**
With bitcoin, it is impossible, because bitcoin is HONEST to its core.

If you don't like the risk, don't lend.
If you don't mind the risk, be a good friend and help your fellow human being without regard for being paid back.  **GIVE!**
Not everything has to be an economic decision.

It's funny how truth has become a pejorative in this age as if to say, *How dare you be honest.*
People lie in order to control you.
And if you are controlled, you are not a free man.

**[Usury]( has historically caused a lot of problems.  There's a good reason it has been banned so many times in the past.  Yet, how many more times are we going to make the same mistake?

Usury has destroyed people and civilizations, and yet we still want to practice it???
I'm glad that bitcoin has attributes that make usury far less attractive than it is under our current world order, because it needs to **STOP**!
