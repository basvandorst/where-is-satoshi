I've never bought anything with BTC, waiting on my TenX VISA card to start paying my daily expenses with BTC.

does anyone have a link to a detailed guide on how to set up LN on a windows 10 machine (testnet)? I already have a full node running (bitcoin core)

Also, this card is currently only available in the EU, rest of the world is next year, and it converts to fiat currency at the moment of purchase (it's not a prepaid card)

I'm going to do the same thing, waiting for my TenX card, should be here anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:24:28
can I import my 3... address into electrum and use that?

I currently use it as a store of value, I literally had money in an envelope in a drawer that I was saving up to buy something, so I decided to put it in BTC, I now have tripled that money.
Next step is as a spending account, waiting on my TenX VISA card to start putting in my monthly cash for daily spending and use BTC as my main currency.
Spending=use daily

just bought 25€ of BTC, 5m later the price drops.
Good thing I'm HODLing, also it's my monthly buy

My prediction is 1 BTC (actually submitted that)

great write up, 1 question, when starting the pool/channel, do the 2 parties need to put in the same amount? or can it be 10$+90$ for example?
Imagine I want to set up a channel with Amazon to buy kindle books, i put 100$, can Amazon put in 0$ and just receive money for the books I order.

"Have you hired any cryptologist?"
This cracked me up. LOL

At least we have one of the best crypto tax exemptions on the planet, crypto trades aren't taxable in Portugal :)
I'm still looking for my first bitcoin payment in the real world though, never saw a store that accepts bitcoin in my area (Cascais).

I'll upgrade my node on the weekend :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:08:24
thank you

I think that is the only guy who understands what crypto currencies are
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:35:12
he has more than I do :(
PS: 0.2 BTC
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:42:45
wait what?!?!?
you can do less than 1 sat/byte? 
but the actual fee must be no less than 1 satoshi right, since there are no more decimal places, correct?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:45:37
it looks like those days are here again.

My portfolio is about 90% BTC, it used to be 99% BTC but I decided to invest a little bit in alt-coins, put in 20€ in 7 (each), just in case one of them turns out great
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:29:39
Yes, it's called (GRC)
Edit: it uses PoS, but the point is you can use BOINC as a cryptocurrency

1 Bitcoin = 1 BTC
in Dollars, they aren't used anymore

Binance has an Order Size Limit of 0.001 BTC and Bittrex has 0.0005, if you have a small portfolio Bittrex is better for small trades, binance has much higher volume.
