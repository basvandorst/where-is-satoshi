Have you considered that merchants just raise their price to be able to accommodate your "cash back" fees? It's a big circle jerk and everyone is in on it except you're in the middle.

It sounds like you're expressing what you feel but speaking for everyone. 
I think if someone says "that's not right, it's different than that", then you'd be better off trying to understand what they're expressing rather than continuing to prove your point.  
Then again what is your point with all of this?

What happens you never exchange for "fiat" and buy your plane with crypto? Do you ever have to pay income tax or just sales tax?

It's nonsense propaganda like this that makes me fear this is all a trap and that I should get out.

Wiggum: Good work Lou. You'll make sergent for this.
Lou: I already am sergent chief.
Wiggum: Quiet Lou! Or I'll bump you down to sergent so fast it'll make your head spin.

At a certain date will only get you so far won't it? The price can swing thousands of dollars in an hour.  
If you're looking for an average price it shouldn't be hard to find a table you can copy and paste. You could then implement with a vlookup or any other number of functions.

Just like that a casual comment on Reddit changed my whole perspective on shit.

an imagined state or society in which there is great suffering or injustice, typically one that is totalitarian or post-apocalyptic.

"Everyone new starts with Bitcoin. It’s how it works. You first get involved in Bitcoin, then venture off into Ethereum…" - FTA
A friend of mine started mining ethereum and also purchased BCASH before ever holding Bitcoin.  Somehow he did not understand that Bitcoin and BCASH had differences beyond names. I'd like to think that he's not the only person that didn't start with bitcoin.

Worse than that, it's illegal everywhere then you lose $5 and get stung by a bee.

People have such limited imagination when they state the "worst case scenario" . Worst case scenario ... I wake up and bitcoin cut off my dick,  raped my girlfriend with it then started a genocide in my name all while playing "never gonna give you up" by Rick Astley.

This just happened
CFA institute added bitcoin and crypto questions for their ethics exam.
CFA Institute is a global association of investment professionals.
The organization offers the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, the Certificate in Investment Performance Measurement (CIPM) designation, and the Investment Foundations Certificate.

Or... bitcoin becomes illegal and I end up bankrupt and in jail.  Don't say this is impossible unless you accurately predicted Donald Trump as president 4 years ago and you knew that "Never Gonna Give You Up" would be a one hit wonder and then a long time meme.

I never knew! Some of those songs are pretty good also. Who would have thought? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:17:53
.... how did you get it back out.  Did you attach a string to it or do you just basically poop it back out again.  
If you're pushing a foreign mass out of your body is it still pooping. I mean at that point if the cucumber is undigested would it become poop? 
At what point does food become poop? At a certain level of digestion? Only once it has been through the rest of the digestive system? What if you've had your stomach removed or your small intestines taken out? 
I need to stop following this rabbit hole because I need to get ready for work but I have a lot of unanswered questions here.

This was the first comment I read coming back... jarring.

I enjoyed that video. I finished watching it came back to this thread and felt confused and disoriented by why people were making comments completely unrelated to that YouTube video.
