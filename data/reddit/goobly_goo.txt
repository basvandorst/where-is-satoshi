With the lack of info from Mt. Gox, I guess everyone has to decide if they believe their info has been compromised or not. If hackers can get the bitcoins, it's not far-fetched that they'd take the personal info too. It's valuable on the black market. I was trying to gauge to see how many people have taken steps to protect their identity.

You can clearly feel the indignation ooze out of him in the entire document and you root for this one guy standing up to the US Federal Government! Then, he gives props to murderers and loses any credibility he may have had. D'oh!

The point is that Warren Buffett is not seeking to avoid the limelight. He regularly gives interviews, writes/publishes, and runs a public company. Because he's a WILLING public figure, he's probably got plenty of security in place for himself and his family. Further, his money is mostly in banks and stocks.  
On the other hand, Satoshi is unwilling and unprepared for this level of public scrutiny. AND his bitcoins (money) are likely on a computer at his house so he's a much easier target than a public figure like Mr. Buffet.

This. Looks. Awesome! I like the different ideas, apps, businesses that continue to sprout around bitcoin. It's important to have a wide variety of applications.

Not that I know of...just the supposed [extortion attempt by the hackers] ( Thought it may be prudent to just do something now about possible identity/passport theft than just sitting on my hands. Wondering if others have taken some steps already.

Damnit, I did not see that coming!

Ok, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and play devil's advocate. Sometimes, a dissenting voice is useful to help improve something, whether its a scientific theory or in this case, bitcoin.  
In all honesty, all 5 points ARE ACTUALLY TRUE. People use bitcoin to buy and sell illegal goods online. If you're not careful, hackers can (and have and will) steal your bitcoin. If you lose or have your bitcoin stolen, you cannot get it back. You shouldn't try to get out of paying taxes by using bitcoin. And bitcoin did experience plenty of volatility in the past year!  
In my opinion, the best rebuttal to this kind of press is to continue the trend we've seen in the past few months to a year. Namely, the continued building of the bitcoin network. The continued release of products and apps that can help a non-tech saavy person feel confident in buying, holding, and spending bitcoin. Continuing to persuade influential people to invest in and support bitcoin. Continuing to convince retailers and other businesses to accept bitcoin just like cash and credit cards.
We've made great strides as a community and I'm certain we'll continue to do so. But it's not in the best interests of bitcoin (or the whole crytocurrency revolution) to downplay or make fun of people who are discussing 100% true concerns about this revolution. We need every day people to believe in and use bitcoin. And we need to make it as easy and safe as possible for them to do so. The rest will take care of itself. Downvote away!

Man, I was with you until "In third world countries, like Africa..." Africa is a continent with many different countries and cultures! Rest of it was good though, straight forward and hitting the main points that most average users would want/need to know.

Do you think people wishing for war or peace actually brings about war or peace? Come on dude, you sound like people on FB who post shit like "1 like = 1 prayer." That means nothing and people's wishes for things to happen so they make money doesn't mean shit either.

Very interesting way to look at it!

Damn I was laughing so hard before I clicked on your post, thinking it was a joke. 
But you are 100% correct, please reach out and get help if you need it. Don't fix a temporary problem with a permanent solution! For what it's worth, anyone can PM me if you need to, I'll listen.
