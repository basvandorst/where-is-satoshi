@_date: 2016-08-03 05:58:38
We don't know anything yet. Let's wait.
BitGo is only saying they were not breached. It could still be their keys or API responsible for half of this mess (maybe more considering this was meant to be the one service they provide... fraud detection on multi-sig).
People are saying that their personally created BitGo accounts were sweeped too (where BFX has 1 key, BitGo 1 key, and the user 1 key). This means that BitGo is most probably at fault too.

Yay! Let's all play the blame the wallet game. If that fails, blame the user.
It's not my issue, and arguing about it won't change what happened to my friend.
Someone asked whether fees have anecdotally been responsible for people leaving BTC, and my response is a resounding yes.
@_date: 2016-08-13 10:50:18
Friend couldn't guess the correct fee, and used the built-in fee estimator. There were no confs for several blocks on that transaction, so he missed the sale.
He pledged that he wouldn't use Bitcoin again (as I assume this was not the first time this happened to him), until there was more certainty around being able to get transactions into blocks.
Up until then, he was willing to pay the premium of using Bitcoin (fees to exchange from $$$ and also the transaction fee to get into blocks) being higher than what he paid on average sized purchases with his debit card... so that certainly didn't help either.

I didn't look at the security FAQ again, after satisfying myself that they had taken adequate pre-cautions (after signing up).
All current users saw when they implemented bitgo recently, and what that integration entailed. Some one that cared should have pointed out that their docs were out of date, if it really mattered (it didn't).
Why are you focusing on this insignificant point, when the issue at hand is the mistaken belief that businesses like bitfinex "need" cold storage, even though they are not allowed to?
@_date: 2016-08-13 14:10:14
This is why I loathe discussing anything Bitcoin related, as of late. The original question was a yes or no, black and white question; that apportioned no blame, nor forced any "admissions".

Bull shit on all levels.
The funds are tracable... and pretty much every major incident, that gets reported in the media, identifies who is investigating. An investigative force that is afraid of retribution/retaliation is not worth being run.
Back to the funds... the funds are traceable to such a level that they can simply identify the watch addresses, and inform all major exchanges to tell them if they see downstream coins from those addresses, in which case these authorities then subpoena contact details from the exchange for the person trying to sell the coins.
Bitcoin fungibility has been dead for a long time.
@_date: 2016-04-06 00:55:36
Thanks for agreeing. That's what I said, minus multi-sig moving counterparty risk to arbitrator, which I don't really agree with.
If the arbitrator ends up acting dishonestly, the only thing that an arbitrator can lose is reputation. They have neither a product or money at stake, and the risk in using an arbitrator is in accepting that they might rule against you.
You can do multi-sig without an arbitrator, if you use a MAD (mutually assured destruction) strategy... but that has a different risk profile.

Lightning nodes need to hold Bitcoin equal to the amount they will be routing.
There is virtually no incentive as a Lightning Node to connect to less connected nodes, when you can encourage people to connect directly to you and just ride the network effect.
The LN is not yet fully designed (on paper) let a lone implemented, so we don't yet know how routing peer discovery will work. There are mentions of Onion routing, which would make it rather centralised... as Onion routing relies on authoritive servers to tell everyone which nodes can be routed through.
That's three points of centralisation off the top of my head.

@_date: 2016-04-06 02:46:55
If that's what you meant by "transfer large amounts of money" (i.e. lots of individual transactions that add up to a large amount of money), then I would tentatively agree with you.
Payment channels on paper are good for lots of one off transactions, but I'm not sure if that will work in practice... due to the way timeouts work and having not seen an implementation to mitigate dishonest use cases (i.e. buyer says they haven't yet received the good, or the seller saying they shipped the good but didn't).
When you are only routing payment, there is no consequence for failure... as the node has limited liability and the user will eventually get control of their money again. This paradigm changes though, when goods are involved.
I would need to think through it a bit more. If the good being sold is just access to something, then payment channel failure just means that the provider cuts off access to the good being sold.

These accounts were mostly traders. It's not feasible to have cold storage on a user basis, but still allow quick settlement. We both know that lobbying the CFTC would achieve nothing. The ruling explicitly prohibits comingled funds, and the ultimate solution of bitfinex not servicing america is not a solution... as you can say that any business failure could be avoided by the business never existing.
I never said bitfinex and bitgo are not responsible for the loss, but the CFTC meddled in their business model forcing this issue. 
I am pointing out that similar businesses that operate in america are precluded from running cold storage... which is something that all of the people like yourself ignore when repeating the mantra that "no cold storage = ameteur / unsafe". It ignores the complexities of the issue, and writes off multi-sig for no reason.

95% of miners, not nodes. If the mitigation is the requirement that all nodes upgrade, then you can't say that it is purely opt-in.
Network partitioning again comes into play during node syncing. The segwitness compatible nodes will not be able to sync from non-segwitness compatible nodes. The non-segwit nodes will not relay the block extension data, forcing segwit nodes to connect to each other. If adoption of segwit in nodes is too low, then there will be very few nodes actually able to verify the blockchain, except for miners.

Hard-forks don't cause partitioning, and I was not claiming that hard-forks are safer than soft-forks.
Also, it has to be exclusive. How else do the segwit nodes get the block extension data? Everything I have seen so far indicates that non-segwit nodes do not relay block extension data.

Torrent trackers or site operators (hard to tell which one you are referring to) are a different beast altogether, and there has been multiple references and even a light commitment to Onion routing in the LN project plans, more specifically in creating an implementation like Tor. Both trackers and site operators are examples of increased centralisation, so it's puzzling that you would propose emulating them in response to someone pointing out that Tor has centralisation.
An Onion network implementations like Tor are pretty much the opposite of decentralisation. They are focused on an entirely different problem, which is privacy.
@_date: 2016-04-05 22:18:39
That doesn't make sense to me. Unless the thing being purchased can also be partially delivered to match the rate at which the large payment gets broken down to... it would only enable the receiver to back-out at any point of time with no consequence and pocket the partially sent money.
I would have thought pure multi-sig solved counterparty risk on large transactions.

There is functionally little difference between segwit softfork and any other hardfork. One explicitly kicks you off the network while the other silently degrades you to less than SPV security. 
If anything, we would be in trouble if the majority of nodes were not segwit compatible, while miners were mining segwit. It could cause network partitioning and almost limitless griefing potential in broadcasting legitimate looking transactions that are actually double spends. 
If you have less than 50% of miners on segwit, then a malicious miner can mine an invalid segwit block that looks legit, but actually permamently forks all of the segwit miners off the blockchain.
I need to read more about the technicalities of segwit to talk more on it (with certainty), but I would not say that this softfork is 100% safer.

New nodes would struggle to come online, requiring users to find a peer, replace the hardcoded seed peers, and recompile Bitcoin.




Only the operators would know that


Yes (and there is an option to disable the use of those seeds)


Probably (Only the operators would know that)


Probably (Only the operators would know that)


No special handling of Tor (that I am aware of)


Probably not


Real IPs, obviously. I've never heard of anonymous IPs, unless you are referring to spoofed IPs or addresses behind Tor... which would obviously not allow new nodes to bootstrap from.


They are necessary for bootstrapping


No limit, but there is not much point having a heap of them as I believe they resolve sequentially

Tor is not a particularly good model for decentralisation. Tor relies on authoritative servers that decide which exit nodes are legit. Who would run the authoritative servers for LN? Would it be Blockstream? If it's Blockstream, why would we be centralising absolute power with them?

How is volatility a poor excuse though? The combination of volatility and sporadic (but increasingly common) long confirmation times make for a poor user experience.
What you are suggesting is a radical change in the way business is done. If you are only talking about one or two services, people may be able to live with what is essentially a bond, that ties up their money... but if we start talking about requiring a "bond" for every service you use, we start talking about a huge portion of each user's disposable money being tied up for non-productive reasons. It also becomes a massive problem to keep track of your money spread over lots of services.
Even worse than the massive waste of money and time, is that this fundamentally breaks the paradigm shift of Bitcoin... a trustless system. You need to start trusting your money to other parties. What happens when they go bust, etc.

And this is the crux of the supposition that the high mempool must be spam. Now be honest and use this same supposition for LN. If a few key nodes saturate their own channels, then LN will be slowed to a crawl too.
The `thousands of transactions that spend each other but can be undone by one double spend` would be trivial to confirm, but we never see analysis of here. There are always some bad actors that take a MB or two... but never enough to match a significant portion of the mempool. You also forget that miners are self-profit maximising by design. They are not forced to respect RBF or double spends. If there are more transaction fees processing the "spam", they can ignore the double spend.

Did you read the post? It's primarily because more and more transactions were taking longer than the guaranteed price window by Bitpay, and the high fees makes refunding too expensive (they cited seeing $20 fees), and also a bad user experience for people coming up just short of the steam price needing to send a few dollars with a large fee.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:14:06
From the article, when the price rapidly changes and it takes longer than the BitPay window of guaranteed value, the user either has to send more coin or gets some back in the form of refund. In both cases, the user eats a second fee, which has been up to $20 during Bitcoin surges.
Both make for a bad user experience, which ended up being something Valve wanted to avoid.

7, as I recall. Pretty much one for each continent. Either way, there is no point in continuing this discussion. You don't understand enough about LN to have an idea of what you don't know, and sadly it's the same for the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:34:33
Unless there is some major centralisation, then it will be likely that many channels will need to be opened and closed.
The other major aspect we don't see discussed, is that the channel opening and closing transactions are going to be way bigger than the current average transaction. The longer it's open and the more addresses involved in the final settlement, the worse it will be.
Hence why I said it's essentially still vapourware. It can't be counted to relieve short-term to medium-term pressure if it doesn't exist now, nor likely to see any kind of adoption in the medium term.
Also, your comparisons to the internet just outright fail. The internet works due to a handful of super routing nodes... that LN to this day claims it won't have. Decentralised onion routing is not a solved problem, and no solutions (let alone code) have yet to be proposed. You should go read some more about LN before deciding what is and isn't a major problem.
If you assume that the nodes are already setup and connected to each other, then there obviously won't be any issues... but that removes almost all of the complexity from the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:41
Actually, with blocks full now, the increase in transactions just from opening and closing channels would be double what we can handle now... assuming everyone adopts immediately. This is also ignoring the fact that nodes need to regularly settle accounts to unlock their coins.
Also, in terms of routing. As of right now... it's a mystical thing that hasn't been figured out. You have to do your own path finding to connect nodes together. There is probably discovery for nodes that are connected to ones that you are connected to, but I don't see how this is going to prevent everyone from connecting to the big nodes run by exchanges and the coinbases, etc.
We won't be able to say how it unfolds until we see it in action, but I don't see anyway of it working without the LN nodes run by the big bitcoin companies.
Also, the comparison of LN to the internet is a non-sequitur. You are comparing a mature technology to something that still essentially lives in the realm of vapourware. The recent demonstration did not show anything about route finding (for node setup), or how to find other nodes. Last I saw, they were going to require a centralised node list, or a boot-strapped node list... but I was giving it the benefit of the doubt by ignoring the issue of even getting onto the network.

Your post didn't add anything to the topic except attempt to de-rail it by using whataboutism to try and deflect to BCH.
How did what you say address the fact that there are only a handful of people with commit access to the Core repo?
How did what you say address the fact that having a few people act as the gate keepers to the Core reference client is certainly centralisation?
How did what you say address the fact that of those handful of people with commit access to the Core repo, a few are members of the same organisation? 
And to delve a bit deeper, said organisation is funded by venture capital, of which we are yet to see the pitch they gave to get said venture capital. The most we can surmise is that they pitched that said organisation would somehow be able to get a return out of their side-chains and/or layer2 solutions, somehow.

The policy is most likely the result of unpopular posts the mods are making, getting downvoted to oblivion. By hiding the votes and arbitrarily changing the vote sorting on a per thread basis, they believe they can "deter vote brigading".
Removing the name would invalidate the whole purpose of this counter-measure, as their comments would no longer be tied to their name, and hence their authority.
Perhaps it's just a coincidence that this was implemented after mods were again massively downvoted (I believe the threat to censor Bitstamp was the most recent massively downvoted post), but I certainly have a lot less faith in these mods after all of their previous decisions, and am not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

You still have to get your $50 to steam somehow, and if it's worth $46 by the time it gets there, they have to ask for another $4 to credit you the $50... or some how re-work the way their payment systems work (probably on BitPay's end as Valve was likely only dealing in USD), which would be a hell of a lot more effort than just dropping support for Bitcoin.

The problem is, you only get the scaling benefits of Lightning Network if people are using Bitcoin a lot. If everyone is only making one or two transactions a month, or even worse... transacting with lots of different people... the scaling benefits are hard to realise with LN.
The whitepaper itself said that blocksize increases would be required for it to work... so I don't see what gain we get from crippling adoption and volume in the short-term.
I don't see how or why the blocksize would ever be reduced, and likewise, increasing the blocksize past what the network can safely handle will just mean that miners will self-impose blocksize limits to prevent their blocks from being orphaned. A self-correcting problem really.
The next concern typically is about the "centralisation" effect of slightly larger blocks... however the fix is going to be LN that by design will require super nodes that are connected to all of the big players. There is nothing more privacy destroying than that.

Skimming through your wordy reply that attempts to justify why managing the resources and goals of a project is out of the scope of someone who's job is to manage said project; I see the following justifications (that are quite frankly awful):
* Making a legal contract without consultation of the project manager and/or inadequate planning of the time and resources required (from said project manager for the project)
* Submitting fraudulent bids to tender, knowing full well that the project would run over or would require more resources, or run at a loss
I stand by what I said before: "If your manager is telling you to work overtime, it means they have failed in their one job, and you have failed to adequately support your manager in doing their one job."
Small start-ups are a bit different though, as joining one comes with the expectation that you pitch in (whether via money or giving up paid time) to get the business started and self-sustaining. You did not indicate that you were talking about start-ups though, when you intimated that some of the many project managers out there are slave drivers.
My counter point was to clarify that the only project managers that are slave drivers, are the ones that are bad at their job.

@_date: 2015-12-01 23:16:10
To be honest, the more I think about it... the less scaling potential I see.
Each payment channel requires a minimum of two transactions to startup and close (one from the user, and one from either the user or LN node to close out), and holding coins in a channel means tieing up twice the amount of coins for the duration that the LN node buffers transactions (keeps them off the blockchain).
Settling more often means reducing the capital required to function, but also means reduced scaling.
Also, from my limited understanding, the average transaction size increases as the LN nodes handle more channels, which means there is less space of other LN nodes to fight for (you have the cost saving of reducing all of the payments within a channel down to just 1 closing out, but you still need a transaction per channel close-out or a big transaction to close-out lots of channels). Double the number of channels means half the number of LN nodes getting transactions onto the blockchain (keep in mind that for this to work properly, users are expected to join lots of channels).

Who is Luke-jr to make changes that affect users that install bitcoind with completely default options?
Especially after he attempted to get the changes into the upstream version but couldn't get them through. It reeks of sleaziness to then push them into the downstream Gentoo package that for all intents and purposes looks to be a simple simple port (even shares the same name as the upstream package) ... and then also have these questionable changes enabled by default.
If you are not affected, then good for you... but you asked why some (including myself) feel his actions are despicable, and I replied.

Although the majority of the economic users and nodes may be outside of China, the majority of the hash power is in-fact  in China.
Specifically taking action to increase the orphan rate would see the Western miners lose out, from my limited understanding. I recall seeing a big Chinese miner talk on the mailing list to Mike Hearn, saying how it would be funny to see the Westerner's have their share of orphaning, as China initially experienced.

We have to base this on reality. China has more hash power, so supposing you have more than them is not really relevant.
As a smaller miner on the faster but smaller part of the network, you would be able to grab transactions faster and have the rest of your small segment build on your blocks faster... but the fact still remains that the larger segment (China), has more chance of building off their fork that you do off yours. This works both ways too. When China finds a big block, it takes the westerners longer to receive it and start building off it. With their smaller portion of the network, they are on average going to be orphaned more than the larger portion.
Where the economic base is transacting from, isn't particularly relevant.

I could point the same back at you. I read your copy paste, so the least you could do is read my carefully selected parts from the wiki.
You just copy pasted a section, and even your copy paste says that their contribution of tantalum is usually small, with a credited body determining it was a bit less than 1% normally, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008, which could be for any number of factors. If they produced a whole heap at once, they could have dumped it cheap (causing their percentage to rise). If you are going to attribute those peaks to specific products, you should mention the other major release dates in their line, and how they did not cause a peak.
I also pointed out that the primary source and largest producer is Australia.

An address blacklist enabled by default ("Enhanced spam filter policy") for Gentoo users that use the bitcoind distribution, with a flag to opt-out... seems pretty bad to me.
The "spammers" hit by the policy include:
* BetCoin Dice
* Lucky Bit
* SatoshiBones
* SatoshiDICE
* Counterparty (old encoding)
* Mastercoin
Short of checking his implementation yourself, you can never be sure of what he plans to do with that power. The blacklist is not a default behaviour one would expect from a package named the same thing as upstream.
There was much public outrage, with Gentoo maintainers and users alike in saying that luke-jr should provide bitcoind as it is in the upstream, with changes either being opt-in or in a separate distribution. No matter how you cut it, his shenningans were an abuse of his position as bitcoind Gentoo package maintainer.
Luke-jr made a public apology for the stunt, and a few months later when he believes everyone has forgotten, pulls the same shit again.
I couldn't care less about his religious alignments, beliefs, and even who he is as a person... but what he does appears to directly harm the community and thus makes him despicable as a result of the actions he took.

Bitcoin can handle these problems, if you wish to involve 3rd parties (as your example dictates). The Bitcoin protocol is built around the principle of zero trust.
One of the most applicable applications to your problem, would be multi-signing (contracts). This is where two out of three (or more if you wish), have to sign to release the sent funds. The buyer, the seller, and the escrow service (could be a bank if you wished). 
The buyer gains nothing by not signing if the goods are delivered (and the 3rd party can intervene by signing with the seller to release the funds).
The seller can't get funds released if they do not deliver as promised, unless they can prove to the 3rd party that they delivered.
Contracts are very possible, and we will likely see more innovation in similar areas as it all becomes easier to use (people make clients that can handle more complex transactions).
For exchanges, it's possible to have read wallets, where the exchange can see that each user has funds, but is unable to actually move the coins. Just before any transaction, the user would be able to release the funds to the exchange by communicating the private key.
To say that Bitcoin has no protection mechanisms is simply wrong and miss-informed

One of my most recent transactions:
I wanted to send $400 USD to Kraken via commbank.
Quoted conversion rate of 1 AUD = 0.8336 USD means AUD 479.85.
Add an undisclosed conversion fee (they literally just whacked it on), on my statement, I spent $485 AUD and got $374 USD at Kraken (before their fee cut of $6).
There must have been a $26 transfer fee.
The bank also added spread to the currency exchange as another form of fee, which amounted to about $39 AUD. They lowered it from about 0.9 as I recall on the day to 0.8336.
If we convert all those fees to USD:
$26 + $5 + $35 = $66 which is 17.6%
The "shitty exchange rate" is part of the fee, and brushing it off isn't exactly making the comparison to the flat 10% GST a fair one.
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:21:06
$66 in fees which is 17.6% of the $374 USD I got at the other end.

Except they are not... most do not operate on the weekends. Add to that that everything goes through these major trade centres, it's not particularly decentralized either.
I stick to my belief that Forex is not a good comparison (especially when we get p2p exchanges soon™)
**From that link:**
The forex market can be split into three main regions: Australasia, Europe and North America. Within each of these main areas there are several major financial centers. For example, Europe is comprised of major centers like London, Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich. Banks, institutions and dealers all conduct forex trading for themselves and their clients in each of these markets. 
Each day of forex trading starts with the opening of the Australasia area, followed by Europe and then North America. As one region's markets close another opens, or has already opened, and continues to trade in the forex market. Often these markets will overlap for a couple hours providing some of the most active forex trading. So if a forex trader in Australia wakes up at 3am and decides to trade currency, they will be unable to do so through forex dealers located in Australasia but they can make as many trades as they want through European or North American dealers. With all of this action happening across borders with little attention to time and space, the sum is that there is no point during the **trading week** that a participant in the forex market can't potentially make a currency trade.

The act of profiting using regulated and legal exchanges is not and will not be illegal. You were basically implicating anyone that deals in multiple currencies, and criminalising day traders and financial institutions in the process.

It has been argued that in a truly free and unregulated market, insider trading helps speed up price discovery by incorporating both public and insider knowledge into the price.
To be honest, the movement of bitcoin is somewhat public anyway as any one can follow the flow of bitcoin... But not necessarily interpret it well enough to capitalise on.
There was an interesting paper on why insider trading should be legal, released recently. If i wasn't on mobile, i would go find it.
If you don't agree with this practice, you should take your coins elsewhere, and pray that the new exchange isn't doing worse things.

Core leadership is whole other can of worms, but pretty much what one would expect from a group of loosely associated developers with a diverse range of beliefs and goals... until a collective group of them got together and had a more prominent voice, and a more firm and shared direction as a result of their employment. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I would at least like to see two groups of similar size and experience to reduce the systematic risk.
I personally find it pretty hard to accept the forced fee-market (especially when if the devs intend to honour their roadmap, we would see the sudden pressure removed which would make their fee market collapse)... but I can hardly blame them when I look at it from their perspective and assume they are acting in the best interests of Bitcoin in the long term.
Even 's hardest positions to defend are actually rather logical if you throw away all of your preconceptions and listen and think hard about what he has shared. At risk of putting words in his mouth, from what I have seen, really believes that a significant portion of the current transactions are spam that can be priced out of the network with little detriment to the whole. Without seeing the calculations and logic that leads to this conclusion though, it's rather hard to agree with... but it is logical.
From that point of view, it's pretty understandable that block size related matters are not very interesting or urgent.

It is fraud in a regulated market, because the law says so... So I can't agree on that point, as bitcoin exchanges are unregulated and thus thhe laws of regulated exchanges don't apply.
He also has not made any claim, that I am aware of, that implies they are regulated or intend operate with a license. They also do not say that that they will not use your data in their privacy statement.
This is all assuming of course that insider trading is undesirable, which I am again not inclined to agree with.
I never once considered that the operator would not partake of insider trading, but I can see how people may be delluded into thinking an unregulated market would function the same as a regulated one.
Hopefully this serves as a wake up call for people that neglect to do their due-dilligence.

Also, you need to remember that fees measured in USD need to consider the Bitcoin price... and it's hardly fair to compare [$1000 coin fees]( with [$450 coin fees](
This is why pretty much every metric that talks about fees is measured in BTC fees per transaction. 
Regardless, the fact that the USD worth of fees on $450 coins is comparable and almost exceeding fees on $1000 coins, speaks about the huge increase in volume we have built up to.

The hashing power is controlled by the people running the pools. All said and done, less than 12 people control &gt;50% of the hashing power. This is fact, and has been said by people more reputable than myself, so don't take my word for it and go have a look at the situation for yourself. 
Positive decision making is about affecting change that addresses problems. Leaving the problem alone (allowing such large pools to have control, or a few people to dictate all change to the protocol) does not make it go away, and sets us up to fail in the future.
If there was an easy solution, then people far smarter than me would have stepped forward with it... but there is none. We sure as hell should not be wasting our time smearing each other and fighting. Likewise, saying that the risks of X are intolerable because it could cause centralisation... is incredibly dishonest. We are already centralised well past the dangerous point. We have a collaboration of pools SPV mining off each other's headers, for a combined &gt;50% hash power.
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:57:00


I don't think that's particularly true. I'm reluctant to go down this path ... but practically, the power Core Devs have is their ability to put out a recommended client. If the IPV6 committee had similar power, they would have put out a Bitcoin-IPV6 and we would have seen a larger IPV6 acceptance.
Did the entire community accept the RBF opt-in? I think we both know the answer to that one, as evidenced by the front page. That point is kind of irrelevant though, as is the concept of contentious issues.
IPV4 to IPV6 is not contentious and as a result has seen 10% deployment, so it's kind of irrelevant to qualify the statement with whether it is contentious or not.

The single largest cost in mining is getting the hardware, first and foremost. All of the cheap power in the world will not do squat without the hardware. 
Next up would be getting hardware at a price similar to what everyone else pays (including the chinese pools). This has not been happening, and it's pretty hard to be as competitive when your hardware costs 10times as much as other peoples.
Then, and only then, is power a major factor... let alone a deciding one.

I don't think it particularly matters what kind of a definition you want to apply to supermajority, when there are two sets of rules (one for the incumbent client, and one for everything else). A fork is a fork, and it's appalling that forks like SW are not an alt-coin but anything that touches blocksize is.

Sorry, but you fundamentally misunderstand how DDoS in general work, let alone how the current one has shaked out.
Yes, a dumb DDoS would spread their bandwidth over many targets, but any DDoS with a bit of planning put into it will saturate the link of one node at a time (or a few nodes, instead of many). The goal is not to keep them flooded for a period of time, it's to have a large enough burst that the ISP blackholes the node, or uses up all of their data allowance, or breaks their software/hardware stack.
This is exactly how the current DDoS operated, and it was rather successful. One of the numbers I saw thrown around was 10% of the entire set of nodes getting taken down within 3 or so hours.
I see you either didn't read or purposefully dodged the rest of what I wrote. I wasn't talking about miners at all. This entire thread is about nodes, which due to the number of miners out there right now, means that the thread is almost completely about normal users running nodes.
You have also completely gone off on a tangent here. There are no new miners (particularly in the big boys league) that I am aware of, let alone new miners that have started up just to mine classic.
Also your closing line completely ridiculous. You appear to be saying that if the rhetoric of the classic movement was better, there would be no political motivation for them to be attacked... Well if this was case, there would be no contention either and the entire community would be in consensus, and there would be far less nodes in AWS.
Your drivel is completely ignorant and I don't know why I am wasting the time reading and responding to it, when you clearly can't apply any critical reasoning to what I have written.

It's fundamentally the same difference between using and being, when the only people that can afford to transact are the rich people, banks, and other companies.
Are you saying you can or will be able to compete on a fee basis with those entities I mentioned?
It's likewise complete nonsense to say X or Y will solve the issue, when they are vaporware... and segwit essentially offers a once off 300 - 600KB blocksize increase. It does not solve this situation, and at the current rate of growth, doesn't really offer much more growing room either.
I will be impressed with LN when I can see it in action, but I'm worried we may not survive that long... due to the rather large gaps remaining in its design and implementation.

Actually... silently degrading the security of the network (i.e. allowing un-upgraded nodes to still think they are part of the network when they are no longer able to validate all transactions), is arguably less safe than a hardfork that simply removes old nodes from the network in a very obvious way.
Anyone saying "evil forks" (official terminology from Peter Todd and [Maaku7]( and various other core devs, not mine) are safer than hardforks, is rather misguided.

As much as I disagree with almost everything says, there is a technical grounding in a lot of it, with merit that must be considered.
My conscience would not permit me to say that has not done some amazing work in the Bitcoin space.
"luke-jr created the Eligius mining pool. He maintained BFGMiner -- a modular ASIC, FPGA, GPU and CPU miner written in C, cross platform for Linux, Mac, and Windows including support for OpenWrt-capable routers."
His best work was probably in figuring out how to soft-fork SegWit, and I'm sure that I am forgetting a whole heap of other things he did that were important.
I'm willing to donate 1BTC (in present USD value, to reduce my future liability and also because money is tight right now) to that cause, as the Lightning Network has potential to be the most important thing in Bitcoin right now... and bringing it into fruition from the state of vaporware it is in right now, is pretty damn important.

Limiting the mempool to such tiny amounts is worse in some ways. If something happens in the market that causes a one-off stampede of transactions, then your node will start dropping what could potentially be legitimate transactions.
That's not a very good user experience, and in cases where a backlog forms and can't clear... you will eventually reach that 50MB limit in just (what is now) regular market conditions.

Poorly worded on my part. You have the power to plan the solution, and make it. People that agree with it then simply have to download and push go.

The important part is that people can choose their level of risk aversion. If nodes and miners started doing something like accept double spends, the risk profile changes and the individual can make an informed decision.

Not really. They have more than 50% of the hashing power, so selfish mining due to the GFW actually is only a benefit to them. They will always win the race.

@_date: 2016-01-13 23:26:29
SW never aims to give a 75% increase in blocksize, and it does not fix the core issue of scaling, which according to the Core team before SW was announced was block propagation.
If anything, SW actually makes the blocks slightly bigger, thus harming propagation!
SW gives us about 0.25MB more transaction space, and 0.5MB if most of the transactions are SW compatible. The only way to even reach anything like 2MB with SW is if everyone makes transactions designed to attack the network, which renders it all moot as there would be no regular transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-30 11:44:38
Absolutely, but lets not pretend the road is full. Neither side (with the exception of one developer) claims 1MB to be the technical limit.
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:47:59
I'm not arguing that SegWit is potentially a better solution. People take issue with the wording people use around this issue. Especially when that wording says Core has compromised on blocksize, or that neither side has been willing to compromise. The quote, again:


One side started at 20MB, and has negotiated all the way down to 2MB. The other side started at 1MB, and has ended on 1MB. SegWit is not a blocksize increase... but it has properties that gives an effect similar to slightly raising it.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:55:14
What lesson? And how harsh was it?
@_date: 2016-01-24 07:10:17
Not begging for anything. As I predicted, we would either see a quick swing and adoption or more stalling to placate the miners. What would you call the Core roadmap, if anything but stalling? 
What is really sad, is that you either did not understand how XT was implemented, or were content to spread FUD. **It was not feasibly possible for XT to activate before January, and as a direct cause, not necessary for miners to show support for it by adding the required headers.**
The miners are the most risk averse in the system, as the mere perception that they moved wrong, harms them far more than those sitting aloft in their ivory towers... casting stones at others and censoring opinions they do not agree with. A price movement of a few dollars, actually greatly effects their bottom-line.
We are fast approaching the critical point where Core is forked out of the system completely, which is far more dangerous for us all, than the popular sentiment under XT, that believed Core could continue to live alongside XT. [Classic has more than 75% of the miners (let alone the more important economic actors) committed to upgrading, so sit tight and see what happens.](
Also, you are sadly mistaken if you believe any of the Core devs offered any block increase in good faith. The "offer" of 2-4-8 is disingenuous, as they did not intend to ever roll with that. This is well and truly proven by their actions thus far.
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:38:56
Especially when the vows I saw from their side was to spin up more nodes to mitigate the DDoS attacks, rather than return fire and DDoS core nodes.

Instead, we get core devs making snide asides.

I can speculate, but I do not speak on behalf of everyone or anyone... nor am I particularly tied to one side or another (Core or Classic).
[Aggregate graph](
Bitcoin Unlimited nodes aren't numerous enough to count for much... but I speculate that the majority of XT nodes switched to classic to show solidarity. I imagine that the pressure to increase the blocksize is a lot stronger if it comes from X% of nodes running a single implementation that increases it... than from X% + Y% + Z% running three different implementations that increase it.
I would also speculate that people switched from XT due to the poor communication from the devs that allowed too much of the community to slander it and their name, together with one of the devs throwing in the towel after finding gainful employment and getting fed up with the politics and smear attacks. I personally don't feel he was too far wrong to say Bitcoin is a "failed experiment". We have reached such a level of centralisation that there is just one development team, where a handful of developers represent all of the development collective... and they can sit down in a room with less than 12 miners and successfully move &gt;80% of the hash power. If we were to look at this scenario happening 3 years ago, I doubt Bitcoin would have seen any of the success we have seen up to now.
Gavin said his largest failure in XT was not effectively communicating that XT was a once-off hardfork to increase the maximum allowed protocol level blocksize, which easily allows for a soft cap on it that miners can then later raise in consensus as required... effectively a single hardfork permament fix for the foreseeable future. (i.e. if the max blocksize was 1GB, all of the miners could say only 2MB blocks are valid. Later on, they could softfork to 3MB with 90% consensus).
Either way, my opinion accounts for nothing... so go out and do your own research and read posts from lots of users across both sides of the divide.

How do you align this with Lightning Network, when you defacto won't have control of your coins without the permission / co-operation of the node you open your payment channel with?
When the Lightning Network ramps up such that people won't be able to afford setting up a channel more than twice a year, what is the game plan then? I see people saying that the end game is to use alt-coins / sharded networks to on-road into the Lightning Network... but by that stage we aren't getting any of the benefits of Bitcoin anymore (control, pseudonymity, economic freedom, decentralisation, etc.).

@_date: 2016-01-17 23:19:21
Not really a valid reason. If they aren't going to upgrade their node for weeks, then the choice is either: having their security silently downgraded (soft-fork), OR being removed from the network in an obvious way (hard-fork). I believe there are also built in alerts in the case of hard-fork, where the node will say no blocks have been found in the last hour.
There is no difference between a soft-fork like SW that removes node's ability to validate transactions, and a soft-fork that adds more coins that can't be seen by the old nodes (i.e. increasing the block rewards via soft-fork).

I am perfectly aware of the Bitcoin coin limit. You chose an arbitrary number, so I did too.


Companies accepting the coin, need to spend it... as the easiest example. Leaving you coins in the channel at the end of the transaction, ties up LN capacity until the hub flushes all of its transactions onto the blockchain... so by design, they actually don't want you to just leave your coins in there for very long periods of time... as it ties up their capital. It's meant to be a game of hot potato, until the person left holding the bag bites the bullet and flushes to the blockchain and eats the fee.


Also, you raise the fallacy of being able to leave when ever. If the fee to get into a block is higher than the amount being moved via LN, there is actually no protection. It also make economic sense for the hub to play foul, as they are likely to get away with it. If this happens on any kind of scale, then the whole system falls apart as everyone transacts on the blockchain.


You simply don't get billion user level scaling by putting out LN. You get limited scaling directly proportional to block size.

It's skirting the spirit of the problem though. If people expect developers to check for RBF flags, they could also be checking for low fee transactions  right now (which I am rather surprised they did not already do).
If anything, this just proves two things. 
1. That setting higher requirements of developers, for very little gain, is even less likely than maintaining the status quo... as they don't even meet the minimum requirements right now.
2. And that this perceived problem was in reality such a small threat to operations, that notable names aren't even taking the minimum precautions necessary to remove the incredibly obvious dishonest spends, right now.
@_date: 2016-01-06 02:32:53
You completely missed the point. Keeping received coins in a channel, ties up LN hub/node capacity. The coins need to exist in two places, in the place they start from (as according to the Blockchain), and on the receiving end of the channel but ready to be spent (not in the Blockchain yet).
By design, LN ties up coins until the transactions are committed to the blockchain. Thus incentivising channel-closing/blockchain-updates. The longer the node doesn't commit to the blockchain, the more capital they need. The more frequently they commit, the less scaling we get.
Reputation is asymmetric. It relies on some kind of trust system, and some kind of review system or word of mouth. The nodes/hubs are in the position to screw over as many people as they want, and when they stop getting traffic... can just setup again elsewhere. They have everything to gain, but nothing to lose. This is called a sybil attack, and the reason why nodes are not paid for their services to the Bitcoin system.

The two biggest are route discovery, route optimisation in terms of fees and hops... not to mention multi hop routing and negotiation. The last time I looked, lightning only could do simple transactions between two parties.
Unlike bitcoin, water infrastructure has to have a far greater capacity than current let alone peak demand. It also generally has a fixed fee (sometimes with tiering). If they get that wrong, then people can die and the rich and organisations absolutely do take more than their fair share in those conditions.
In short, nothing like a capacity constrained resource with a fee market. Feel free to try again.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:01:42
I don't think you have a solid grasp on how the LN works. You open a 1BTC channel with multisig, and the LN node needs to have 1BTC. It can't move your coins until you sign a transaction, **AND** the transaction is broadcast.
All of the routing it does is using its own coins, with the guarantee that they hold the unpublished transaction you signed, giving them your coins.

No, the winning strategy is generally communication. 
If your users want a flying pig, then you tell them exactly why a flying pig is impossible. You don't just wave your hands in the air and push out communications saying a design committee will decide how to do it in 6months. At the end of the long wait, you then can't say that there will be no flying pig, and still omit the reasoning behind that decision.

Undoubtedly. I'm not particularly aligned with either side, but it seems pretty logical to move your node to AWS if the rolling DDoS takes it and your entire connection down at your place of residence.
This OP was pretty pointless, as the Classic side outright said they would do this as the main reaction to sustained DDoS. I think it's laudable that they decided to fight censorship in this manner, rather than pool resources to retaliate with DDoS against Core nodes.
We would be in a right mess if both sides were nuking each other, but it would perhaps bring more attention to the matter.

This is akin to getting your credit card company to do a charge back though?
It proves nothing, as it's well known and the majority of services have figured out the level at which they need to care about the costs of fraud... or otherwise quickly find out when they get hit at a later date. Proving that the systematic weakness is still there helps no-one, and it certainly doesn't make the abuse of such any more legal to perform.
You can read up in this reddit post, where the Coinbase guy says they decided on a monetary level at which fraud detection kicks in. They are comfortable with the level they chose, to maximise the user experience and do not appreciate Peter Todd ripping them off or making a tool to make the process easier for people.
If market conditions changed, they would make the fraud detection threshold lower, or remove 0-conf... so again, all we are left with is Peter Todd bullying a company that was recently censored for stating they would test **REDACTED**, and furthering his crusade against 0-conf.
A real good use of time, from a core-dev, and a brilliant example for the community to lookup to.

Discarding the cost of bandwidth/data allowance, and the cost power is pretty dishonest. Running Bitcoin Core normally, will also have a detrimental effect on connection quality for other usages.

7,000,000,000 (your number, not mine. I'm sticking with it though as you choose it) people moving 0.5 of a Bitcoin at the same time and closing out their channel a day later means tieing up 3,500,000,000 Bitcoins.
7,000,000,000 people creating and closing a single channel a day requires the Blockchain to handle 14,000,000,000 transactions a day.
Lightning nodes must have BTC capital equal to the number of transactions they cache, so a node of any decent scale is going to need hundreds if not billions of dollars of capital outlay to cache any decent number of transactions (until we reach the logical limit of more than 50% of all BTC out there, being used to run Lightning nodes)... and the amount requires increases by the number of blocks they are caching for.
I simply don't see how people can think Lightning suddenly allows for such scaling.

I did no such thing. By only mentioning 4MB, you are deliberately misrepresenting exactly what it offers... which is a 1.6 to 2.2MB blocksize. It only extends past that when people are attacking the network.
Please be accurate, as the under-informed would look at your comment and assume that SegWit = 4MB blocksize.

Since quoting Satoshi appears to be all the rage these days.
**EDIT:** Here's another: [The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.
It's weird that the thread with a Satoshi response was nuked from the forums though.

It's good that you know, but a lot of people don't. They mistakenly believe it to be something like compression.

I don't see why they would want to kill their key though, to prevent a message telling everyone to upgrade... after the trigger conditions for hard-forking are met.
If core ever dropped to 25% or less of the market share, and are hard-forked off the blockchain... then the alert system is meaningless to them, and any action to kill it would be out of pure spite (forcing the forking client to replace the key anyway).

You may want to read a bit more about what SW is then, if you are arguing that propagation time (and costs associated with increasing the amount of data sent and received) has anything to do with either scaling options.
SW increases the amount of data sent. There is no free breakfast here. The accounting trick moves part of the block data into an extension block, freeing up more room for transactions... but this does not suddenly mean that the data moved out of the block just disappears. It has to be sent and evaluated too, unless you don't want your node actually validating the transactions.

No, there are several lessons here. Here are some quick ones I came up with:
1. Central planning is a must. In Bitcoin's case, we are gucci because development is centralised, and the devs have the power to make the whole system upgrade at once.
2. Upgrade paths are critical. Making a whole system upgrade simultaneously, but in a non-backwards compatible way and without a straight forward upgrade process, is a recipe for disaster and apathy.
3. When creating a standard, keep user needs in mind. They over-engineered IPV6, adding a whole heap of redundant features that are better handled lower or higher in the stack.
4. Keep it simple. They could have given IPV4 a significantly longer life by simply adding another set or two in-front of the old standard to make a IPV4.2... instead of making these monstrously long and hard to read/remember alphanumeric strings.
5. Plan ahead far enough, so there is adequate time to convince the eco-system to upgrade before the system reaches a critical state.

Correct, but a hard blocksize limit is vastly different to a soft blocksize limit. You can set a hard limit, and then have miners agree on a soft limit that is less than that.
[If you ask Gavin, that was actually the intent behind XT. Instead, we had a huge amount of FUD and censorship.](
Either way, the comparison is moot as 2MB is pretty well proven by jtoomim's tests to likely still be within tolerable limits of the network capacity (i.e. not cause the network to explode, and give us breathing room in cause of transaction spike)... and 2MB is far more reasonable as a short-term increase, than 1.25MB.
The only way to fix scaling, is to actually spend time fixing the issues that make it not scale efficiently (block propagation and processing speed)

There is far less difference between the kinds of forks than people are led to believe, and even SW has been acknowledbe considered to be of the evil kind (as it silently degrades the security of all non-upgraded nodes). I believe Peter Todd even mentioned this.

You can argue that SegWit (when considered as a soft-fork, meaning only miners are required to upgrade) is far more insidious and dangerous to network health, by relegating nodes that think they are working and contributing, into mere block relays that are unable to fully validate blocks... in comparison to just slowing the network down for peers connected to your under-specced node.
Also, reducing peers, but ensuring these limited peers get a decent connection (i.e. full speed), is far healthier and responsible than more peers at slower speeds. I'm not sure why you specifically pointed out reducing the number of peers being dangerous.

The phrase a couple of, meaning “a small number of; a few; several,” has been in standard use for centuries, especially with measurements of time and distance and in referring to amounts of money: They walked a couple of miles in silence. Repairs will probably cost a couple of hundred dollars. The phrase is used in all but the most formal speech and writing. The shortened phrase a couple, without of (The gas station is a couple miles from here), is an Americanism of recent development that occurs chiefly in informal speech or representations of speech, especially when followed by number terms (as a couple dozen eggs) or units of measurement (as a couple years ago; a couple gallons of gas). This use of couple (as an adjective or modifier) is still disliked by many. Without a following noun, a couple is even more informal: Jack shouldn't drive. It's clear he's had a couple.

A factual and informative post. I don't see why anyone would down vote this... not.


Nice, an adhomenim. If I recall, this counts as trolling right? We haven't even left the first page and we have found his first majorly down-voted post to be something he should be getting warned or banned for, if the moderation rules were applied equally and fairly. Let's assume no one reported it and the mods were blissfully aware of this (as he surely does not have a record of previous offenses for this kind of conduct), and move on.


Okay, we have more trolling here. He has side-tracked the discussion here (which is apparently trolling), concern trolling, and also just plain being disruptive while offering nothing positive to the discussion. Once again, I fail to see how those down-votes were not deserved.


Again, we have more positive contributions to the topic at hand. Likening people's concerns to "whining"... that's certainly going to win approval from your peers.

You can't be both technical and reasonable though, so I'm not sure why you would put both in the same thought.
The choice of couple struck me as very deliberate as it is used to represent up to 5 or so, and my clarification would hopefully save the next person looking at that chain some time.

It doesn't matter how well the wallets predict the fees. The more actual users of Bitcoin there are, the more people fighting for that space... which means the fee limit will reach the point at which it is no longer worth using.
Yes, it may only be $0.20 for now, but expect that rise as more people use Bitcoin. Have a think about at which price point Bitcoin is no longer useful to _*you*_. For me, it's probably somewhere near a dollar. When it reaches a dollar, pretty much every other existing payment method is cheaper and less hassle.
Sure, if you are moving $10k, then $5 is pretty reasonable... but most people are not using Bitcoin in that way right now or in the past.
The higher the fee, the more likely that Bitcoin becomes bankCoin and companyCoin... which seems to be the argument against raising the block limit... weird isn't it?

You were there when that question was raised, and you didn't answer the question then, so it would be appreciated if you answered it now. My understanding of the mechanism is pretty basic. I'm sure there are better ones out there, as I see core-devs mention the name "evil-fork" several times, as if it were an official term with a good working definition.
My very basic definition would be something like: Throwing transactions into an extension block that allows nodes to continue verifying parts of the block, but not the entire set of transactions. If a miner on the wrong end of the evil-fork tries to spend something touched in the extension side, they would be rejected by nodes running the evil-fork... and over time will end up not being able to verify any of the transactions.
From my understanding, SegWit (like a few other changes in the past), would fall into the evil-fork category... and due to the properties of an evil-fork, either have comparable safety or are worse than a plain hard-fork.

First of all, the logic that the more nodes there are, the more nodes would individually be secure from DDoS is so patently wrong, I struggle to find your post anything more than troll bait. Even worse, you say that having more nodes would make them secure, but you then lambast them for doing exactly that... because these new nodes are on AWS! But let's ignore that and continue with the rest of your post...
There is nothing shady happening here at all. [Classic node count was growing rather organically, until about 15 - 20% of all Classic nodes were taken out by DDoS.]( Refer to my previous post for proof of this, as well as several people pledging to move to AWS as a direct result of the DDoS. 
As more and more people were hit, we saw a very sudden surge in node count, that pretty much accounts for the current number of AWS nodes.
The only shady thing I see here, are people marginalising Classic even when presented overwhelming evidence of foul play by one side (DDoS). And then attempt to use the mitigation strategy Classic employed against foul-play as some kind of evidence of Classic committing foul-play themselves... when clearly the easiest and most effective retaliation from Classic would have been to organise an even larger DDoS on Core nodes.

And larger attackers would prefer your scenario too. There is a fundamental trade-off between network security and total value at risk. If we go back to CPU mining days witha billion dollar network, it becomes highly profitable to launch 51% attacks.

You are comparing a time of irrationality where speculators and people trying to quickly enter the system and capitalise on the collapse of the largest exchange (and hence willing to pay large fees to have priority) and the prices that were soaring, to a time many years later where there are no such factors at play.
This is exactly why fees are not measured in USD, but instead in pure BTC. It also boggles the mind that some one would think that as a currency or speculative platform gains maturity, acceptance, and subsequently stability... that the natural result would be for fees to rise.
The ball game changes though when people are competing for limited space. At the pace we are going, give it another few months and double the current fees will probably be the norm.

I don't think you understand the consequences here. When you remove all miners (good and bad), the network is open to attack regardless of our intentions.
Changing PoW is the same as allowing anyone with spare capital to 51% attack. They just won't be using existing ASICs or new ASICs immediately.
If you secure a billion dollar network with CPUs, they will buy 51% of the hashrate in CPUs. If you secure with toasters, they will buy toasters. And even worse, it won't just be 51% attacks for political reasons, there will now be financial incentive to do so.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:41:40
It's pretty harmful to remove something obviously used, and say there will be a replacement in the future.
I never saw core devs pushing it as a solution for fee incrementing. I only recall them only advocating the transaction combining. The thing not mentioned though, was how FULL RBF directly helps LN (combining transactions) and directly undermines existing solutions for fast but low value and risky transactions.
You need to do both now to keep the status quo (continue using 0-conf), or re-write and change you business model to work after X confs. Both are unwanted changes.

1% can't be profitable. When you fail, you lose the transaction fee... as well as the money you were trying to defraud them of!
If you send them $10 100 times, and defraud them once... you get $10 back and deposit $1000.
Since it's an exchange, I suppose you can withdraw and then purchase from them again... but you would be losing fees on each transaction which should make 1% unprofitable.

The point of sale is not the problem, it's the the currency that the money was created in.

Yes, which is why all incentives are geared towards the mid to long term future. We are all painfully aware of this. 
If there was indeed a way to make more money than they can reasonably hope to attain by continuing what they are doing... then they would rationally change their behaviour to take advantage of it.
Right now, there is no compelling evidence to take action (either side), and taking any action has the very distinct possibility of rocking the boat and causing prices to crash. Hence they will agree/support both sides, until something compels them to change.
Their interest though, should mostly align with expanding the network and maximising the value of the coins they earn.

* largest miners will just fill the blocks with spam (at a loss of income), which will raise the blocksize (just a little at a time) and push smaller pools/miners off the network

I hope you enjoy holding worthless coin then. Bitcoin retains value due to the security of miners. If we secure it with toasters, it becomes extremely lucrative to spend money 51%ing the network.
You can argue that other factors weigh more on the price, but the reality is that it's worthless if unsecured, or secured far below its value.

@_date: 2017-03-27 09:49:59
The design of the protocol manages this by itself. If there were suddenly no limits, miners need to balance the speed of getting the block out to as many miners as possible, against including as many fees as possible to get the highest return on their effort. If they push a 1GB block filled with useless transactions before the network can handle 1GB blocks, then they are needlessly reducing their profit by increasing their orphan rate. If they are pushing blocks that are too small, then they are missing out on fees that other miners will scoop up. These other miners will then be able to sustain lower fee rates and higher operating expenses, and eventually price out those uncompetitive miners. If you are supposing that &gt;50% of the miners can collaborate to send blocks of a minimum size above what the 49% can handle, then all bets are already off the table as that is an attack on the network.
People that say this introduces a way to DoS miners by putting mega blocks of junk transactions and tie them, are willfully ignoring that they can already do this by sending hundreds of crap 1MB blocks now. Up until fairly recently, some miners weren't even validating blocks, instead relying on others to do that!

If anything, this shows the resilience of the nodes in data centers versus nodes on home connections. As the ones on home connections get nuked off the network, the only ones left are the strong nodes that can just eat up the attacks.

I can think of three reasons straight away.
1. Full RBF allows people to consolidate their transactions if they are pending. When blocks are full, the Core devs have allowed users a way to reduce the strain on the network and allow a crippled Bitcoin to limp along.
2. Full RBF attacks 0-conf by making it easier for users with a RBF wallet, to double spend. Reducing the utility of 0-conf increases the utility of LN and other off the blockchain techniques.
3. In addition to allowing users to limp along on full blocks, Full RBF gives the potential to make LN more efficient for the nodes that interact with the blockchain (in my limited understanding of the LN node settlement).

There is no upgrade path or native compatibility between IPV4 and IPV6, which in my opinion is the single biggest failure in the IPV6 planning. The features removed in IPV6 were re-implemented externally, making the whole thing kind of pointless after ISPs invested in doing inter-carrier NATing.
Also, if your carrier is using IPV6... as the consumer you would be too. So I think the point stands that many people would need to use IPV6 for it to show any kind of success.

If that was the case, FSS RBF would have achieved the same goal without any of the downsides.
The only legitimate use case for full RBF I see, is when you make more than one transaction and want to combine both transactions into a single (albeit larger) one.
Seems like an awful lot to give up for a blocksize issue.
Also, in terms of big red flags... it doesn't make it easier for vendors to handle double spends. It introduces a new vector they must account for. They still have the old risk + a big new one, that make it more obvious.

@_date: 2016-06-23 12:04:19


All of this ignores reality though, in that all major pools spy on each other to get the quickest lead possible. They can't hide their blocks and mine at their normal rate.
Also, their own model shows that to break even with honest miners, you need at least 25% hashrate (with a 50% chance of winning block propagation races).
I was perfectly right and your source supports this, so thanks for the downvote.
I should also point out that in your original case of attacking via bigger blocks, their curve would shift down... meaning the already required minimum of 33% of total hashrate with 0% chance of winning block propagation, required hashrates approach 50% very quickly. If your blocks take longer than 10mins to propagate, then your earnings should be practically 0.
I also don't think their model is all encompassing of the possible scenarios, nor did I check their math. I will assume it is right though... for the sake of argument.

Nope, the security issue he thought he found was that a bad acting node could self-sign a cert, and then use it to masquerade as any other server (as he believed the certs were not pinned to servers, and acted as a global whitelist). He didn't understand how the caching worked though, and it was pointed out he was wrong.
The real issue he found was that when you connect to a server for the first time, you have to trust it to give you the correct cert. If someone MITM you, and gives a bad cert, then your communications are compromised with that server. This is the exact same with most websites (unless they have DNSSEC), and is a weakness of SSL in general.


When you originally said "...even less than have an interest in running an indexed server on top of that...", 
I took that to mean setting up an electrum server and getting it into the server list for public use. If you were referring to the requirement of a database, then you should have said that.


And it's perfectly fine to not set up your own server. Anyone can use electrum without a node, but if you value privacy and security... then you need to run a node. I've pointed out a few times that light wallets are more convenient to use that a full bitcoind instance. I even enumerated some of the major conveniences. I guess you must have some kind of reading comprehension issue, so refer to previous posts if you want them again.
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:35:26
If you are savvy enough to use Bitcoin, in this day and age I would dare say that many would have a VPS... most especially those security minded individuals.
Did you read the "security" concerns? None of them are applicable once you have connected to the server in question once. Self-signed certs for servers are downloaded and cached locally once and same for CA signed ones. Once cached, that cert is the only cert that can be used for that server (one of his concerns was plain wrong, and he sees why now).
TL;DR: Anyone can run an electrum node, connect to it once in a secure environment, and then receive all of the benefits of a light wallet with minimal security concerns.

@_date: 2017-01-26 02:32:49
Not strictly true. The whitepaper itself says the blocksize needs to increase severalfold to 50MB or 100MB or something, to service existing and short-term future demand.
Also consider than LN merely acts like a caching network. If everyone makes 5 transactions a week, the most that these transactions can reduce by is to 1 that gets committed before the channel expires (and running close to expiry runs the risk of losing coins).
Thus, even with LN the blocksize needs to massively increase to match usage.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:42:23

I'm not talking about transaction fees. The parent of the reply was saying that through-put would not scale, and the person I replied to said that was by design. This is not true. 
Bitcoin was designed and first released without such a cap, with the intention of scaling indefinitely. The network was unfortunately not ready for big blocks at that point, so a cap was introduced to prevent DoS attacks.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:46:38
Umm, segwit increases the bandwidth requirement by a bit more than double. There is practically no difference between a 2MB hardfork and segwit (assuming full adoption) in terms of bandwidth.
Before you tell me 16 &gt; 2, there have been many hardfork proposals, with the most popular (including Roger support) being a plain 2MB. Another being Adam's 1-2-4 (don't remember if it ended on 8).
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:45:27
I believe that such laws are broad enough to cover nodes too, but realistically speaking, the money can still be routed without most of the nodes, while the LN is entirely reliant on users transacting though specific LN nodes (i.e. you can't open a channel with the same coins to all LN nodes).
The bigger LN nodes will be tempting for Law Enforcement to target, due to centralisation pressures. It's also not going to be entirely friction-less to spin up LN nodes either. You need to have as many funds tied up in your LN node as you want to allow to pass through the node between each blockchain commit.

That is assuming that increasing throughput (volume) is a priority, which has obviously not been the case here. There is a hardcap on the number of transactions, we knew what the cap was, and we did not seriously start trying to increase that until just before the limit was hit. Now we've had a year or so (IIRC) of maximum transactions. The inner cynic in me points at this being deliberate, to increase the value of off-chain solutions, something that a particular influential and well-known organisation secured funding for.
Before anyone wastes time pointing it out, the average block size will never be the maximum for technical as well as economic reasons. There are plenty of write-ups in other comments on this if you care to learn. The harm caused to the system though by the turning away of users, can't be measured.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:03:27
Please take things in context, instead of constructing strawmen. 
I did not say orphaning was the equivalent of enforcing consensus rule changes.
I said that with 51% of the hashing power, you can enforce consensus rule changes, as by virtue of having the most hashing power, you can keep re-orging out non-compliant blocks.

While some of your argument is rational, the rest of it is not factual or rational.


Demonstrably false. You could have picked pretty much any argument here, but you chose the weakest and easiest one to disprove. Just look at Satoshi's posts around the time that the 1MB cap was introduced.


Correct, but certainly not the whole story. By design, the block reward subsidises transactions for many years, with this subsidy scaling in terms of value handled under the assumption of constant user and transaction growth. Capping the volume of transactions forces the fees the rise to maintain equilibrium, and certainly was not the intention from conception, as anyone with base intellectual honesty can attest to.
**There are technical reasons not to increase the blocksize**, but let's not lie and say that Bitcoin was never intended to scale paste 1MB blocks.

It's as if you are not reading anything I am writing.
If you care about security, you run your own node. The security as is in electrum, is acceptable and the "security issues" raised here are inherent to SSL itself, meaning they would affect all sites not using DNSSEC, which would include many banks.
Your electrum node does not need to be indexed, and I have already outlined exactly why one would run their own electrum node (security and with all the advantages of a light wallet).

There is no technicality about it. You said that all they can do is double spend with 51%. That's not true.

If that was the case, we would see hundreds of exchanges, and the transfer of FIAT to BTC would be frictionless.
Regulatory capture, however, makes this impossible. BitPay's business model is to do all the paperwork and comply with all regulations on behalf of companies... for a fee.

With AMC/KYC compliance, I sincerely doubt that the barrier to entry will be low.
Also, the most important part will be getting into the Lightning Network. Who ever you transact with onto the LN will be running a money transmitter, hence beholden to the law. An Amazon is only going to allow trusted nodes (i.e. the Coinbases) and perhaps their own... which would be a huge centralising force.
The only kinds of competition will be nodes run from countries with laxer laws, and even then, from the examples as recent as btc-e, those overseas nodes will run into trouble if they allow Americans to access illegal services or move dirty money.

Did you read my comment? I didn't accuse you of having an opinion. I accused you of lieing when you were saying that having a capped block size was intentional (i.e. it would not scale in terms of transaction through-put by default). Bitcoin was designed and first released without such a cap, with the intention of scaling indefinitely. The network was unfortunately not ready for big blocks at that point, so a cap was introduced to prevent DoS attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:12:26
That's certainly not true. They can orphan blocks that they don't agree with (i.e. enforcing a protocol level change).
@_date: 2016-12-09 01:23:08
We aren't scaling or growing though, which is the problem. We have hit the maximum volume and remained at that limit for a year now. We have put shackles on Bitcoin while it is still an infant, while we wait for the perfect solution that may yet be years off of fruition. No compromise is acceptable, and everyone that thinks otherwise is an ignorant big-blocker.
When miners indicated that they would hardfork to 2MB, we sent core-devs over there to pacify them... twice. These core devs allegedly spoke on behalf of all core-devs and signed contracts... but when they were called out on it, insisted they only represented themselves and not the entirety of the developer base (to the irritation of those chinese miners). We still don't know exactly what was signed (unless I missed that contract getting leaked).
I won't even go into how worrying it was to see so many important developers attached to a single organisation that accepts investment that seeks to profit off side-chains. While I desperately want to assume they would only work to improve Bitcoin, I do not see how those investors would get a good return on their money if there was not deliberate incentive to move people onto side-chains. It would be foolish not to be cautious of things that have the potential to cause harm... but apparently it's acting in bad faith and deliberately undermining Bitcoin to share concerns on things like this.
I remain optimistic on the future of Bitcoin, but it's a bit sad to see that we have wasted a year's worth of volume growth and potentially deliberately crippled Bitcoin for an organisation's profit, for what seems to be little rational reason.

I didn't make the post to express a view on the matter of **REDACTED** vs. Core, but if you are going to bring it up...
Wouldn't having multiple implementations that are expected to work together as perfect replacements (protocol wise, not feature wise) be even better than what we have now? Assuming they are talking the same protocol, wouldn't we be able to see very quickly when edge cases are handled differently? 
It would also make contentious protocol changes potentially easier, if you have dozens of clients whose developers could come to individual agreement amongst themselves to support different protocol changes. The users could potentially be better represented too, by voting with their wallet (moving to the client they best identify with). Hard forks would always be messy, but this way sounds less messy.
From what I have read, this issue was only found because sipa was trying to make sure libsecp256k1 was compatible with OpenSSL.
On a different note, were you in the know for what the fall back plan was? How would the damage caused by a 10% miner that was spitting out v2 blocks on purpose, be dealt with assuming this issue cropped up in the months before BIP66 was written and tested? I assume there would need to be constant block re-orgs. How would these issues even be spotted? I assume some nodes would be spitting errors, but many would not be... and when the issue was compounded by SPV mining... it seems messy.
The issue no longer appears relevant, but I find the history fascinating... and I would certainly love to understand how a major protocol issue would be fixed immediately in a scenario of catastrophe.

No. What they lend is denominated as an IOU (aka. fractional banking). A fraction of what they have lent is backed up by the valuation of assets and actual money.
The money earnt from these loans is then plunged into speculative activities (investments) or used to multiply the amount they can lend.
A large part of the regulations that came as a result of the GFC, was to force banks to keep a higher percentage of their worth in liquid reserve (i.e. real money or liquid assets).

Some of the technical experts out right support the censorship here, and the remaining core developers support it by not speaking out against it.
The censorship is malicious. No amount of good done in the past will change the fact that what they are enabling right now is malicious to the community.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:07:17
The nuances being:
* There are a few other subs that have more than a dozen subscribers, but are not directly mentioned any where official or prominent on this sub
* Because theymos promises to only censor for a limited amount of time (no specific timeframe given though)
* Blocksize debate is repetitive and uninteresting, even though the debate is allowed... we just can't mention one of the solutions... not to mention how this issue prevents topics like *"Stephen Pair: BitPay supports the adoption of BIP 101 for increasing the blocksize limit"* AND *"The Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source"* AND *"World's Top-Rated Charity, DirectRelief, now Accepting Bitcoin"* AND *"[bitcoin-dev] bitcoin-dev list etiquette"* from appearing on the front page.
You are right though, it is very much more nuanced and I can't help but project my personal bias on its interpretation.

I have a 42/1.5 which is the best service available to my service. I pay about $120/month and get a data cap of 500GB/month (The ISP only decided to throw us a bone recently in upgrading us all from 200GB to 500GB).
Data cap wise, if I don't propagate any of the blocks I receive, I am fine... how ever being a selfish node is of no use to the network.
I only have to be propagating each block to 13 other people to pretty much use all of my data allowance for the month on being a node. I suspect that this won't really cause much fuss in the community though, until American ISPs can force their customers into these data caps too.
So I strongly disagree with your conclusion that full nodes can be run every where in the world. I am in favour of big blocks, but everyone should acknowledge that there will likely be less nodes as a result.

The only numbers I have seen to quantify this issue were released by Mike, which projected actual usage to outstrip (i.e. create a never ending backlog) the blocksize by next year or early 2017 at the latest. I have this blog entry in my history, so it was probably [this one](
Anyone that insists this issue is not urgent (whether it be user or developer), is going to need to share some numbers and their analysis to back up this assertion.
The problem with the nuclear option, is that you need weeks to ensure you get that consensus and that everyone moves together... leaving it to the final minutes is far more irresponsible in my opinion.

You must not hold a very high opinion of BTC then if you think a single country or person is capable of pumping a crypto to a level almost equal (and sometimes greater) than the BTC itself.
Just take a second to ponder exactly how you think it's possible to pump from nothing to 5billion dollars worth.
If we were talking about just a fraction of the BTC volume, then I could agree it's more likely to be a pump, but we are literally talking about a crypto that is almost equal in value (and sometimes higher) than BTC itself. If you can't see that as a literal sign of lost market share due to in-fighting, then I'm not sure what else could convince you that BTC is strangling its medium to long term future here.

Pray tell, how will users know that **REDACTED** exists, let alone where discussion of it is allowed? There is certainly no direct mention of those subs in the side bar, let alone in either of the sticky's main body of text. One would have to guess or ask other people.
**REDACTED** is very much on-topic for Bitcoin as a whole right now, and I fail to see how this political maneuver to silence one side of the debate does the community any favours. This blocksize discussion may be repetitive, but the censorship only applies to one of the proposed solutions (i.e. **REDACTED**)... not the discussion itself. **REDACTED** certainly was not being spammed, and the fact that it keeps cropping up is largely because the original topics posted were removed.
It is especially ironic that you support this censorship in the sub, but speak out about it in the codebase (which I do not support, but can easily see why it was done... and it does not appear to be exceptionally malicious).
I also notice that you did not address the major point of contention on the criteria laid out for censoring **REDACTED**, that being that **REDACTED** is an alt-coin.

Signing with proof of ownership of coins would be a novel way for the community to express what they desire. To reduce manipulation, it could be facilitated by making a transaction with specific mining fee for each option that can be voted for.
People willing to make that sub $0.01 (or higher if the fear of manipulation is too great) outlay to vote should be heard, and anyone willing to throw money away in an attempt to manipulate the votes probably has a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed (which is good).
You could also do a vote per 0.5 BTC signed for. Moving the signed coins either updates their vote weight or cancels it if the remaining denominator is less than 0.5BTC. This favours the whales, but if anything... they would care the most about the future of Bitcoin.
The user voting could be used as an additional metric, along side mining pool votes and node counts (with node counts having the least weight due to how easily they are spoofed). No single metric is infallible or should be allowed to stand by itself. This whole user voting concept kind of goes against the principles of Bitcoin, and thus there is no good way of proving 1 vote = 1 user.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:33:42
It's disingenuous and intellectually dishonest to imply **REDACTED** is rushed through or refused discussion on. This issue has been contentious for years, and the small block party refused to comprimise on any part of it (it was the big block proposal that offered many comprimises).
It's also disingenious to imply that the **REDACTED** state of the sub was not caused by multiple highly upvoted and commented threads dissappearing and many users getting their comments scrubbed or banned from the sub.
The great thing about bitcoin though, is that it can and will handle this. The miners and market can be presented with multiple options and choose what they feel is best.

The largest impact Bitcoin has is on online things, not so much for physical locations. Try capitalising on how much better you can handle international sales.

It's been discussed for like 2years now. To say it was rushed through is just intellectually dishonest. Multiple proposals have been made and all are contentious (more than 1 dev disagrees).


You are for decentralisation, but approve of having a handful of developers completely control Bitcoin. This doesn't make sense. Users will act in their best interests and adopt the client that makes the most sense for their purposes... which is how consensus works now and always. This issue will be settled one way or another, and a hard fork is inevitable.
You or a handful of developers should not have the power to decide what Bitcoin is no longer (i.e. Fast and/or cheap transactions).


Do you deny that there were two extremely popular threads with hundreds of comments and upvotes on the front page? Do you deny that those two threads were removed? Those two threads were among the first and only threads dealing with **REDACTED**, and low and behold... when they were removed, we had a Babara Streisand effect and everyone started posting and commenting about it.

Every time an operator starts from scratch, they start with no feedback again, and should not be trusted as much as an established operator.
Also, something that is black market can't be held to the same responsibilities as something legal. If the authorities want to clean the game up, they would need to legalise and then regulate it.

I just noticed that [Gavin mentioned a REAL reason for rolling out BIP66]( and after going back and reading what BIP66 was meant to fix... I realised how serious that bug could have been, as it was literally a ticking time bomb. From what I understand, Bitcoin relied on OpenSSL, and it was discovered that various versions of OpenSSL would accept different signature deviations of the DER standard... which means a signature for some users would be valid and simultaneously not valid for many others. That sounds pretty bad, but Gavin has now alluded to this bug affecting 32 and 64bit installations of the same version!

You missed out on the fact that the Bitcoin process flow was retarded in their layout. It was not a distinct option on the option page, but rather an option after you had picked an option.
I recall the success being measured in terms of conversion. Something that would undoubtedly be interrupted if you suddenly offer a new option after the user has made a choice.
I also recall the A/B split being very one sided (something like 80% to A and 20% to B)... of which the highly discrete data of conversion and total donation amount was directly compared between the datasets.

That's blatantly false. SPV nodes are still insecure if they are not fully validating. Core devs have been saying that, and even their Benefits posts says this.
You either download it all (whether it be the entire history or the complete block), or you download a portion and accept the security trade off (i.e. trust everyone else to be honest). 
Checkpoints have been a thing for ages, and are not unique to SegWit. If it is the same functionality as right now, it can't be an improvement... by definition.
Great, you said the same thing as I did... except for the very end. You believe that there is no security trade-off by not being able to see SW transactions or continue to validate new transactions. The spent input after a SW transaction will appear unspent for a non-SW node. There is plenty of opportunity for fraud here, as the non-SW node sees one thing and everyone else sees another. 
The fraudster can't create or steal coins, but there are plenty of other malicious things they can do. The non-SW node is also not contributing much to the network either... as they will be ignoring transactions.
There is not much to guess about 1.7. Normal transactions will be 75% cheaper (they are 25% of the normal size in the actual block), and multi-sig transactions will be even cheaper, as determined by signature size. You should go with the numbers communicated to us, and offer a range of savings, assuming 100% adoption. There is no need to dumb it down to something misleading like 2x to 4x. You can look at any blocks mined recently, and see that multi-sig transactions are far less common than normal transactions.

Nope, check their terms of service again. They have to comply to all the relevant laws... which they have interpreted to mean going to reasonable lengths to prevent users from using their coins for illegal activities.
I have seen enough posts over the last few months that support the suspicion that coinbase tracks coins for at least four hops.

That would be true for P2P networks in general... but the Bitcoin ecosystem requires blocks to be validated and sent fast (within 20seconds, was the number I recall core devs throwing around). 
This is so important in fact, that a relay network was setup to get the miners talking to each other faster. Without that relay, we would be seeing pretty insane levels of orphaning, as a direct consequence of shitty nodes making the network slower.
If you are pulling down a block, and you can't propagate it faster than 20seconds, then you are in fact harming the system to the very real detriment of everyone else.
Most nodes have a rather small number of max peers (or too many max peers for the connection speed they are on), which is what aggravates this situation.

Except nodes play a far smaller role than miners in this debate. Anyone can run a node (or even thousands of them for a week or so before switching them off) if they want to.
Miners actually bring utility to the blockchain, more so than nodes. There is a reason why miners are rewarded for their effort and nodes are not.
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:42:28
Actually, every node that performs slower than average is bringing down the performance of the network.
And every new node added, means one more node that requires propagation.
Taking this to the logical extreme, the network all but breaks down when when X% of the network is running on dial-up.
Also, the biggest consideration that is usually overlooked... is that a healthy Bitcoin node is expected to receive and validate a block within 20seconds. This needs to occur on both ends, so you would also need to be able to send a block well within 20seconds, to be contributing to a healthy network.
@_date: 2016-02-05 05:37:12
The whole next generation of SPV wallets are theoretical at this point. SW should allow for all kinds of future features (the most of which I am looking forward to are proper fraud proofs that will allow SPV nodes to operate in a more secure fashion). Do a search for SPV in the benefits write-up. 
It was also a throw away comment in the sense that we can't really expect that much focus to be on SPV wallet privacy enhancements, while the whole ecosystem needs to pivot on upgrading to support SW or otherwise advocate for its adoption.

Even if external miners represent a small percent. For those two pools to maintain their hash rate share in proportion to the rest of the pools, requires coordinated operation.
If one pool added hashrate a day or week before the other... their shares would diverge greater than 2%.
Of course, this would not apply if both of their hash rate shares were decreasing over time (which has not been the case).
It would be great if we could understand how much of their hash rate is private! I have a feeling it is the majority in most of those Chinese pools.

Sorry, but you massively misinterpreted what I said, and you are plain wrong about SPV nodes retaining security.
It is a fact that the old nodes will not be able to see SW transactions. Thus, they will allow to propogate and/or create invalid transactions that attempt to spend balances that are already sent.

It's not that good of a news piece though. The people actually in a position to implement it, are the minority that currently control such a large portion of the hash rate. This will further push the solo and small operation miners out of the game.

Yea, the downloading section is plain wrong... as you can't be secure without the signatures.
The softfork part is wrong, as old nodes won't be able to validate or see signatures... meaning they are less secure. They also attempt to break consensus by allowing invalid transactions (as they don't know better), however... SegWit nodes and miners will drop those invalid transactions.
The bigger blocks section is wrong, because the blocksize technically increases (one part remains at 1MB, but the signatures part gets tacked on to allow up to 4MB worth of transactions in attack scenarios, or around 1.7MB realistically).

There is almost no drawback to using them (just Heat and that other one require some thought in terms of placement), and there is no real counter to people firing gold at you (it's inarguably a substitute for skill at worst, or plain over-powered in the hands of people better than average).

On the flip side, the current price would be close to the ceiling value, if we assume there is not much room left for bitcoin to grow.

From what I have heard from core devs, healthy nodes should be aiming to propagate blocks within 20seconds.
A slow node is actually reducing the performance of the network, not increasing it. So Core's policies actually make a lot of sense, as they feel it is better to run at full speed for X blocks and then turn off, than to run at a reduced speed all of the time.

Are you just concern trolling or what? Mum and pop stores don't handle transactions directly in fiat, because they have no need to. It's inane to suggest that not doing everything yourself somehow makes you a failure. At what point does it end? Should businesses be producing their products by hand, without the benefit of foreign manufacturing deals, or imported materials?
The same logic applies all the way up the chain to large department stores and mega-corporations. I can point out many companies that rely on the service of payment providers. In reverse, there are very very few companies that handle all of their fiat transactions internally, especially when selling online. These payment providers serve the same purpose as they do in Bitcoin land... as not many business models involve the company sending money to the clients.
Seeing that part of your logic squarely trumped, you now want to focus on sales not being denoted in Bitcoin. I guess you've never heard of foreign currencies then.

And what do you think would have happened if the "users" forked themselves off the chain, leaving &gt;80% of the miners behind? The obvious answer, to me at least, would be users caving on their principles and going back to the miner chain, essentially killing SegWit in the short-term.

Validating is not the same as send and receive. 0.15 did not allow for native use of segwit. Transactions had to be made raw, which is obviously not desirable, and I don't think you could even do it via RPC. It had to all be done via CLI.
Are you trying to tell me that even though normal usage of segwit via RPC was not possible in 0.15, it was somehow possible in 0.13?
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:53:41
UASF chain would be finding a block once a day or less. It wouldn't be useable. The miner's chain would be a bit slower, like 15-20min blocks.
If only 20% (and as I recall it was less than 5% that were signalling support at the time) came to the SegWit chain, it would never get re-organised back into the miner's chain. If it didn't manage to meet the threshold in time, it would permanently fork off or would discard all of its blocks and re-join.
I don't see how anyone can honestly say that UASF had the odds behind it. It didn't manage to get any kind of significant "community" support, significant node support, or even majority core developer support... but we are somehow meant to believe it was the crucial factor in getting SegWit activated?

Maybe, but we certainly won't know, without seeing their financials.
I return the original question to you. We don't see massive drops in hash rate when the value of Bitcoin massively drops. We certainly see a slight decline in hashing rate, but not nearly as much as would be expected... e.g. during a 40% drop in price. Why would that be?
There is certainly a minimum price where mining wouldn't be profitable for anyone, but I suspect that pace of price growth generally vastly outpaces their costs. At the current level of hashing, it's far too expensive to start mining at any scale (capital intensive as well as all of the R&amp;D costs involved in making your own ASICs).
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:28:05

You are close. If you limit the growth, and restrict the number of transactions that can be done, then the blockchain won't increase in size as fast. If you limit it enough, you drive away some of those future transactions, as Bitcoin becomes less useful as a payment system.
You are correct in that two 1MB blocks of data will take up the same space as one 2MB block... but you essentially aren't considering what happens if some of those transactions in the second 1MB block don't happen, as a result of seeing the first block full (you need to look long-term, as this example doesn't make as much sense on such a short time-scale).
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:29:40
It's not so useful to be passing money backwards and forwards between two people, so I don't see why people always try to conflate that with actual usage. If you have 100,000 people opening and settling a single channel every week, then that's immediately a minimum of 200,000 transactions a week, and by design you don't get to keep channels open indefinitely. All dispute resolution is also handle in the blockchain (meaning that if you are running close to the limit, you run the risk of people getting screwed over by timeouts). The above scenario is also assuming massive centralisation (the thing that we all hate). 
Seriously, go read the whitepaper. No where in it does it propose that *normal usage* would mean millions of transactions occurring without hitting the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:20:52

It would certainly dip, but I doubt how much impact the &lt;5% of the community that was signaling and committing to go all-in with the SegWit would have actually had. By all metrics available at the time, they were the very vocal minority. Any damage to the price probably would have come from clickbait headlines, rather than anything related to usage.
These miners remain profitable with 50% and greater dips, and you want me to somehow believe that a dip on a similar scale, due to UASF, would break them this time?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:27:50
8 hours from the release of the 0.16 release candidate, obviously. There's been another release candidate since then, so it was obviously a good idea to hold BitPay accountable for not implementing it straight away, to upgrade to SegWit.

For most people, the 8% fee for a few one-off purchases of coin is far less than the hassle of getting set-up with an exchange.
In Australia at least, there are a lot of hurdles that you need to jump through, as well as there typically being long delays in processing your application.

That article is just a bunch of hopeful speculation, backed up with very little actual data.


Alright, opening argument is a strawman backed up with a metaphor. Nobody is saying that everyone is dumping Bitcoin in favour of alt coins. The recurring warning has been that people are using other alt coins to make up for the lack of capacity in Bitcoin.


I see... because the value of Bitcoin is still rising, it must be impossible for it to be losing market share to alts that have the capacity to soak up Bitcoin's overflow. Makes sense.


There were several such articles that spent the effort showing the correlation between Bitcoin transaction volume surges and the corresponding surges in other altcoins that people used to move their funds between exchanges during these peak demands.
But because the article goes to no effort in researching this them self, they instead simply state that there is no evidence.
Colour me convinced now. Market share is obviously not a good indicator of the usage of Bitcoin versus the other alts.

Things involving trust require reputation. Legacy systems are built around KYC, hence a reasonable assumption would be that even if this is implemented in Bitcoin, Tesla would record the details of the renter before allowing them to drive the car. If it goes missing, they were the last ones responsible for it, and they would have sufficient ID to track them down (if they adhere to KYC properly).
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:42:53
No Bitcoin ATM I have seen, has a lax KYC. A scan of your drivers license or passport, which can then be matched specifically against your coins. It would likely be easier for law enforcement to get that data than from the exchange. The convenience factor is that by its very nature of being an ATM, regardless of the KYC, it has to serve you your coins within a few minutes, in comparison to the days or weeks it takes to get setup at an exchange... otherwise it fails at its one function.

Not really. Adoption, if anything, is exceeding what all of the reasonable people were predicting back during the 1MB vs 2MB or 4MB saga (BitcoinXT / Bitcoin Classic era).
The original proposal between miners and devs was SegWit now with a 2MB hardfork in the meantime, as it will take 1-2 years before we see any significant capacity increases from SegWit alone.
We were at almost maximum capacity back then, and have been pretty much all of the time since then. All of that potential growth was forgone... much to my disappointment and anyone that seriously cares about Bitcoin.
... but at least we prevented a hard fork! :)

I don't see what problem it solves. From what I understand, you are forcing everyone to pre-pay and lock away their funds for X amount of time for everything.
It also appears to rely specifically on being able to broadcast things on the blockchain, which applies the exact same pressure on the network as just transacting normally.
On a more fundamental level, using the lightning network would result in a completely different user experience than operating as we do now.

Appendix A was referenced in section 3, and described as the way this would be implemented, unless I am misunderstanding it.
[&gt; There has been prior work on Hub-and-Spoke Micropayment Channels[5][6][7][8]. Implementing our hub-and-spoke network requires the malleability soft-fork described in Appendix B. This would enable near-infinite scalability while mitigating risks of intermediate node default. The implementation in Appendix A describes a method without requiring a soft-fork and may be used on the Bitcoin blockchain today with some minimal risk. By chaining together multiple micropayment channels, it is possible to create a network of transaction paths. Paths can be routed using a BGP-like system, or the sender may designate a particular path to the recipient. The output scripts are encumbered by a hash, which is generated by the recipient. By disclosing the preimage of that hash, the recipient’s counterparty will be able to pull funds along the route.](

Not particularly true at all. Miners/pools have been far more altruistic than they have been selfish.
There have been innumerable ways miners could have subverted the system in the past. Consequently one of the now fundamental assumptions is that miners/pools won't harm Bitcoin long term in the interest of short term profit... where in any other market that assumption would be flipped.
Another example is the node network. Running a node is almost exclusively altruistic. You get very little tangible benefit in running a node... especially in comparison to how critical these nodes are to the health of the network.

I just had a look at the whitepaper, and it really does not appear to solve much at all.
One of the largest sections looks at how it all falls apart if blocks are full for any significant amount of time (i.e. a day or week). An attack like we are in right now, would literally kill LN... and that's before you even look at any of the LN specific attacks you could do.
It's novel to solve microtransactions, and a more structured approach to payment channels is nice... but it doesn't appear to solve the issue of normal payments, unless you want to start breaking all of your purchases into lots of small payments which seems to break the whole concept (you need to trust that all of those contracts can be resolved together).

I haven't heard anything about time-stop, so I will have to some additional reading.
As to the breaking down of payments into smaller amounts, from what I understand, for these transactions to work in real-time as advertised, you need to rely on a trusted clearing house. 
As to the locking away of funds, that is exactly what I am talking about. Every payment will involve locking away the funds, unless you can trust every person in payment route to act quickly (which means they need to be active at the time the money hits them). Disputes seem like they would take a while to resolve.

It literally relies on using the blockchain to get in and out... and for dispute resolution.

There is also the fact that the single package maintainer can (and has) simply over ruled changes for little to no reason.

International transfers are slow, and have been costly in my personal experience from Aus, and they primarily relied on bpay (an australian form of settlement) to allow users to fund their coinjar account (they did allow normal transfers too, but i believe there was a larger delay in funding).
I haven't used them in a few months, but being international transfer only would have a large impact on the convience of their service and make time sensitive payments harder to perform.
This is also without mentioning the handy debit card which I assume requires coinjar to have an aus account.

I don't think it's in their best interests to talk about it at all. 
The best situation for them would be to just to continue pointing at it and say how it solves all of our issues and that the whitepaper is not reflective of how it will be implemented (because no code exists for it yet).
I would certainly love to hear how it fixes these issues, and the most fundamental issue that needs to be addressed of how they plan to get the number of transactions per person down ( I don't believe it would be possible to lower it to 3 transactions a year per user, like was mentioned in there ).

Running out of space is definitely a problem. When the major selling points of using Bitcoin ([as it has been touted]( were:
* Fast and predictable settlement
* Low fees relative to other established networks of transaction
... it is absolutely a problem if we have no space and higher fees. Adoption would slow, and its usefulness would diminish. 
**Yes or no, would adoption and usefulness of Bitcoin forseeably decrease if transaction confirmation times were unpredictable and fees were significantly larger?**
Qualifier: If no, would adoption and usefulness forseeably increase or remain steady if transaction confirmation times were unpredictable and fees were significantly larger?
**Do you dispute the growth in block size? That is a binary yes or no.** My calculations have us hitting 1MB in 260 days, of which you would want at least 60days to ensure consensus.
You can do your own calculations, as you will just argue aesthetics on anything I present. You invest the time, and I will pick it apart.
Bitcoin is valuable because it represents change from other established networks of transaction. It also happens to embody many improvements and technological advancements. To deny Bitcoin the ability to keep evolving, is to say that Bitcoin is finished development and can't be improved. 
We have yet to see any contentious changes reach the market, since the days where a strong leader of the core client could push changes with just a super majority of developers agreeing (as opposed to the consensus required now).
All changes that reach the market are also subject to consensus as dictated by code (and not just opinion), so it's not as if any fork could just appear and silently swing Bitcoin in a new direction. 
**Yes or no, would a successful fork now indicate the increased potential of other successful forks in the future?**
The larger base blocksize is required, as outlined in the Lightning Network whitepaper. If it's necessary regardless, what is the point in delaying? To say that increasing the block size solves nothing, is disingenuous or ignorant.
**Yes or no, does delaying an available fix for an inevitable problem solve anything?**

You completely ignored the first point. At this stage the Bitcoin Core dev team is the single largest point of failure.
Something as simple as another dev group stepping up to provide options ended up with: 
* complete censorship via topic removal and user bans
* developer advocated attacks on their infrastructure
* multiple developer statements discrediting the work but providing no proof or actual critique
* developer statements saying that having more than one developer team is unnecessary and could damage the ecosystem
* developers and "experts" redefining terms into political contexts to shoot down innovation (labeling it an alt-coin)
* ... and far more!
A large corporate interest could simply buy the Bitcoin Core package maintainer or a few of the notable devs, and force us down any direction they wanted... or prevent all changes forcing Bitcoin to stop growing and evolving.

Interesting proposal and I like that you use the median, but why would they need to have a higher difficulty when increasing and not when they want to decrease too? The miners aiming to reduce the size will always have an advantage over the miners hoping to increase it.
It's an interesting idea to make the size stickier in the upwards direction, but I don't see rational miners increasing the difficulty simply to indicate an interest in increasing the size.
The size also will change rather slowly. What is the point of an 8MB cap? Shouldn't it be far higher, to kick this can down the road for at least a few years to see if other solutions eventuate? It also does not make much sense to start at 1MB either. We would probably want to start at 2MB (which even the conservatives seem to support).
Unfortunately, this proposal still suffers from the same voting flaw as BIP100, in that it encourages a cartel to form to orphan blocks with votes that they don't agree with.

What was the point of network adapters, when they were first made?
They were expensive and served no purpose as there was only a fledgling internet and each household may only have a single PC. I could just go to the library if I wanted information, or walk to a my friend's house if I wanted to talk.
The product 21 are selling is clearly a first generation prototype. The whole gamefield changes when these are small and cheap enough to integrate into appliances and other things.
To say that this technology platform serves no purpose right now, is kind of missing the whole fact that this is a platform and an attempt at offering a programatic interface that could prove to be the industry standard. If you can't see a way to use this stack, then why assume no-one else can?

It's unnecessary complication to any software solution you are trying to implement, and fundamentally excludes you from the 21 inc. micro-transaction solution, that would likely see a huge rise in miner decentralisation as an added bonus to the network.
Your Bitcoin's worth of satoshis are useless if you are rolling your own solution (as you would be paying tonnes in fees), when 21 inc is offering a whole ecosystem built around that concept. The early access price of entry is just $400 for this MVP (minimum viable product) development kit, which will likely drop an order of magnitude in the near future as both the hardware improves and uptake increases (as the economies of scale kick in).
It is astoundingly ignorant or astoundingly short-sighted to say there is no value in a stream of satoshis and a system of which to use them in.
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:56:26
Satoshi is dead to the community. People should stop trying to leverage his words as an authority. The email could have been fake, for all we know. 
If decentralised authority was ever intended to be a core principle of the client and protocol development, then there has been no incentive to achieve that or any proof demonstrating work was made towards achieving that.
The easiest solution would have been to have two reference clients with similar market share. If there had been two references clients lead by two different teams of developers, then we would not be in the current mess where there was a single authority that has almost complete control over Bitcoin.
The fact that we have a centralised authority right now, is the best proof that decentralisation of development was never intended.

Why do people keep spouting this? Banks would presumably use this as a way to settle and clear transactions amongst themselves.
In a hypothetical example, we have Google and Bing send each other search results that have a monetary value. Would Bing happily trust Google to run the big database that logs and clears those transactions?
Right now, the banks use a third party settlement system. Using a private blockchain would allow all of these individual associations to securely transact with very little trust. It would absolutely be revolutionary, and if I understand correctly, vastly improve transaction times and lower costs.

Bad news. Opening a hub, or leaving a hub means commiting a transaction to the blockchain. The very thing people are against increasing capacity for. Someone did the simple calculations that show we need far bigger blocks if users are going to be allowed 10 transactions a month.
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:57:39
Here, let me google that for you.
* [Peter Todd said gmaxwell doesn't see the current tech going above 1MB, which had been proven false.](
* [I don't have the IRC log to prove it, but Luke-JR outright said that we should be reducing the blocksize, and suggested we go down to like 800KB or 400KB. This was on  He has also shared this view on [github issues](
Those were the top two google results. I recall the bitcoin repo maintainer (the person that makes the final call, and has the power to overrule the other devs) saying that he does not support a block size increase on a schedule longer than a few years. He also compared blocksize schedule to the GFC.
Most of the remaining core devs are under the employ of a company that is positioned to make money on its investment if users are forced off the blockchain, and into their centralised and institutionalised solution ([liquid]( and LN).
[Various mods have also said they would prefer the blocksize to shrink]( and as they have the power to push their narrative... that is almost as good as being a core dev. [I can't tell if they are just trolling though, and won't dare to challenge their authority in case I get banned or forced to submit an apology essay.](

Theoretical losses incurred through capping or limiting adoption are hard to quantify. 
As you pointed out, the sky has not fallen, how ever, it's mighty coincidental that many shitcoins and altcoins have picked up a lot of value while Bitcoin has largely remained the same (if not decreased somewhat). 
Until SegWit actually rolls out and is adopted enough that there is no path back (unless I've missed such a huge milestone in my absence), I doubt many will reconsider what side they are supporting, as it's all still just talk. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 01:31:44


Why don't you try them yourself, then? They are very simple arithmetic. 
Increasing blocksizes is required no matter which way we take forward.
@_date: 2015-11-24 06:17:38
Umm, no. In your hypothetical, it would be a $20 fee every time you join a hub (which the LN whitepaper says people should be joining many for day-to-day transactions).
It's also a $20 fee to settle disputes. Would you pay $20 to settle your $30 dispute? How about when the fee is greater than the transaction's value?
The whole point of the LN is to facilitate easy entry and exit of these hubs that make no guarantee on availability or trustworthiness. The whole fall-back, is being able to dump your transactions into the blockchain if there is a dispute.
Also, the LN hubs will very much fall into the purview of the government. In most developed countries, those hubs will be classed as money transmitters and require a license.
If you think current mining is not mostly happening in datacentres, then you must be having a laugh. The small people and businesses have long been a minority in the Bitcoin network (as was inevitable and even mentioned in the original whitepaper).

I haven't looked at namecoin in a very long time, but has there been any thought about replacing the way CAs currently work in SSL with namecoin functionality? Current SSL is all about trusting these centralised organisations to ensure we are talking to the legit owner of a domain (instead of a MITM server) by signing their trusted key against the owner's untrusted one. When CAs can no longer be trusted, isn't this a perfect niche for an alt based around zero trust authentication of domains? A site's registration could be used in their SSL. Domain renewals could be linked back to previous registrations of the same domain to show how trust-worthy they are.

@_date: 2015-11-26 01:18:44
Nope, you have fundamentally missed the point. Right now, the only way banks are willing to transact between themselves is via trusted third parties. The downside being the large fees and slow confirmation.
A blockchain solves this neatly, by cutting out the third party and allowing these banks to transact securely in a trustless manner.
They are dealing in fiat, so they obviously need additional controls on-top. Whether it be a client with better support for time-lock contracts or multi-sig... the sky is the limit, really.

My time is worth about $50/hr, so if I could setup up the hardware, pool, and a way of ensuring I get a stream of satoshis in less than 8hours (less when you factor in the rPi and miner cost) ... then it would make sense to do it myself.

@_date: 2015-11-09 21:30:42
Nope, not even close. I will quote some parts of it when I get to my desk.
Basically, the last speculative surge saw blocks fill as people tried to move coins into and out of exchanges. A normal transaction fee would see your transaction take 27hours to confirm, while a fee of about $2 would take anywhere from next block to a few hours.
The OP manages some kind of BTC and altcoin pool. During that period of high volume, they noticed that many more users were electing to be paid in alt coins, which could be quickly moved to exchanges and sold. This unfortunately halted though, when his pool ran out of liquidity and had to wait for their transactions from exchanges to slowly clear.
The message was clear, users moved to other alt coins when the blocks filled. If BTC doesn't remain useful, people will adopt what works, whether it be dogecoin or litecoin.
@_date: 2015-11-20 01:35:39
I don't know about you, but I certainly wouldn't be able to assemble a development framework and the infrastructure required to ensure the hardware I am running on: accrues satoshis at a steady rate, and allows my tiny transactions (satoshi sized) get onto the block chain eventually
... in less than 8hours (my time has value), to compete with that $400 price tag for developers.
As the economies of scale kick in, and we see any of the things I previously mentioned occur... I definitely would not be able to do the same. If I could, I would compete with 21 inc., in a race to be an internet of things enabler.
If we only focus on the hardware then yes... this MVP (minimum viable product) is easily beaten in cost. How long that can last though is anyone's guess. 
Can it still be beaten in cost when it's $100? How about $50? How about $10?

I think you are confused about the terminology here. Both kinds of RBF are opt-in, in the sense that users can elect to flag a transaction as RBF, or send normal transactions. The two RBF implementations commonly talked about are:
* **FSS RBF**: Transactions can be replaced by higher fee-paying transactions, provided that all outputs in the previous transaction are still paid by the replacement
* **Full RBF**: Transactions can be replaced by higher fee-paying transactions, including transactions that allocate the coins to different addresses (i.e. you can use other addresses to pay more in fees, or simply send the coins back to yourself).
Core implemented the latter, and by extension, I guess Electrum followed Core here. I haven't checked what Electrum specifically did, except note that they have indicated that they will not highlight incoming transactions as having the RBF flag.

No, what is pathetic is that you believe miners and users would move to BIP101 before the minimum activation date.
BIP101 has an economic majority supporting it (pretty much all of the payment processors), and miners have tentatively supported it, if there is no progress from this December scaling conference. It is in their interests to hold out as long as possible, in the off-chance anything else is coded that would give them more control or chance of higher profit.
Everyone seems content to see how this plays out, even if we bump against the block size roof.
We will either see a very quick swing after December, or yet again more stalling with another 12 scaling conference planned.

While I agree that miners work for us, and that they ideally operate in self-interest, I only see BIP148 muddying waters... which is what I meant by clear path forward.
Miners have no mechanism of being able to distinguish between vocal minority, and economic majority. Companies can easily throw out radical suggestions, as at the end of the day, none of them are carrying significant risk (via massive price movements), as they are only transaction facilitators and retailers. All of the risk lies with the miners, that need to make a hard decision. Even if they horribly botch things somehow and can't transact for a week or two, they only suffer reputational damage and opportunity cost (shared by all their business rivals too).
You hit the nail on the head by saying that miners work for us... but therein lies the problem. It's us as users, not other companies or node counts, and there is no clear way to poll that group in a fair and reliable manner.
I reiterate, I don't see a clear way forward, and if we somehow muddle our way through this crisis, the next will be even harder, if we can't come up with a clever solution.

I would very much like to explore your numbers. How many coins do you think will be in an average LN transaction (the LN side, not the blockchain side)?
By my calculations, 130MB would enable **1.5million LN nodes** transacting 20 times a day, at the current average transaction size. Transaction size seems to scale pretty linearly with the number of people getting paid in the transaction, so you if I am not mistaken, the number of people LN can facilitate is pretty much capped by how many transactions the LN nodes can make. Doubling the average transaction size would halve the number of nodes that can make transactions.
If we assume each transaction is 0.5BTC on average, we would also optimistically tie up 750,000 BTC for a bit over an hour a day for the LN nodes to facilitate these transactions (as a LN node needs to hold an equal amount of BTC to the amount being routed). It kind of falls apart, if people hold their money in these payment channels (as they are encouraged to do) or don't spend the BTC immediately.

And the 21 infrastructure, unless you are saying that is part of their API.
You are also excluding the convenience of packaging it together.
The miner can't be swapped with $30 of Bitcoin, as it is then not securing the 21 pool's power. It would also fall astray of laws in many countries if they were to sell products with money included, OR it would mean the developer/user needs to load every device with coins... which obviously does not scale as well for all kinds of products. Your bitcoin home security system, your bitcoin phone, your bitcoin browser dongle, your bitcoin automated vending machine, your bitcoin automated public locker, your bitcoin public bike stand.
Having to manually re-enable an IoT device, pretty much kills its usefulness as the number of IoT devices you have grows. Would you really want to do some manual re-activation for every single device in your house or organisation at random intervals, when the whole intention is to make them smart, in-dependant, web enabled and autonomous?

I regret to inform you of this, but that's pretty retarded point of view. These old windows XP machines are largely embedded systems (everything from specialised device controllers to MRI CAT scanners, etc.).
The rest would have other specialised purposes running **only** the propriety software designed for it (think scheduling systems and medical record browsers, etc.), and not being used for general word processing and mail browsing.
With this established, you should also consider that there have been dozens of high profile linux exploits that required immediate patching over the years, and did not rely on users being ignorant. These machines still being on windows XP implies that they most likely would not have been receiving updates, hence equivalent linux machines would be just as vulnerable, all else held equal. 
You are sorely mistaken if you think just whacking a linux machine in-place of a windows machine automatically makes it more secure.

Only if they were not dependant. The **REDACTED** method would drop transactions that depend on each other. This would mean the real spam would be dropped, while potentially leaving the legitimate but low feed transactions there.
The added benefit is that transactions won't just disappear, with enough nodes alive, transactions would be kept in at least one mempool.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:08:39
Electrum don't plan on warning people of which transactions are RBFed, and the Core RBF is full RBF, where addressess can be changed as long as the fee is higher.
You should ammend your comment that says warning people of RBF is better than ignoring it, as it implies that Electrum is aiming to help the situation here, when they appear to be purposefully muddying the waters.

They pay a fee, how are they attacks? If anything, attacks would be making a huge amount of transactions that all depend on each other... and the **redacted** client addresses that problem quite well, but dropping transactions that depend on the one picked for eviction.

That point is rather moot, as the merchant needs to be offering Bitcoin as a payment method. If they took the trouble to offer it as a payment method, there is generally a discount.
If you are paying with Bitcoin, without it being an option, then you are probably using a service that has the fee savings built in.
Coinjar has no fees on deposits, 1% using their Bitcoin debit card, no fees on withdrawl of Bitcoin.
There is a fairly competitive spread on the exchange rate, in comparison to the exchanges available to Australians.
This service is available for Australians, and I take full advantage of it!

You probably went wrong by assuming there was much critical thought put into these percentage suggestions.

No? It's potentially infinite, but based on how fast the transactors want their transaction confirmed. If 1.01MB of transactions want to be in the next block and are willing to pay a larger fee, then the fee will climb up to the highest fee willing to be paid and cascade down from there for 1MB.
In practice though, there should be a point at which the fee is too high to make BitCoin worth transacting in.

Thanks Canon. I don't understand your tone. Their priorities have clearly been on retaining market share, which can lead to (but does not necessarily guarantee) "making money". Offering more payment options for digital businesses that actually have the capability and experience of integrating multiple payment processors, is a no-brainer.

Are you okay?
@_date: 2015-10-08 01:26:55
Well... have you had a look at your CC fees? If it costs you more to pay via Bitcoin than via CC, it means the merchant is likely getting the difference in processing costs as additional profit.
If the merchant offers a discount on Bitcoin purchases for the amount they save on processing costs ... then it should be cheaper to pay via Bitcoin.

There is not technically about it. A hash rate drop means an absolute drop in security.
If the hash rate dropped by 100x, not only are there quite a few ASIC companies willing to continue producing and selling ASICs to who ever would buy them... there would also be a glut of old equipment lieing around potentially put for sale.
Bitcoin is relatively insecure until it is not economic for largest concentration of wealth (likely the largest nation state) to attack the network. Until that point, the network remains economic for large players to manipulate.

Which is their bullshit justification. In the digital era we are currently in, having servers somewhere should not equate to doing business there. It should also be the case in-terms of discrimination of customers.
What they are doing is a ham-fisted attempt at forcing companies to only serve customers within their own region, which kind of goes against everything the internet has been about.
@_date: 2015-10-08 02:06:02
That has nothing to do with it?
The merchant pays a fee to a processor when accepting your CC. Bitcoin removes a large percentage of that fee. Merchants can choose to pass on some of that saving to people that pay with Bitcoin.
By paying with CC, not only will the merchant pay a fee, you will generally also pay a fee too.
The combination of a small saving and the reduced fees are likely to make paying with Bitcoin cost competitive, which means there should be very little difference in paying with Bitcoin vs. paying with card.

If orphaning is a risk of a blocksize increase, it's the exact same for SegWit. SegWit doesn't magically put 1.7MB of data into a 1MB block. It still needs to distribute that extra data.

So much for decentralisation. I got massively flamed and downvoted when I pointed out that this was the only way lightning works and scales.
The other big problem being that nodes still need to commit each channel regularly, not just keep them open for months.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:53:00
Can you explain exactly how LN will scale to the kind of stage that most transactions can happen off-chain... whilst also remaining decentralised? If your explanation hinges on everyone setting up channel with the handful of exchanges, then you are proposing the highest level centralisation ever seen in Bitcoin so far... as well as entirely mitigating any supposed privacy gains.
Bonus question: How long would these channels stay open, keeping in mind that having them last longer means locking away user funds for that period of time should something unforeseen happen (exchange closing, etc.) as well increase the incentive for exchanges to hold coins for ransom (i.e. pay us $5 not to just let this channel time-out and lock up your funds for 6months)?

I think people massively misunderstand Chinese culture here. The Chinese culture of face, drives everything, and when they believed Core promised them SegWit with a 2MB HF coded up and ready to deploy (if they promised to dump Classic), that is what they expected. When Core about-turned and claimed the Chinese were lieing, face was lost, torpedoing any chances of future cooperation. To top it off, one Core developer threw together a HF he knew would never get accepted (a HF to like 300KB), further destroying Chinese face... especially when Core hand waved and pointed towards that HF as proof of them honoring the commitment that they simultaneously claimed never happened.
Is it no wonder that they would do their own SegWit and 2MB fork with hookers and blackjack, even if the end result is very similar to them just going with SegWit now?
I'm not even going to go into all of the FUD Core devs and others were spreading in the early days of this whole contentious scaling issue (like any blocksize increases data allowance requirements too high, thus killing decentralisation, then doing an about turn after SegWit and saying that the network can easily handle double to quadruple the size of blocks [SegWit blocks are bigger than straight 1MB blocks, regardless of how the signatures are transmitted]).

This is an interesting phenomenon, but i can't wrap my head around it yet, even after a bit of cursorary reading.
Could you break this scenario down into how the buyer and seller benefit?
As i understand: 
The seller of the bond has to repay less of the amount owed, due to the negative interest... But doesn't that mean they are not paying interest at all... Or that the buyer is paying them the interest? When the bond reaches maturity, then the theoretical face value would be paid.
The only thing i can see the buyer getting out of this, is security in knowing the bond is safer than the bank... Probably.
What would make these negative bonds profitable to buy? Is it just a hedging tool, where they believe the money will be worth more in the future?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:28:13
Like I said, it is your prerogative if you wish to increase the taint in the block chain. Just be-aware that if any scheme to blacklist or identify addresses occurs, it is not only the culprit that suffers, but everyone that trades with an address that can be reasonably proved linked to the culprit. If a business used a "professional" address to sell t-shirts, and some spy paid to that address and is later busted, that business with the "professional" address now has questions to answer for, and when compelled to share who else bought things, all of the consumers are now compromised too.
An address is re-used when you accept coins from it more than once.
Go do some reading, they are indeed not the same. IIRC it was something about them being generated as uncompressed addresses, which was twice as large as the normal compressed addresses.
Yes, you are completely wrong.

The "meme" was justly earnt, though. Two things continue to sicken me till today:
1. We had prominent devs supporting the censorship at the time, and the rest refused to publicly comment on it.
2. The mods never consistently enforced their rules for dropping the ban hammer. There were plenty of examples of this back then, but a more contemporary example would be allowing discussion of a hostile fork (UASF) that is highly controversial and only pushed by a minority. Under the definition the mods put forward as the "golden rule", they would have called UASF a shit coin and banned all discussion.

Please do not encourage this. It's fine as a donation address, but using custom addresses has many large down sides. Here are three of the larger ones:
* You compromise the security of yourself and everyone that deals with that address, negating some of the benefits of an anonymous network. Address re-use is not something we should be encouraging, which leads to...
* An improvement (somewhat already implemented) coming very soon is to lower the priority of re-used addresses to once a block... meaning you will not see payment to a re-used address more than once every 10mins or so (coming soon)
* Increased wallet and transaction size. I don't really need to elaborate on how these "custom" addresses are usually larger than standard addresses. This means more fees and more bloat in the chain.
But at the end of the day, if you say "fuck you" to everyone else, it is your own prerogative. Until  truly comes into play, you can continue doing your own thing and no one can stop you.

I wasn't given root access on the dedicated server *_* ... filed a support ticket to see if I can get it.
EDIT: My miss. Root not enabled by default on default installations.

You can only try to inform them (many down votes were had)... We should hopefully see some changes in the way the blocks are mined, and wider support for "HD address" to discourage address re-use.

Only works on Python 2.7.3 so far. *_* 
Version 3 and 2.5.X were no good.

I see what you mean... but there are serious bitcoind limitations. When your wallet is too big, any action will freeze it completely as it rechecks the entire wallet reconciling. If you don't take active steps to manage it, you get weexchange all over again (if we are to believe he isn't bankrupt in the first place).

I am glad I had my wallet automatically email and backup a copy for me. =P

I never went that far, but I definitely made a few of my own when I first started. After a bit more exposure and education, I learnt the folly of my ways, and now only use one as a donation address. Will be changing it as soon as BIP32 addresses become mainstream.

I would like to a single Aussie exchange. We have none locally yet. We do have a few one man operations, but that are better classed as traders instead of exchanges, especially as they are only acting as 3rd parties.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:52:00
So close...
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:14:46
BitFinex down now too.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:50:47
I guess it is more of a statement that without Mt. Gox... us Aussies have nothing... as usual.
Very annoying that there are soo many American only exchanges and currency conversion platforms.

Order was just fulfilled (add at least 30mins for the invoice to originally go through =).
Impressed with delivery time so far. Will report back after playing with the server a bit.

It actually came good just before it went down. Did I cause it? :)

Cloudflare definitely did their job keeping the site up... however the dynamic back end is down. Kind of a moot point.

Against any real attack anything you are doing locally is completely ineffective, especially if it only deals with remote IPs.
I guess it stops the script kiddie level of DOS though.
I was DDoSed last week, and they took out my upstream providers long before it hit me.
Before that, they have used DNS amplification attacks, as well as protocol-less floods from many hundreds of thousands of addresses.

Businesses should be generating addresses as needed for each individual transaction. Not only does it provide far easier accounting, it also minimises taint. Refer to my above scenario.
There are two substantial pools I am aware of with this currently implemented, and BTCGuild are considering it. Not to mention that when devs are behind the idea, it has a higher likelihood of occuring.
You can apply what ever half-assed logic to support undermining the core ideas of BitCoin that you want. Claiming that not adhering to recommended practice is somehow going to cripple adoption is nothing but ignorant. Another slated change which may soon be coming are so called HD addresses that feel like a static address to the reciever but provide a new address automatically for each transaction (this is the dumbed down explanation).
EDIT: And it's not X days, it's every time they recieve BTC, it should be to a new address. Point me to a single client that does not facilitate this functionality in two or three clicks.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:39:14
In case you needed another example, someone can lace your "professional" addresses with dust, which will inadvertently be spent or moved somewhere else. BAM, those accounts can now be linked together with a high certainty. There are a myriad of reasons why address re-use is "bad".
EDIT: Spelling mistake, address not account.

119.13 AUD per BTC?
Mt. Gox is currently down but the going rate is closer to $70 right now.
It's hardly an exchange when they have a fixed price. I am after an open market exchange. The risk factor is significantly higher with those small unknown exchanges.
+1 for suggestion anyway
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:06:30
lol, only a little exchange risk? It's moved from about 85 to 75 in last 3hours. *_*

Great to see another option for 3rd party Bitcoin processing!
Seriously though, please invest in getting a Chrome extension (and then firefox I guess) created. A bookmarklet is not convenient, especially as I do not have a bookmark toolbar (can't remember if this is by default), and don't want one.
With a Chrome extension, you could then simply add a checkout with snapcard button to ebay pages, etc.

You guys are in for a world of hurt every time the price drops. I find it hard to trust a business with such a poor business model.
What happens when the price dips? Does the consumer get a refund if the item has not been bought yet?
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:41:39
Does it have a box? 
Does it glow? 
Does it fly/hover? 
How much money are they making an hour from it?
What is the build quality like?
Did it explode?
Is it leaking magic smoke?
How fast can they get it to go? (DOA if it burns right?)

Call me skeptic, but it sounds awfully like communism to me.
We have you (I assume the central body of this new government), deciding how money shall be divided between the populace at a whim.
I don't see how your scheme is any different from "forced theft".
Nice try though. I support most of the sentiments.
