Hi. Please send me a PM with your email address, and I will send you the link to download the vector. Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:06:00
Thank you for sharing man. 
Funny thing, I am not an Eth guy necessarily, but when I first found out about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, about a half a year ago, I took baby steps, and started with mining with what seemed more affordable to me at that moment, and that's how I got to having most of my small portfolio in Eth. In the meantime, I gave up on GPU mining, and got some BTC bits these days. I love both :D and the whole cryptospace (besides scammers and spammers) 
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:39:46
That's right. History tells us the same :)). 
I feel nobody wants to get to the moon but seeing their green candlesticks rising to that height :D 
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:34:20
LOL :)) this escalated quickly. Would you be kind enough to send one my way and one at Max Elegen, whose comment in a thread on FB's group Crypt0 News inspired this?
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:50:22
 here you can buy it with as cheap as 11$ :)))) cheers y'all
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:11:35
Thank you :D
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:57:11
 maybe they ship it to Australia from here :D
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:53:59
or you can take it from the artist's shop who made it, for $11 at  ;)
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:16:31
Thanks, man! I am ok with people using the image, as a meme or doing their own T-Shirts with the artwork. I am against those who sell it for profit though as if it is their own. THere are some who sell it Spreadshit for $29,99, Redbubble for $24,99. On Threadless, in my shop, I think is the lowest price, only $11.   Thank you for the support!
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:56:40
Looks good! :D 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:05:52
 here you go

Yes. After seeing people selling products using my artwork, without crediting the source, I decided to take the file down, even if the harm is already there. Anybody who wants a copy of the file to print it on their own end can contact me directly and I will give them the file. But I am not ok with people ripping other people off, selling T-Shirts for $29,95 using the artwork I created and shared freely for those who want to make a T-Shirt locally without having to pay the shipment. Text me on Fb or Instagram  and I will send you the vector. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:54:50
For anyone who wants the original vector to make his own t-shirt here it is  and if anybody wants to send some love my way, you can buy you'r T-Shirt or Hoodie at  Cheers guys!

damn...this guy is selling on the same platform as me...and I created the artwork... this is sick
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:29:06
I used OPTIFutura-ExtraBlackCond

I'd do that as well, but since my fiat bag is empty atm I'll stick at hodling and creating artworks.
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:01:45
If you redraw the vector, thank you for using a different spacing between the letters. At least there are some differences between what I created and your copy :)) 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:05:37
it didn't mean anything in particular. Somebody suggested a meme based on the "just hodl it" line, a parody from "just do it" and that inspired me to create this artwork, with the Japanese candlesticks. It was during a market bloodbath, and I was (and still am) for some coins I hodl to recover. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:35:24
Thank you ^_^ Interesting day in crypto, and the fun is yet to start.
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:57:16
It's considered fair use since it's a parody.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:35:41
I agree. One one side you have the adoption aspect and on the other that of speculation. 
Who needs to be first? The egg or the chicken? IMO in order to have higher adoption rate, you need to have businesses which accept crypto for their products &amp; services. The possible high returns on holding Btc, even though dips are happening, may be enough of an incentive for more businesses to start accepting cryptos (which is already happening). The fact that the onboarding ramp is on a different scale for using cryptocurrencies than for speculating on it is a different story.
Either way, my artwork was inspired by recent events, I didn't think about it as a crypto motto/philosophy. 
I am from Romania, and we are a long long way from adopting Btc. All I can do is prepare myself for that day :)))

Shirt sellin'? Sure. But don't waste your time on creating your own artworks. In 24 hours since I created the artwork it went on Amazon, Etsy, Ebay, Redbubble, Spreadshirt etc. and was sold for up to 39.95$. I was definitely happy to see so many people appreciating the artwork, but seeing others taking profit on my work wasn't as fun. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:38:10
Awesome! Glad to hear this. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:55:05
 they ship in Europe as well. If you know an European based platform that prints and delivers T-Shirt, let me know and I will make the design available there as well.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:50:03
try here :) 
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:53:15
 :) this would be more legit
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:56:03
Nicely said!
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:19:38
Told you. Contact me on one of those channels and I will send you the vector. Have a great day
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:23:40
I already made the design available on threadless and redbubble as T-Shirts or other apparel, if anyone is interested. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:56:28
 you can get it from here :) if you are in the US I think this is the cheapest way you can get it, other than printing it yourself at a local vendor. If you wanna do that, I can send you the artwork as vector, but only for personal use :) Cheers!

If I'm not mistaken, initially it was a typo and people liked it. In the meantime they also added the Hold On for Dear Life meaning.
