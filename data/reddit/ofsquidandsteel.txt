I helped a friend set up a CB account over the weekend and she went through the same process. It was quick and easy!

Coinbase if you want to actually spend your bitcoins easily, since you can pair a Shift Card as a debit card with your balance there.
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:41:38
A couple of my real life friends signed up yesterday because they heard that Bitcoin had fallen a bit and decided that it was a good time to buy. Hooray for the referral bonuses!
So 100k is a bit high, sure, but it doesn't take that many people deciding to try out a currency that's been in the news for reaching quite high and then continuously rising back up again for (normal) people to decide to sign up for a company that makes it easy to buy and takes all of the knowledge of tech out of the equation to reach 100k...
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:40:56
I get charged when I buy with my debit card, but not when I do a bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:45:55
This is such an important point, and I don't see how people keep overlooking it.
Regardless of whether I keep my assets in USB, BTC, forever stamps, or whatever other currency, at the end of the day my assets are only worth what I can get with them. And sure, while Bitcoin will likely go up again and I'll become "wealthier" (when compared to USD), that won't return the extra amount I may have spent when it was lower. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:53:09
There are ways to raise them (such as buying more with the method).
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:50:54
The closest I can think of is Coinbase's referral program (buy $100 worth of bitcoin and get $10 free), which you could transfer over to GDAX off-chain.
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:25:46
That should go up if you verify your identity and/or keep spending. Check out the "limits" section on the website to see what you can do.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:46:46
Access and control are two different things, though. Most browsers request access *each* time.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:56:16
And I bought some at $40, sold all at $120 and was proud of myself for having made a profit. Ended up not getting any again until it hit $800, and even then, I'm not even remotely close to how many BTC I had back in the day.
Frankly, though, I needed the money when I sold years ago, so although I *could* have earned a lot more by holding, it wasn't what I needed back then. As easy as it would be to regret selling, I have to remind myself that past!me did what was best for her, and present!me can now slowly invest in BTC and ~~hopefully~~ afford to actually hold it this time.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:01:45
I believe it somewhat depends on Coinbase's algorithm. You can be a fully verified account, but if their algorithm suspects you might be a scammer, your limits may be lower. 
I don't know of anybody personally who has a limit lower than $100 once fully verified. Most of my friends that use it have $500-$750 limits while fully verified. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:14:23
This is *so* true. And even when you educate her, don't make any promises about how it always goes up. Because if it takes a dip (and it will, inevitably, take a dip - we all know this roller coaster), it'll be all your fault.

I haven't had any issues with Bank of America yet.
However, I move money into my Coinbase Wallet every two weeks for my scheduled daily buy instead of using my bank account. I make some of my random (read: dip) purchases through my bank and haven't had any issues with those transactions yet either.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:46:55
But it also sort of does? What if you *needed* to spend your coins? Or if "long term" outlasted you.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:41:51
Alternatively, you could just buy Bitcoin with your entire paycheck every time you get paid.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:02:53
Coinbase ACH transfers, maybe?
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:21:18
That option kept not loading for me. : / Meanwhile, for some reason, Basic didn't work either because they supposedly couldn't find me (I've never had a problem before, though?).
I was stuck doing enhanced, and was ridiculously grumpy about it.... and this is why I dislike less prominent alts/tokens.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:22:12
If you manually do it on an exchange where you can avoid fees like GDAX limit buying, there really aren't any. Especially if you put monthly deposits into your USD wallet on Coinbase, so you're avoiding the constant bank transactions.
Granted, you might miss out on some lower large buys, but dollar cost averaging is typically fine.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:52:30
IIRC, Coinbase used to let you decide between BTC and bits, but removed bits earlier this year.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:03:09
You don't lose anything else in your wallet. Find your GDAX address, send your BTC there. The BCH and whatever else will stay in your wallet (along with any BTC you don't send).

Hype-related posts tend to get a lot of upvotes. It's that way on a ton of subs - you get karma by posting memes, news, and whatnot of things that people like.
There are legitimate discussions here too, along with useful questions. You just have to stop looking at the top posts and dig a little deeper.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:44:55
This is one of the problems with reddit - people normally only post about companies like this when they're complaining about them.
Is coinbase perfect? Of course not, but the vast majority of users (myself included) never experience any problems with it. However, people that don't have problems are less likely to make posts about how their transaction went through and all is as it should be. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:09:20
Oh wow. That stinks.

Verify your identity, then try the card a couple of times. They've had a (not yet fixed) glitch the past week or so where card verification is taking longer than expected. Double check that everything is spelled the same way it is for your card, too!

Most definitely! Google Authenticator is the most secure of the commonly used methods.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:28:41
Exactly! I first got curious when it was at $400. Back then I had a better job and could have afforded more... but only bought $10 worth. I regret not having bought more when I could, but it's better late than never. Especially when Hodling.

The article on their site was a wall of unorganized text that wasn't super easy to read. 
I added the etc. too, so I wasn't wrong. And responded to the currencies they asked about. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:31:24
To put simply, yes. Coinbase is a wallet application that buys and sells instantly, while GDAX is an actual exchange. Thus, they don't need to adjust the price to guarantee stock or purchase on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:47:40
If somebody can get into your phone's service provider and port your number, they have access to your Authy/SMS 2FA.
They need the physical device for Google.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:51:07
Go to GDAX and move funds from coinbase into it. It should be instantaneous. Try selling there.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:40:59
Just take the extra minute and buy on GDAX using limit and avoid fees altogether.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:57:45
The log scale is what helps me keep calm about the growth and not worry about our little "corrections".

I use a Ledger, not a Trezor, but IIRC: ETH, LTC, etc. are all supported.
[Here's a list made by the developer](

Nope. GDAX is awesome, and you can still use Coinbase to store. Just make sure you know what you're doing

While it may or may not do that, people were saying the same thing when it hit 900 in December... and now it's August and we're at 4k.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:16:09
As others mentioned, Ledger Nano S, Trezor, and Keepkey are good ones.
However, to go a step further, I'd back up your private keys on a cryptosteel or three. This way, if there's a fire and your device is destroyed, your keys will survive.

Millions of satisfied customers, but problems with response time due to rapid growth.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:25:49
I needed a bit of extra cash at the moment so I sold a bit at $2500. Yeah, it stinks now, but it was necessary when it happened.
In the grand scheme of things, though, my weekly buys and BTC's growth will cancel that small bit out. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:28:32
[This comes to mind...](
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:54:05
You're never guaranteed it will crash, though.
I had friends waiting for it to drop down to 1k after it hit 1.5k. Never quite did. The next "crash" happened when it dropped to 1.9k-ish.
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:28:10
They have a backlog of customer support. Mind you, it's also been a three-day holiday in the US (I'm pretty sure that they still have people working, but not at full staff). 
You can post in or email their reddit support (it's linked in most posts in I think that posting in their community forum might be quicker than reddit, but your mileage may vary.

Mine, along with ones my friends and family have bought by my recommendation, have mostly come in about two weeks earlier than expected. I hope it's the same for you!

Does one ever truly "own" a Bitcoin, though? It's not like they can raid your house and find a golden coin lying about. Sure, they can find the private keys to a wallet, but they can always be disguised as something else. It's not like Bitcoin sniffing dogs exist, or as if there aren't ways to keep Bitcoin concealed from private eyes.

@_date: 2017-05-08 21:46:23
But that's the magic of Coinbase - it makes Bitcoin *look* very simple. Furthermore, unlike GDAX, Coinbase basically guarantees you'll buy your Bitcoin right away. Sure, you can use close-to-market limit sales on GDAX instead, but if you've ever tried explaining that to a non-tech-savvy person, you'd realize how intimidating it can seem.

@_date: 2017-05-04 22:54:25
But it lets people that want to get in and feel like they're getting a deal buy the dip, which makes the price go up again.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:42:42
How is that last bit relevant? I just checked their [careers]( page, and being paid in Bitcoin is still on there... Maybe your source was inaccurate?
Did you ask your Coinbase guy about limits? They might know how they work better. IIRC, there's an algorithm that they use to determine whether or not someone might be a scammer, which they refer to when the system is determining limits. Maybe check your verification and/or update your account information, if you haven't tried that?
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:40:20
You can if you use a credit/debit card, but then you have higher fees
Or if they trust you and give you an instant bank limit.
Orrr if you already had some cash in you USD wallet.
But you can always buy btc *with* your bank account, rather than moving money into your wallet first, which will still take several days to process, but you'll get it at the price you bought at (regardless of if it has gone up or down).
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:29:48
I had a similar situation happen, and the item that *should* have shown up two days later with Prime ended up coming over a month later because they'd ended up buying from another seller in China. Now, because it still came during their *expected* period (and because I'm sometimes too nice for my own good), I ended up rating the seller 5-stars, only to be rated 1-star immediately after because it took me about a week after confirmed delivery to rate them (even though I'd messaged the seller I was out of town and would rate them when I got back and actually saw the item due to the seller fiasco).
My rating survived, but I'm *definitely* going to be more cautious with what I purchase in the future. The situation sort of turned me off of Purse. I contacted support, too, and they basically told me that the seller's allowed to rate me 1 star if I took a week to confirm delivery. After waiting over a month to get an item because of a seller change. Oh well. Sure, I'll still use them, but significantly rarer.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:01:17
I'd like to add a fourth thing:
- Do your own research in addition to asking for investment advice from people holding said investment. 
Especially with cryptocyrrencies, it's not *that* hard to look up past price charts and check out some somewhat relevant recent news. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:04:04
Sad to say it, but it's very likely the two accounts thing. Coinbase doesn't allow it. Try contacting support and explaining the situation, promising to keep the other account closed, etc. There will be a wait time, but good luck to you!
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:47:34

One of them is an exchange and the other is a wallet where you can easily buy or sell. The average person that wants to own some bitcoin but isn't particularly tech savvy will enjoy Coinbase, while GDAX is more for trading.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:57:18
Pretty sure you can find thousands of unhappy users for any website or app that has over a million users. They tend to be more vocal, too.

@_date: 2017-05-18 02:02:01
I've had two negative experiences with purse orders in the past month, so I'm officially done with that service. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:21:50
For Coinbase/GDAX, yes.
I feel like a lot of the reasons why they're hated here (closing accounts if there's any indication of gambling / illegal stuff, having ties with banks, their current IRS shenanigans, verification requirements, licensing, etc.) almost guarantee that I'd (eventually) be able to get my money from them if something went wrong. Granted, I use them mostly to have a small automatic daily buy on Coinbase, occasionally make larger, fee-avoiding purchases on GDAX, very occasional selling or trading for one of their other two alts, and for sending any decent my purchased crypto to my hardware wallet for hodling purposes... so I'm not exactly spending my coins outside of their own system, and thus I'm not too worried about them getting on to me about suspicious usage.
Of course, I could be wrong and it could all go to Hell tomorrow, but personally I'd be more skeptical about exchanges with histories of getting hacked or something similar.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:59:14
Doesn't the same thing happen with Ethereum all the time though?
Not trying to argue - just wondering how this is different than the ETH/ETC split or the tons of altcoins crafted.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:03:21
I've actually had friends I've told about Bitcoin hold off purchasing because they thought the same thing... Or that, at the least, you could buy 1/100th of a coin.
Thankfully that's not the case with Bitcoin, and it's very easily divisible into tiny pieces. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:00:36
Ah, alright. Thank you for that distinction! That was very helpful.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:44:55
I recently had a somewhat bad experience.
An item that should have shown up several days later with Prime/Amazon's free shipping ended up coming over a month later because they'd ended up buying from another seller in China - which was strange, because it wasn't cheaper. Now, because it still came during their expected period (and because I'm sometimes too nice for my own good), I ended up rating the seller 5-stars, only to be rated 1-star immediately after because it took me about a week after confirmed delivery to rate them (even though I'd messaged the seller I was out of town and would rate them when I got back and actually saw the item due to the seller fiasco).
I contacted support and they told me that the seller's allowed to rate me 1 star if I took a week to confirm delivery, even after I explained that I had warned the seller of this and that the seller had purchased a shady listing that took forever to arrive.
My rating survived, and sure, and while I might use Purse.io in the future, support's backing of the seller instead of me in this situation turned me off of them quite a bit.

Have you checked your transaction history? Maybe somebody else got into your account?
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:44:14
Coinbase Vault is actually pretty safe if you're using the correct 2fa (so Google Authenticator, not SMS or Authy) on your Coinbase account and emails. Hardware wallets are better, sure, but worth more of an investment. Personally, I don't like phone wallets because I worry too much about my phone being stolen, so I either Vault small amounts of Bitcoin that I may or may not trade on Coinbase or send to my hardware wallet. Plus CB tends to be more error-proof on your end (for example, you don't have to figure out where to safely store your keys).
If there is a fork, just leave your coins for a bit. They'll still exist on both chains, and CB should let you know if they plan to ditch a chain beforehand.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:59:01
Phones getting stolen or crashing isn't exactly a rare occurrence; there's a form of backing up (sort of like the recovery phrase for a hardware wallet).  You'd have a couple specific backup codes that you printed out when you set up Google authenticator, and qr codes for specific sites.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:32:03
Ah, alright. I hadn't heard about those. I guess Authy is trying to take some measures to get Coinbase to stop recommending users to leave them?
I'd recommend you make the switch from Authy to Google Authenticator, though - the multi-device option has been reported to toggle on its own by some users. It's better to have something tied to your specific device than to your number, and even *limited* ability of using SMS to install and whatnot is significantly less safe than none.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:33:30

You can move them off to whatever wallet you choose.

Now graph it on a logarithmic scale.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:10:15
According to a recent blog post, coinbase is working on that type of feature, allowing hardware device auths like yubikey.
TOTP like Google Authenticator is tied to your actual device, not your SMS card or number or anything like that. So, hypothetically, if they port your phone, they still can't  get in. Thus the hacker has your phone (or you stupidly don't check the URL and fall for one of the fake webpage scams), the hacker would need your physical device to get in (though Google account access could maybe let them in, but you can use a physical device to authorize that).
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:13:42

You can use Coinbase to send to any merchant that accepts Bitcoin. Alternatively, you can get a Shift card and set it up with your Coinbase account, effectively giving you a debit card linked to your BTC instead of your fiat account.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:17:56
I agree with this entirely. For things like hardware wallets, I'd rather pay a bit more and wait slightly longer to get it by buying directly from the manufacturer than risk the chance (as minute and improbable as it may be) that my device is compromised when it arrives.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:22:57
Log scales tend to be better estimates of natural growth and whatnot, so if it looks like a bubble in log, it probably is, but if it doesn't, it can be natural.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:09:18
I haven't used that one so I can't speak to that, sorry. It looks like it supports generated passcodes, but also sms and push codes. It looks like sms is a backup to the code based authenticator? If that's the case, it's not nearly as safe, and is subject to Authy's largest vulnerability. However, again,I haven't used it so I don't know how easy that would be to disable.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:42:15
Anytime. : ) If you plan to spend, I *highly* recommend the shift card. It makes it super easy and lets you spend in places that don't accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:28:36
I feel like this is more likely a reaction to Coinbase's original email and recommendation of Google Auth over Authy than to Reddit chatter.
This having been said, unless Authy becomes a TOTP authenticator, it will still have vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:10:47
Did you have 2FA enabled? Specifically, were you using SMS, Authy, or Authenticator (and which)? Have you signed in to coinbase and checked your notification settings? Have you changed your email password recently and made sure that your email itself wasn't compromised?
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:01:06
You have backup codes from initial Google authenticator set up and qr codes to remain access to specific sites.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:49:08
Solid advice.
Then the rest of us can buy the dip. : )

FYI, tends to be a good starting point for simple explanations.
The price on each exchange is determined by what people are willing to buy/sell for on *that* specific exchange. For example, when an exchange halts USD withdrawals, that specific exchange's Bitcoin price will surge in comparison to others. Likewise, if somebody just bought or sold *a lot* of Bitcoin on a particular exchange at a specific price, it will temporarily modify that specific exchange's price.
If the prices are different by $200, you could hypothetically buy in the cheap one, send it to the more expensive one, and sell, but remember that fees differ on exchanges and Bitcoin can jump. Furthermore, Bitcoin has it's own transaction fees and wait times as well. Buying on one, sending to another, etc. is all essentially day trading through different exchanges, but depeding on the amount you'd earn, often not worth the effort when the price of Bitcoin itself is fluctuating by as much as it is.

I'm sorry for your loss. 
I think it's cases like that which are causing the current friction with Authy.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:47:16
Because more people are getting into Bitcoin and wanting to safely secure their coins. The companies can't keep up with demand.

It also happened two days after Coinbase sent out their email, IIRC. Potentially three? I don't remember when Coinbase's email went out.

You get a couple backup codes.

It's probably better to split it up into smaller transactions. Also, depending on where you live, beware of potential capital gains taxes.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:59:49
The backup codes that Google gives you and the QR codes you print out when setting up authenticator with specific sites.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:13:03
Wait, emails from Coinbase about Authy or from Authy about Coinbase? If the former, it's because Coinbase is trying to get people to switch to Google Authenticator due to loopholes and potential Authy exploits. If the latter... that's news to me. What did the email say?

I came here to whine about the sheer number of times this meme has been posted... but then saw your very clever edit.
So very, very true.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:43:20
Exactly. I feel like online security is a consistent cycle of the paranoid becoming the new norm.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:22:30
I'm not entirely sure about that, sorry. All I know is that current porting methods (the main flaw of SMS 2FA) and phone number based recovery do not affect it because it's tied to the device rather than the number.

You can entirely avoid fees on Coinbase if you use the correct GDAX buy. However, it's up to you - both are good exchanges.
This having been said, if you're looking at long-term storage, keep your coins on a hardware wallet such as a Ledger Nano S or Trezor.

Manchester's airport is the worst.
I flew through it recently and they proceeded to tell me that I had to stuff my solid soap, solid perfume bar, and solid powdered makeup into my liquids bag, confuscated my extension cable because it looks a bit bomblike when coiled up (literally the $2 extension cords you see everywhere) and then asked what currency the fake coins I was bringing as souvenirs for my boss's and friends' kids were.
.... I wouldn't be surprised if they were the first to  ban crypto. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:28:25
I'm confused. How is it better for them to go down at high-volume times? If they make money on fees, doesn't that mean they're no longer making money?
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:35:11
Typically, merchants will either have an address for you to send to (which you input into "send") or a QR code you can scan (same thing).
Go to the app, click the wallet you have your BTC in, click the little plus sign in the bottom right corner (if on Android; not sure about iOS), and you'll see an option to send.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:25:42
IIRC, it's first-in-first-out. So you're taxed on the difference between the original price of the earliest BTC (in that wallet) that you have in your account at the time of sale and the price at time of sale.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:45:07
This is the best advice.
Though if Trezor is sold out, Ledger Nano S works fine too.

Right now, in 30 seconds, in five minutes, at 4 AM tonight, tomorrow, next week, in 5 months, never... Nobody knows.

Pretty sure the reason has been well established - they've been growing too quickly for their support team to keep up.
Granted, it's probably about time that they hire/train more support.

Depending on the coin, they're compatible. For example, for most Ethereum tokens, you can link your Ledger and/or Trezor to MyEtherWallet and use it to store them (I know for a fact that GNT is fine, but would have to look up STRAT - if you can hold it on MEW, though, you can hold it on a hardware wallet).
While you *can* use Polo to loan out your coins, there are two main issues with this:
1. You can lose money. While Polo makes it look like you're almost guaranteed a gain, if you read enough on this sub about it, there are some horror stories.
2. By storing on Polo, you're still storing on exchanges. You don't hold your private keys. If your account gets hacked, Polo itself gets hacked, or Polo pulls a Mt. Gox (not saying the latter two are likely, but still possibilities worth considering that illustrate the point), you lose your coins.
If you'd like to use Polo to loan out your coins, don't do it with all of them. Pick a specific amount you'd be sort of okay with losing on the off chance something happens, use good security on your account, etc., and loan out part of your investment. Not all, though.

I'd say it's about as secure as your accounts are. Make sure your Coinbase account is protected (Google authenticator, don't reuse passwords, don't talk about all the Bitcoin on social media, etc) and do the best you can with Shift as well. 
I have a shift card that I occasionally use. Personally I've liked it - it feels just like any other debit card when you're using and can be used anywhere that accepts visa.
