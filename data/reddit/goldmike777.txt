I just sent them an email stating
''Thank you for your swift reply,
can I not then get the laptop I ordered fulfilled?  I did state in the first email that I wanted to go ahead with the purchase, that was the main reason for getting in contact 
as the coinbase website states **''If you're a customer and have just paid a merchant outside of the 15 minute window, we suggest that you contact them directly to notify them of the situation to make sure your order doesn't slip through the cracks.''**
yet my order was refunded &amp; I can no longer buy the laptop again as now you require more bitcoin than the time I paid which was the full amount
look forward to your reply
we will see what comes back..

this whale that whale had enough of waiting for whales to sell and whales to buy, bitcoin at times just seems like a huge friggin shill

I sent them my own bitcoin , the way I see it is as soon as bitcoin has reached them, they most definitely have a setup where bitcoin sells instantly on coinbase at the given rate, or at a 75/25 if they keep a small percent in bitcoin, so I sent them $750 worth of BTC, wait a week get no item, have to email back a fourth then get $550 back in BTC even after stating I wanted to go ahead with the purchase

yes its down &amp; im left without the item, I actually really wanted the item.. now I can't rebuy it, im out of pocket of £150/$200, I told them I wanted to go ahead with the purchase, at the time of purchase I was just going to sell my bitcoin and buy it with cash but I thought what the hell they accept bitcoin so I'll just pay with that

they use coinbase as the payment processing, please check coinbases terms on expired invoices 
I told them I wanted to go ahead with the purchase ( of course why would I purchase in the beginning right? )
I sent the payment but it didn't get to them in the 15 min window, they still got the money it shows on blockchain info
they send me a refund of the same amount of bitcoin today ( first paid Sunday night )
my gripe is.. bitcoin is down.. so my bitcoin is worth less, I don't have the laptop I bought.. it took a week.. also I almost guarantee if bitcoin has increased by 30% they would of sent less bitcoin

litecoin would be better for purchases imo
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:10:48
its all great when it goes good but when it doesn't and a merchant takes a week to sort the payment out
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:47:14
ok so I seen this thread has gotten a lot of good opinions &amp; yes I might of been in the wrong as I was just heated the merchant made me wait a week and then refunded me when I told them no I want to go ahead with the purchase so I guess I took the loss instead of him.. what can I do, also I agree Bitcoin is pretty poor for '' the internet's currency'' I really hope people start to adopt litecoin more as I think its amazing in comparison, the invoice timer is 15 mins but the high fees on bitcoin = 20 mins.. logic.
