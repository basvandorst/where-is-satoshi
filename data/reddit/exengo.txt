Depending on the terms of use and the options available for deposit I'm interested. But considering your goals with this I can't really imagine they would be unreasonable so sign me up!

A NAS is basically a small computer with a really large HDD. Most of them ship with some distro of Linux and custom software too make it work like a NAS.

It would be really nice to have the privacy agreements and terms of use in English so we know what we're agreeing on. Especially since you're making a really big deal about being "open".

There's a couple of sites to use. I mainly use localbitcoins or virvox
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:47:06
No, this is a problem only related to Coinbase. Not Bitcoin.

Same here in Sweden, or at least as long as you have the same day, else it's around 12 hours.

I have no idea who you are, but everyone here seems to get gold or btc for some reason... 
You seems to be looking for ideas, I'd say support Darkcoin.

Didn't think about that, but now when you say it that sounds more likely since the computers running NAS units are almost always bare-minimum.

I don't want to be rude or anything, but everyone here knows this. We've all used banks, we've all also used, or at least know quite a bit about, Bitcoins. There's no need to have this kind of post every day just to circlejerk about how bad banks are.

So you're someone with ridiculous amount of BTC who provide venture capital. Anything else I should know?

Both are Swedish btc/sek exchanges

I'm just hoping for apple pay integration. The ability to buy bitcoins in seconds with just your fingerprint sounds awesome to me.

Done all of that and posted my User ID in my first comment (1000001030)

Looks great so far. Will you require proof of ID and address for fiat deposit/withdrawal when that's implemented?
@_date: 2014-11-22 14:28:28
I do believe almost all NAS unites uses Linux so that shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:48:49
Just want to point out that buying Bitcoin this way is about 12% more expensive than buying at market price. And you will have to wait up to 48 hours for your first withdrawal.

Except when an article with sensational title gets upvoted.

Why would it be important to decentralize social network? The idea with Bitcoin was to decentralize currencies to solve problems with fiat currency.
But this doesn't really solve any problems, it seems like to we have gone to decentralize things just because we can with no real gain. 
In essence, it seems to be a non-working solution to a non-existing problem.
