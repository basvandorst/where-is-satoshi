Yes. Most of it is because the rich people in India don’t pay any tax. Seriously. Income tax department’s data says there are only 240,000 people in India with annual income more than $20,000. This is a fucking joke.
There are more than that in a single city in top 10 cities in India. This is because most businessmen don’t pay taxes. There is this parallel black economy where you can buy anybody with cash. There are so many 50,000-60,000$ cars on Indian roads. BMW etc is common in major cities. My neighborhood in India has atleast 10 millionaires. Seriously, most houses are easily worth $700,000. In India. Most are doctors who take money in cash from patients and pay pittance in tax. They launder this cash in the parallel economy buying $200,000-$400,000 houses in cash. 
Almost all of India’s problems boil down to pathetic tax collection. The parallel black economy is being threatened by the government with laws and anti corruption drives. They are worried these people will now move their illegal parallel economy to crypto. 
Seriously, you cannot imagine how bad tax collection in India is. Almost no one outside of salaried class pay their fair share of tax. The government thinks Crypto will make it worse by offering an alternate economy 
Take any per capita gdp, nominal gdp values you see from India with a grain of salt. I am sure the real numbers are way more. There is a multi trillion dollar parallel economy in India which doesn’t show up in these numbers.
