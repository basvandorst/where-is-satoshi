There used to be a sub called It was essentially a place for people to post slutty pictures that are on their friends' Facebook pages. SA started this whole "Reddit is a safe harbor for pedophiles" and "Reddit is filled with CP and the admins won't do anything about it" thread. While you may disagree with the intentions of a it was not child porn. 
All of their users just seem to believe everything they read there. I know a guy at work that told me "I don't go on Reddit because of all the child porn there." Way to think for yourself.

I get that the legit way of doing it is, well, legit. But I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to fool quite a few non tech-savvy people into giving up their logins for a few bitcents. Of course, there's nothing useful that you can do with somebodies twitter account, but a lot of people use the same password for everything.

I can mine addresses at 21 Mhash/s too. oclvanity tells me 1Connor reaches 50% probability at 10 minutes (I got about 7 in an hour), but 1Rassah is estimated at 10 hours. I wonder why that is.

@_date: 2013-03-15 18:35:24
I was going to include my idea for that, but was typing on my phone.
Bitcoins are sent to an address (one per user, preferably) as a pledge. The total in the pool of addresses for pledges for that specific Kickstarter is converted to USD based on some exchange's current rate. If the goal isn't reached, each user is sent their BTC back. No currency exchanges are made until the kickstarter succeeds.
This method has a problem though; that's pledge reward milestones. If I pledge $20 worth of BTC right now to recieve the $20 reward, but it then drops to $18 worth of BTC, what happens? You get some angry users, that's what.
They could lock reward milestones at the value at the time of the pledge. I hit the $20 mark with BTC, but the value drops to $18 and I still get my reward. 
I'm not sure if it would sense to have the whole system work the way I just said, instead of just reward milestones. If a developer is told they will be getting $15,000 of their $20,000 kickstarter campaign, but then received only $12,000 due to a bitcoin price change, kickstarter might run into trouble.
**TL;DR: Keep BTC as BTC until the campaign is complete. Total the 'current donated' based on current exchange rate. Use time-of-transaction exchange rate for rewards.**

It's more like, we (you, anybody) knows more about it than the average person, and that makes us realize just how 'off' journalists usually are about things. They're probably this wrong about most things that they are told to write about, but we're all home-grown experts.

They could convert them immediately, but then refunds or failed kickstarters become a problem. They could also just factor the current usd value of sent coins into the pledged amount, which will cause it to fluctuate a bit, and then convert to USD after. 
I guess 'pay only if it passes' would have to change for bitcoin users.

I think I got really lucky. I was looking at it Tuesday night and said to myself "I've got a really bad feeling about tomorrow. It's gonna jump $30, and then plummet. I can just feel it." So I put in an order on Bitspend for something I'd been planning on buying for a while that cost about half my BTC, called it a win, and left the rest in my BTC wallet. 
In it for the long run, but also not stupid about it. I mean, I put in about $100 for 3.5 BTC over the course of a few paychecks, so no big deal no matter what happens, but I'm glad I ended up getting something out of it.
