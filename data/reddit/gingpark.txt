I say it is great being stable and the price since I would believe its harder for more people to get into bitcoin if it was too high. Plus thinking it would be better at the moment for merchants who accept since it converts at market price using BTC unit. I encountered lots of people being confusing using different units like mBTC

Had this with BofA, the reverse left no trace for the low end customer service so it kept getting escalated and finally they saw it was into mine and then reversed out to another account. Got $2K cash deposit back because I had a legit receipt and they knew where the cash went. Took about 2 weeks for them to finish investigating and the bank to credit me. 
Many tellers and customer service I have spoke to while all this was happening literally said they were allowed to do such a thing as reversing a cash deposit. Doesn't make sense if you get paid in cash its yours how can the teller have authority to take CASH out without account owner approval. Managers and such definitely knew you cannot reverse cash deposits. 
(In the past there was a Photoshop BofA receipt but since cash deposit shows up online banking instantly and this one didn't show up so knew right away, LBC banned account instantly or they usually just delete their account.)
On the other side I had instant transfer from BofA to BofA has been the best compared to other within bank transfer such as Chase QP *HORRIBLE* and WF *HORRIBLE* 24 hours to show which is more WTF. 
So for BofA ended up with my first lost since "person" disputed that it was fraud "hacked" into another person BofA account and sent the instant transfer money. (I did only do small amounts for instant transfer so didn't lose much.)
Yup learn and change, so no longer using instant transfer method which honestly was great due to the convenience of 24/7 and just not having to go to the bank which is nice cause its always a pain. 
Only takes one to ruining the method to everyone that was honest about which I used for so long.

Agreeing on the usage of lite clients since the blockchain did take forever to download so I used Multibit. 
As of now though I moved over to Armory, since right now can download the blockchain pretty quick and have multiple computers with enough space.
Yes I would definitely recommend new user to use lite client and then go from there just as myself. 
Sort of on the side but I would assume many just using online wallet since its simple and quick...?

Agree with OP, for what I see with panic with price drop is people who bought in with the hype of few articles of get rich quick scheme is over. 
At this point it's the long run for those who believe in bitcoin not concerned about the price as much but the entire community that has been built upon. 
We came from being nothing, no one paid any attention and now there are more and more adoption of the use of bitcoin in many ways than one. Note: Many came together to slay the mighty bearwhale as well right. ;)
For those still investing for the long run as well especially myself I see the drop in price as once again an opportunity to just buy more bitcoin. 
Pretty much you can easily create a better spread if you really bought bitcoin at a high price, and now that you bought bitcoin at a lower price you find your self in a better situation plus that median will turn out better once the cheaper coins you got goes back up in value. 
Overall I believe in the long run people won't have to look at what the value is comparing bitcoin to USD. This chain has to be broke at some point right?

hahah yeah exactly.

$8 and $13 is pretty different from $270-$300 , that is the definitely a change. The amount that people now invest into bitcoin is considerable enough to change peoples life's at this point as well and so we have seen in end of 2013. 
What you are saying is that nothing changed in the fact its volatile right?  
Just seeing movement is what is being pointed out since based on what I have been seeing and working with was a stable price for a considerable amount of time.

Cool, keep up the good work!

Wow that is seriously just beyond words ... pretty much no reason to stick with these. Always been sketchy especially since they say no fees but no idea what their bpi is linked to , always $5+ than bitstamp or bitfinix so at this point it just shows they are selling at a premium.

If considering the price of current market yeah I guess but then again just as bitcoin came into existence would it be that hard to imagine ways to reduce the cost of what you are giving an example as alternative - solar energy.
Just the fact as well we have bitcoin coming in at practically valueless to something many many believe it to be going to be worth more than it is currently. So in that regard if the price of bitcoin goes up enough would that mean everyone will then consider it? 
And mentioning USD, isn't the cost increasing endlessly to print more money each year with a more likely lesser chance of the cost being reduced?
Plus instead of selling all the current bitcoin at market price for growth, most stuff comes from additional new investment for growth is it not? I just mentioned alternative energy which could mean anything that could produce electricity at a lower cost overall since without mining where would bitcoin be?  
If our traditional methods are that much better, why bother with bitcoin just stick with USD or something right? If we are willing to consider changes especially as mentioned from something worthless to something that is worth billions... is it really impossible to move away from our current means of energy production which majority is harmful to the human environment and go towards what is better? Can there really be no win win situation in this regard?
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:42:57
Always been wondering, would this make alternative energy growth faster? Pay one time for them and free electricity? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:53:12
Yeah that is one of the reason why I have been using Circle each week but just checked and now it is saying I can buy again .... at $312.

How many times have people assume the final straw for bitcoin and it came out to not being so? The future is unpredictable, so yes it may but what guarantee does anyone have that it's the end. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:35:50
yup can't agree more
