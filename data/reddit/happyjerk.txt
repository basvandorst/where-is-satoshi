That's why Bitcoin will fail and every 3 weeks somebody is going to steal millions of dollars in Bitcoins and nobody will be able to do shit about it.  Enjoy playing your retarded little game.

This is what cognitive dissonance sounds like.  I wonder how many more millions of Bitcoins need to just disappear into the night before people realize what the fuck is going on.

yeah you're lucky that happened before they got stolen.  everybody makes money in a bubble, but a lot of people get fucked too.

You realize that behind all technology is a person, right?  There is somebody that holds the keys.  You would have to be an extremely naive idiot to think that the whole Bitcoin thing from beginning to end was completely automated with absolutely no way of being influenced by people. Even if it looked that way from the outside, you would have had to trust whoever created the structure didn't create an opening for themselves.  
And guess what - it wasn't automated.  There was an opening for people to fuck with it.  And fuck with it they did.  Spectacularly.  I knew Bitcoin was going to fail because it was liable to become meddled with by people, but I didn't think they would be so brazen as to just steal ALL OF IT so early in the game.

You act like Bitcoin is a separate thing with a mind and method of its own.  It's not.  Everything is controlled by people and you need a centralized institution to regulate any kind of currency.  There has literally never been a currency without some kind of centralized institution.  And in this case, the centralized institution wasn't "incompetent" - it was evil - the whole thing was set up to take your doillars and they did.

The fact that the main exchange of Bitcoins failed and took everybody's Bitcoins with it doesn't make you think there might be something wrong with Bitcoin?  Wow. Talking with you people is just like talking with religious fundamentalists, except that religious fundamentalists admit that they might be wrong.  I really don't think any amount of evidence can convince you people.

Bitcoins don't have any inherent "value."  They only have value because morons on the internet pay for them.  Same reason fiat currency has value.  The difference is that fiat currency is regulated by a government organization that has some standards and transparency whereas Bitcoins are complete anarchy.

Read my post again.  No matter how "evil" governments are, at least they can't just keep all your money and disappear into the night like the Silk Road and MtGox did.  Governments being bad doesn't mean that anonymous people on the internet are being good, but at least you know who the people in the government are.

still a lot more stable than bitcoin

blah blah blah cognitive dissonance.

No they actually succeeded.  Their plan was to take your money and they did.  The only humans who failed were people who believed in Bitcoin.

Governments "printing" money are still much more reliable than Bitcoin.  People who hate on fiat currency protest that the currency has lost 50% of its value over a 70-year period, but somehow don't have a problem with something like Bitcoin, whose price doubles and then falls by a third over the course of weeks.
