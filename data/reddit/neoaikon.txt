well I can actually buy the stuff they have for prizes with less Bitcoin than it would take CC tokens

Nopecoin for me, I already feed them a crap ton of personal data just for the 'privilege' of easily connecting with friends and family. But no, I will not give them that

I bet the person who wrote that felt immensely prophetic when they saw bitcoin appear.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:00:27
I had the same thing happen, I had 19 bitcoins at one point. What could have been...

Its vision is based on market fluctuations!

On one hand I agree with you since I have heard/read stories, a lot of stories; My personal experience with them has been great, I got some free XLM and didn't know about the memo thing and left it blank. One support ticket and two weeks later I had my XLM in my portfolio properly, so that was a great experience.

I just cropped this and made it my background at work so people think I'm a l33t b1tc01n h as well ^__^

But will we still be using C/C++ in a millennia?
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:55:21
I don't understand what the person behind this latest crap is in it for. Anyone who knows anything about bitcoin knows that unless you can sign a message with the genesis key know one will take them seriously...so they're either incompetent or they're trying to sucker in a bunch of idiots for a scam or something.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:06:27
Are multiple scammers just copying and pasting after each other? Or is it the same ring? I've seen so many scams lately with this EXACT wording so I'm genuinely curious
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:28:20
Oh god, why does this happen a week before I get paid! Don't worry guys, come Friday of next week we'll be back over 10k if fate gives me the finger like usual XD lmao.

I took 100 USD and bought like 19 Bitcoin, then I used that to get 1/8th of medical grade cannabis. I regret it from an investment perspective but I did it because I wanted to use Bitcoin as a currency. I wasn't thinking about my future at the time.

The density of this statement is immense, like seriously it's called *MONEY* Laundering, and ALSO cash came before bitcoin you stupid munchkin! /rant
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:57:46
This was an art piece that sold for a lot of money IIRC.
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:58:27
Dude......she went to western union first where they probably wouldn't process the money order because they can recognize a money order scam, and because Mr. Nigerian Prince has her on hook she says they're 'unfriendly' and wouldn't help her' to OP; but WU was trying to protect her! Then she gets told by the scammers to do it via bitcoin because they realized the money order wasn't going to happen.  
  
This is as classic scam as those "send 1 ETH get 10 ETH" scams you see!  
  
My uncle sent over 10 grand to some woman he doesn't even know, my cousin had to get power-of-attorney or else he would have kept sending her money orders! All on the promise that she would 'eventually' send it back to him, she just needed a bit more to cover those 'fees'.

You'd be better off mining Verium on your PC and Electroneum on your Mobile and then selling those for Bitcoins, and even then you're going to spend more than $20 in electricity to do it.

Ah yes, the famous Missile-Command graph
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:18:31
This chart is more coherent than that XD but it's a very good attempt for sure

The guy in the time traveler post said that .01 BTC in his time was enough for a lifetime so if you have more than that you're set. XD
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:48:59
You didn't blur out the scammers number and now I'm really really tempted to mess with him. Other than that, this is delicious
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:18:38
That video was the sound of him shitting his credibility in the toilet and by this time next year (after this **DOESN'T** happen) you'll get to hear the flush!  
  
I'd be fucking amazed if a codebase with that many eyes on it had a flaw so fatal and it had been overlooked for 11 years.
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:43:38
I actually just want a used Tesla, and I probably won't be selling bitcoin to get it I'll probably just take out a loan and make payments while hodling the crypto as a sort of insurance against my dumbass self. I don't really have a lot of crypto anyway, I'm mostly a collector
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:50:01
I'm sure your realize this by now but the reason the people at Western Union were 'unfriendly' is because they'd had training in recognizing money order scams. Ever been to a Walmart? Go to the customer service desk and they'll have a billboard detailing things to watch out for :( I feel really bad for that old lady and it's upsetting to me that they prey on the elderly like this

It has the cryptographic power of one million Ian Malcolm's.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:58:13
In Spokane, WA nonetheless...is there a strong interest in crypto there? I wouldn't have guessed it
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:14:36
I like the profit taking approach of **Z% every Zx**, so for example if your preferred Z was say 5, that'd be 5% every 5x. You can adjust it how you like, it's just worked out for me.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:15:25
What does he expect to look like when this doesn't happen? And I'd be astounded if a codebase with so many eyes on it had a flaw so fatal and its been overlooked for 11 years.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:47:03
I got this email and surprisingly I had like $3 of bitcoin on there from 2017! I didn't even remember I'd had it
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:24:46
I'm more of a fan of math that includes long division because one of the numbers is in a hut.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:38:31
That's not how open source works you fuckwit. SHUT. UP! You can't make something open source and then retroactively claim copyright or anything over it. This guy has lost his marbles!!
