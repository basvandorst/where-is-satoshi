Look at us. We used to buy things with our money. Now we buy money with money ����
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:34:29
Use PayPal. If you have a bank account. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:16:00
Bitbay.net is good. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:25:32
Yeah! You’ll go to jail before turning 18 for the rest of your life! And your dad will enjoy all your bitcoin money. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:55:15
I bought yesterday and might buy more today. My gut telling me no matter if it keeps dropping it will go back up, higher n higher.

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:17:46
Point is, don’t catch feelings. Bitcoin will ride you like a bitch and throw you away like garbage. Yes totally right it’s a roller coaster! We’re here for the thrill and who knows what this will be in 1, 5, 10 years but I believe this is the future and might just hit BIG! Be patient and stay on edge my friends!
