Yes, in the long run this won't be a problem. But in the short run, coinbase is still pretty much the first place beginners hear about. A lot of people will be burned before coinbase stops being the first-stop for most beginners. Markets don't work instantaneously, and markets work better when the individual actors in them are working better.

What about the idea that privacy is only complete if it's in the base layer? If you use tumble bit or zero link, you still run the risk of accidentally associating your private addresses with your phobic or otherwise known addresses. You also aren't completely safe from analysis on transaction amounts. If you pay someone a particular amount, and only one combination of transactions happens around the same time with around the same amount, your transaction can be deanonymized. This will be harder with lightning, but there may be sophisticated techniques to do it.
On the other hand, if privacy is built into the base layer, you don't need to ever worry about that kind of deanonymization analysis (only holes in the base layer's privacy model)

Look at Russia as an example. Putin likes crypto, but the central bankers don't. A government is made of individuals, and many of those individuals are investing in bitcoin. In Ukraine, a few dozen politicians declared about 21,000 btc. 
While "government" as a single entity shouldn't like it's money creation powers to be threatened, in reality there are much more complex power dynamics at work. And because there's so much money to be made in bitcoin, even many bankers want it. 
They'll try to support bitcoin until the last moment, and just before it's too late, they'll sell everything and try to kill it knowing they sold at the tippy top. What they don't realize is that it's *already* too late.

I've thought through sharding myself, because it seemed like an exciting way to scale. But I came to the conclusion that any kind of sharding necessarily splits the hash power, and thus the security. So yes you can do sharding, but it means that you need to multiply the hashpower of the network by the number of shards in order to retain the same security. That is a huge scalability problem. 
Proof of Stake I'm less certain about the issues for, but I haven't read anything that convinces me that a PoS or hybrid system solves problems like nothing-at-stake. They all seem to involve some kind of quorum system where a group of miners choose the next set of miners. That kind of system is bound to lead to centralization since by definition it's creating a centralized group who then can exercise their power to maximize their potential of controlling the next chosen centralized group.
How do you think those problems could be solved?


More transactions isn't really what I meant by "more use". By design, ethereum uses a lot more transactions to do what it does. But these transactions aren't all monetary transactions. These are dapps running that might have nothing to do with money. Number of transactions is not the appropriate metric. A better metric would be the volume (total value) of transactions. 


You're right, it seems I misread.

Love the Olympus server! Does this follow any standard set of protocols? Does any standard exist? If not you should create a set of protocols as a separate github repo so other projects can implement interpretable integrations or their own implementations.
One thing i think might be very helpful to add is a lightning node rating system, where users who can prove they have a lightning channel open with someone can rate that channel based on events like forced closure, attempted channel theft, and uptime statistics so that info can be used by the network to chose (or decide against choosing) a channel partner. It would also be useful for rating Olympus nodes themselves, eg if an Olympus node promised to store some info or watch for channel theft and doesn't, that should be reported so people know to avoid that bad actor.

I like the idea of auto-topup. If you have a mobile lightning wallet, your home lightning wallet could refill your mobile wallet whenever you turn your computer on. 
Autosaving what? Could you elaborate?
Payment requests already exist in lightning clients.
By "security amounts" do you mean number of confirmations your wallet waits for to day an on chain transaction is complete?

The realization of fee issues. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:47:27
I've been told some miners even accept conflicting transactions where the original *wasn't* rbf, as long as the fee rate is higher, some miner will take it 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:59:29


The fee level wouldn't be the same. Because there's more blockspace in bch, the fee levels would be drastically lower. If there was only 900kb in legit transactions per block, fees would be almost 0 anyway. You need more transactions than blockspace in order to even have the economic imperative for fees. 
But spam transactions aren't even effective at increasing fees. If you were a miner who wanted to fill the blocks with spam to increase fees, you'd have to spend more money on fees (or lose more money by forgoing real transactions) than you'd make in additional fees. This kind of thing can't permanently or even semi-permanently increase fees - fees will go down almost as soon as the spam stops. So there's never any reason to spam. 
So disregarding the idea of spam (since spam isn't even likely to exist in bitcoin because of the high cost of creating spam), it takes 8 times the demand to bring bch to the same fee level as bitcoin. That's what I was talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:34:03


I don't think that's true. Why do you think that's true? If there's not enough money, the value of money grows filling any gap. Because of that, growth of monetary supply is never needed.


Japan's lost decade is a loss of working-age population - like the US will be going through with the aging baby boomers but way worse. It has nothing to do with monetary issues - any monetary issues are just symptoms of a deeper problem.


True, but the difference is it will stop and its increase is 100% predictable, unlike inflation of the US dollar for example.

I don't think it's true that fee estimation is currently based solely off the mempool. The block information is already available to anyone. Won't miners just continue business as usual accepting their own feeless transactions, cpfp, and externally accelerated transactions making the "lowest fee" recorded in the block meaningless?

It doesn't seem like graphene is bcash specific. Cash shuffle seems cool, but doesn't hold a candle to the privacy offered by monero. Can't quickly find anything about what re-enabling opcodes is about. 


Despite the warnings that it has never been safe. 6 confirmations has always been the standard for safety. 1 conf if you don't expect you might be paid by a miner. 0 conf is basically safety in numbers. Someone will get robbed, but most people won't. 


Yes, but 1 confirmation for any block time is better than 0 conf.

Love the art! Very good intro material.
Some constructive feedback:
* on mobile (android chrome), scrolling down scrolls the images sideways, which is really annoying cause half the time i end up on image 2 before I've read image 1 after scrolling down to the next one.
* The double spending problem is *not* solved by a public ledger and quorum-style consensus. Its the proof of work that solves double spending. And in fact every individual either validates that a transaction happened or delegates that validation (using spv), so any block violating the "consensus rules" can be individually rejected by that one node even if no one else rejects it. That is also a powerful way to be your own bank - having agency in the rules you accept.
* Correction: a bitcoin address is the only piece of info you need to receive bitcoin, but you need your private key to *send* bitcoin. One of the images says your bitcoin address is all you need to send or receive which isn't true.

Could you point to any of those developments in block propagation, privacy , or smart contracts? 
If privacy is your goal, why not monero? If you want sophisticated smart contracts, why  not ethereum or rootstock? 
0-conf isn't safe because nothing stops miners from making the most profitable choice and replacing conflicting transactions if one has a higher fee rate. But if it was safe, why couldn't you do it in litecoin? Litecoin doesn't have RBF either. 
A coin needs to have a differentiating factor from other coins, otherwise it simply won't last. Bcash doesn't have any major differentiating factor.

15x? Over what time frame are you talking? A year? There have only been a handful of years since bitcoin got started, so what's you point? 


That's not how investing works. You invest because you think that investment will be worth more in the future. Right now literally doesn't matter for an investment other than insofar as it affects its future value. 


The OP is talking about price. You're talking about price. Of course I'm not going to just interject with off-topic BS. Don't be a troll.


Sure, that, but also people using it for international remittances, people using it to buy houses and cars. Before the fee madness, there was enormous growth of adoption in businesses accepting bitcoin. It doesn't matter what percent of the users are speculators if the *real* users are actually growing as well. And they are. 


Oh yeah. We'll *never* get to as high (adoption, price, etc) as we got in 2013..... Its sad that no one ever returned to bitcoin...


So you expect a crash to last year's all time high before running up to $100k? Is that what you're telling me? 


Dude. Can you please slow your roll? You never asked me about the technology til just now. Quit acting unpleasant.
But now that you've asked about the technology. What's happened in the last year? Segwit was adopted, showing the success of a UASF, the first lightning network clients have been built, RBF, numerous performance improvements have been made, among others (you can see in the release notes on github). 


That's exactly what I did. But some people don't have major savings and prefer to invest as they go from each paycheck. 


Lol, ok. I doubt it but I'm not gonna play the "I'm better than you cause I've been around longer" card. I've been around long enough that I don't care how long you've been around.

You have a point. Imagine the cell phone tho. How many generations did it take for that to reach granparents etc? Maybe half a generation? And you don't have to have a cell phone. You can live without one. Cell phones didn't make land lines less usable. 
But if bitcoin really succeeds, it will destroy the traditional currencies. The value of fiat currencies like the dollar and securities like govt bonds will plummet. If you don't switch before then, you stand to lose a ton of money/value. I believe there will be a kind of "flippening" where people are compelled by market forces to switch, with dire consequences if they don't. This is where Bitcoin is different from something like the cell phone or internet.

Well of course. But I was musing on what might have lead to the slow of new money coming in. 


Again, that's not how markets work. People invest on the future, not the now. Segwit being adopted promised lots of great things for bitcoin, including LN, sidechains, and schnorr. Its entirely plausible that this breached the threshold of doubt for some people. 
But I don't think the price run up is anything more than more people becoming comfortable with the idea of bitcoin. Markets are nowhere near instantaneous when the market actors take a shitload of time to become informed. The likelihood is bitcoin would be increasing in value regardless of any material progress in the technology, because more and more people are coming to understand the power of the technology that was there 5-10 years ago, and the power of the idea. 


Ya dude, me too. To your point, its only run up 15x a handleful of times, so I don't understand why you think you can extrapolate from a handful of data points. You got lucky in 2013, and you might get lucky again this time. But if you think we're at the top here now, I think you might not.

You don't need to rewrite one day. A double-spend can be done in 6 blocks pretty much anywhere bitcoin is taken. Some exchanges don't even require more than 1 confirmation. 


First of all, the difficulty reseting does not make it more (or less) difficult to do a 51% attack. If you have 51% of the hashpower, you mine 51% of the blocks, regardless of the difficulty.
Second of all, the difficulty would almost definitely go *down* during a 51% attack, because less blocks are being mined into the chain. If your prospective attacker has 51%, and the rest of the network has 49%, once the attacker starts orphaning all the honest blocks, it will look to the chain as if 49% of the hashpower dropped out of the game. So I'm not sure what your point is about the difficulty, but I don't think its a valid one. 


What does this mean? Why does the attacker care about this? The blocks that they are trying to erase would obviously not be blocks that the attacker has mined, so they aren't losing anything. Only honest miners lose the energy they used mining blocks if their blocks become orphaned in a reorg.
You're right that a 51% attack is hard, but none of your points make sense as far as I can tell.

Nope. Look at the price graph on a logarithmic scale. It'll be a lot clearer what's going on: the same thing that has happened dozens of times before:  . Bitcoin's value is still 1/100th of what it will be in 10 years - that hasn't changed (except that it's gotten closer to realizing that value). 


Don't pretend to understand bitcoin if you think this is all just hype...


Except meteoric growth in user-base and awareness, and huge advances in the technology? 


That's not a strategy. That's called hindsight. 


This isn't confusion. These people, like me, believe that a bitcoin will be worth over $1 million. Rather than buying every day, they're buying periodically during dips to maximize their purchase. 
You clearly don't understand why bitcoin is revolutionary technology. So rather than writing snarky comments that imply you know sooo much more than everyone, how about asking questions about how bitcoin works and why its going to be so big? Just because you don't understand doesn't mean its all hype.

Would it tho? What's the scenario where that solves the problem? If most mining is done using ASICs (which is the only way that an economically motivated 51% attack wouldn't be a problem), then everyone has to use GPU mining or something until new ASICs can be built. That would massively reduce the hashrate and therefore massively compromise the chain's security. Whatever nation state attacker did the 51% attack would have a much easier time then attacking again in the meantime. What am I missing?

@_date: 2019-07-14 21:14:31


Its more like two banks keeping track of loans between them (remember, in bitcoin, you are your own bank). They do this by creating a contract that says "each person must put 100 mbtc into a jointly owned 3rd party trust account". Once they've actually put the money into that trust, they also make contracts that say "I authorize the trust to pay the other guy 100 mbtc one week after this is received". That way, if one of the partners goes AWOL, the other partner can go to the trust account and submit the authorization, and after a week would get their money back. But partners aren't expected to be AWOL for long.
If one of them wants to pay their channel partner 10 mbtc, they create a new contract that says "invalidate those last contracts, and instead, I authorize the trust to pay other guy 110 mbtc one week after this is received". Their channel partner does the reciprocal, changing 100 mbtc to 90 mbtc. 
If the one that paid 10 mbtc then goes to the trust and submits the out-of-date authorization for 100 mbtc, the other channel partner can submit their new authorization that invalidates the old one to get their money. 
But the lightning network does that via atomic cryptographic contracts, rather than legal contracts. And there's no 3rd party trust, its just a multi-sig address that requires signatures from both parties. Then you have atomic ways to pay across many channels to people you don't have a direct channel with. More for you to learn ; )

The problem is that coinbase is basically a perfect storm. They're using bitcoin supporters against bitcoin. Their popularity as an exchange is being exploited to do this. They make their customers pay the miner fees so this attack literally costs them nothing, not even opportunity cost because they have more customers than they can handle. And they make those fees particularly high which drives up perception of fees higher. If i didn't know better, it really would seem like the plan of an evil genius. A government isn't gonna come up with a plan this diabolical. And likely this is the only era this plan would work in. Eventually coinbase will actually start losing money by screwing their customers over like this, but it might take a while.

When considering technologies with network effects, it's hard to simply be "outcompeted". You need to build a network with massively more desirable properties for people to switch.

A channel doesn't run out of Bitcoin, it can only become unbalanced, where the coins in the channel are all available to pay you money but not available for you to pay others with.

China contains mining operations and pools that collectively have more than [70% of the total Bitcoin hahpower]( This absolutely should be concerning to anyone who wants Bitcoin to succeed. Having greater than 50% of the hashpower in a dictatorial country certainly doesn't feel like a safe situation. 
A lot of people on here mentioned that mining pools don't own the hashpower, and that pool miners can switch away if they notice something nefarious is happening. That's true. However, users would not notice anything immediately. This would let the mining pool double-spend over 6 blocks before any of their pool miners know.
In fact, pool miners would only know if the pool miner that mined the block told everyone else and proved they mined the block. And for that, the pool miner would have to know that their machine did it. I would be very surprised if there was any software that made it clear that your machine mined the block for your pool. Its possible that the pool operator could take the block, send it somewhere else and make it seem like some unrelated entity mined the block. That would let the pool operators get off scott free with a double-spend attack, and none of the pool miners would know the wiser - even the pool miner that mined the block and *should* know the truth if they bothered to monitor at what their machine was doing. But pool miners don't bother. They just let it run.
So no, mining isn't magically safer because its a mining pool.

It comes from a misunderstanding of the kinds of decentralization that are important. Not all types have important consequences.

Bisq really does need help. I just downloaded and played around with the program as it stands. It has a large number of annoying UI quirks, and its laggy as balls at like 1 frame per second. Worst of all, the important information you need when you're trying to make or take a trade isn't there. Namely what transactions will be created, where the mining fees are going, where the security deposit will go, where the trading fee will go. This is just unusable for someone who wants to know their first trade on Bisq isn't being sucked down a sync hole. 
And the fees are too high. Even tho they're apparently using  to get fee info, they're changing 10 times as much for fees than they should. Paying 1 satoshi per byte is expected to get your transaction into the first, second, or 3rd block. That's pretty damn quick. So why is Bisq charging more than a dollar just for mining fees when it should be like 10 cents? And I see no way of changing the mining fee myself. Since it doesn't even tell me an estimate of how many bytes the transaction(s?) will be, I have no way of knowing what number of satoshis per byte its trying to use either. 
Bisq is still just way WAY too hard to understand. It really needs massive UI simplification. Please find a good UI designer.

That doesn't sound right to me. Coordination of a signature wouldn't have a time limit.

Well the fact is that it does mean it's safer. The type of security you're talking about when you talk about hiding technical details from potential hackers is called "security by obscurity" and is considered by computer security professionals to be worse than nothing, because it gives a false sense of security without actually offering any actual security.
Skillful people can tear down a device and learn how it works by probing it and physically examining it. Keeping details like the firmware and hardware structure secret makes life only slightly harder for attackers, but it makes life impossible for honest onlookers and would be code auditors. Transparency in security techniques minimizes the likelihood of errors, which is ultimately where all security holes come from. It's orders of magnitude more difficult to find errors when most people can't see the code. 
Ever been to a restaurant with an open Kitchen? Ever notice how much cleaner they are then closed back room kitchens? Same thing applies with code. The light of day is a powerful healer.


That is absolutely not what they said. They said the problem can be mitigated with a password. They also described how the device is **not** useless without a password since an attacker can only obtain part of the seed, not the whole thing. What they did say is that using a password can protect against almost *any* honest hardware security hole, and everyone should be using a passphrase *regardless* of this issue.


They thanked ledger multiple times throughout they're response. I'd say they are glad and have credit where credit is due.


What in Earth makes you think they're not? That's literally what they do day in and day out.


Doing similar tests is not sufficient. Novel tests must be done to harden security, and you get many more novel stresses when more people can see and find problems in the code. This should be the most obvious case why open source security is better. Ledger's Discovery of this problem probably wouldn't have happened if the hardware wasn't open source.

Since the LN is particularly good for small payments, I feel like it might make sense for nodes to share information about current channel capacity up to a point. For example, letting other nodes know it has at least $50 of capacity doesn't really put it at much risk. Also a spy node can get much more information simply by sending a larger payment through a particular node (to themselves) - then they know the channel contains at least enough for that payment. I don't see why keeping information about small balances private really matters.

Of course they did.. 


No, we must not. Every BIP is a new plan. The white paper isn't all there is.

That's not true. Ant miner s9s are ~~$135~~ [$350]( each and run 13 TH/s. That means that you could manufacture the current hashrate of 80 million TH/s with $2.15 billion. They would be spending some money on energy and other things too, but that would be more than half offset by their earnings, which would be less than $20 million per day. So that's less than $2.17 billion to control the chain for a day.
And if you consider that cloud mining services could in the future allow people to rent profitable hash power on the fly, in that case a 6-block reorg would currently cost $810,000 to pull off.  Even 100 times that much is only $81 million. Is that enough security against a nation state?

If anyone gets access to your old state, chances are they have access to your private keys for that channel, since they should be protected in the same way (encrypted on disk, in plain in memory). In fact, your old state should actually be **better** protected because it has no reason to be in memory. 
So who cares if your worst enemy has your old state if they also probably have your keys and can steal not only the whole channel, but all coins associated with that key?
I'm worried that eltoo does not provide enough incentive against cheating. Imagine a channel with 100 bitcoins in it (a lot i know but it's just for numerical convenience so just run with it). If channel partner A started with 50 bitcoins on their side, and then transferred 40 of them away, they could steal those 40 back by publishing their prior commitment at an opportune time, however they would only really stand to lose two transaction fees. If the chance of success was higher than 1 in 100,000 it would be worth it to try.

In what circumstance does your attacker know the total channel balance? Seems like if they know that, they're likely to know your individual balances too.


I'm curious why not. If you have a lightning channel, its safe to assume the total channel balance is significantly higher than on-chain fees. So every attacker knows that every channel has some minimum total balance. Going the tiny step further and saying that your personal channel balance is something in that range doesn't seem like it offers anyone any valuable information.
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:55:22
I find it a little strange so much attention is focused on energy use when PoW is an intrinsically costly process, regardless of whether energy makes up a significant part of that cost. Like, more power efficient chips might reduce energy use in mining, but it won't reduce the total *cost* of mining because the cost is where the security comes from. 
The question i have for people is, how much mining cost is enough to be reasonably sure the system is secure? Is spending $100,000 per block (almost $20 million per day) enough now? What about if bitcoin became the dominant world currency? How much would be enough then? Remember that at some point transaction fees will become the majority of the mining reward, and so higher security in the form of higher mining rewards will translate directly to higher fees.

That just isn't true. You could argue custodial storage is safer than something a non-technical person could set up, as long as the custodian is trustworthy and competent. 
But you say you would argue that.. why don't you lay out your argument? What's your reasoning? 


Look, I agree that most people probably can't safely create, store, and backup their own wallet keys as well as a business can. However, a business can never be trusted forever. Businesses have an enormous number of points of failure, and that leads to tons of company's losing their customers' data and getting hacked. Are the exchanges you mentioned even built properly for secure use? How susceptible to social engineering are they? How do you know they won't pull an exit scam like other changes have before them (mtgox, crypsy, etc etc)?
Its easy enough to get a hardware wallet and back up the seed. One day we'll have better solutions for normal people that make it easy to trustlessly back up and store your coin while also not having a single point of failure (if you forget your password, lose your seed, etc). Custodial wallets are just not safe enough to trust usually, and anyone trusting them will find out the hard way eventually.

Please [source]( factual assertions like that, so people can easily check your facts and also have a ton more context around what you're talking about (enormously reduces misunderstandings). Bitmain may have mines set up around the world, but it's highly unlikely any of those mines are sufficiently independent from the company headquarters. If the Chinese government has the ability to make jihan run custom bitcoin software in China, they have the ability to make him run it in Washington state and any other place in the world too.


Yes i agree. But it doesn't change the fact that a single company is a single point of failure.

Hmm, I think I see. You're saying the SIGHASH_ALL opcode is used in the funding transaction, and so wouldn't know what outputs to put into a SIGHASH_ALL directive, since those haven't been created yet.
Wouldn't it be possible tho to create an opcode that authorizes spending of any UTXO created with a particular ID, for example? Then as long as all your future commitments are created with that same ID, I would think that would have the same relevant capabilities as SIGHASH_NOINPUT, but wouldn't have the possibility of accidentally applying to an unrelated transaction that happened to have an output of the same value.


Right. Public keys work. Is an ECDH exchange risky in some way?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:03:20
Custodial wallets are a bad idea. Your bitcoins are not insured, and the company can lose or steal them, as has happened many times before. 
You point out that a vulnerability exists in a hardware wallet, but the irony is that custodial wallets have far less security even than a vulnerable trezor, since a vulnerable trezor relies on a password and so does a custodial wallet.

Most important thing is to securely back up your wallet seed in multiple locations. This isn't the easiest thing to do with maximum security and reliability. 
This article isn't perfect (in particular, ignore the part about exporting private keys in the "text" section, that's a terrible idea, and turning off your computers internet temporarily doesn't make it that much safer) but it has a lot of good info:
Make sure your using a wallet with an HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet, so all you need to do is back up your seed once. Most good wallets use that, including hardware wallets, electrum, and bitcoin core wallet.

I read a few more malleability articles and I don't thing I quite understand still. It sounds like there is something about multisig where the second signer can (or always?) change(s) the hash (ie txid) and the fix is to move the signatures elsewhere? 
I still don't quite get this because if your protocol requires both signatures to sign the same exact transaction, then it wouldn't be possible to craft a situation where the signatures are both still valid  even tho the message (and thus the hash) has changed. What am I missing?

I don't understand why SIGHASH_ALL can't also be used. Why is spending any input required? Can't the input be specified in every new commitment transaction (tho that might mean you actually need n new commitment transactions if you can only specify one input, which shouldn't be a problem, right?)


Couldn't we just not do that simplest thing then? Seems like coordinating a secret key isn't that hard between two channel partners.

Bitcoin's userbase has gone up by 740% the last 36 months. Metcalf's law says the value of a network like this grows by the square of its users. That means bitcoin's network value has grown by 5,400% in those months. And actually bitcoin's value has increased 4000% in the last 36 months. Bitcoin is still hugely undervalued despite the hype.

It sounds like the main benefit here are CT (which could be added to bitcoin), shorter confirmation times, and issued assets. 
As far as shorter confirmation times, is 2 minutes similar to waiting an hour on bitcoin for 6 confirmations, or is that 2 minutes equivalent to a single confirmation? What's the security assumptions there?
As for issued assets, I'm wondering how this compares to using cross chain atomic swaps. I'm also wondering if it's possible to build something like DAI on top of the liquid network. Would be nice to have issued assets done in a decentralized way, rather than having to trust a single issuer/auditor pair.

Intelligent in the sense of having the long view. Understanding the implications of this technology. If you're the type of person who can see the implications of Bitcoin on our world 15 years from now, Bitcoin favors you.


True for now. But some people (eg Andreas Antonopoulos) believe that the level of security we need has already been met, in which case as bitcoin's value grows, the total block reward can be kept the same. As more transactions move off-chain and as the maximum blocksize rises, this will mean for the same amount of security we have today, we'll need to pay vanishingly smaller fees. 


We're talking intelligent **people** here, not an intelligent hive mind. The intelligent people I'm talking about, again, are those that take the 15 year long view. They're valuing bitcoin *now* at the value it will have 15 years from now. The intelligent people know that the tech isn't ready for global adoption now, and rising fees are a result of that. But these same people know that the tech will improve by leaps and bounds and they want to be a part of that revolution. 


If its greedy to try to make yourself better off and help other people be better off, count me greedy. I think the intelligent ones want to benefit from Bitcoin's rise just as much as the bandwagoners. The difference is that the intelligent ones know to hold on because they know where the cards will fall. 


I agree there's a lot of speculative mania, but its being fueled by *intellectual* mania around bitcoin's technology. If I were to guess, I'd say there is a far bigger percentage of bitcoin "investors" that understand and believe in the technology than there were in dot-com companies. The intelligent ones see the light. Everyone else will see the light when bitcoin's resilience to manipulation becomes proven by years of actual use.

@_date: 2017-12-13 23:29:23
What do you mean by "backed"? Backed in the context of currencies usually means there is something that currency is redeemable for regardless of the state of the market. Like, a gold-backed dollar could literally be redeemed for 1.5g of gold, no matter what the price of gold was measured by anything else (francs, silver, etc). "Backed by" in this context means exactly the same thing as "pegged to". Gold-backed dollars were pegged to a weight of gold. Cuban Pesos that are pegged to the US dollar can be said to be "backed by" the dollar. 
In this context, its clear that US dollars aren't pegged to anything (except in the jurisdictions that peg their currency to the dollar), and same is true for bitcoin. 


The US doesn't have to "go poof" for the dollar to diminish in value. In fact, over the last 40 years, each dollar has lost 75% of its value. And what is the US going to do if the value of the dollar collapses? They're certainly not going to give people gold for their dollars. And the only other way to prop up the value of the dollar is to destroy dollars. Who's going to let them destroy their dollars to prop up the value? No one. "Trust in institutions" is meaningless unless those institutions will do something in the case of currency collapse.

It's possible to use a hardware wallet with lightning, so keys would not actually be on the machine.

Yeah, a 51% attack is easy to detect. But its not easy to detect when someone has &gt; 50% of the hashpower and *not* attacking (yet). Detecting a 51% attack is great and all, but the attack has already succeeded at that point.


Thanks. Sometimes its not clear what people are referring to. There's lots to find, but often what I find won't be what someone else is referring to.
In any case, there's lots of press about certain people saying certain things. But such-and-such person or department head saying "china will ban bitcoin mining" or something like that is not the same thing as them being "in the process" of banning miners. Also, all these articles are from April, and I don't see anything more recent.

Malleability was the ability for certain parts of transactions to be changed after being signed. This made the lightning network design more complicated and less optimized (tho I'd have to do more research to be able to tell you exactly why). 
This malleability was fixed for segwit transactions (and I think only segwit transactions) along with all the changes the September update. Malleability could have been fixed in a hard fork without segwit, which is what many bcash supporters wanted to happen. But this wasn't acceptable to most of the bitcoin community.

While gold can't really be destroyed without a particle accellerator, a PC can be destroyed pretty easily. Data loss can happen even if you're trying to back it up. Keys to bitcoins are also often encrypted and so simply finding a wallet file isn't going to give you the bitcoins unless you also have the password. I just don't think the cases where someone's gonna find an uncorrupted unencrypted bitcoin private key is going to be anywhere near common enough to be comparable to gold mining.

I have considered that. Miner's can certainly create free spam when the blocks aren't full, but when they are full, any transaction they create is fees they don't receive. It costs the same to a miner to send spam as it does to a non miner. The only difference is for a non-miner its a normal cost, and to a miner its an opportunity cost.

This isn't the case. Anyone that needs to make more than 2 transactions this month can save on transction fees by opening a channel. This is true no matter how large the transaction fees are. The more people do this, the less load there will be onchain, and fees will go down for everyone. 


No disputing that. However, clearly we're nowhere near to "everyone in the world" using bitcoin at the moment, or even in the near future. We probably have 1/1000th or 1/10,000th of the world using bitcoin at the moment, if that, which drops that 133mb number to 133kb or 13kb. The lightning network will save us when it comes. 


Where are you getting that 3 transactions/year/user number? Is that an average? Is that data even available? There are certainly people doing many more than 3 transactions per *month* not to mention per year. Lots of traders clogging up the pipes. They'd all be smart to use the LN, saving tons on fees. This drives onchain traffic and thus fees way down (remember the relationship between fees and number of transactions is non-linear).

The same is true for a trezor tho. You have to ensure your firmware is good, otherwise you're keys can be compromised. This is why on a trezor they ensure that all device memory (potentially storing your keys) is fully wiped before new firmware is installed, so a thief can't just install different firmware to take your keys. I believe trezors also warn you if the firmware you're installing isn't signed by them. Not sure if that warning is generated by the previous firmware version before it's overwritten or if that's done in the hardware itself
But to repeat, the single most important thing with a hardware wallet is to ensure you're installing the firmware you think you're installing and that it's from a trusted source.

I suppose you could put it like that. Its more like a chain where, for example, you give a check to your connection A, and then A gives a check for the same amount to its connection B, then B gives a check for the same amount to the destination D. And this is done in a way where the whole chain of checks is either all valid or none are valid (so that it isn't possible for someone like B to lose their money).

@_date: 2017-12-31 00:20:34
It almost definitely won't. Economically, each high fee could only possibly increase the total fee market by a fraction of that fee. This necessitates that any onchain spam transactions cost more than could be made from doing it.
Imagine a scenario where there was was two transactions slots every block. If the current fee is $1 per transasctions, making a $2 transaction in order to increase fees for yourself. You'd take one of the slots, so the other slot would be competed for in the $1-$2 range. The maximum additional fee you'd be getting there is $1 if the other slot went for $2 as well. If the slot went for higher than $2, your transaction lost you opportunity cost of however much higher that second slot went than $2. So you'd at *least* be losing $1, and most likely something much closer to the full $2 in fee you paid. Change $2 to $1.01 and all the same logic holds.

Its great that Trezor is open source so that anyone can find and identify problems like this. Ledger could very well have similar problems, but they won't be disclosed because the device isn't open source. 


12/24 words doesn't break things. How long does it take to actually crack the user's wallet? 


 
A [link]( would have been nice. I don't think their response reads negligently at all. In fact, it sounds like Ledger was being negligent by prematurely disclosing things and even disclosing things in a way that clearly some people at their company thought was premature, as they asked Trezor's team to refrain from disclosing that info so soon. 
Their recommendation to use a password was not as the solution to that particular problem, but a general solution that mitigates almost *all* edge case hardware issue. Since if you remove information from the device (ie the password), no one can extract that information from it.

* Light nodes connect to a set of full nodes to verify any received transactions
The second video's super interesting but doesn't have anything to do with normal full nodes (it just talks about miners). I love the idea of continuing to add different mining algorithms that work together. That's something that was recently brought up in a discussion about changing monero's mining algorithm: 
Third video is mostly about why an individual would want to run a full node, and some vauge stuff about helping the network by uploading to other people. I wouldn't say that's directly related to the question.

What a fantastic speech! His comments about there being no one true form or currency are on point, and that's one thing that's so revolutionary about cryptocurrencies, is it's one place where the ideal libertarian opt-in government can actually work. People choose their monetary policy by choosing a currency. If you don't want some rules, you can choose a different currency, no need to wait for even a majority vote. 
I do, however, think that a small handful of currencies will "win". The network effects of currencies are so strong that we're very likely to converge on one. Especially since a side chain can implement basically any consensus rules it wants to, whatever the most secure, private, and valuable base chain is will have all the variants as side chains, and unrelated currencies will die out

I think everyone's now aware there are risks to increasing the blocksize. What I haven't seen is a plan for when block size increases can happen. We need milestones that say "when the network has these properties, we can raise the blocksize to Xmb". 


I'm not sure that's something we can say for certain. 


Ok. Well the whitepaper was written almost 10 years ago before the network even existed. Those hypotheticals have no bearing on how people are actually using the blockchain today. I'm not arguing with the math, but I don't think that most people making transactions are only doing 3 transactions per year. I doubt its even close to that. 


The white paper says increased block sizes are necessary to support worldwide usage assuming the LN is in place. That's not the same thing as saying that the LN requires higher blocksize. 
I think everyone is in agreement that we'll need bigger blocks in the future. The question is how much and when. I think the community is getting more consensus for a small blocksize increase soon. But we need to see at least some back-of-the napkin math from both sides. For the most hardcore small-blockers, I'd like to see what conditions they think we could raise the blocksize next, and by how much.

I disagree. A unit of account is important to have, but as long as there's a clear exchange rate from your desired currency and a stable unit of account, you can use a currency that can't be used as a unit of account. Prices in the age of the internet can be automatically adjusted for that exchange rate. And this is exactly what has happened with bitcoin. Accepting bitcoins is not at all hindered by its lack of a consistent value. Its far more hindered by rising fees..

@_date: 2017-12-30 01:04:46
Ah I see. That's not how I see the lightning network playing out actually. The way I see it playing out is that people will create channels not with dedicated hubs that only serve LN purposes, but rather with businesses they already frequently pay. 
Let's say you go to the grocery store every week, and you get a pizza every few months. Imagine this scenario:
You set up a LN channel with your grocery store. They front no money at all, but you put in a few hundred bucks worth of btc. You can then pay them via the lightning channel maybe 10 times over the next few months. But you're not gonna set up a lightning channel with even your most frequented pizza place, cause you just don't go there enough.
But your favorite pizza place (FPP) might buy their ingredients regularly from your favorite grocery store (FGS), or maybe instead buys from the same the supplier your FGS uses, or perhaps the pizza place you go to is the fancy farm-to-table kind and they have a LN connection with some individual farms that your FGS's supplier buys from. In any of these cases (and many more) you'll be able to route a payment via your FGS to the pizza place just as easily as paying your FGS itself.
Now that you've paid your grocery store a few times, someone can now actually pay *you* via the LN, even tho none of these businesses fronted any money whatsoever into the system for you. 
Eventually (after a few years), a new LN user won't even think twice about opening a channel with a businesses they're only going to pay once, as long as they're convinced that business will be around for the next year at least, because they know that business will have connections to anyone else on the LN and can route payments for them to anybody, even if they only pay them once (or never). And once that user pays anybody via the LN, they can then receive that money back as payment from someone else.

Mmm, sort of? Its kind of a new thing. There isn't anything else really like it that I know of. With a blank check, anyone can just run away with that money. With the LN, every single transaction has a contract laid out where "if A sends to B, then B will send to C, and C will send to D" that's enforced cryptographically. A lightning network transaction is almost always multiple transactions over multiple channels such that all but 2 of the actors are paying and receiving the same amount. But you're right that these checks remain unsigned, so in a given payment channel the next "check" replaces the last, and only the last check is signed and submitted (when the two channel partners decide to close the channel). 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:46

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:27:52
I don't think this is true. You aren't lending money to someone if you never had control over the money changing hands. Being part of a lightning route could be considered money transfer but not lending. Even in your own payment channel, the coins you send to your channel partner are a transfer, not a loan.

Watch them try in 2020. They will fail. 


The question is why does the mexican Peso exist when they could use dollars instead? The reason is that it started as a currency pegged to the dollar. This gave it value. But when they let it float, it lead to hyper-devaluation. They then pegged the new peso to the old peso and the devaluation has continued. There is momentum in an assets price, it can't disappear overnight with millions of people holding on to them. Its price will continue to devalue until they switch to a better currency. Mark my words, that currency will be a cryptocurrency.
The dollar started the same way. It was pegged to a weight of gold. When it was left to float on the market, it has steadily devalued relative to gold. Pegging is how national currencies are created. Peg to something with actual value, then let it float and watch it devalue. Then start the cycle over again. 
Pray tell, why do you think the mexican peso and dollar exist side by side? Is it because government "gives it value"? How would a government do that? 


Give me some evidence. Here's some counter-evidence: 4/5 of the biggest economic crises in history happened in the era of central banking  . 


The people are the reason. People's belief in a currency gives it value. People tend to believe in a currency when they believe in its monetary policies. Bitcoin has the most predictable stable monetary policy of any currency that has ever existed. So no, government is not the reason currency has value. How about providing any evidence whatsoever of any of your claims?

Now, some analysis of recent events that will affect the technical aspects and societal impact of bitcoin would be interesting. But price? Who cares. Just watch the chart go up

We're agreeing. That's what I'm saying. I think we're in violent agreement here. You're misconstruing what I'm trying to say as some kind of attack, and that's not what I'm saying.


No I don't. I'm ONLY saying that this "utterly important" factor is not necessary to prevent malleability. This is what I was saying from the start. I'm NOT saying it was a bad idea or that it shouldn't have been done. I would appreciate it if you assumed good faith on my part.

Ok I think you're confirming my second understanding here. I get it. The transaction ID must not be generated from data that included any signatures. But Segwit is more than that. Segwit also segregates all the witness data into a completely different section of the block. This isn't necessary to prevent malleability. The signatures can be kept alongside each individual transaction without causing malleability as long as only the transaction (and not the signatures or any additional data) is hashed to create the ID.

I'm saying that declaring it a "problem" is subjective. The community at large has decided that bigger blocks would be a bigger problem than higher fees. This is a design decision. What I'm saying is that given the current design decision, the fees are right where they need to be.

In monetary terms it will actually be non-inflationary. It's rate of inflation is already low and will eventually reach 0. That's 0 monetary inflation.

Perhaps I'm using "native segwit" wrong. I guess I'm not really sure what "native" means in this case. Addresses that start with 3 are segwit compatible and can create segwit transactions. Yes bc1 is more efficient, but also less supported right now. 3-prefix addresses are almost as good.

This is why bcash exists. A centralized coin won't change the world. A centralized coin will be hijacked and inflated by a new (or old) set of bankers. If you don't mind centralization, use a credit card for nearly instant low fee transactions. If you don't like quasi govt agencies like the fed stealing 6% of your savings every year via inflation, keep your currency decentralized.
Honestly, use litcoin or some other alt right now if you need to make frequent or low value transactions. Bitcoin's tech just isn't ready for the usage it's got. And if you really need to use bitcoin, make sure all your coins are im a segwit address that starts with 3

Well, that's not true in the short term. For example, in emergency situations, things like water jump in price. People might be able to bring in a bit more water, but supply can't be instantly created. Rising price not only incentivizes more production, but also provides a means to ration distribution. With bitcoin where there's no possibility of increasing supply based on demand, that rationing aspect is what remains, and it's still very important.

In what way does that sound like centralization? This is exactly how the (decentralized) internet works. You have connections, your connections have connections, you route through them. This isn't centralization. Centralization would be if you had to route through a single or small number of entities. 


It would in no way have to be a "major" entity. It could be literally any business. It could be *your* local hometown sandwich shop, which has channels with its grocery suppliers, which in turn has connections to 1000 different businesses, one of which has a connection that's connected to this sandwich shop in Spain.

Of course they are! A judge would order you to compensate the damaged party with a value equal to the damages at the time of the court judgement.

@_date: 2018-05-04 22:22:58


Not really relevant. While being forced to pay your taxes in dollars would provide some buy pressure (or hodl pressure), the government's pretty-much immediate spending of that money is basically sell pressure that perfectly balances it out. The value of a currency cannot come from having to use it in transitory interaction. Just like a token has no value, its the games that have value. Likewise its not the tax paying tokens that has value, its the government that has value (even if you disagree that value matches what you're paying for it). 


Explain that..

Being legal tender doesn't give it value. If you leased someone's car and crashed it, yes the owner is required to accept payment in dollars, however if dollars drop to 1% of their current value, then you have to pay 100 times as many dollars. Being required to accept dollars at their current (floating) price doesn't provide even one little bit of value to that currency.

No its not. Difficulty is not a measure of security. Cost of hashpower is the only measure of security.

Ok, again, worrying, but doesn't prove me wrong. I'm not saying you can't hack a smart phone, I'm saying there are FAR fewer attack vectors. And any reasonable program will be using encryption anyway for anything sensitive.

I'll take them point by point:
* USB DFU - I'm pretty sure the Trezor at very least warns the user if they're uploading new firmware that isn't signed by Trezor. The old firmware does a check of the new firmware before the user can reflash. They also fixed the issue that would allow a physical theif to upload new firmware that steals their keys  . In order for a compromised computer to upload malicious firmware (that could then compromise **new** keys only) the user would have to ignore warnings on their Trezor. 
* Bypassing PINs - Trezor claims there is no known attack in current versions of Trezor:  . If they do know about a problem, I suppose they'd wait until they've fixed it to announce it. 
* Supply Chain (Malicious knock offs) - Any supply chain problem are also just as possible with the Ledger, and in fact any piece of hardware. Unless you manufacture the hardware yourself, this will remain a security issue on any hardware wallet. The claim that the ledger gets around this by having a proprietary device key ignores the possibility that a knock off device has stolen the piece of hardware needed to verify the device. Maybe it makes it harder, but certainly no where near impossible.
* Recovery phase and surveillance - As it notes, anything has these vulnerability. This isn't really a vulnerability of the device(s) at all, but a vulnerability of humans.
All in all, I don't see a big reason to think the Ledger is more secure than the Trezor. Especially since proprietary security code is always a huge danger. The Trezor has orders of magnitudes more auditing than the Ledger could have.

Why is that? Bitcoin halfing events happen at regular intervals, and since the supply is going up so slowly, the S/F ratio should increase an approximately constant amount each halfing.

Yes, sudden changes in the value of money (price inflation or deflation) are almost always symptoms of the economy. Sudden changes like that are entirely and completely different from long term average inflation or deflation. 
Its also very different from *monetary inflation* (changes in quantity of money). That is not a symptom of the economy (unless you count how the Fed exploits weaknesses in the economy for its own gain). 


I disagree. I think that when you get deflation, *sometimes* the environment is in an undesirable state. However, if you have a currency who's total quantity doesn't change (eg bitcoin), the scenario is different. You can get deflation and the environment is in a very desirable state. 


In other words, it'll incentivize people to save. [Is that a bad thing](


What are those? Less personal bankruptcies and fewer jobs in the repossession industry?


I disagree wholeheartedly that it's better. Its certainly an incentive to not hold on to your dollars. That isn't necessarily good. But that's a topic for the other thread ; )
@_date: 2019-03-30 17:14:46
Note: different user here.
That nbc article doesn't make any sense to me. They list 3 types of buyers of negative yield bonds and the first two look the same - they're both predicting deflation. But wouldn't it be more profitable to just hold your cash in that case? Doesn't make any sense to me.


Think about it like a subsidy. If there's a subsidy for making solar panels, more people are going to make solar panels. People will find ways to make them that exceed the value the panels can be sold for, but will still make money because of the subsidy. Yes, those that make more cost effective panels will make more money, but not everyone necessarily has the ability to do that. So while the subsidy does help those that are making cost effective panels, it also incentivizes creating products that literally have negative net value. Take away the subsidy and you remove those inefficient businesses. 
Price deflation would also drive people to compete with the highest ROI businesses, driving down prices for consumers. 0 inflation would actually be a great equalizing pressure, since below average investments wouldn't be profitable, people would be driven to compete in above average industries, which would more evenly distribute the profits of that industry. Why waste human time on low value work?

I think the model is not about scarcity -&gt; price, but rather change in scarcity -&gt; change in price. The idea is that, given a starting point value, you can approximately predict what price it will be at a given S/F ratio by multiplying the predicted rate of change in price by the known current price.

All those previous spikes in those charts happened to finance war.

Everyone in the news is wrong about deflation. Deflation didn't cause the great depression. The deflation of that time and the depression both had a mutual cause. Sudden deflation can be caused by an extraordinary bad business environment. If keeping inflationary cash is a better deal than investing in things in the market, that means something is going horribly wrong in the economy. Chances are it's government related (*cough* the FED ruined christmas 1929). So it's the bad economy that creates deflation, not the other way around. Deflation is just a symptom.

An attacker certainly needs very close to a full majority to have any significant probability of pulling of the attack. An attacker simply wouldn't attempt the attack unless they had a majority because of the cost involved in failing the attack. 


The community "manually" rejecting the alternate history is not a simple move. It would create massive disruption in the part of the economy using that coin. While possible, its also ideologically opposed by a large fraction of the bitcoin community - maybe even a majority. Regardless, you're not arguing against my point here. You're saying the checkpoint isn't needed. However, if your point is correct, then PoS would already not have to worry about long range revisions - which was Andrew Poelstra's main point of contention with PoS. So you aren't correct if you're trying to say your points refute mine.

There isn't any one single thing that defines a "good store of value". If you want to store value long term and don't care about month to month fluctuations, bitcoin has and probably will remain a great store of value for you.

Well in that case, maybe most of the billionaires will manage to acquire enough bitcoin to maintain their 9 zeros. Most billionaires are billionaires counted by their investments in stocks, bonds and derivatives. If hyperbitcoinization happens, all of those things will be worth a lot less as people realize government bonds are worthless, companies holding large cash reserves and who are heavily invested in the dollar's machinations will see their stocks dive, and lots of investments in general will lose their value as it becomes clear that barely beating nominal inflation isn't a good investment.
I think lots of billionaires will lose their billionaire status (in buying power if not in trillion-dollar bills), and the rest will have either been in companies especially insulated from the debt and dollar bombs, or will have had the insight to buy bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-03-30 21:14:42


Ah that makes a lot more sense. Thanks for the examples.


First of all, if that were true, it wouldn't be any different from a company having to simply make a greater-than-zero ROI in a zero-inflation economy. The incentive in that regard wouldn't be not different.
But it isn't the case. In a good economy, there are plenty of opportunities to make more than inflation. However, the money will lose its value regardless of what you do. Companies with large amounts of cash (eg banks) are incentivized to find the best ROI they can in any environment (inflation or deflation), but those companies would be willing to make investments that make *any* return above zero. It doesn't have to beat inflation because that money is a sinking ship that needs to be bailed out.
This isn't a problem in a zero-inflation economy, or a deflationary economy, because you can simply pass on shitty investments and wait for a good one to come along. In an inflationary economy, there's no such luxury. 
This is the problem tho: you're spending more value than you're producing. And yet this waste makes economic sense for banks because of inflation. This is exactly the reason why anyone buys things like low-yield government bonds and derivativized toxic assets.
Worse yet, the fact that all this money is being thrown around increases the velocity of money which causes *further price inflation* which means that people who do have the ability to bring high ROI investments to fruition have less value to do it with (because their money becomes worth less). The economy would be better off without those low-ROI investments because other people with better ROI investments could do more of them, or do them faster. 
@_date: 2019-11-23 20:42:05
What do you think the economy would look like if the US dollar started hyperinflating?

I can see this being possible if there was a way to require that a transaction use up *all* the outputs at a particular address. Then you could set up a requirement that maximum X bitcoins can be sent to any arbitrary address, while the rest must be sent to an address with a 1-day timelock. 
Anyways, I hope Nash can build something that does better than Bisq.

Still does not make it clear why any of that is relevant. But honestly, I don't care about that point. So let's move on.


I agree that predictable or small price fluctuation on its own is not a major problem. We've already agreed that unpredictable price fluctuation does add some friction to the market. 




If you take away one thing from this conversation, its that you should always specify whether you're talking about price inflation or monetary inflation. Price inflation can be hedged against, sure. Monetary inflation cannot. Price inflation sans monetary inflation has little impact on a person's life. Monetary inflation has a substantial impact. 
Monetary inflation is the big problem, because it transfers massive amounts of wealth from both debtors and cash holders to bankers without providing commensurate value to those people or the economy at large.
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:12:32


Um.. you don't see it? There is a VERY sharp rise in inflation between 2009 and 2012... 


This is economics 101 man. Any source you find explaining the relation between monetary inflation and price inflation will tell you that monetary inflation generally leads to price inflation. And what they mean by that more specifically (and a relation you might read in more nuanced treatments) is that monetary inflation \*always\* leads to higher prices than would have existed without that monetary inflation. 
You could look at [wikipedia]( that says "Economists generally agree that in the long run, inflation is caused by increases in the money supply." You could listen to the famous economist Milton Friedman, who said “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” [[source]( Show me a source that says otherwise. 


I agree. What I disagree with is that predictable monetary inflation is fine. Predictable monetary inflation is the best kind, however a predictable monetary inflation rate of 0 is better than a predictable rate above 0. 


Cars aren't more expensive because of tech features. Regardless, I hope my example shows you why anecdotes and cherry picked data aren't helpful to this discussion.


Technically, no its not. Its a deposit - its a loan to the bank. Regardless of what you call it, if there's 2% inflation and 2% interest rate on your savings, you're not making any real money. If there's 0% inflation and 2% interest rate on your savings, you are making real money (2%). So your example shows how inflation erodes someone's deposits.


Price inflation is defined by a rise in the price of goods, yes. 


Yes, a house's value is not (directly) affected by inflation - you're correct. Where you aren't correct is about a company. A company is not a physical object, rather it is a network of people, processes, and assets. Most companies have some assets in the form of bank deposits, bonds, equity in other companies, or other things that are affected by inflation. Recently, companies have been holding [more than 10%]( of their assets in cash *on average*. 


What kind of evidence are you expecting to see? Stock prices are so volatile that any affects of inflation would be lost in the noise. What would convince you that a company's cash holdings are affected by inflation? The question is, why would a company's cash holdings *not* be affected. That's my question to you.


Let me quote you something from that link: "Earn 20x the national average with interest compounded daily." Ally is claiming that the national average is 0.18%. So ok, double than what I said you'd be "lucky" to get. Regardless, the link you gave me has the information that proves my point - interest rates are not high. Even Ally bank has sub-inflation interest rates. And I hope you realize that you again cherry picked data by pointing to a single small bank and showing it as "proof" that interest rates are .. "good"? Regardless, interest on bank deposits are irrelevant to this discussion.


Banks don't give interest rates as "real return". Its only basic return. So you're incorrect that reducing monetary inflation wouldn't change the real return. 


You're frustrating me with your lack of critical thinking. Please think more about this. Here's a simple example:
There's $100 in the entire world. You have $10. People like apples, which currently costs $1 each. You can produce an apple for 50 cents. Let's say you produce 10 apples that year and sell them all. You've spent $5 and earned $10, a net of $5 profit. If the government prints $100 more dollars in that time, it means each dollar is worth half as much. This means that your net profit was 2.5 real-dollars (in beginning-of-the-year dollars) rather than 5. Does this make sense to you? Do you see why the real returns are different?

There's probably many reasons. For me personally, i was against credit cards when i first was old enough to get one, so i tried using a debit card. However, it was very easy to overdraft my card accidentally. If you didn't have enough credit left on your credit card, it would be simply declined, however with a debit card, it would not be declined and you would be charged an overdraft fee. I tried calling the bank and other things to resolve this but it simply wasn't possible to get banks to fuck off and simply decline the charge if you didn't have enough money in the account. So i started using credit cards instead for the (lack of in-) convenience.
Also, i was constantly told that to "build credit", i needed to use a credit card, otherwise i wouldn't be able to do things like buy a house later in life. I'm still skeptical of that advise, but true or false, it is widespread. 
And then you have all the people that can't keep themselves from living beyond their means, and it's just so easy to do that with a credit card. 
Credit cards are a disease.

So.. the final recourse is that one of the traders can initiate a time-locked donation to Bisq's DAO? This will not turn out well. 
Bisq has been incredibly terrible at deterring scammers. Their main problem is that fiat transactions via the payment methods they support have VERY LONG finalization times, measured in months. And yet the trades happen on the order of days. This inevitably leads to a security hole where a scammer will pay with fiat, wait to receive bitcoin, then dispute the fiat charge and get refunded - basically stealing the bitcoin. 
Bisq's solution is to remove escrow? How does that solve anything? Bisq needs to work on getting cryptocurrency methods like USDC more volume. Last I checked there was no Bitcoin offered for USDC. Their only hope is to stick to payment methods that have short finalization time - that is, only cryptocurrencies. And they really should start supporting atomic swaps so none of this scammable escrow garbage is necessary.

@_date: 2019-11-22 21:06:15


Rightly so.


Interesting, so you would basically shard the network information this way and then ask nodes lexicographically close to your destination node if they know how to find it? If they don't, they could ask a potentially even closer node (since they should know closer nodes). Would these nodes store network information around each node they're lexicographically close to as well? I'd expect them to have to, since otherwise simply being aware of the destination node isn't helpful to constructing a route.
Seems like it would be a bit hit and miss, since the lexicography would have nothing to do with network shape. 


That doesn't sound so bad. I'd wonder what the average route lengths are. Even with a billion nodes, a well-connected network shouldn't need much more than 10 hops on average tho (considering a network where 20% of the nodes have 10 channels and the other 80% have 2 channels). Change that to hubs with 100 channels each and that drops down to 5 hops on average. So 20 hop paths really shouldn't be necessary in the vast majority of cases. even if everyone in the world has a few channels.


Well, what do we do to route packets in the internet? Each router has a routing table, and when you connect those routing tables together, they form a routing tree. Of course DNS and IP are both centralized systems. But there's a reason address routing works so well - unlike lexigographical proximity, IP addresses that are similar to each other are by design closer to each other in the network, because that's how IP addresses are given out.
It seems like this would be relatively ideal, since you could use the destination address alone (with public channel data) to determine an acceptable route. If there were multiple tables and each channel were assigned multiple addresses, shortcuts could even be discovered that could allow near-shortest routes to be constructed.
So why hasn't anyone modeled LN routing on the IP routing we know and love, just with some decentralization added in? Are there fundamental problems with address-routing I'm not aware of?

Electricity costs are not objectively worse than hardware costs. And PoW mining cannot be made "cheaper".

@_date: 2019-11-24 22:02:49


Well there's a couple things about that:
A. A node doesn't have to index *all* the information. A node only needs to count nodes up to the point where it exceeds the size of the network of the node doing the counting. So in the usual case where the node's network size is 1 (they're making their first channel with someone who's already connected to the LN), almost no counting needs to be done.
B. Even in the case where two large separate similarly-sized networks connect, each node should not need to count the entire network but can instead query a potentially tiny fraction of the nodes in that network to verify the numbers. For example, you could ask 1000 nodes surrounding the counterparty and ensure that the information from those nodes matches up with the information given by the counterparty. This would solve the problem in a very similar way to on-chain bitcoin - similar to what you said, it would only take 1 honest connection contradicting the counterparty to make an attack by the other 999 dishonest nodes fail. 
C. The network size count also doesn't need to be exact either. If one network is clearly bigger, go with that. If both networks look to be around the same size, honest participants can just randomly decide which network will be rearranged. 
D. Again, it would be quite rare that large disconnected networks connect together. Almost all nodes would connect to a node they know to already part of the main Lightning Network.


I'm not proposing to remove signatures from the equation.


That's also not what I'm proposing. The parent child relationship is not a master-slave relationship. Its simply a convention for deciding which way is "up" and which way is "down" for the purposes of routing. The parent doesn't allocate addresses to the child, instead the parent and child agree together on the addresses the child will use. In addition, every parent child pair makes this decision independently according to the protocol, so that its ensured that resource exhaustion attacks are very expensive. 


Well, what I'm proposing sort of allows that. When you introduce multiple routing trees, nodes take turns being the parent. So if there are 5 routing trees, all nodes connected to a partner that has 5 or less channels will definitely get a turn being the parent. Again, the parent has no power over children, but they take turns in order to vary the routing possibilities.


Addresses would be IP-style numbers where each child in the tree is assigned a contiguous range of numbers. They would have no connection at all to any public keys, except that when your destination invoices you, they'll include all the addresses that identify them in the available routing trees, and sign that list with their private key. 


What would forging an address allow you to do? If you invoiced someone with the wrong address, payment would simply fail because whoever is at that address doesn't have the secret preimage.


The great firewall isn't possible because of address routing, but is possible because of the fact that IP addresses are manually allocated in a way that can be commandeered by a government. What I'm proposing wouldn't have that weakness.


That's why I propose multiple routing trees. Each node would have one address per tree, and shortcuts between trees would make routing around any failures or attempted blockades easy. 
To expand on that, these routes wouldn't be built wholesale per-tree - meaning that you wouldn't find 1 route per tree, you'd find exponentially more routes per hop. If T is the number of routing trees, and N is the number of hops, the upper bound of the number of routes you would get would be defined by `T^N`. So with 5 trees searching 6 hops out, you'd be able to find a maximum of 15,625 routes.
The way this would work is that the sender would request the next hop for each routing tree from each of its channel partners (of course excluding ones where it knows it'll be the next hop), which gives them a maximum of T next hops per channel. Then for each next hop it found, it does this again, asking about the next hop for every routing tree. So the routes found do not strictly have to follow parent-child relationships in any single tree. This multiple-tree routing system gives a resilience to connection failures that a single-tree system can't match.
By the way, thanks for thinking through this with me : )

I would imagine it is relatively simple. You can group transactions together and calculate their fee/byte, and simply sort. Any multi-transaction groups simply get multiple entries in the sorted list. So if you have A, B, and C, and C depends on B, then your list might be:
B - 12
A - 10
BC - 9
If you have enough space for 9 sat/byte transactions, then both B and C go in. Otherwise maybe leave C out. Any transactions that are mutually exclusive can be marked as such and the inclusion of one simply prevents the inclusion of the other.

Good Q&amp;A but you're jumping the gun when you say using a block chain isn't suitable for voting. The jury's still out, and the problems identified in the answer there are either not bigger problems than without a block chain or they're solvable.
1. A trustworthy computing environment is the same problem as voting machines have. It's an even harder problem to create a trustworthy environment for sending out and then counting paper balets (tons of points of failure).
2. Distributing voting keys is, like Nick's answer says, is not a bigger problem than distributing mail in balets.
3. DOS attacks would be far less of a problem if you use a block chain network, because you have more machine resources in the system. Plus, the amount of data is actually rather small (80 GB for an entire US of votes) and counting all the votes doesn't actually need to be done as fast as possible, so a DOS attempt would have to go on for days or maybe weeks to be successful. It would be enormously expensive. Highly unlikely.
4. Scalability isn't a problem either, as i said, the data is actually small. It would take about 8 hours to go through that data with machines that have 50 mbps connections. And unlike bitcoin, the blockchain is complete when the vote is complete, and also, not every person needs to be doing the counting, so we can have higher machine resources requirements. 
5. The hashpower majority could be a problem if you do it wrong, since they could censor votes. However, since all voting keys should only be used once on this particular block chain, you actually don't even need a blockchain. You just need one single block that everyone independently calculates. Any key that votes twice could be disqualified, or you could have a way to allow people to correct their vote by over riding their previous one. But the point is you just need a mempool to count votes, you don't actually need a chain of blocks.
6. Pieter Wuille mentioned that a problem is supporting secret ballots. This is the only really tricky problem, but it might be solvable using techniques built for mimblewimble. If your vote can be combined with everyone else's votes, there would be no way for you to prove who you voted for, it would just be one big blob of votes. The only way to know who any individual voted for would be by obtaining every voter's private key. Using dandelion, anyone who started the dandelion chain would expose their vote to the next person, but that person would be random in a sea of millions of voters, plus, since mimblewimble has no addresses, the IP communication would be the only identifying factor, which could be easily obfuscated with tor. And the kicker is that even this level of exposure needs to be taken on by a few people at the beginning of the dandelion chain, which could be thousands or even millions of people long.

This is a super important question and something the bitcoin community needs to get right before its safe for most people to start actually using bitcoin as a long term store of value. It needs to be accessible for every-day people (ie non crypto geeks) to safely store their bitcoin in a way where almost nobody will lose their bitcoin or get it stolen. I believe methods can be developed that would allow this even for non-savvy users without custodial storage, but those methods certainly aren't widely available yet (if they're available at all). 
The best way to store and backup your bitcoin would be to use a well-vetted open source backup and storage method. Everyone here seems to be rolling their own security, which we all should know is not great. However, people are doing this out of necessity since holistic well-vetted open source backup and storage methods simply aren't available.

I disagree. It's a fundamental truth about block chains. The whole point is to determine consensus among many separate entities that don't trust each other. It simply records information in an agreed upon order. A block chain doesn't do anything else. So what do you think i might be missing that would be useful for centralized use (where there is only one entity and therefore no separate untrusting entities).


Companies throw away money all the time. Maybe not quite as much as governments, but they do it, as do we all. The bigger the company, the more absurd bets big execs make decisions on when they don't understand the space.


There's two cases:
A. The order of the "transactions" in your block chain matter and can be used to some kind of advantage. In this case, anyone can Sybil the mining system and take over the chain. Because there is nothing of value needed to mine, not enough mining will take place leaving the system unprotected.
B. The ordering doesn't matter, in which case why are you using a block chain at all?
The situation you describe only works when everyone trusts everyone else to not screw over the system.

DCA is for people who only can afford to invest a percentage of their paycheck. For anyone who has money in the bank to invest, DCA is clearly an inferior strategy for a generally appreciating asset.

So what, would you block all AWS full nodes? You have to identify them as an attacker first, which you can't because they're not doing anything other than being normal honest-looking full nodes.


Again, how do you identify an "evil" node?

I don't think your definition is accurate enough. Storing value is not about low "risk of change", its about low risk of loss. No one complains if their asset goes up in value, only if it goes down. A quantitative measure of store of value would be what probability there is that your asset will not be worth significantly less than it is now the amount of time in the future you care about storing it. 
If your goal is to store value for 5 years, your 30 day volatility doesn't impact how good of a store of value it is at all. If your goal is to store that value for a month, then sure, your 30 day volatility totally matters.
All this makes "good store of value" even more subjective, because it doesn't incorporate the lengths of time people might care about storing it.

Is it his fault if corrupt rich assholes [leach wealth from the economy for themselves]( preventing Joe from reaching anywhere near his predicted goals? 
Is it Joe's fault that banks lend out money that didn't exist before the loan, making it impossible for everyone to pay back their loans, even if they were all prudent? 
Corrupt interests have changed the economy to suck wealth from it, and have done it quickly enough that people didn't have time to learn how to deal with this new shitty economic reality. And we still have enormously misleading cultural influences that tell people its ok to put nothing down on cars and only 5% down on a house. You even have assholes like [this idiot]( telling people that "large" down payments is a bad idea. So many things in this world are trying to trick people into doing really stupid things, and the financial world is top of the stack when it comes to irresponsible bullshit.

@_date: 2019-11-10 16:19:56
There is another important piece to running a specifically public full node that i never see anyone talking about: sybil resistance. Right now there are only around 10,000 public full nodes, which isn't a ton in the grand scheme of things. The easiest way for someone to disrupt the bitcoin network is to use up the bandwidth on those full nodes. 
For example, let's say the average full node is willing to dedicate up to 100 Mbps of bandwidth to the bitcoin network. You can rent cloud servers the cost [$60 per 500 Mbps of bandwidth]( That means an attacker only needs to rent 2000 machines in order to be able to lock up all the available bandwidth that public nodes can provide. That would cost $120,000 per month or $1.4 million per year. This is well within the budget of the vast majority of governments, even small governments like the government of [Dominia could afford this level of expenditure]( without it being more than 1% of their yearly expenditures.
What an attacker would do is simply run ~2000 full nodes that are normal in every way except they connect to as many public nodes they can (not just 8). As simple as that, people would have a very hard time connecting to the network. 
This attack can only be made more costly for an attacker to perform by running more public full nodes. So if you run a full node, please put in the effort to make it public :)
Update: people keep saying things like "nodes can ban misbehaving peers", but these attacker nodes DO NOT misbehave to any single peer. They act like an honest node in all ways except the number of public nodes they connect to.

How? In order to do that, they would need to trick users into downloading the wrong software (with the wrong checkpoint). 


So does Bitcoin. Users must already choose their implementation. 


Thanks for the link. The checkpoint situation I'm describing for PoS falls into Pieter's first bullet point: "*the checkpoints are created for old blocks (weeks or months old)*". In Bitcoin, Pieter is certainly correct, no attacks are prevented because long range attacks aren't possible (or at least break the security assumptions of bitcoin). However, in a PoS system, long range attacks are what need to be prevented, and thus old-block checkpoints do in fact help.

This is simply not true. Even if no economic decisions are based on information from the node, a public node does protect the network as a whole, as i already mentioned.
You are correct that you as an individual gain more privacy and security by using your own full node, and gain almost nothing by running a full node you don't actively used yourself. However it does help the network. Also, if you run a public node, there's no reason not to also use it yourself. So it still seems bizarre to me that the node would be unused by the owner.

He's right that no government or even all the government's put together can change the consensus rules via a hard fork without each individual choosing to download and use their software. He's right that it would be basically impossible to achieve 50% of the hashpower in secret, which prevents maliciously changing consensus rules via a soft fork. 
What he misses is that a government can still DOS the Bitcoin network simply by creating too many private full nodes and using up the resources of all our valuable public full nodes.  This can be done for only a couple million dollars per year. That's why we need more public full nodes. Bitcoin isn't out of the woods quite yet.

Well that's a reasonable proxy, but its a tad more than that. Not only does a full node need to download the blocks, but they need to upload them as well. In fact, double that is about what has been seen empirically eg here:
That's seeing about 4 Mbps for 100 connections, or 40 Kbps per connection. And that was 2 years ago. Today, bitcoin.org recommends upload speeds of at least [50 Kbps]( Since a node generally needs to upload each block to an average of 1 connection, we can infer that 8 connections requires 50*(8 download + 1 upload) = 450 Kbps, or about 56 Kbps per connection.


You aren't understanding the attack. Let me make this very clear with a concrete example:
* Assumption: There are 10,000 honest public nodes, with an avg of 100 Mbps available bandwidth each. That is, collectively, the public nodes have 1000 Gbps of total bandwidth.
The attack then goes as follows:
* The attacker runs (rents or purchases) about 2000 machines from various services (equivalent in price and bandwidth service to [OVHcloud]( It would not be difficult to make these purchases from 20 different services to minimize IP subnet correlation. 
* The attacker would then have a collective bandwidth of 1000 Gbps, just like the honest public nodes.
* The attacker then simply runs stock bitcoin core nodes (no modified code) on each of those 2000 machines with [maxconnections in bitcoin.conf]( set to 9999 or something.
What would happen is that, on average, each attacker node would connect to up to 8928 public nodes (obviously no attacker node would be able to connect to the same public node twice, unless done through a proxy, which should be entirely unnecessary for the attack). This would be 17.85 million connections in total. Each public node would be connected to up to 1785 attacker nodes. 
In practice, since attacker nodes would compete alongside honest private full nodes, the attacker would only get some fraction of the available connections. Since there are about 100,000 private full nodes, there would be demand for 800,000 honest connections. Since the attacker can make 17.8 million connections, the attacker would be able to control over 95% of the connections on the network. If the attacker's nodes disconnect less frequently on average than the average honest node, they could capture an even higher percent. This would mean also that only `1-.95^8 = 44%` of honest nodes could even get a single connection to the network. And it would be statistically impossible (.05^8) for a node to get a full 8 connections to the network. 
In this situation, 44% of nodes would be unable to make connections. Any node that only connects ephemerally would likely be out of luck, as nodes would have to wait around for hours or possibly longer to make even a single connection. This is a DOS attack. 
Do you see how the attacker's nodes wouldn't need to do anything outwardly nefarious? Do you see how the public nodes would not be able to distinguish between an honest node and the attackers nodes?
Peter Wuillie even called this out: [public connections are a scarce resource]( He said "*If people go try connect to all of them like some sites do, we'll very quickly run out.*". This is exactly the attack.

That is most certainly not true. Two chains with alternate histories can never "converge". What will happen if that nodes will choose the longest of those 2 chains, and so the *nodes* will converge. Maybe that's what you meant to say?


There's one of three possibilities:
1. Both nodes downloaded software containing the same checkpoints, the split happened before the checkpoint. In this case the nodes have no possibility of being on a different chain and everything's good.
2. Both nodes downloaded software containing the same checkpoints, the split happened after the checkpoint. In this case, both nodes will choose the longest chain and at least eventually end up on the same longest chain.
3. The nodes download software with different checkpoints. In this case the nodes are each on *different cryptocurrencies*. So obviously they will never converge because they are following different protocols.
I hope this makes it clear to you where we are making different assumptions, because you still haven't told me enough info about how you think checkpoints work for me to figure out where we're misunderstanding each other.

It wouldn't negate existing debt. But in a bitcoin economy, debt wouldn't be negative-sum. You're familiar with the concept of zero sum, right? Well debt in our current system is negative sum, meaning that there's never enough money to go around to pay off all the debt (despite massive amounts of money creation, actually because of it). 
Because money is destroyed when debt is paid back, the money that truly exists is there sum of the interest, while the amount of debt that exists is the sum of balances. Since balances are always larger than the interest (in any given year), there is never enough money to pay off all the debt. 
Debt can only be held at bay while more and more people borrow money. Inevitably this growth comes to an end and the economy crashes. Banks that lent out phantom money that didn't exist before the loan then "repossess" large amounts of assets from unlucky debtors who couldn't pay off their loans. 
But the real reason for this post is to point out the monetary inflation that's massively debasing the value of dollars right now.

I already read that paragraph, and it simply doesn't apply to hardcoded checkpoints. Let's look at an example:
A. You have some users on old software with an old checkpoint. Let's say the checkpoint is at block 100,000 with a hash of ABCDEF. 
B. You have some users on new software with a new checkpoint. Let's say that checkpoint is at block 110,000 with a hash of UVWXYZ.
C. The current block height is at 120,000.
Because this software is built to be part of the same blockchain, we know that the blockchain that contains block UVWXYZ at height 110,000 ALSO contains a block with hash ABCDEF at height 100,000. `... -&gt; 100,000: ABCDEF -&gt; ... -&gt; 110,000: UVWXYZ -&gt; ... 120,000: ???`.
For an attacker to fork two chains, they have to build the *longest chain* built off a block at or before block 109,999. This means the attacker has to build a *longer* secret chain for 10,000 blocks, which is over 2 months. To do this, the attacker most certainly has to have the majority of the block-creation power, in which case all bets are off and they can already double spend and mess with people at will via a 51% attack. 
Some questions I can anticipate:
1. Why does the chain have to be secret? If the chain isn't secret then its simply the longest chain and everyone would know about it, and therefore the checkpoint would come from a block in that chain. There would be no other chain to split off from
2. Why does the attacker's secret chain need to be longer than the honest chain? Because if its not, then neither old nor new software will follow that chain.
So while yes, an attacker can theoretically split the network by exploiting the checkpoints, they can't practically do it because it requires them having the majority of the block creation power.

My understanding is that both mediators and arbitrators are part of the Bisq DAO, and since the final mediation step is paying the DAO, both mediators and arbitrators gain a bit if that happens. This won't create "rogue mediators", but would more likely create a painful and unfair mediation process where mediators and arbitrators don't really try that hard to remedy the situation.

It's not about lucky breaks dude. Why aren't you getting it? It's about corruption. It's about regulatory capture that has allowed banks, hospitals, oil companies, and politicians to leach off the people. Bitcoin can solve the bank problem by making money sound that can't be printed out of thin air, making it harder to lend out more money than we actually have, and allowing us to rely less on banks so they aren't "too big to fail".
It's not only fair to call out this corruption that has ruined a generation, but it's absolutely necessary in order to regain our lost freedom.

I assume you're wondering if you should create a native segwit address. The answer is probably yes, since transactions will be cheapest for you with native segwit. The only downside is that some old crappy software might not be able to send to your address. You're unlikely to need to interact with old crappy software anyway.

It should indeed slow down eventually, but the because halvings happen at regular intervals, it won't slow down right now. It *should* reduce in magnitude, and we are seeing that. So instead of seeing a 200x or 50x gain, we'll see a 15x gain or something like that. 
I think the halvings have actually been a big destabilizing factor that has caused a lot of volatility in the system. As halvings become smaller and smaller, I hope that we stop seeing massive runups and crashes, and instead see slow and steady growth. That in and of itself would make the currency more attractive and would make it grow faster.

Again. You're wrong. Majority stake is required. Without  majority stake, the attacker could not create a longer chain than the honest chain.


I will agree that this allows for additional types of disruption than the situation without a checkpoint. However, it is not "far more disruptive". With a 51% attack, you can literally censor every transaction. That is quite clearly more disruptive than a chain split. If someone has and can maintain majority hashpower in bitcoin, they can kill bitcoin if they want to. There is nothing more disruptive.

The design looks great, the functionality looks great. The fact that it's open source looks great. It's all great except that **because its a website, you are literally installing it FRESH every single time you go to that page**. I bolded that because its very important. What that means is that at *any* time, the owner of coinb.in could pull the rug out from under you and steal your money. 


Are you verifying that the code served from that address is the code listed on its github **every single time you visit it**? No? Then you're not using that website safely, because you can't be sure your keys and addresses aren't stored anywhere. The only way to conveniently use this website safely is to never enter any private keys and never let it generate an address that required a private key to generate. The multi-sig looks ok since the private keys are never touched by this web page, and some of the other functionality is fine.
This is on *top* of all the vulnerabilities you have from shunting around seeds and passphrases every time you need to access your wallet. Not to mention the fact that you're probably using a desktop computer to do this, which is even less secure.

Thanks for sharing! Looks like this boils down to poor implementations, poor auditability, and single point of failure at key generation time. Poor implementation is solvable, but the other two aren't. Those are certainly good points.

In any case, not "dangerous" but seems like multi-sig is theoretically better in all ways.

Well ok, but while that's certainly trivial for an "attacker" to do, is it expensive for a miner to resolve it? I wouldn't think so.

Are you trying to misunderstand me? I didn't say anything about monetary inflation always leading to "Zimbabwe doom", I said it always leads to higher inflation. This is a rock solid fact. If you think I'm wrong, how about going and finding a source for me that refutes what I'm telling you? This is the most basic of macroeconomic facts. 


I would appreciate it if you would acknowledge that you were wrong or misspoke that there's a "predictable 2% inflation"? It seems to me that you're trying to redirect the conversation to avoid admitting you weren't correct.


That blog entry you pointed to is unconvincing. The writer cherry picks a single item (milk) and uses that to discredit a graph that comes from a basket of goods. So yeah, speaking of manipulating data, your source is doing just that. And he goes on to say that treasury yields must be above inflation, asserting that this "isn't controversial" without providing any evidence that is the case. Logically, there is no reason at all that treasury yields must have anything to do with inflation. People invest in whatever they can to get the highest return. Even if treasury yields were below inflation, they'd be better than sitting on cash. Dumb post.


Anecdotes aren't worth much. You shouldn't care about mine either. And nobody can "anecdotally guarantee" anything. If you want my cherry picked example, how about [car prices]( Specifically, [this chart](


First of all, cash does not have an "interest rate". So your millionaire loses at least $1000 in a year to inflation - and that's if the 2% inflation number is accurate. 
Second of all, you're only paying attention to 5% of that millionaire's assets. What about the other 95%? Did you even think about where that part is? In any case, your example is pretty unrealistic. According to cnbc, "wealthy investors had 27.1% of their assets in cash while 26.3% was in equities" &lt;sup&gt;[[source]]( So your millionaire is actually far more likely to be losing $5420 in that year just on the $263,000 they have in cash. 
And if you're talking about holding cash in a bank, you'd be lucky to get 0.1%. Wells fargo gives 1/10th of that rate (0.01%). Regardless, interest on bank deposits has nothing to do with interest rates. They're loaning out your money for you, and you'd earn a higher real return if there was less inflation. 


I guess you haven't heard of [negative yield bonds]( Regardless, I agree with you, most bond buyers want bonds to have rates above inflation. The problem is that once you buy a bond, unless its a special type (ie TIPS), if inflation rises, you're out of luck because your return rate won't rise with inflation. Only the return rate on \*new\* bonds will have a corresponding higher yield. 


Ok, but my point is that stocks \*you\* hold are less valuable because companies do this. Do you feel sorry for yourself if you end up being one of those companies' stock holders?


Its not good for the world, that's for sure. However, the issue is that tax law is such that if companies did "the right thing", they (and their shareholders) would get penalized for it. Tax law horribly distorts the market.

QE in 2010 has nothing to do with inflation in 2004. 2004 is irrelevant. You asked me to show you the bump, and I showed you an obvious bump. If you want to pretend that the rise in inflation was "a temporary bounce back from the recession" there's nothing I can do to help you. At least perhaps you could admit that *maybe* the bump we see is the bump from quantitative easing?


First of all, the "this 'expert' said x" game is absolutely stupid. Second of all, Krugman is an arrogant loud mouth that constantly speaks FAR outside of his area of expertise and has been [spectacularly wrong]( so many times, its not funny anymore, its sad. Krugman hasn't been a researcher since 1991. He just cherry picks data and makes fun of other people with snarky remarks. 
Even so, Krugman is *not* saying that monetary inflation does not increase price inflation. Krugman has a more nuanced point, tightly bound with his massive bias towards self-aggrandizement. He's saying that short-term monetary inflation does not necessarily lead to short-term price inflation. Short term being the key point here, since in the long run, monetary inflation must lead to price inflation.


What about stores and flows? You said "stores and flows" and then failed to mention anything about it again. Are you going to explain how stores and flows somehow changes the equation for inflation? You should already know that I know how the velocity of money affects inflation in the short term, because I told it to you already. Is that all you're talking about?


A system with a fixed money supply can experience inflation and deflation, but cannot experience sustained inflation or deflation in the long run. Inflation and deflation in such a situation would average out to 0 over time.


Please [link]( to charts you reference next time. So actually I see a visibly less volatility from 1820 to 1930 than from 1930 to 2019 (ignoring the two massive wars, which I hope we can both agree are irrelevant outliers). So I can't share you conclusion that going off the gold standard reduced volatility, since volatility was already quite low. What it did clearly do was massively increase net inflation by a ton. 
I'm glad you brought this chart up because it illustrates a lot of the points I already made. The fact that net inflation is 0 without an inflating money supply. Of course, the banks still inflated the money supply, but it was always temporary. Until 1931 that is.


It is a key market distortion that has caused a lot of bad investments to happen. 


Sorry, when has that ever happened? I mean, outside government money printing.


If you're not going to even listen, why should I even talk to you? Your point is irrelevant. What you're saying is the same thing as saying "your job earns you enough to cover inflation, so why complain?" That is an absolutely stupid point you're making. If there wasn't 2% inflation, you'd be earning 3.92% instead of 1.92%. 
I'm sorry, but you're refusing to think about what you're saying. Keep your biases. I'm done talking to you.

That depends on your risk profile. It might be totally ok for you, but the fact is that it's totally less secure than typing it directly on the hardware wallet. It is most secure to expose your passphrase to as few machines as possible and as infrequently as possible. 
If you type your passphrase into your computer, someone could have installed a virus on it that key logs, or may have simply plugged in a key logger to your keyboard. Then they can steal your seed and steal your coins. That can't happen if you only type your passphrase in directly on your hardware wallet.

Even if the website said "DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE!

It makes is far far too easy for people to get into a pattern of insecure bitcoin usage.
And again, THEY DO NOT HAVE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS. What they are doing is without any doubt very irresponsible and will lead to people losing their funds when users go to another website and trust that website with their keys or don't understand that letting a website generate an address for them is just as bad as giving the website public keys.

After reading through that pdf, it seems Andrew didn't consider an important piece of most PoS systems in his analysis. That piece being checkpoints. Ideally these would be hard coded check points that are just another part of the code, and therefore part of the protocol. 
Andrew made the point near the end that PoS isn't quite distributed consensus because it relies on conferring with your friends, businesses, etc to know whether you're on the right chain. This is a reasonable point except that if the definition of distributed consensus includes that out of band agreement cannot be necessary, by that definition distributed consensus is impossible.
Even with bitcoin, the only way to know you're on the right chain is to know that you're running the right software - ie the software everyone else you care about is using. Even if you read and understood every single line in the source and knew it to be secure and well constructed, you still wouldn't know whether the people you care about are using that code without asking them. Neither Proof of Work nor any consensus protocol can eliminate that requirement. You need prior agreement on a protocol to reach consensus.
So what we can do is minimize the need to re-establish that agreement. Bitcoin does this by only requiring people to establish out of band agreement on the protocol itself on first use of the system, and on any subsequent change of protocol.
Proof of stake can similarly minimize the out of band agreement in the same way. However, with hard coded check points, there is some minimum frequency of protocol-change necessary to update the check points, to prevent the attacker from gathering up enough used keys to build an alternate history from the check point onward. This is in contrast to bitcoin where theoretically the protocol can stop evolving and so require only one out of band verification per user (on first use). However, no one seems too fussed about the frequency protocol changes happen with bitcoin currently, and so if a PoS system updated at that same frequency, there would actually be no difference in security model. If a condition of being allowed to mint a block is that the output used must have stayed in one place since the last check point, there would be no possibility of anyone building an alternate history with used coins.

Bitcoin actually does have multiple types of intrinsic value when compared to its competitors: fiat currencies and inflation-escaping investment vehicles (gold, govt bonds, etc). What are they?
* Bitcoin has a very specific and stable rate of inflation and eventual supply. Anyone can figure out almost exactly how many bitcoins there will be at any given time in the next 200 years. Fiat currencies obviously fail here, but even gold doesn't have a fixed supply, since more is mined and discovered all the time. The fact that Bitcoin is decentralizes gives this property credibility, since because of its decentralization, this is unlikely to change. 
* Bitcoin can be used to transfer huge amounts of money for basically nothing in comparison to its competitors in the money transfer market: wire transfers. 
* Bitcoin can be used to hold money securely without giving an institution custodial possession of your money. Keeping cash is far more vulnerable to theft than encrypted Bitcoin keys. 
* With the lightning network, Bitcoin will allow people to finally do economically viable microtransactions - something that has proven difficult for other systems. You can easily set up a system to do microtransactions with a particular partner, but no private networks have been able to grow big enough to allow people to do microtransactions with *hundreds* or *thousands* of unrelated parties - like the LN will easily allow. 
* With the lightning network, Bitcoin will be by far the cheapest way to send smaller amounts of money - beating out credit cards, venmo, paypal, and the like. Transaction costs should be orders of magnitude less than any of those.
All of these things are value the currency has in comparison to its competitors. Just like the usefulness of dollars give *it* value, the fact that Bitcoin is far more useful gives *it* far more value. 
tl;dr While the *price* may be solely based on what people *think* its worth, the fact of the matter is that a logical rational person can see that Bitcoin is more valuable than fiat currency, and because of that rational thinking, the *price* will follow the real value.

Old transactions would remain in the blockchain.

The innovation of segwit is that blocks can be bigger without *any* additional centralization pressure, because the witness part of the block is not needed to start mining on top of the next block. So sure, it keeps block sizes low, but small-blockers won't care about that because the whole point is to keep centralization low, and segwit allows 2-4 times as much space without any additional centralization pressure.

Trying to figure out what's a good store of value is never a sure thing. As everyone's eager to point out, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Looking at bitcoin vs monero in past volatility is possibly the absolute worst way to predict whether either or both will be a good store of value, because the volatility today has nothing to do with the value in 5 years.


I agree, and that's not what's happening here. Bitcoin and monero might both be good stores of value. I'm not going to claim one is definitely better than the other. But I will say that Bitcoin is more likely a good store of value than Monero because of momentum. Popularity alone doesn't make something a good store of value. But if there's a high likelihood that it will remain popular for a long time, that gives a lot of credence to it being a good store of value. 
Bitcoin has a lot of people who believe in it, and a lot of people who are working to improve it. Its a provably scarce asset that isn't controlled by any central entity, which means that when it gets big enough, its volatility should be substantially lower than centrally manipulated fiat currencies. It is easy and relatively cheap to transfer and store it on-chain (especially in comparison to gold and cash), and extremely cheap to transfer it on the lightning network. 
The thing that makes Bitcoin very likely a good store of value in my mind is that it has all this momentum, and by far the largest userbase of any cryptocurrency in a system with strong fundamental network effects. This means in order for another currency to overtake bitcoin, that currency can't just beat bitcoin, it has to beat bitcoin by a LOT. It has to be perhaps twice as useful as bitcoin or more in order to make it clear to everyone that they should switch over. And there aren't a ton of improvements that Bitcoin can't simply adopt itself if they're that valuable. 


Improvements are being made literally every day. There is absolutely 0 chance of "no improvements" being made.

I think that's the idea, eventually. Most transactions will be done via just 1 or 2 open channels per person, that stay open for months or even years. If everyone has 2 channels left open for a year on average, the LN could support 70 million transactors. 200 million after Segwit becomes active. It'll take some time to get that many people actually using it, so in that time a few maximum-blocksize doublings should also be safe to do. With 100 MB blocks (and/or equivalent optimizations), the LN should theoretically be able to support literally all 7 billion people on the planet.

There's some sign of it changing. Internet speeds do climb over time. But the comparison to airplane speeds is an interesting point. Its somewhat different with bandwidth, since the cost of aircraft speed climbs exponentially with the speed, whereas bandwidth is pretty linear.

This article says fuck all. It has no logic and just asserts things. The only way bircoin would strengthen the dollar is by forcing the dollar to compete with it.

But the dollar won't be bolstered by bitcoin somehow making it easier to get dollars. That just doesn't make sense.

The lightning network isn't expensive to set up.. You run a piece of open source software. Done.
And what, exactly, seems "too much like added centralization"? Do you just have the ability to smell centralization when it enters the room or what? Nothing about the lightning network allows centralized groups to control bitcoin's protocol direction or take your bitcoins. That's the most important centralization to stay away from - and the LN does stay away from it.
What you're complaining about is that Bitcoin Core (and MANY others) didn't support reduced security so that you could buy some coffee. The LN will allow you to buy as many coffees as you want, as fast as you want. You'll see in a few short months. This absurd argument will all be over once the LN takes off before the year's end.

Being able to store them in pretty big. It opens the way for banks to acquire bitcoin on their balance sheet (at least in Germany) as an investment. And letting them sell bitcoin is just another great onramp.
If banks start being able to insure deposits of bitcoin, that could actually be huge for traditional custodial banking. There's tons of people who aren't comfortable storing their own bitcoin, frankly because it isn't yet simple to keep your own keys securely and safely. "Not your keys, not your coins" is a good mantra for the tech savvy who want to make sure they're safe from government and bank shinanigans, but for the average Joe who trusts their government, storing Bitcoin is a mine field of security pitfalls.

Our brains are literally prediction machines. If you use that machine, you can reason out that a blockchain is only good for decentralized use, right? There's tons of company's trying to use it for stuff its not good at. Its a horrible centralized database. Also, a blockchain can't be sustained without something of value to pay for sustaining it (eg transaction fees and coinbase rewards in bitcoin to reward miners for building the blockchain). A blockchain is a very technology with a very narrow scope, and so it makes sense to have a narrow viewpoint of it. You can certainly use a viable blockchain for more than just currency, but a currency is a necessary piece of a blockchain, as many many people on this subreddit like to remind people.

There is no such thing as "merchants pay[ing for] the transaction fees" - a transaction is an interaction between two people.

You should be able to restore the wallet on a separate device/computer and send a transaction that uses the same outputs. Since there was no fee, it probably isn't in anyone's mempool and so you shouldn't even need to worry about replace-by-fee or CPFP. It shouldn't actually be difficult to recover your funds.

Even with the lightning network, to support 1 lightning channel for all 7 billion people, where each person on average opens only 1 channel per year, we'd still need on-chain capacity of over 220 tps, which would require blocks that are hundreds of megabytes each. Hopefully by the time we need blocks that big, we'll all have gigabyte per second connections.

Upfront costs will have a higher *percentage* of the total cost. An idea like this would not substantially raise the barrier to entry. Any everyday person that wants to spend around $1000 will still be able to profitably mine, just like is true today. So there's no reason to expect that fewer people would mine with this idea in place.

Making blocks bigger is a scaling solution. So is compressing transaction data. So is off-chain transactions via the lightning network. Segwit literally enables all 3 of those things. So yes, segwit is built with scaling solutions. The only other type of solution is sharding the block chain somehow, and that might be actually impossible without also fragmenting the security of each shard. So segwit is likely implementing scaling solutions in every possible category.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:17:38
Because blocks happen every 10 minutes and were limited to 1MB. Transactions are approximately 600 Bytes each, so 1MB/(600 Bytes)/(10 min)/(60 seconds/minute) == 2.77/second . Now that segwit is activated, average transaction size will decrease (not quite sure by how much) and additional space on the block is available. So transactions per second should about triple once more people start using Segwit transactions.

I assumed based on incomplete information. That's something others have talked about, so I guessed.
"Every possible" I assume is hyperbole for "most". Let's keep things literal, for our sanity's sake. Why wouldn't most transactions in someone's life be possible through the LN? 
1) tying up capital is only a problem if transactions are not possible through the LN, and I don't see why that would be the case if the LN becomes global
2) Topping up a channel should be one more on-chain transaction. But as the number of LN users goes up, the likelihood of people being paid via the LN goes way up, which means the need to "top up" a channel will become less frequent. 
The main problem I see is transactions between users who aren't online at the same time. I haven't seen a solution to this. But this problem doesn't result in "swamping the network". 
I don't think I understand the "mixed mode" you're talking about - why would the network be swamped with transactions? The way I see it, supply and demand economics will manage the use of on-chain transactions. People will be incentivized to keep their personal ratio of LN payments to on-chain transactions as high as possible. I think this economic pressure will manage things basically automatically.

Why can't you just send more btc into the main multi-sig account and update the commitment transactions? 


I don't see why that would be the case. Just cause you can't use the LN for everything doesn't mean you need to open and close channels more often at all. Just keep the channel open for anything you can use LN for. The use of other transaction modes shouldn't affect your need to open and close more LN channels at all. 


Well you might be right. And you're certainly right that we need every little bit of scalability we can get to reach worldwide bitcoin usage. I don't see that being a danger in any way tho - unless we compromise security for short-term capacity increases. Nothing about this can cause anything to "break down" - it just might be more expensive than we'd like or less convenient than we'd like.

This site says that the fastest confirmation you're gonna get is with a 450 satoshi/byte (or about .001 for a 220 byte transaction):  . If you don't mind waiting a couple blocks, you can cut that in half. And if your transaction is a segwit transaction, cut that in 1/4th again.

Ah, that does sound like it could work reasonably well. That has a downside tho - nodes would be basically required to make at least one of their channels connected to lexigraphically close nodes, or possibly all of their channels. This would severely limit the use of other channels, for example if people want to make direct channels with someone that isn't lexigraphically close for some reason, finding routes though that channel may be generally infeasible. 


Ok.. but why can't that process be decentralized? What's preventing that? 
For example, consider this method of assigning addresses:
1. When a node creates a new channel
1.a.i. If each channel partners are part of completely separate unconnected networks (which would be the case if a previously unconnected node was making its first channel), then each node counts their own network (either using public channel information or using a chain of size queries) and makes a claim for how big it is.
1.b.ii. Each node verifies the other's claim by traversing the public channel-connection information. This can be done probabilisticly so that liars are likely to be caught, while reducing the actual traversal necessary substantially.  
1.b.iii. The node with the bigger network is assigned as the parent.
1.a.iii. The parent gives it an address range to manage, from which the child node chooses an address.
1.a.iv. That child then declares itself new parent for its other channels and the process from 2b repeats for each of those channels (and that whole side of the network). The grandchildren can verify this is to-protocol by using the same probabalistic method used in 1.b.ii.
1.b.i. If each channel partner already has connections to the same network (which should be most of the cases), the one closest to the root is chosen as the new parent if that would bring the other closer to the root. If it wouldn't bring either closer to the root, then no reorg is done.
2. When a node closes a channel, this information should be propagated up the tree so parents know how many descendant they should have. 
3. When nodes are caught lying about information, they are charged with punishing someone in the chain that information came from. For example, if the number of descendants a parent has is found to be wrong (probably to a certain threshold degree), the partner who has been given incorrect information can demand the parent (information provider) punish someone for it, that parent can demand one of its children punish someone, etc etc, until someone is punished (eg by channel closing, but more nuanced punishments can be done). This way, there is an economic incentive to be honest and there is a mechanism to punish attackers that try to disrupt the network by lying.  
The above method can be extended into an array of trees, each assigning a different arrangement of parents (eg in 1.b.i, nodes who are already a parent in another routing tree would be excluded from being a parent again).
So my question is: am I missing something that fundamentally makes decentralizing address distribution much more difficult than it seems?

The only requirement for the LN to give Bitcoin more capacity is that the average channel does more than 2 lightning transactions. As long as that's true, the LN gives more capacity whether or not people are doing everything on it.

My protocol is this:
* I use NotepadCrypt to store my seed in an AES encrypted format: 
* To encrypt I use a password that I only ever use on my local machine (I don't use this particular password for any online websites at all)
* I store a copy of that encrypted file in multiple places: on a Blue Ray M-Disk in a fireproof safe that I keep unlocked, a usb keychain I keep on my keys, on my external hard drive, and on my phone. I also want to put that file on a family member's machine.
* Oh, and note that I also store information about the specific format used by NotepadCrypt so that if for some reason in the far future I can't use that program, I could program something myself to decrypt the file.
This protects me from most things: theft, fire, flood, drone strike. 
To protect those funds from memory loss or death, I've thought of the following:
1. Create a set of encrypted files each with a portion of the seed (and instructions on how to reassemble the seed)
2. Give each encrypted file to someone you trust - also give them the key to that encrypted file.
3. Keep a note somewhere that those trusted people will find out about in the case of your death. That note will identify who all the people are that have a piece of the seed so they can meet up and use the funds. 
This also protects you from memory loss since you can read that note yourself and find out who to ask to recover your funds.

Yes, but the cause of centralization is the time it takes to circulate the new block. The longer that takes, the more centralization pressure there is. If small shops can mine without validating everything, the risk their block will be invalidated is well worth the extra time they get - in most cases they'll have plenty of time to validate the entire block, without having to lose the time they could have spent mining against the miner that mined the last block (and their close connections).

From a contributor of Electrum:
"The current release (2.9.3), or the master branch, does not yet have segwit ready to be used on mainnet. It can only be used on testnet at the moment ...
I believe p2sh-p2wpkh type addresses (the successor of p2pkh, the current '1' type addresses) are fully implemented, but p2sh-p2wsh addresses (which would be needed for e.g. multisig) are not.
Hence, most users will need to wait for a new release of Electrum that at least enabled the currently implemented functionality on mainnet, and then create new "segwit" type wallets (to clarify, this means a wallet with new "seed words", as the current code implies that a wallet having segwit addresses is a property of the seed)."

I've looked into it and I haven't seen any technical proposal for adding funds, but I haven't read any white papers so maybe they're in there - iono. I do understand how LN commitments work tho, and I do know that if you trust your channel partner not to intentionally try to burn your bitcoins, simply sending to the main multi-sig account and updating the commitments should do it. Your channel partner wouldn't be able to take that money in any way, so the only incentive to mess with you would be blackmail.
I think you could eliminate even that minimal trust by creating a refund transaction that uses (as an output) the specific input you plan to send. That way you have the ability to claw back your new additional funds before you have to commit the funds to the blockchain, *and* there's no possibility of the person adding funds to take btc that haven't been added to it yet.

Me and a friend actually discussed this a while back. What you're talking about isn't possible on Bitcoin. And Etherum or rootstock won't help much either. The problem is that there are no secrets on a public block chain. In order to keep a secret, it MUST be private. The solution we came up with was to distribute these secrets to a large set of computers that would all have to reveal their piece of the secret in order to unlock the data and would only be paid if they did that after a certain time or condition. However, if there is any way to connect the secrets together and if the data is perceived to be likely valuable, it's always possible those computers will collude to get the data for themselves. 
In short, it should be far cheaper and more reliable to set up a private dead switch.

You could even say that attempting to "solve" the problem by blocking immigration is delaying progress towards a less socialistic world.

The fact that cheap credit exists is caused by the Fed. Credit companies wouldn't be able to loan out so much money in a bitcoin world, because no one's spitting out more money whenever banks and financial institutions "need" more to lend out. 
Cheap credit has lead to an irresponsible public to predictably overextend themselves and end up in debt cycles. Its incredibly [expensive to be poor]( These people should never have been offered credit in the first place. Then they wouldn't have years or decades of constant debt and could move up out of their situations. But with credit card BS, they get knocked back down every interest payment.

It almost feels like you didn't understand (or perhaps read) my comment. I didn't propose a system that didn't have credit and debt.
 &gt; Interest and inflation are intrinsically related.
No.. they are not inherently related at all. Only when you have a central bank that creates money when someone needs a loan are they at all related. That doesn't have to be our system, and loans do not depend on creating money from thin air. 


That's absurd. Use your brain please. The incentive is to earn more money than you had before. If you lend 1 bitcoin for a year at 1% interest, in a year you have 1.01 bitcoins. What more incentive do you need?


So if your risk means that your loan has a 1% chance of defaulting, then charge 2% interest. Its not complicated.


First of all, if you're going to argue about inflation, you should be more specific. In our current economic system, borrowing often creates both monetary inflation (as the central bank often creates more money as a result of bank activities than lend it out) and price inflation. I'm actually not sure which you meant there.
It does not create price inflation directly. Temporary price inflation may happen if the velocity of money goes up, but that's a result of the money being used faster than average, not a result of the loan itself. And that price inflation only happens once - its not the constant 3-6% you see year over year. If you had a society with no loans and then enacted a law allowing loans, you'd see a one-time increase in the average velocity of money, which would correspond with a one-time increase in price, after which you would see no more price inflation as a result of loans being available. Of course, loans have pretty much always been available, so I assume you think that year-over-year inflation is somehow intrinsically tied to money being repeatedly lent out. If that's what you think, you're incorrect.
And it may create price inflation if the central bank is involved in the lending or ends up loaning money to a bank because that bank has over lent and doesn't have enough reserves (or for some other reason). 


Loans do not increase overall purchasing power. The availability of loans give opportunities to spend to more people, so yes 


Most borrowing in no way increases the money supply. The Fed is who creates money supply, which they might do in the form of a loan. 


I see what you're saying, but you're using "money supply" incorrectly, which is confusing. What you're trying to say is that the velocity of money increases, which has many of the same effects that an increase in money supply does. 


There's no reason to believe a bitcoin economy would have "big, unpredictable swings" in the velocity of money. When so many people are using bitcoin, the averages smooth everything out. Only when bitcoin is small,  like it is now, can it be so easily influenced by a few large actors.

It was only actually gold backed until 1933. After that only currency exchanges could redeem the currency for gold, normal people or businesses couldn't.
The loss in the value of the dollar before then, and probably also until 1971 was that printing of the dollar actually devalued the gold itself! Because there was more currency running around than gold to back it, as long as everyone didn't ask for their gold (or possibly silver) all at once, the government could print more dollars and drive down the value of the dollar, which also meant driving down the value of gold.
This just hit me like an epiphany. The gold standard didn't work because the government could still devalue the gold by printing more money. Bitcoin on the other hand can't be printed arbitrarily, so doesn't have that problem.

Yes. Gold is so expensive that you can't carry small amounts of money around via gold because you will *lose* it. $20 of gold is half a gram, which is 5% of a cubic centimeter. Gold is difficult to divide accurately and difficult to count accurately (since you need to weigh it). Its also difficult to determine its purity. 


The desire to have a monetary policy is wrought from the desire of a government to print free money for themselves. Your average person doesn't need or want a nebulous monetary policy that is constantly shifting and changing via government manipulation of the currency and markets.


The companies you own stocks in have reserve money in dollars, and that reserve is depreciating at the rate of inflation too. So your stock investment still depreciates when dollars do. Someone is holding the bag for that depreciating money, and chances are it affects you regardless of whether you hold dollars yourself.

I agree that providing easy ways to be secure against death and amnesia are important and not readily available. I agree with others that have said multi sig is the right approach. This is my dream setup:
1. 2-3 hardware wallets used to create a multisig wallet, each with different keys backed up on stamped steel protected with passphrases stored in at least 2 physically safe locations (eg in your house and in a safety deposit box). This is already safe from all 10 of your enumerated points, but isn't safe from death, ammesia, or a video surveillance bug + physical theft of your hardware wallet.
2. In the same hardware wallet above, you also give time locked spendability to 2 or 3 of a number of other keys. These keys should come from public keys given to you by trusted friends or relatives, or a professional service built to help backup your wallet, or from a key you control that you put in plain text stamped on steal in a lock box. Also, you put into in your will do that if you die, there are instructions on how your trusted group of people can recover the coins. The time lock can be like a couple months, and you can have software that watches for transactions from those other parties, and if one happens you can override those transactions, kind of like how lightning works.
The above method should be secure to everything except video surveillance + physical theft. The only thing that can prevent this is my making surveillance harder (for example by using one of those mind reader devices - but then you could still use something like a key logger as an addition to get the necessary info), or making theft harder (eg by implanting your hardware wallet in your body). So you can get more extreme ; )

However, in order for a majority hashrate set of miners to pull off the attack you're taking about, the *vast* majority (in terms of numbers and machine resources) of nodes following that chain must be running clients configured to screw over the other chain.

Bitcoin has higher utility than the dollar (or any fiat). Therefore even just based on world currencies, bitcoin will be higher value. 
However, beyond replacing fiat, bitcoin will likely also replace [lots of other things]( Precious metals (eg gold and silver), low-yield investment instruments (government bonds, derivatives, and again .. ahem..  gold and silver). Also will replace remittances and credit cards which increase its value as a transferrence mechanism. It will be so much more than "just" a world currency. $10 million is a low bound for "highest theoretical value". I made a list here: 
Derivatives alone represent potentially over a quadrillion dollars. If all derivatives are replaced by bitcoin, that would mean a $50 million bitcoin.

I don't agree. You don't need hand holding customer support in order to have a good customer experience. Letting user experience go by the wayside is something companies often do when they get big enough, because they think they're invincible. Most companies don't look at the right metrics and just figure of they're still growing, they're fine. If they don't realize that they're not serving their customers very well and more, and the market environment changes, they can suddenly see a huge problem and don't know where it came from. 
You might make a little more money in the short run by skimping on customer service and UI development, but you're killing yourself in the long run.

Yes, but some forms of business are anti-competitive or are propped up by poorly thought out laws or outright corruption. Each exchange is still net positive, but suppressed competition means its much less positive than it would otherwise be. 


The fed itself is not a violent cartel, but they use the violent cartel that is the US government to their own ends. Coinbase does as well, to a much lesser degree.
Coinbase is abusing its market leadership for short term gains, and they'll eventually feel the pain of competition. But regulations (like KYC) suppress the competition and coinbase is exploiting the position they have that's protected by those anti-competitive government regulations. 
To put it differently, if person A pays you $15 for some product you made for $5, its a win win right? What would you think if person A threatened to kill the guy who wanted to buy your product for $30? Still think that'd be fair game?

It's really interesting to realize what I've of them said, that loan defaults are built into the system. Because there is never enough cash to pay back all the loans, defaults are inevitable, and the party can only go on as long as more new money comes into the system as new loans than is paid back. This obviously leads to the boom bust cycle and represents far more wealth theft than the inflation itself. I never realized that until this video. We are really being robbed blind by banks

You present a false choice. We don't have to choose between no SPV and almost all SPV. There is a wide area of middle ground. My calculations have shown that we should have about 10 million full nodes in order to make certain kinds of sybil attacks infeasible even for state-level actors. If the whole world is using bitcoin, that's still only just over 1/1000th of the population (1.25 1000ths to be exact). Of course, where we are today, we would ideally want everyone to run a full node.


I'm not sure I fully agree, but I see your point and I think I partially agree.


I disagree with that. A UASF is only prevented if only miners are running full nodes - that is not a scenario I'm proposing. If a full node required 3 raspberry-pis-worth of machine resources, your doomsday scenario would not happen.


I agree that is important. I think fraud hints help achieve that goal.

I got that. But *my* point is that if an attacker found 2/3 chunks of your key, they could trivially brute force the rest in a matter of days if not hours. That's the whole reason Shamir's secret sharing algorithm was invented. If it was that easy to securely split up a key, we wouldn't need Shamir.

What I was thinking is that if you have a bunch of pieces of a key that you only know fit together when *all* of them are on the chain, then you can distribute those key-pieces to a number of nodes (with duplicates for redundancy) and even if 99% of them submit the key, as long as no one can tell those parts relate then it could incentivize this to work properly. Let me lay out a simplified protocol:
1. Split key into X parts
2. Send each part to Y nodes
3a. After the specified trigger is detectable on-chain (eg no transaction from address A has been recorded in D days), the first node that submits a key-part gets a reward for submitting it iff all key parts get revealed
3b. If a node submits the key part early, that node doesn't get a reward and no node can be rewarded for that key-part
Now, one way people might try to exploit such a system is by going on a private network and sharing the key-parts around until the key can be reconstructed. They could still do this using this scheme, but as long as its impossible to tell which key-parts go with which other key parts without having *all* the key parts, it would be much harder to do something like create an underground marketplace for key-parts (since you'd have to reveal the whole part in order to find the rest of the people that have a matching part). If you were able to find matching key-parts without revealing your key part, then you could do bargaining swaps and make money from it. But if you can't, then you're just giving away the bag. 
If you had a single keep-alive address for all key parts, the keepers of the parts (the keymasters.. one could say) could use this address to easily find the other keymasters. But if each part had a different keep-alive address, and the transactions posted at random times (so as to not be associated) then they wouldn't be able to make any exchange. Of course, an agent of chaos could simply release their key part publicly so as to have whatever data its associated with known even without the trigger having happened, but only one of the key holders would have to behave in order for the protocol to work. 
At this point, I think I've convinced myself this could actually work pretty well. The problem is that it would be expensive. Each key part would require a separate trigger (which for a deadswitch means one transaction per timeperiod per key part). 
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:41:14


Yes, exactly like that bug. Ledger could have a bunch of bugs like that floating around and no one knows about them only because ledger is closed source. When an attacker finds out, still no one will know (except the attackers). That's not a good situation to be in. 
At least with Trezor, we know to use a passphrase to protect your coins from a physical threat. With Ledger, the same is definitely true (tho with what ease we don't know). You cannot protect information stored on a device from a physical threat with absolute security. An attacker can always theoretically pick apart the device atom by atom and find the information. But with a passphrase, it requires computational strength to crack the data, rather than just knowing where to look. 
That's not to say I approve of how Trezor (especially the founder) handled the situation, and its still a vulnerability that should be fixed. But I trust Trezor because the statistical likelihood is that more of their bugs have been found, and they have less bugs, purely because they have more eyes on the code, which is only possible because their designs are open source.
If Trezor open sourced their code, I'd buy one as soon as enough time had passed for audits to be done.

See how gold's price went up massively since 1933 and especially 1971? This certainly points to the destructive inflationary behavior of fiat, i think we can both agree. 
But the following chart is inflation adjusted:
The fact that the inflation adjusted price of gold has gone up since indicates that gold's price was depressed to about 1/4th the value it might have been for some reason. That reason, i would guess, is insolvent gold backed currency. Printing money still inflates the backing asset, and so even before the fed, fiat was destructive, tho perhaps governments were less brazen about it than the fed is.

No, no its not. 


Most people aren't good at research, are too lazy / not proactive enough to either record research for later use or refind things they've researched before, and too lazy to reexplain things they actually do understand well. Every community with points to discuss has this problem, not just r/bitcoin. Its human nature. So maybe what you really mean is that human nature is toxic. We could certainly do better, but how to get others to, I don't know.


You're very "credible person" focused. Many of the first-adopters of bitcoin are the "think and reason for themselves" type, not the "find credible-sounding experts to believe" type. The fact of the matter is that there are lots of real-life conspiracies and dodgy behavior in the financial system. I hope you're aware that "conspiracies" don't need to be intentional. [Unconscious conspiracies]( abound in this world, driven by perverse incentives caused by badly structured laws and institutions. And there is a real echo chamber in mainstream thinking, almost by definition (something only gets mainstream when its echoed around a LOT). New ideas cannot start out mainstream, and by the time they are mainstream, they're never still new. 
But speaking of that, "banks are evil" as a general idea is actually pretty mainstream. Pretty much all of the US democratic candidates are saying things along those lines. "Evil" is both vague and also an extreme thing to say, but the idea that Banks are causing harm and are at fault for not correcting themselves is a widespread belief by MANY "credible" people (for some definition of credible, for example, one that includes some politicians). 


You're welcome. But you should be more aware that literally *everyone* will say crazy things from time to time. That is human nature. If you invalidate every source because you can find a time they said something crazy, you will inevitably invalidate every source. One should examine people's logic and arguments, not their character and credentials.


That is not a falsifiable statement. If you're trying to be scientific about this, you need to identify factual claims that people can discuss. "Big banks rule the world" is a statement that is not discussable, because "rule the world" is so vague (just like "evil"). 
So I'm going to again ask you, what FACTUAL claim made by these "conspiracy theory" folks is something you take issue with? If you have no factual objections, there is nothing to discuss.


You say that as if the problems are inevitably on a similar level. The inflation and financial manipulation caused by fiat currency is highly destructive as it moves wealth to those that create money from literally everyone else who regularly interacts with that fiat currency. Banks lend out money they don't have and earn real interest on it that they then keep. Its theft plain and simple. And yet its legal. 
You want credible sources on this, how about this one with numerous other sources in its reference list:

But past history *is* indicative of what would be surprising or not in the future.


50k from 7.5k would be a 6x jump. Last run up (2016 -2018) was 100x. The one before that (2013 Q3-Q4) was 10x, the one before that (2013 Q1-Q2) was also 10x (combine those 2013 ones and its another 100x). Given that, I'm not saying we should *expect* another 100x (we should certainly expect less as time goes on), but something near 100x (say 50x) would **not** be surprising. It would also not be surprising if this was a transitionary period where the dynamics have changed and we don't see something near 100x. 
But 6x? We've never seen a run up anywhere near that small. Fyi, when I say run up - I mean something that reaches a new ATH not the meaningless sticks and candles from week to week.

Certainly possible. That's essentially accusing those organizations of fraud. By contrast, my understanding is that technically having a 1-to-1 match up of gold to gold-backed dollars was never the law, and over-printing money was all squeaky clean and legal as long as there was always enough gold paid out when people asked. Basically a fractional reserve system for gold. 
The question is, if a government tried pegging their currency to bitcoin (let's say this happens in a time when bitcoin has a more stable value), could they succeed in devaluing bitcoin? I would guess this could only happen to the degree that they could convince people to want their currency or force people to use their currency.

There's two ways:
1. Have your seed recorded in some kind of plain-text form (this can include a seed split many way using Shamir's secret splitting algorithm) with instructions on how to reform them and retrieve the money. 
2. Have a multi-sig wallet where your heirs control the keys, and multiple keys are required to move funds. This one is a little more tricky to get right, because you don't want your heirs colluding behind your back (I know you said you're not at risk, but still). Ideally there would be a timelock situation that allows you to cancel any transaction made by them if you're actually still alive. However there's no easy way to do that at the moment.
Both of these also require a will as usual. Both require you to regularly (eg once a year) double check that the keys are still in your or your heirs' possession.

What you're saying is that the majority of people are living from paycheck to paycheck. Looks like [you're right]( This is not good. I believe people have been taught that they don't have to live within their means, which leads to systemic problems in people's lives where they constantly get knocked back down as they try to get up - because [being poor is expensive]( Living meagerly for just a few months and saving up enough money to not have to deal with living month to month is SUPER worth it, but so many people don't seem responsible enough to sacrifice their social life or other non-necessities in order to break out. 
Credit cards are part of the problem in that they make it easy for people to over extend their means. Credit card companies are also one of the many reasons why it costs so much to be poor, since they charge 15-25% interest rates, gouging the poorest the most. 


I hope not. Freely available credit has been a disaster because most people are using it for non-necessities and non-business purposes. Credit should only be used when you can use that money to earn more than the interest you will pay OR if its an actual emergency.

\&gt;  private conglomorate banks in the USA vs Credit Unions 
Your weasel wording shows your bias. Both "conglomorate banks" and credit unions are private. The difference is who owns those private entities: the customers or someone else. Credit Unions are fantastic because they align the incentives so what's good for the bank is good for the customers, because the customers \*own\* the bank.
The swiss population does \*NOT\* own their central bank. Its the other way around. The swiss central bank, like the US Federal Reserve, is privately owned \- not even government owned. So in your analogy, the swiss central bank is like the US conglomerate banks, and is not like a credit union.
\&gt;  The Swiss are merely attempting to improve their infrastructure. Something that should be applauded instead of derided. 
That isn't what I was doing. But this referendum to give only the SNB power to create money doesn't even do what the title says it would do. The SNB is a private bank, not a public bank. So the only thing this would do is give a money\-creation monopoly to the private SNB. Even if the SNB was a public institution that obeyed strict policies passed by the legislature, its unlikely to improve the matter much when the money created by the bank (central or not, public or not) is not the people at large but rather "the government" or more likely the friends and cronies of the politicians in control.

Are you talking about a specific paper or article? Or is there a link that goes into more detail about that 'depth'?


Well, that's not true. Case in point: the lightning network requires using multi-sig.


But.. they would be able to use the solution I outlined. If you have no (trustworthy) friends, then you pay someone trustworthy to do it. 
There is no "ultimate solution" that doesn't require someone else. Like, I mean, you could get a key implant that is (almost) impossible to lose, but unless it also requires a password, its easy to steal (while you're asleep, by force, etc). And if you do have a password, its vulnerable to memory loss (hit your head, brain disease, death). There is literally no alternative to securing something with either "something you have" or "something you know" (or both). So in order to be safe from both theft and memory loss, you need to involve 3rd parties. 


I agree.


You mean some automatic system where you answer questions? What if you die? How do your benefactors inherit your coins? A third party is required to backup your coins so that if you die the coins don't just vanish.

Its just as easy to pay one (or more) services to do the same thing. If you really have no one you can trust, you could split up your key into 3 or 4 pieces (using shamir's secret splitting algo) and store each piece in a different bank's security deposit box. If those keys also had a locktime like I mentioend, not only would all 4 banks have to be aware of what you're doing and all collude together, but they would only be able to do so if you had actually died or were indisposed for the entire locktime.
You can use lock times both ways too - if people really don't trust themselves, they can have a week-long lock time on any transaction they send with just their own key, so that if someone steals their key and tries to steal their funds, the locktime would give them time to reverse the transaction (eg by using the recovery mechanism). This could be set up in a way where signing transactions with both the service's key and your key allows you to spend money instantly, but you might set daily/weekly/monthly limits on spending for yourself, with the ability to like, do a video call with someone at the bank if you need to go above your limit.

That's not how it works. Segwit gives us 4mb blocks first of all. Second of all (actually nearly 8mb is the theoretical limit). Also, it doesn't matter how many people continue to use non-segwit transactions, as long as there's enough segwit transactions to fill up 3mb of space, then the blocks will be ~4mb regardless of the proportion of people still using non-segwit transactions.

This isn't a fair comparison. You're comparing DCA to a lump sum of *all* days in the range. This would only be a fair comparison if I was recommending choosing a random day in the next year to buy all my bitcoin. But what I'm actually recommending is buying on the earliest day you can. I [changed the script]( to keep track of only lump sum purchases for the first 30 days. The results:
1 year - lump sum always under performed (30/30) (This is actually surprising to me, since looking at the historical price chart, the price 1 year ago doesn't seem that bad).
2 year - lump sum over performed 24/30 days
3 year - lump sum always over performed (30/30)
But even this isn't really a great comparison. What you'd really want to do is choose a couple ranges (say 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years) and then sweep a range of starting dates (say 2015 through 2018-10-08 for 1 year, 2015 through 2017-10-08 for 2 years, and 2015 through 2016-10-08 for 3 years), where for each starting date, you compare buying a lump sum to DCA over the chosen time period (1/2/3 years). Then you'd see an actual apples to apples comparison for each starting date and could use a count to see how often DCA out performs a lump sum purchase.
Beyond that, it would also be prudent to calculate expected return for this. Ie even if DCA outperforms lump sum purchasing 80/100 times, if the times it outperforms it only outperforms by a little bit, and the times it underperforms it does so by a ton, then that's something the simulation should reflect.

Oh so `S(N+1)` wasn't a function? You were saying `S*(N+1)`? This is unlikely to be acceptable with `S = 8 * block_reward`. Look at Bitcoin. `8*13.5 = 108 BTC = ~ ~1 million`. That means anyone who mines a block must stake $1 million. At the same time, it adds almost nothing to security. Bitcoin security is determined by its capital requirement, which is about $300 million. Adding $1 million to that increases security only by 0.33% - which is not worth the extra complexity.

Even tho that part isn't trustless, there still is a lot of reason for other parts to be trustless. The counterparty risk of keeping somebody's money is expensive, so removing that risk drastically lowers costs. It's likely that the Oracle's price is used to create the smart contact, rather than the smart contact actually using a live data feed (which i think you're right is not possible on bitcoin). This means the seller probably had a chance to agree on the piece given by the Oracle before committing to the transaction, which is exactly what you want. This isn't even any more trust than issue, since you need some source for determining price of sale. You can always check as many sources as you want before committing.

That's a good writeup showing you how to enable it, but it doesn't explain how it works.
I wasn't able to find a good explanation of how they work in their entirety. From what I gather from the sources I was able to find, this does not actually backup your node's state at all. This is evidenced by the fact that in the commit notes, they say ["We’ll now require all peers we connect to, to have the DLP (Data Loss Protection) bit set. This is required for the new SCB (Static Channel Backups) to function properly."]( Maybe you're aware that DLP is basically where your channel partner is expected to give you the latest state. So in this case, your channel partner is the backup.
So even the static channel backup isn't as static as it's name implies. The devs don't even plan on it being the primary backup - but only plan B or C if your other backups fail. This is no better than pre-commit backups - its just another backup location.

Others already have. Price movements are a consequence of the movement of maybe $100k/day on exchanges. This is often the same bitcoins being traded back and forth. Most bitcoins were acquired at much lower prices, and yet the market cap is based on nearly (within about 50% of) the highest prices bitcoins ever been at (the most recent sale). 
If another $10 million in buyers show up one day, they can immediately raise the price by 10% or more, which can trigger another manic bull run. That hype cycle brings in a ton of people, some small (but very significant) fraction of which will become actual users/holders, increasing the network value permanently. But the point is that only a tiny fraction of coins are being traded, so millions and not trillions are all it takes to substantially increase the market cap.

Hmm, looks like I did my calculation wrong. I was mixing weeks and days. We have:
* Daily trading volume of: $400 million
* Daily mining revenue of: $16 million
That means the halvening reduces daily supply by *less than* `8/400 = 2%`. Less than, because there's always more supply than what's actually traded. 


My understanding is that volume of $400 million is $400m bought and $400 million sold. Is that not right? 


A X% supply decrease can certainly cause the price to go up by much more than X%, as I noted in my first comment. It can also cause the price to go up less than that, depending on the shape of the market. 
However, a 2% change in supply is unlikely to make a huge difference either way. Even if its affect was 10 times the input, a 20% price rise isn't anything to phone home about in the bitcoin world.

@_date: 2019-10-11 04:51:32
You may not think you pay extra when you buy with a credit card - that's because stores have already increased their prices to cover the costs of taking credit cards. Most people have to pay higher prices even when they pay with cash, because most stores just display one price and don't bother with differential pricing. And in some places, charging extra for cards is illegal (tho giving a discount for cash probably isn't).  I guess most stores don't want to deal with the hassle of giving a discount for cash, or maybe they just don't think of it.
But the point is that the cost of credit is built into the prices of everything these days. Make no mistake, you pay significantly higher prices because credit cards are being used. The 1-3% you make back on your credit card \*does not cover it\*. And how could it? Credit card companies and banks have to make money on this stuff, and so they're definitely charging more than they're paying out. Looks like maybe an average of [2.5%]( of what you pay goes to the credit card system. Who feels good about their 2% cash back now?
We should make it part of the culture to offer discounts for people who pay with bitcoin. Its a good way to incentivize people to get off expensive and insecure payment methods like credit cards.

No. It's much harder to operate the same channel from many machines, because of the issue of state. It's important your node know the latest state. If all your machines have a very reliable way to ensure they're all on the same state, then sure. But it's likely easier in that case to run the channel on a single machine that you just connect to remotely from your arbitrarily many machines.

Supply will be halved, but that supply only represents about 2% of trading volume. The price will go up as a result, but not as much or as quickly as the last couple times.

Debt and credit has no problem in a zero inflation society. It's actually much easier to mentally think about credit when you don't have to worry about adjusting for inflation. Those who have money can invest it by letting other people borrow it with some agreed to terms, like has happened for millennia. Either equity is given in return or a bond is given, or some other instrument. We don't need banks to create free money for themselves for credit to work. 
Governments honestly should not be borrowing money except during emergencies (war, enormous natural disasters, not very many other things). Governments should instead only use a fraction of their taxes such that they keep an emergency reserve they can use to weather business cycles. The government's job is not to make money, so it shouldn't be taking loans.

Its important to distinguish a country from its government. 


Yes, the reason a government prints money is so they can use it (whether toward creating a government, or to appease a politician's cronies). 


No matter what you do, a country's resources are limited to what is inside that country. Being able to print money doesn't change that. It only changes *who* controls which resources (ie it allows the government to take resources for their own use from the people). 


When there is a market crash, people tend to sell the assets they think are part of that crash and will go down. Bitcoin is not a stock or bond and is very uncorrelated to those traditional market assets. I can't tell you for certain that you're wrong here - people might irrationally sell bitcoin as well in a self-fulfilling prophesy, however it would be irrational since its so uncorrelated with those kinds of things. 


It does matter. Long term value always wins eventually. Betting against something that will have long term value can earn you money only if you're incredibly lucky, but all others will lost their shirt. 


That may be all *you* care about, but it certainly isn't all that matters. 


Its absolutely more stable than zimbabwe dollars. But it isn't as stable as USD yet. You can see by looking at a chart of [bitcoin's volatility]( that its volatility has decreased over time. The larger its market cap gets, the less its price can be manipulated (intentionally or unintentionally). IE the larger it is, the more predictable it is.


I strongly disagree. It takes away the ability to print money from central banks. That's a huge win. And you didn't at all show that bitcoin is *more* controllable than dollars. Its quite clear it is less controllable.

I can think of a way to do an "ultimate backup". Imagine a multi-sig wallet with the following properties:
1. The owner can spend with just their own personal key.
2. One or more third parties can spend by using 2 of their private keys after a timelock (eg 4 third parties can spend by using 2 keys only after a timelock of 30 days).
Those third parties can be friends, family, banks, or whatever. If the owner loses their key, they can go to these third parties and ask them to help him retrieve his funds. They can spend to somewhere and after 30 days, he'll have his money back.
If a type 2 spend happens without the owner's approval, it gives the owner 30 days to realize the spend is pending and send their money elsewhere if there was some kind of error or attempted theft. The owner can set up a watchtower to check for him, or can just rely on going online at least once every 30 days. 
So in a similar way to how lightning channels are trustless, this setup would be a trustless backup where backup transfers can only happen if the key is actually lost. Of course you still have to trust a couple parties to not collude against you once your key is lost, but its much better than losing your money entirely.
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:14:52
This would have the most effect if all that new supply is put up for sale. Current volume is around $400 million traded per day, so the halvening reduces this by about 15% (percentages matter here, not raw volume). How much this could shift the price is anyone's guess. It is likely to push up the price by more than 15% tho, because a small push upward will likely trigger more bandwagon buying. This could be the catalyst for another run up spike. If it's anything like previous spikes, Bitcoin will go up to $200k, which puts it into the trillions in market cap, just under gold. 
We'll see if this run is like previous ones. We should expect less spectacular runs each time now tho, percentage wise.

@_date: 2019-10-11 05:51:18


Credit card fees that businesses pay usually comes in two chunks, the flat rate per-transaction chunk, and the percentage rate. So hypothetically, this might be something like 35 cent + 3.5% per transaction. So a $1 transaction would have a 38.5 cent fee and a $5 transaction would have a 52.5 cent fee. Businesses also have profit margins - so if their profit margin is only 10%, they wouldn't even be making money by selling something for $5 at that rate ^ - all the profit would go to the credit card system. 
Btw, I've never seen a $5 minimum - only $10 minimums.

I'm telling you that you're shooting yourself in the communication-equivalent of a foot by using a definition of proof of stake that is so abnormal as to be unrecognizable.

@_date: 2019-10-21 05:38:50


Yes. My definition is only that proof of stake requires owning coins in order to mint blocks, and the more coins you own give you a higher likelihood of getting the chance to mint a block. 


I don't know what criteria you're using - that's why we're talking past each other. 
I'm going to take a couple of your statements and implications and respond to them:


PoS systems don't require master nodes. 


You can design a PoS system that does not require any minimum stake. 


Why do you think that?


The same can certainly be true for PoS as well. In fact, its far easier to stop a mining operation than a minting node because mining operations are generally much larger and use physical resources that can be tracked using information about power consumption in an area (while PoS uses no significant resources).
@_date: 2019-10-14 15:06:29
You don't need a full node for that.
@_date: 2019-10-29 21:32:07
It *over* encourages that. It means people are forced to make bad investments, because those bad investments are better than holding a depreciating asset.

@_date: 2019-08-10 01:59:43


You're right. I misread.




CPI is purposely manipulated. Its a garbage indicator meant only to mislead people into thinking everything's ok.


I don't disagree with you. But the value of the company certainly includes the value of cash on hand. And *that* value is depreciating. 
The point is *someone* is always holding those dollars. And so *someone* is constantly holding the bag for that depreciation. That depreciation means that anything you buy from those someone's is commensurately more expensive because of it. You can't make the problems of inflation go away by saying "well I don't hold dollars".
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:38:48


I think this could be explained a bit better. Every full node is peers with at least 8 nodes, and this sounds like it's implying that some full nodes aren't peers with anyone. I think it would be worth adding that nodes only send the transaction initially to their outbound connections (8 rn), and not to any inbound connections they might have.

Ok I'm picking up your sarcasm, and you have a point. Your lightning channel probably stores a lot less coin than your trezor.


The solution I'm talking about is not "centralized". It's as distributed as you want it to be. 
Ok so if you want to create a backup that can survive your death and survive amnesia, you could have an implant that has your key in plain text. Then youd need surgery to put it in and surgery to get it out.
And that won't protect you from murder.
The thing is, a key must always be stored in plain text somewhere, whether that's on paper or in your head. The question is: how difficult is it to get that key if you don't want someone to? For the foreseeable future, storing it in your head is as good as it gets, but that is also lost if you die or get amnesia.

PoS does not mean inherent centralization. As long as there's a free market for bitcoins, anyone could get in. Mining equipment isn't cheap either you know. And there's tons of inherent centralization pressure in PoW (latency related centralization, electricity price centralization, other profit margin based centralization). PoS doesn't have those kinds of centralization.
It looks like this particular PoS method might centralize things a bit tho, since it essentially requires a minimum amount of money in order to mine a block. Most PoS protocols only make it so having more stake gives you a higher probability to create a block (just like having more hash power does).

Are you talking about price inflation or monetary inflation? Price inflation is a result of a critical market signal that is important. Without it, people wouldn't know more things are demanded. Monetary inflation is bad because it steals wealth from currency holders, especially how much wealth is siphoned off by the fed to feed their inflation engine. Changes in monetary inflation make it worse.


So what? Inflation steal transfers wealth from currency holders to bankers and causes awful market distortions, business cycles, and recessions at the same time. The fact that financial markets can exploit these things has nothing to do with my point, which is that inflation is bad for the people, bad for the economy, and a corruption of the engines of government. 


You're wrong. Inflation siphons off the value of cash at a constant rate. Any company you hold stocks that has any cash reserves is worth less because of inflation. Any bond you hold that isn't tied to inflation will be paid back in money that is worth less because of inflation. Any savings you have in the bank is worth less because of inflation. Inflation doesn't just disappear because *you* happen to not be holding fiat currency directly.

Born and bred Londoners are by far the ones committing most of the crime. While immigrants move to the poorest areas (which are always the more dangerous areas) because they themselves are poor, crime by immigrants is almost universally lower than crime by area natives, and this is true in the uk as well. The places with the highest immigration inevitably had higher crime before immigrants got there, but since immigrants have come in, [crime in those areas has slowly decreased] (
So if you want less crime, maybe invite more immigrants into your country. Face really and for God's sake do some fucking research.

Gold's use in electronics and jewelry is absolutely not anywhere near enough to justify its $7 trillion total value. Gold is valuable because it's valued as a store of value that just sits in vaults without being physically utilized at all. If gold weren't held as a store of value, it would probably just be worth maybe as much as 10 times copper's value (of 23 cents per oz) at like 2 dollars an oz, rather it's actual price of $1500/oz. Less than 1% of it's value comes from it's use.
People compare bitcoin to gold because they share many of the same properties. They're both super durable and basically can't go bad over time, they're both relatively scarce, neither follow the same price pattern as the stock market, and they're both actively used as a store of value and hedge against the market. So, lots of reasons.

If you're investing more than you can afford to lose, you're doing it wrong. DCA *will* on average make you but in at a higher price for an asset that's increasing in value vs buying in one lump now. Lowering the variance is only really good for making you fomo less. I mean, if we're in a price spike, maybe DCA can save you from buying too much at the top. But we're not in a spike. And if you think bitcoin has a good chance of going lower before you plan on selling it, then why are you even buying bitcoin? DCA doesn't help that.

Value is not the same as price. Pegging the value of a piece of paper to something valuable like gold only works if people trust the entity that creates and circulates those pieces of paper. For a corrupt government like Venezuela pegging their currency to Bitcoin, or any currency, would cause a huge gap between price and value because while the legally mandated price must match the pegged asset, the amount people value that currency would be far less. This is [Gresham's Law]( - bad money chases out good money. People try to get rid of their bad money as fast as possible, and hold on and don't spend their good money. This causes [problems]( and is why most countries moved away from pegged currency exchange rates. In extreme cases, organizations and individuals that are forced to follow the law would be forced to accept a garbage currency or shutter their doors. Many would shutter their doors because of this.

But that is correct. You only pay taxes on your earnings. However, like you mentioned, an earnings or loss event happens every time you sell or transfer it. Theoretically they want every one of those events connected to a buy/receive event so the earnings can be exactly calculated. Just like in normal life tho, only an accurate ballpark matters to them, and small things left out shouldn't be much of a problem.
But this mess is why it's important that bitcoin be classified as a currency and not an asset, so that at least when you buy things with it, you don't have to worry about taxes.

Can you please stop being an arrogant POS for one second and listen to a prospective customer? I WANT to buy a coldcard. A lot of the design that I *can* see looks great, especially in comparison to competitors. But telling me I'm  confused, that I'm building a straw man (which you're using incorrectly and clearly haven't actually looked up), and that I "don't understand hardware" (even tho I went through college for electrical and computer engineering) is going to lose you a customer - and possibly anyone else that reads these comments and doesn't want to buy products from a company that think its ok to belittle their customers. 
I'm giving you one more chance to lose the bad attitude and actually engage with me like a professional adult. 


What don't you get about "open source design"? Open source means you publish the design so others can read, use, and modify it. Open source design shouldn't require anyone buying things to be able to review your design.


Again, I'm sure as shit not going to pay you money in order to be able to verify your "open source" hardware design. 


Even if I do all those things, I have only verified that your PCB design is compatible with the two parts you mentioned. I have not verified anything about how those parts are connected together. This makes it much more difficult to, for example, tear down a coldcard and verify that every element is what you say it is - because there is no parts list to verify against. 
Are you really telling me that coldcard has an open source hardware design because I can buy a coldcard and solder different pieces together? Where's the documentation that lists even those two parts? I already pointed out to you that the documentation you yourself linked to *does not* contain one of the two parts you claim is used in a coldcard. 
If you (yet again) ignore most of my comment, the one thing I want to know from you is: are you claiming that coldcard's hardware design is open source?

If it's easily derived, it's useless for security. Leave it out. 
Your idea is interesting in that it provides a form of redundant backup. However, there's a number of additional problems with it:
1. The user still has to remember their password. If they lose it, they have no recourse. This means they're still solely responsible for their backup, which kind of defeats the purpose you set out for.
2. If someone finds your password, they can steal your seed. The whole point of a seed (vs a brain wallet) is that you need both to gain access to the wallet. If finding the seed is trivial for someone that knows the password, then the seed doesn't provide you any additional security.
Good security means using something you have (usually a seed that's much too long to remember) + something you know (your passphrase).
I think the best back up would utilize time locks. You have full control over your wallet with your own keys backed up however you want, but if you lose your keys, someone else (a quorum of friends/family/services) can initiate a transaction with your wallet that will take months to complete and can be cancelled at any time if you still have access to your keys. That way you could have a bank (or 3) have the ability to retrieve your funds if you lose your keys, but if they collude and try to steal your funds, you have plenty of time to realize it and cancel the transaction.

Of course you buy on an exchange. Then you take those coins off the exchange ASAP. 


I don't know about that, but *all* custodial exchanges are suspect. People got the picture after the Mt. Gox incident - don't trust custodial exchanges any more than you have to. Gox wasn't the last exchange to pull an exit scam either. If you actually care about cryptocurrencies, you care about security.

A "place" doesn't create currency. A government is what creates currency like that. And the government doesn't want to back something in gold or btc because that government wants free money, not sound money. Fiat money is just another way for a government (or a central bank in the US's case) to extract value from the people. If people could demand bitcoin for their currency, the government wouldn't be able to extract much value from them.

A. If bitcoin wanted to choose a blessed few sidechains to do this with, it would work, right?
B. I can imagine a protocol where a sidechain would be required to register using some kind of transaction that records information about how to connect to the network (eg a DNS record or list of IPs) and would use a standard protocol to allow bitcoin nodes to verify cross-chain transactions via SPV. The info could be updated by majority agreement on the sidechain if need be. 


If the above was done directly, the cross-chain transactions would compete with normal bitcoin transactions, and any cross-chain transaction would require validation of block headers for the side-chain to some depth, and validation of an SPV proof or two. Nodes could decide which chains to continuously follow (because cross-chain transactions happen frequently enough) and which ones to only evaluate when they happen. 
However, you could put a level of indirection on this - where only one side chain is directly supported, and that sidechain then supports any number of sub-chains. Then if any coin is going from one side-chain to another, and doesn't need to go onto the main bitcoin chain, then it won't compete with normal bitcoin transactions. I could imagine that the middle side-chain could even potentially batch cross-chain transactions to minimize how frequently a node needs to evaluate SPV proofs for the sidechain.

Regardless of *how* it rises, the fact that it does and will rise is not at all surprising. The price of bitcoin will lead its actual current-day value because that's how markets work - they're prediction mechanisms. And Bitcoin will be worth a TON someday, be it in 5 years or 25.

How easy or mutually beneficial it is is irrelevant. Lightning is safe because you always have the opportunity to reclaim your funds without your channel partner's help.


A. Don't trust, verify. Any backup you keep should be verified regularly.
B. You assert this, but unless you have any supporting evidence, I'd say you're projecting. People trust others with important things all the time.
C. That's also why you wouldn't put trust in any single person. You'd have many participants so that if a couple fail you're still good.
D. If you store one key plaintext in a bank vault that's necessary to make any transfer, the individuals you ask to participate can't even collude if they wanted to. Your fear of giving "a piece of a key" to a 3rd party is entirely unfounded.


What is that? Storing a plain text key in a secret location? That's security by obscurity and is a bad idea. What if someone comes across it? Or sees you hide it? What if you store the location in a bank and the bank decides they want to steal it? Yes this method is safe from death and amnesia, but fails in other important ways.


Keymaster is not a backup solution, it seems to be some kind of multi-factor payment method. The "recovery service" can help you in case you lost one of your keys, but can't help you if you lost all of your keys, say like what would happen if you wisely passphrase protected them all and then got ammesia.

Perhaps. But many buys are holders, tho probably not the majority. 


Large investors tend to hedge. They sell most, not all in situations like that.


I don't believe I made that point. Some people are educated enough to not sell, not sure about most. 


That's not accurate. Price movements like that have nothing to do with the people that *aren't* buying and selling in the market. If you have a lot of holders who buy once and then exit the trading market for years, it means a relatively small number of people are determining "the price". If a lull in buyers comes up or some kind of selling pressure, that can push prices down regardless of how many people are holding.


You're still thinking short term. Mass adoption of bitcoin will mean recessions are rarer and milder because you won't have central banks manipulating the market causing huge swings in the business cycle by borrowing on (and stealing) our future. 


You said the oligarchs all sold. So how would they win if Bitcoin becomes a world currency? The winners would be the holders, which in your thought experiment would be basically everyone except the rich and the poor - the middle class. 
Regardless, your point is that the rich will still make money. Of course they will. However, they'll be prevented from using the power of money printing to do it. They'll make less over time, and we'll all be better off for it.

Also, many people get depressed working from home all the time, cause it means they have less human interaction. But it would certainly help traffic if companies allowed working from home a few days a week, tho I'm skeptical it would allow people to really love much farther away from work.
In fact, the fact that people live so far from work these days is a major cause of traffic, since people have more road miles to drive every day. The cause of this is not enough housing being built in areas where the jobs are. Lack of housing is the main problem with housing.

Because they're using bitcoin as some kind of get rich quick scheme. 


You're talking about it like the experiment is over. The experiment hasn't even really begun. The technology is still very incomplete. Bitcoin isn't about today, its about the future. 


Well, I don't know what you're intending "financials" to encompass, but the person you responded to was not talking about making money buying bitcoin, so that line of thinking is irrelevant. 
If by "financials" you're including the relative monetary policies of fiat vs bitcoin, then anyone that understands how inflation works knows why bitcoin's policy (of steady, predictable, and temporary inflation) is far better than the best of fiat currencies. But to see it, you can't look at bitcoin's very short history to see "proof" that it works, you have to think into the future.

Correct. The model would be the same as the normal bitcoin network. Nodes may have incoming connections (if they have a public port) and outgoing connections, and all information is forwarded through those connections. Most nodes aren't public and so don't have incoming connnections. *All* SPV nodes are non-public, and so only have outgoing connections. This is why its important that the number of connections nodes make is high enough - to the tune of at least 13 connections (which is what [the Erlay paper]( recommends). 
You wouldn't want random nodes connecting to your SPV node for exactly the reason you mentioned - that would open you up to unmitigated spam. 
If you have long-lived connections, you can ensure that they're sending you data consistent with what all your other connections are sending you, and if they aren't, you can figure out whether they're bad-actors and should disconnect from them. This is already how the bitcoin network works, and it works well. There's no reason SPV nodes should work differently with respect to how data is propagated through the network to them.


You're right. I like calling it a "fraud hint". Regardless, I'm claiming that fraud hints are better than fraud proofs for all the downsides you mentioned of fraud proofs. Fraud hints on the other hand are simple, not error-prone, and can be done as soon as we start using UTXO accumulators.

Well, not ever. Shor's Algorithm will never be able to break sha2 hashes. Of course, that's not to say no algorithm will be discovered that can - only that one hasn't. Grover's Algorithm improves the number of operations needed on a quantum vs classic computer, however not enough to really break things. You only need to double the size of hashes to make it just as hard on a quantum computer. Also, quantum computers will not be capable of the 2^128 operations necessary to execute Grover's Algorithm in the forseeable future (likely many decades).

What do you mean by that?


I know that argument, but
A. If your system has centralization that needs to be "broken", your currency has already likely been disrupted to an unacceptable degree. A good cryptocurrency should never have that much centralization (after an initial bootstrapping phase).
B. Breaking such centralization can be prohibitively expensive.
C. PoW models are substantially easier to centralize (eg one entity gaining 51% of the hash power) than some PoS protocols. Meaning the centralization itself can be even less of an issue for PoS. 


Maybe I'm talking about something completely different from what you are. Because to me, a server is in no way a PoS system in any respect. Can you please define what you mean by a PoS system?
The definition I've been working with: A proof of stake system is a cryptocurrency where the right to mint a block is given to someone with a probability based on the fraction of the total coins that person owns and is using for the process. 
Since a server isn't a cryptocurrency, it can't be a PoS system. Which is why i took that for a metaphor.

The method you describe of cutting a single key into pieces has the exact same flaw. Quantum computers could break that just as easily (easier in fact, since there's only one key to break). The method you describe also has other massive flaws, like the fact that even having a single piece of the key makes it enormously easier to brute force. If there are 12 shards, having just one shards makes it literally a million times easier to crack (6 orders of magnitude).
The method you describe is not genius, it is not secure, and no one should do it.

You're right, that is a better example.


Its not quite a fear of losses, it could be lots of things - a desire to do something with that money now, an unwillingness to use math or an unfamiliarity with the mathematical techniques to evaluate it, or simple laziness. Its also an odd consequence of a one-time question about that. If you had people do this repeatedly (say 10 times in a row) they'd probably change their choice. 
Regardless, those situations all boil down to a case of imperfect information. They think they're choosing the right choice for themselves. They think that choosing $100 over a chance of $500 maximizes their money. This means they *are* indeed rational, regardless of whether their evaluation was incorrect. Rationality is someone trying to do best for themselves, not perfect execution. 


It concerns itself with both. In economics, you can't know the outcome unless you know the goal. Behavior and goal are intertwined.

True. Even for those people, there's a limit to how much money they're willing to spend to help the network. 


Again, I don't agree. I think answering the next questions will illuminate why.


I see what you're saying, but I think its not a good metaphor. Yes obviously if you have 1 miner or 1 staker/minter, then your system is centralized. That's not necessary tho.


Are you talking about Ethereum's Casper protocol? Casper is a hybrid PoW/PoS system. Ethereum does not currently use that, but rather is pure Proof of Work. I'm not sure how this adds to your point.


Casper does use quorums that can lead to persistent capture of the system. I certainly don't trust the Ethereum folks to be decentralized enough to not have a captured quorum. However, bitcoin's distribution absolutely would be plenty decentralized enough to not have this problem. I would be surprised if you're talking about quorum capture here tho, so I'm curious what you're talking about.


No its not. Just like someone with 10% of the bitcoin hashpower should mine 10% of the blocks in a PoW system, someone with 10% of the coins should be able to mint 10% of the block in a PoS system. In order to be able to mint blocks, instead of purchasing ASIC mining hardware you purchase coins in the system. The parallels are clear. PoS is not centralization of any kind. *Some* PoS protocols may effectively centralize things, but that is not a requirement of Proof of Stake. 
You've used a lot of metaphors to make your point, but you've left out specifics. Like, why do you think PoS is just a server group? It most certainly is not.

Inflation doesn't need to be "massive" relative to Venuzuela in order to have a huge problem. The M1 money supply in the US, for example, more than tripled in the last 20 years ([source]( What does that mean? That means the Fed created $2.7 trillion. The fed stole 71 cents of value for every dollar that existed in 1999. This represents value it took from the US public and any other holders of dollars. That's $130 billion per year stolen from the public. 
Take a look at the list of the world's [most profitable companies]( None of them make that much per year. The Fed's money printing is big business, and it has enough to share it among all the big banks. What are they doing to earn the largest amount of money of any company in the world? Allegedly "stabilizing" the dollar via market manipulation. Likely they only make things worse with their reactionary responses. Even Ben Bernanke admits the Fed caused the great depression ([source]( as much as I hate to link to something written by Krugman).
That free money can buy a lot of influence for bankers and their friends, multiplying that $130 billion by some unknown amount via regulatory capture and unfair advantage given to banking institutions that regularly fail to act in their customer's best interests or even keep themselves solvent. Now the Fed is being used to bail out the repo market. Large scale market manipulation like this is illegal for anyone else but the Fed.


Sounds like classic FUD to me. Where does this idea come from? What "dramatic action" are world tyrants on the brink of in your mind?


A. Bitcoin is not a deflationary currency. Eventually it will be a non-inflationary currency - none will be created, ie no monetary inflation. The only deflation will be as a result of economic growth (ie products becoming cheaper because we're more efficient at making them). So deflation would be maybe 5% at worst (actually at best since sustained economic growth is good). 
B. Regardless, people would be taking on a lot less debt in their normal day to day lives, since debt, as you point out, would be much more expensive. That's a *good* thing. People need to stop living outside their means.

I've come up with a hybrid PoS+PoW approach before, and it can certainly raise the cost of attack. I wrote a protocol [here]( that describes it and calculates the attack cost. However, while you can improve the attack cost over pure PoW this way, I discovered inherent limitations caused by the inclusion of PoW in the protocol. Basically when you include probabilistic PoS mechanics and the inherently probabilistic PoW, the weakest one mostly determines the security (attack cost). 
However, your PoS method requires a predefined stake requirement S. How could that be determined appropriately? If S is too low, then it's as if there's no staking requirement at all, and if S is too high than mining is centralized to just those Rich few who have that amount. If the function S is not defined just right, it will cut out miners at dangerous times leading to drops in hash power that makes attacking easier. There needs to be a dynamic way to determine what S should be. 
I eventually concluded that a hybrid protocol is strictly worse security-wise than a pure PoS one. While you can get maybe 10 times greater attack cost for a hybrid protocol, you can get 200 times the attack cost with pure PoS. I wrote up a description and analysis of it here:  . 
I should mention that you analysis of attack cost isn't accurate. You seem to be assuming that it only costs the block reward to mine a block. This would be true in a rental attack scenario where you could rent efficient Bitcoin mining hardware, perhaps in the cloud. In reality however, renting such equipment isn't possible and it's quite unlikely to ever be possible because of the specialized nature of bitcoin mining hardware. It takes a ton of capital to gain enough mining power to revert a block. The cheapest way is probably to purchase about 33% of the current hashpower, use selfish mining to maximize the number of blocks you receive, and drive out 33% of the honest hashpower so you then have 50% and can perform an attack. This requires hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. Of course, that mining equipment would be earning money just like any other miner, so it's not necessarily all "cost", but reverting a block doesn't actually cost the attacker anything. They're probably reverting a block they didn't mine, which actually means they potentially can earn more in the future by orphaning it (when the difficulty readjusts without adding in that block). So in short, you're not calculating the right attack cost. 
Your capital requirement for attack is hundreds of millions of dollars + S(5). S(5) needs to be also hundreds of millions in order to have any significant impact on how difficult it is to attack. Maybe S = $10,000^(10*N) and S(5) is 1 billion. However that's a super weird function that really changes the randomness of mining for anyone that doesn't want to stake more than $100k. I don't know that consequences of that.
Anyways, I like that you're thinking about this stuff, but there's a lot to consider in this space.

You basically create a lightning-like channel with 8 channel partners (the federation), and to send a utxo to someone else (it must be a full output) you simply give that person the private key for that output and trust the federation to only respect signatures using that private key that come from the latest recipient of it. Actual lightning channels can be built on top of this to allow you to split outputs and limit direct interaction with the federation (which would likely be associated with some fees that are smaller than bitcoin but larger than the LN).
The trade off is that you can send your outputs directly to anyone (instead of just your channel partner in the LN), but your funds can be stolen if all 8 federation members collude with a previous output owner to steal the output from the current owner. The upside of that theft scenario is that the theft must be recorded in a blockchain (separate from bitcoin's) so there is proof the actors colluded. What that means is that if you can enforce these channels legally, there needs be far less trust than you would give to a fully custodial system like a bank, PayPal, or venmo, and no single point of failure. 
So the trust level needed is somewhat higher than the LN, but gives much better scaling properties. If the LN has the liquidity problems some say it will, statechains could be a saving grace.

What is the premise of bitcoin if not having a global currency? 
The reason why people talking about taking down banks is that banks are using inflation in order to take money from the people. They often then use this ill gotten wealth to corrupt national governments and do tons of nefarious things. Bitcoin won't get rid of banks, but it will get rid of that corrupt power to create money for themselves without providing anything useful to the economy. 
Ending currencies is very related. Why would you want to accept a currency that depreciates over time? Why use a type of currency that has more often than not died a horrible economy-killing death (eg venuzuela)? 
In another 10 years, bitcoin will be easier to use than cash and credit cards. All the usability problems we see today will have been solved and volatility will have disappeared as adoption grew. 
You seem to think the above is impossible. What makes it impossible?

That's not correct. That's "deflationary spiral" thinking.

These both increase the network value of bitcoin. People don't death grip everything that increases in value.

So this is not a novel idea. I did think of a novel solution about a month ago tho:
Basically nodes will require proof that someone in the payment chain was punished in some way for significantly delaying their payments (channel closure, being put on a blacklist, etc). We determined that it's not possible to identify the offending node, but it is possible to identify a channel of an offending node, which can then be punished in some way.

But, thinking about it more, you're right that if the attacker nodes on the mining majority only send transaction data to SPV nodes, full nodes wouldn't have the data to create a targeted fraud hint (or fraud proof). That could be a problem, because the SPV node might have to fully validate the whole chain to know which nodes are being deceitful, and it might not have anywhere near the resources for that. 
This would be a situation where the vast majority of users decided to screw over a minority chain. It seems very unlikely in the first place. However, even so, to do this requires that SPV nodes *can* get the transaction data when they ask, and the data is consistently withheld from full nodes. That would be very difficult to accomplish given the right countermeasures. For example, if full nodes receive valid headers but can't obtain transaction data via the full-node network, they could start asking their SPV connections for it. Maybe a single SPV node couldn't serve even 1/100th of the transactions happening in that fork, but each could serve a tiny bit if full nodes are asking for it. Even a tiny bit from 1000 SPV nodes could serve the data to the fullnode network well enough to create targeted fraud hints (or proofs). 
There are solutions to the problems you're bringing up. It just takes some effort.

Its a matter of scale - the more people that could be traced to the coin, the harder it is to effectively block any particular coin. If your pool of anonymity is only 1000 people, they're much more likely to be subject to stuff like this than if its a pool of a million or a billion people.

No its not. Paying rent is usually better than paying a mortgage that has interest. Now, if you buy a property outright (no loans, no mortgage) then you do better than renting.   
Painting landlords as some kind of evil demon isn't a logical argument. Landlords provide land, there's nothing wrong with that. What's wrong is telling an entire country or the entire world that taking out a $500,000 loan you can only pay off after 30 years is a good idea. Debt like that is not good, it shouldn't be normal.

You periodically ask them to sign a challenge so you know they still have access to their key. In the future when we use our key as an identity mechanism, we'll be signing challenges every time we send a text or make a phone call, so it will be immediately obvious to everyone involved if they lost their key. 


In this backup mechanism, you're doing both. You're taking care of it yourself *and* you're asking other people to take care of it if you failed to take care of it yourself. You're not giving anything "away". It would not limit your access to your money, it wouldn't put distance between you and your money, or force you to deal with family politics at all. You of course would have to take the time to explain it, but that's why you choose responsible intelligent trustworthy friends or family, not necessarily your mom. 


What is the "trust" here that you're worried about? Are you worried that your friends and family will collude and steal your money? How would they do that when you have months to reverse any underhanded transaction they make? Are you worried they won't be responsible with their keys and will lose them? That's why you regularly verify. The method I laid out has almost no trust involved. Much less "tons" of it. 


Obscurity almost always sucks. Maybe obscurity works for historical artifacts hoarded by a king, but it doesn't scale to the general public. 


You're again asserting things without supporting them. It is not a backup service because their "service" cannot recover your money. Its billed as a *security* system, not a backup system, because that's what it is. It protects you from attacks, not from key loss. It would be much better for key loss to simply replicate the same key in multiple locations rather than having a multi sig with each key stored in different locations. You are required to have many keys you own and create in order to recover your funds, and therefore their service doesn't help you back up your funds.

Dandelion is one solution to this, where only nodes that participated in a particular dandelion sequence would know which kernel was associated with their output.

Do you run a *public* node?

Bitcoin will shift power away from banks by taking away their power to create money (and thus leach money from the people).

I agree. Fee selection is widely considered to be not very good across the board. Maybe we need automatic fee hiking - like set a maximum fee, but your software would try to minimize it by setting a lower fee, and upping it until it gets into a block or it reaches the maximum you've set. That way you can fire and forget while still having confidence you won't usually overpay or have to wait too long. The downside is higher network traffic.

Money laundering is funneling money through something else to make it look legitimate. The lightning network cannot do that. It can, however, hide the transaction so only the payer and payee know about it. This increased privacy is not the same as money laundering.

I don't know the specifics of Bitcoin enough to know how a flood of unconfirmed transactions would affect nodes. But my guess is that this would come up against the [mempool size limit]( of each node. Nodes might receive transactions, but simply drop them.

Having electricity for just 2 hours a day isn't a mere blackout. You're absolutely right that Bitcoin is unusable by an enormous amount of people in 3rd world countries. Those are the very people that need Bitcoin most. I'm putting together [an analysis of Bitcoin throughput]( at the moment, and there are a number of hurdles to making full nodes accessible to poorer people.
You don't need to run a full node to use Bitcoin. SPV nodes work perfectly fine. The only problem is that you have no say in a majority chain split (eg if the majority of users want to change the rules to something you don't agree with). Full node is ideal but you aren't required to have one to use Bitcoin.

What are you talking about? Dictatorships often have tons to do with socialism. Many dictators have claimed to be socialists (just like many claim to be democrats). They nationalize industries in the name of socialism to create an egalitarian society (with them on top of course..). 
I obviously know that socialism and dictator are different words with different meanings. You really need to start trying harder to understand the meaning that other people are trying to communicate using the imperfect medium that is text. IE you're a bad listener and you're CLEARLY misunderstanding me. Do better. If you don't understand me, ask for clarification rather than assuming something retarded and then being a dick about your strawman.

Seems far fetched. Would make a good cyber punk book tho! Honestly, I don't think feudalism can happen anymore because most governments are strong - meaning they can control large areas. Feudal lords were necessary because it took weeks to get information across a small country. Now that information is instant, there's no reason for division like that except for allowing jurisdictional differences (ie this town wants different laws from that town). 
Theoretically if everyone gives their government the finger and refuses to pay taxes, that could lead to some sour governments. I just don't think its that hard for a government to enforce taxes, even in a world with ultra private cryptocurrency.

That's because that "magical moment" doesn't exist and Darwin never said it did. For living things that reproduce sexually, a species is usually defined as a group of living things that can mate together. But this is a loose definition. Being able to produce viable offspring is a shifting window that overlaps between species. So while a neanderthal could mate with a homo sapien (as there is abundant evidence of) and a homo habilis, modern homo sapiens might not be able to mate with a homo habilis. This overlap means that soecies is a vague term where there is never any clear point where it changes. Rather it is a gradiential change where adjacent "species" can mate with eachother, but species further apart than that can't.
For species that reproduce asexually, the distinction between species is even less well-defined. It usually takes thousands or millions of years for sexually reproducing animals to evolutionarily diverge until each group can no longer reproduce with the other. However, we don't even have to look at the fossil record to see speciation. We have actually seen new species arise in our lifetime: 
But yes we have seen speciation in the fossil record. What would you expect to see that doesn't already exist in the fossil record?
And why is it implausible to you that evolution within a species, which you readily admit happens, can easily lead to speciation?

Trezor's super easy to use. I've never used a ledger, but it doesn't get much easier than a Trezor. If you really want to be secure, make a 2-of-2 multisig wallet with one key in a Trezor and the other in a Coinkite Coldcard - both are open source. I wouldn't want to support a company doing non-open-source security like ledger, even if it was cheaper and easier (which it sounds like its not).

I'd say so. It reminds me of the scene near the beginning of Ozarks where they almost don't let him take his money from his safety deposit box. 
But if it's a multi-sig wallet where having just that one key doesn't get you anywhere without other keys, then you don't have to trust them much.
A multi sig wallet where primary key can spend at will, but other keys need to be accompanied by 2 or 3 other signatures would do the trick. Make it a 1 of 1 or 1 + 2 of 7, where the required 1 (of the 1+2) is the key you put in a safety deposit box released by your will. The other 7 go to trusted friends and family members - probably the ones you're willing this stuff to. Even if 5/7 lose it, the coins still won't be lost. Recommend using an M-disk DVDR for storage so the data lasts. If you worry about the bank losing the key or doing something nefarious, you could put an additional 4 of 7 multi sig grant on it so the bank need not be involved as long as fewer than 4 of them lose their keys.

Linear charts are useless for showing exponential growth. Log charts show the right perspective. A crash from $10,000 to $3000 is NOT bigger than a crash from $1000 to $300, and a logarithmic graph respects that truth while a linear graph hides earlier crashes.

You don't need a custodial wallet for mass adoption. Time locked multisig wallets will let people use an institution like a bank to help them backup their coins trustlessly and do things like 2 factor auth and category-based spending auth. 
Fully custodial services need to die because they're ripe for fraud and theft, and that counter party risk is expensive.
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:07:45
I agree that we need idiot proof ui to get mass adoption. I think we can get there trustlessly. We need a way for a user to create a wallet and be able to recover funds even if they lose their private key. 
How can this be done without a custodial wallet? You do need a 3rd party, but that 3rd party would only be able to spend funds with a time lock (of say a month). That user who lost their private keys can ask the 3rd party to send their money back to them (at a new wallet, since they lost their last one), and they'll get their money back after a month. If the 3rd party tries to take the money, the user can run software that recognises that and sends it to a second emergency wallet the 3rd party doesn't have access to. 
This could all be packaged up in a way so that the user doesn't have to know about it or pay attention.

I know, I've heard all the classic economic psychology things. The thing is that people misinterpret these things in the way you just did. Because people do *not* have the *goal* of avoiding losses more than earning gains, they simply have that *behavior* because the machine of the human mind is not perfect. 
Ask anyone if they'd rather have won $1000 and lost $500, or won $400 and lost none, and everyone will want the first. However in the moment when trying to maximize their wins, they imperfectly decide to behave in a way that limits their loss because they think that's how to maximize their position. This is rational, even in the economic rationality sense. However their information isn't perfect and so they fail to maximize as well as an all knowing god would. This doesn't change economic theory at all. It's just complicated to understand and quantify the affects of imperfect information.

Monetary inflation \*always\* leads to price inflation...


Um... first of all, inflation is not at all a predictable 2%. Inflation in the past few decades has been almost always above 2% and in the 70s reached above 10%:
And that's if you believe theCPI metric the government regularly manipulates. If you go by previous metrics the government has used in the past, inflation has been 3 time as high, or possibly even has been around 10%/year for the past decade:


A. I'm absolutely certain you're wrong. B. it doesn't matter if you're right. Even if people in general hold 5% of their net worth in cash, inflation has significant negative effects on people. 
And why are you ignoring my point that companies you hold stock in are worth less because inflation erodes their cash reserves? 


Not all bonds have inflation priced in. I would be surprised if the majority did. Could you source your claim?

Yes it will. Contrary to (poorly thought through) public opinion, requiring payment in a currency doesn't give it any value. 
The government only cares about being paid in taxes with money they can actually use. If the money is worthless, the government will no longer require being paid in it and will actually no longer accept it themselves. If businesses and people aren't accepting it, how would the government use that money they collected?
If people strongly prefer bitcoin, the effectiveness of dollar creation reduces, meaning more must be created for the same effect, which in turn would drive the inflation rate up. This also means that the government would be making less real-value in taxes if they ask for dollars rather than bitcoin. This turns into an inflationary spiral that leads to a currency unusable by anyone - including the government. The only way to reset and create a new currency is to create a better one that what people are currently using - which would mean they'd have to create a better currency than bitcoin.

Bitcoin makes it so we don't have to trust some giant entity not to inflate the currency. Actually "being your own" bank is far less important than freedom from inflation. So even if people still have to trust their coins to a 3rd party, bitcoin is a huge step forward. But I agree, good security needs to get easier. Unfortunately, that will probably require some fresh new operating systems (not windows, not mac, not linux) - and those are pretty entrenched..

I see reference to ATECC608A and STM32, but no reference to the specific STM32 MCU - L496RGT6.


How do I know if I don't know what parts they are? Also, how do I even know they're passive elements? I can't verify this if there is no design. 


My goal is to ensure that coldcard's hardware design can easily be evaluated by independent reviewers. An open source design should be easy for people to view, and as understandable as possible. Not listing the specifications for your parts puts an incredible burden on anyone who doesn't want to spend days or weeks tinkering with random parts. Even hardware security experts have to put a lot more effort into imagining all the possible combinations of connections between the MCU and the SE in order to determine the design is probably ok. 
Without listing your actual design, there IS nothing to call "secure". MY goal is to ensure that the design *can* be effectively and independently reviewed so I have confidence it *is* being independently reviewed. I would also like to look at it myself if possible. But it isn't possible because coldcard hasn't made it easy to understand what they're doing. 
Why not make the hardware design fully open sourced? What's the problem?


Unless coldcard lists their parts, I have no way of verifying that. So why should I believe you?

B. That's how long things take to shake out in market via the price system. It takes about a year for the market to come to equilibrium after changes in things like inflation and minimum wage. 
Most people are reactive to the market, not proactive. That's why it's not priced in. Things only get priced in when you have an ideal economic market with full knowledge. In reality, most markets are not close to that ideal.

PoW is a game of profit motives. Miners (generally) only mine for profit. Profit margins will shrink over time, which *inherently* reduces the pool of those who can profitably mine. That is absolutely inherent. There is no way to get around that with a system like proof of work that expends substantial resources in order to gain substantial revenue (and a small profit). Those with cheaper (or subsidized) electricity, better access to hardware, or closer connections to other large miners gain significant advantages.


I don't know what that means. Please elaborate. What centralization pressure is there exactly? How does it work? I ask because I've thought it through *a lot* and have concluded that there is no centralization pressure with PoS. So please enlighten me.

There's right and wrong ways to do things like this. If if can be proven that gains were ill gotten, then it seems fair to claw back those gains as part of an indictment. However, simply confiscating items that aren't needed as criminal evidence doesn't make any sense unless those items are being used as collateral in lieu of money as repayment of damages.

Anyone understand how delete works? I don't understand his pseudocode. Either that or I don't understand how the proofs are constructed. When I try to go through it, it seems to be finding the parent of the first node and itself. And if it tries to find the parent of the first node and the root of the second tree, that doesn't get you any deeper. What am I missing? 
I tried translating it into something more readable:
parent = fn a b:
 if a.side == 'left': 
   ret hash[a.hash b]
  else:
   ret hash[b a.hash]
deleteOne = fn acc proof:
 var height = 0

    else:
      curNode = parent[proofHash acc[height]]
   height++
 acc[height] = n
 ret acc
deleteOne[acc {
 {side:'left' hash:c}
 {side:'left' hash:a}

The wider the coin ownership is spread, the better. When any single person or organization making the currency owns a large fraction (even below 50%) of coins, they can easily manipulate the price. Not only that, but if the company making the currency is one such party, they have a big incentive to do things that are good for themselves and not for the rest of the community (eg Ethereum's block chain reversion). It also shows they care more about making money than they do about creating a decentralized currency.I personally don't trust currencies that have large premines or things like that.

I do know that there's a lot of things in place for determining when a connection isn't playing nice and disconnecting. However, there is a limit to how many non-public full nodes the current approximately 10k public nodes can service. If a government simply sets up many thousands of full nodes running stock bitcoin core, it could use up the resources of public nodes without doing anything detectable as malicious.
This isn't the worst problem tho. Presumably if this happened, there would just be a call to run more public nodes, perhaps enable UPnP by default again, and get things running smoothly again in a few weeks to a month. But perhaps it isn't that easy to get more people to run public nodes. Best to already have the capacity to weather an attack like that rather than have to react.

The cost to mine a bitcoin depends only on the total amount of resources people are dedicating to mining. The electricity used is only one factor in the cost (the other major factor is the cost of the hardware). 
Miners decide to mine bitcoin primarily based on profitability. If its profitable, or they predict it will be profitable, someone will decide to purchase mining equipment and start mining. The more this is done (either more people in the mining game buying new hardware, or the same people in the mining game buying new hardware), the higher the difficulty will rise, and the higher the cost will be to mine a bitcoin. 
Whether mining is profitable depends on the price of bitcoin. So the cost of mining depends pretty much solely on the price of bitcoin (or the future price of bitcoin predicted by miners). 
So trying to figure out how much it will cost to mine a bitcoin without knowing the price is impossible.

I disagree. You *might* be able to convince me that what you and I think are in many people's best interests is something they're voting against, however the whole point of representation and democracy is that we (as smart as we are) might be wrong or biased. Well, we're certainly biased (everyone is), but that's part of the point. 
I would have rather seen Hillary president than Trump, but I understand the feeling that Trump was actually a better choice if the thing you want to maximize is change in the system. We all know Hillary wouldn't have changed a single significant thing about government in the US. People thought Trump might - and he just might indeed, tho it might come from backlash and remaneuvering rather than anything Trump does directly.


Kind of, but he's had things in his advantage for quite some time. Mcconnel has been a senator for almost 35 years. Candidate hopefuls only have a [18% chance]( of winning a congressional election against an incumbent. That number is 7% for house reps. So by and large, the congressmen we have were dictated by voters [10 years ago]( and moreso for long-running congressmen like McConnel.


People are all but forced to vote for someone from one of those 2 parties. That's [how first past the post operates]( 


Interesting, I've never heard anyone say that. 


Its true. Voting for 3rd parties in a FPTP-based two party system is a waste 99% of the time - watch the video I linked above. 


Sadly, that's not true. Voting independent is a non-starter unless we change the voting system. FPTP (aka plurality) must be changed if we want independents to have a chance at winning. 
I wrote about this more here: 
I'm a big fan of score voting, since it should remove all weird biases from the system and simply tell us what would make the people as a whole most happy. Switching to score voting from FPTP would literally double the voter-satisfaction (using randomly chosen candidates as the baseline).

No number of nodes can push their own consensus. Each individual chooses what rules they follow. However, lots of non-public full nodes could DOS the system.
Billions of full nodes would be quite expensive to emulate tho. They'd be sending and at least pretending to receive as much data as any other full node. In a DOS attack that attempts to max out the resources of public nodes, what matters is bandwidth, not raw numbers of nodes. Currently it would cost only a few million dollars per year to match the resources of the ~10,000 public nodes. If we converted the other 90k honest private nodes to public nodes, that basically 10xes the equation, making it cost 10s of millions of dollars per year. Still in range of a dedicated government. Hopefully if such a DOS attack was attempted, people would be rallied to add more public nodes to the system (and also sue whatever government is doing such an attack).

I don't know much about stellar, but there are lots of currencies that are designed to be decentralized, however there are many aspects of decentralization. Does one entity have control of 50% of the hash power or near that? Does one entity have most of the coins? Do 3rd parties regularly review changes to the core code?

Well, theoretically, any feature can be added with a soft fork (via additional block data old versions don't know how to access like the segwit soft fork did). So if soft forks continue to be preferred over hard forks, then all of those features can be added that way. I do think most of those features (or equivalents) will be implemented in some fashion or another, since they represent massive improvements.
The problem with a hardfork is that you ideally want to upgrade in two steps: first everyone updates their validation so they see new features as valid, then once a critical mass have updated, the features are "turned on" and people can start using them (with only a minimum number of nodes ending up on the inevitable fork). The problem is that immediately after step one, some malicious party could mine a block using new features before the system is read for it, causing a messy fork with a lot of users on it. Because of that, I don't see the stigma against hard forks going away anytime soon, if ever.

Not true. I don't even know what you mean, but you cannot "backup the chip". The chip contains the pin and the pin is deleted if you try 13 consecutive times on the hardware wallet I'm talking about. There is no recourse. No "infinite tries".


Any good hardware wallet will *at least* have exponential backup. Which means it would take longer than the age of the universe to crack even a 3 character pin (`.1*2^(10^3/2)`).
Now, you could theoretically strip the hardware down and extract the pin from the guts of the device. This is pretty damn hard to do and requires physical access and expensive equipment.

You're absolutely right that you could say that when bitcoin's price goes up, bitcoin's price is "inflating" and you could call that inflation. However, you will confuse every single person familiar with the word inflation, because it's not how the word is ever used.
Inflation implies that something is getting bigger but not more substantial, which is exactly what happens with monetary inflation. Yes there are now more dollars, but those dollars collectively aren't worth more than before inflation. 
When prices decrease in comparison to a non inflating currency, nothing is actually happening to the currency itself. It's "price" (denominated in non-currency goods) is going "up", but only because there price of those other goods is going down. It would be misleading to say that bitcoin is x"inflating" because the increase represents actual additional buying power (by virtue of prices being lower).

Monetary inflation is when the supply increases. Price inflation is when prices go up. Monetary inflation causes price inflation, but they don't always move in exact unison.

Which is why "rising prices" (of other things, not the currency) are price inflation and indicative of monetary inflation..

No. Read the research.


If 53 million people try and open channels (or whatever onchain transaction) smoothly over the course of a month, each person would have to wait 13.5 hours, not "months". Do the math.


People can be paid via the lightning network.




No. What do you think decentralized means? Most people do not need to open multiple channels for the system to be sufficiently decentralized. As long as there is sufficient competition between public lightning nodes, most people can just have one channel.


You're moving the goal post buddy. We're talking about the limits of the lightning network. Of course things would get a bit hairy around the limits.
Also, do you think people open up bank accounts every other day? No, they carefully plan that shit.


I don't know why you're making judgements about the system when you clearly don't understand how it will work in the future.

All hardware wallets store the seed words somewhere in memory. In some hardware wallets, this memory is in a secure chip. The seed words are almost always protected by a pin, and often times a 25th word passphrase in addition to the pin (if you opt for it, which you probably should). 
I'm not sure if any hardware wallets encrypt the seed words using your pin, tho it would be a good idea for them to do that. Even if that's not the case, if you use a 25th word passphrase, that is essentially just as good as encrypting the wallet seed with that passphrase (actually better because of BIP39 key stretching).

You ask this as if they have control over this. Thing is, the governments of the world aren't one big conspiracy working against the common folk. Each government official does their own self interested things that are driven by the incentives the system they work in gives them.
Governments in freer countries may find that many of their officers will jump on the bitcoin bandwagon. Trying to force bitcoin out with them be met not only with public opposition, but also internal opposition. Governments have largely been quite permissive toward bitcoin, and it would be quite difficult for some to reverse their positions.
People think it's easy for a government to just make something illegal. Well it is in third and second world countries, but it's not easy in first world countries when that thing is high profile. If a democratic government was to try to kill bitcoin, they'd do it by adding annoying regulations, not by banning it

There aren't nearly enough pubic full nodes at the moment to protect the bitcoin network from a state level DOS attack costing only a couple million dollars per year. There are about 10,000 public nodes and if too many private full nodes are connected to them, users wouldn't be able to easily find enough connections to the network. This probably isn't a catastrophic problem tho, since it would mostly just reduce the number of outgoing connections any particular node could attain unless the attack was quite big, and the solution would simply be to run more public nodes (which we could do by re enabling UPnP by default, making all honest private nodes into public nodes).

Well, I suppose that's possible. But memorizing a whole seed is a bad idea - human memories tend to suck at doing things like that. A lot. So you'd probably have to store that seed somewhere accessible anyway, and whatever method you'd use would probably be less secure than a hardware wallet.

You don't base your understanding of the future on things that have been already done. You base on projections about what can and will be done. If you think lightning won't be able to scale to billions because its small now, you're not even trying to predict how things will play out.


True. Tho its only a "big" problem today.


Currently thought through ideas that exist today can get Bitcoin up to probably around 300 tps. See  .


Whether that's true or not depends on demand for opening channels and other on-chain transactions. It sounds like you're imagining a scenario where 1 billion people all try to open a channel at the same time. That would never happen.
Let's take 300 tps (since that's a lot more well researched number). That's about 800 million transactions per month (let's make the math easy ; ). That means every person can make 1 on-chain transaction per 10 months. Already this is theoretically enough, tho clearly not ideal, as long as people have channels that they make changes on (top up, channel close/open) once per year. 
If demand for Bitcoin really is all 8 billion people, the blockchain could withstand that, but people would have to use their lightning channels as long-term storage for often a large fraction, or all/most of their Bitcoin. 
But if demand was just 1 billion people (still nothing to shake a stick at), that's one transaction every 1.25 months. Even if we say that another .75 transactions per month per person is done for non-lightning purposes, then people would be able to do things like top-up or whatever once every 2 months, which is quite a bit more reasonable. 
There's no reason to believe people would have to *wait* more than a few blocks to actually do any of these on-chain transactions. As always, those that pay a lower fee will have to wait longer than others. But no one will be waiting "months".


Instant finality is not bad. Its incredibly valuable to merchants and institutions, and anyone that wants to sell something. You don't want to surrender over the merch if some sketchy customer might claw back their money later. 


You have a point, and I've learned that a concept called covenants can be used to implement bitcoin "vaults" that put additional barriers in the way of an attacker in a scenario like this. You could set up a vault where it usually takes you a week to withdraw funds, unless you hunt down multiple keys (kept in a home safe, safe deposit box, etc). 


Hardware wallet. Multi-sig. In the future these will be obvious and everyone will use them. You can't remotely hack a multi-sig wallet that uses multiple hardware wallets.


What are you talking about? It matters to literally everyone. 
Monetary inflation is most certainly higher than reported price inflation, since technological improvement is constantly driving down the actual costs of goods and services. So any money you have in the bank is losing about 4-6% of its value every year. Your salary is only increased retroactively, so your salary is actually decreasing between raises. Any investment you have with a company that holds cash is being devalued because of inflation. 
But the biggest effect of inflation is not that you're losing money. Its that corrupt elites are getting that money and using it to manipulate the government, at least in the US. Literally [billions of dollars]( are used to lobby in the US, and the vast majority of that money [comes from banks]( These are the people that are fucking up our government and using it to screw everyone else over. Getting rid of the inflation that drives the political power of those assholes is far more important than having an extra 4-6% per year in spending money.


This statement pisses me off. Its vomited out by every half-baked armchair economist who's knowledge about economics only comes from soundbites and high school econ. 
Inflation is a distortion of the market that **over** incentivizes spending and investment. Inflation means that investments that would otherwise be worthless because they lose money are actually "profitable" because they lose less money than your cash. This is absolutely horrible for the economy to incentivize bad investments and debt over savings.


Counter party risk is risk related to trusting another person or organization. You take on counter party risk when you give someone a loan, since the borrower might default. You take on counter party risk when you give a valet your car, since they might steal or damage it. You take on counterparty risk as a merchant when you accept payment via credit card, because the payer might issue a charge back later (resulting in basically stolen merchandise/employee-time + extra fees). People in financially distressed countries take on significant counterparty risk when they store their money in a bank - because that bank might freeze their account. 
There's lots of forms of counterparty risk, and Bitcoin's P2P nature provides ways to eliminate a lot of those risks.


I really don't understand why anyone thinks what you're required to pay taxes in matters. So many people think that somehow gives a currency value. It doesn't.


I'm sorry, how often are you paying taxes in your life? For me, its once a year. Converting some currency once a year is not a huge burden. In fact, most people pay most of their taxes via their employer, so often they wouldn't even have to deal with it at all - they'd just get their tax refund in dollars. If people take only a portion of their paycheck in bitcoin, then they can use the other portion in dollars to pay their taxes. There's lots of ways around that. Saying this would be a problem for adoption seems like a pretty weak argument. 


Maybe some countries would try to do some stomping. But if they did, there would certainly be other countries that would let it thrive. Overt oppression doesn't work well in democratic countries. If, say, the US make bitcoin outright illegal, and other countries didn't, what's the US going to do? Ban Bitcoin from foreign exchanges? The US might as well ban the Yen.

There's two important things that need to be made easy:
1. Backup and restore

Making bitcoin transactions is already pretty easy. And  isn't that hard either, just get a hardware wallet. 
But for  probably almost no one is properly backing their coins up, because it's not made easy. I don't even back my coins up right. If i hit my head and forget my password, those coins are gone. If i die, no one inherits my bitcoins.
We need wallets to offer simple ways to do multi sig backups so people can store half a key with a few friends and half in a bank lock box behind a lawyer. It's not that hard to download and backup your encrypted private keys, but no wallet leads you through how to do fail safe backup.

Well it's theoretically more secure, because an attacker finding your seed needs to crunch through 384 bits of password, while a 2-of-3 shamir would only need to crunch through ~256 bits (one of the two other seeds). If you find a good implementation of ssss and don't make errors copying down the results, they signed both be pretty secure.
However a downside you missed is that there's no way to execute shamir's secret sharing without having the single original key all in one place - a single point of failure. To do it properly, you need an air gapped machine. Since hardware wallets don't support Shamir (as far as i know), making your own air gapped machine is a pain. 
Of course to use your passwords, you also need to bring them all in one place, but at least you can use a HW Wallet. 
If you're going to all this trouble tho, why not make a multisig wallet? Plenty of entropy and no single point of failure.

Ok, so you make a good point about inflation adjustment, and I was a bit unclear about the inflation adjustment being mostly a useful tool against volatility, but not against consistent inflation/deflation.


Obviously such a loan would not be given out. I think we both agree there. Your example isn't concrete so let's make it concrete. 
* 3%/yr general decrease in price levels, aka deflation (commensurate with the rate of economic growth)
* 1%/yr general decrease in wage levels (commensurate with the rate of population growth)
With these premises, let's say a lender did lend money out at 1%/yr, and the borrower planned to pay it back once per year over 4 years. If they're paying it off with a wage job, they would find that they had to pay 1% more of their earnings each year to pay off the same amount of debt. If they were running a business, that might instead be 3% more per year. Hopefully the loan is paying back more than that. 
But really, this is not different than getting a 8%/yr interest loan in a currency with 2% inflation. Deflation or inflation, the interest rate loaned out at is just adjusted accordingly.

It actually depends on where the pin is used. You're incredibly unlikely to be able to bruteforce even a 4 numeral pin on a coldcard mk3 for example - since you only get 13 consecutive failures before the wallet deletes the seed and bricks itself. 


Well vetted techniques do indeed tell you to use a passphrase to protect your seed - although doing this means that if you die no one can inherit your bitcoin. 


No.. you assumed i was talking about where to hide stuff. I was responding to your advice of "get creative". 


If you're hiding your passphrase, you're doing it wrong. A passphrase is "something you know" not "something you have". It should not be written down. If you want to have a second "something you have" factor, use multisig.

It's not just ok, it's necessary. We would all like there to be more usable space on the block chain, but the fact is that it's not safe to add more space yet. It's like running an engine at the red line, you can do it for a while, but in increases the likelihood that you'll damage the engine. The same is true with a distributed consensus system like Bitcoin. The technology and hardware it runs on can only run so fast without opening the system up to security problems. The current consensus is that doubling the block size again is not currently safe. For details on why, read this:  


Most altcoins sacrifice security for improved speed and cost. These coins would be easily disrupted if they were as valuable as bitcoin. The only thing keeping most altcoins from being attacked is their worthlessness. In addition, it's likely that bitcoin can and will adopt most of the well vetted and well tested ideas that do end up being improvements that don't sacrifice security. So altcoins can only stay alive if they do something that is fundamentally incompatible with bitcoin. And most are not that unique.


Others have answered this, but basically it may be currently possible for the Chinese government to take over the mining pools in their country and do something like double spend, which would be quite bad. However, because most of the mining power is in pools and not a few giant mining farms, individual miners can still choose to switch pools at any time. When [stratum v2]( comes out, this will close that hole and make it impossible for mining pools to control what goes into blocks, and would eliminate most of the problems with having a few big mining pools. The only problem that would remain is that a mining pool can potentially be shut down, which could make blocks mine slowly for a few hours to a day until miners can switch to another pool.
That also answers your third question.


Huge corporate partners is not a good sign. Those huge corporate partners want correspondingly huge pay offs, which often eventually lead to screwing their users for a quick buck. Bitcoin is about decentralization and freedom, while xrp and the like are just about extracting profits from people who don't understand that a centralized currency is very likely to be manipulated in destructive ways.

Do you just mean that data relay is done efficiently in a way where a node won't ever serve all data to all it's connections (eg each connection should only need a piece of data 1/8th of the time)? Or do you mean something more there?

It's most definitely allowed, but managing it can be a hassle for the customer and the business alike, so most businesses just see it as easier to charge credit card prices even for cash purchases.

Honestly, it shouldn't even be that hard to add this kind of thing into a wallet. It would essentially be the same as the current wallet creation process except you choose how many friends and/or banks (or w/e) you want to split the multi-sig part between, and then at the end after you store your key, it tells you how to give the other key parts to other parties. You do that and you're done. 
It just takes someone to start caring about it. Pretty much  no one thinks of what happens after they die. Especially the sub-40s-heavy demographic of bitcoiners. But it sure would be nice to hold your own coins and know that if you get hit by the ISS in the next 5 minutes your coins will go to people you care about.

I see. I figured maybe it was variable since scrypt can use variable key stretching. For example the [scryp.params function here]( allowed you to choose a number of key stretching iterations based on the machine's speed. This basically future proofs your password hashing, since if your application is deployed on a new faster machine, newly created passwords will now be stronger without any change in algorithm or manual parameter tweaking. This should be done in bitcoin so that no one needs to manually tweak parameters in order to maintain strong key stretching.
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:10:10
Thinking about it, i suppose if everything is programmed right, and there is really no trace left in the other part of the device, it should be just as good really. The issue is the likely hood that there's a flaw in there code that removes the key after use.

Why don't they use bitcoin to transfer value? Maybe because fees, but then why not litecoin or one of the myriad of other coins? It's a money grab like all the rest. Companies view cryptocurrencies as a funding mechanism, not as a way to create user value. And yet they dress up they're homepage as if it's the token itself that enables value creation.

I don't think that argument holds water. What I'm hearing you say is basically "bitcoin would have to interface with the same kinds of insecure 3rd parties and tech that credit cards have". Except:
A. No they wouldn't, because anyone who holds there own keys doesn't have to rely on 3rd parties,
B. The most insecure part of credit cards (handing someone your credit card, with its number on it - ie the "private key") simply wouldn't exist even for customers that use custodial wallets. Instead of handing your private keys to your waiter, you'll scan a QR code and type your pin/password so that the company you're paying never has the possibility of making payments with your wallet.
So even if nothing else changed about the payment institutions of the world, instead of having to trust every single person you pay with your credit card number, you only have to trust your custodial wallet (or no one if you keep your own keys like a good hodler). 
Its not dramatic to stay that would be a HUGE step forward for fraud reduction and payment security. Sorry bud, you're just not right about this one.

As I posted as a top-level comment, most dice are [*not*, in fact, random](


No you can't. You can test your dice for bias, but bias is not obvious simply by using the dice.


In an open source hardware device like the Trezor, the same certainly *can* be said because you can look at the hardware, look at the code, and work out if its randomness is sound.


If you generate the private key on device 1, and then input it on device 2, the private key has been exposed to both devices. There is no security reason to separate those functions into two devices.
What is the goal of this? If its to create better randomness than a hardware wallet - you're not likely to succeed. If its to create a more secure system than a hardware wallet, this is certainly not achieving that goal. 
So what goals is this intended to achieve?

If you understand bitcoin (do you?), you understand why its far better at what it does than dollars. The only possible way that bitcoin doesn't take over the money system is if *another* better newer currency does. Dollars are a losing bet even in the medium term.
So what's more likely? 
A. that Bitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency, or 
B. that some new cryptocurrency trounces it?
If its A, then it **will** go to 5-10 million 2019 dollars per bitcoin. If its B, it'll go to near 0, tho probably only after a long, brutal fight. 
Option C, that cryptocurrencies remain just a nerd phenomenon and dollars remain on top for the next 100 years, is unfathomable.

@_date: 2018-03-16 07:57:08


Have you identified the differences in premises we're using? Could you lay out the premise I'm using next to yours and we could see why we differ on that? 


I see what you're saying. Basically the velocity of money idea. I agree that money can flow around in many trades.


Also agree with the same caveat you yourself brought up (that I quote next) - its not the number of trades, not even the value transfer of those trades, but its maximizing the sum of all the profits made from those trades that we want to maximize. 




I think we're talking about two different types of "efficiency" here. You're saying that businesses operating at low profit margins are efficient because they're forced to be efficient. This efficiency is one of minimizing rent seeking itself - for a business operating with 0 profit and 0 loss (of course when including opportunity cost), none of the actors are taking any extra profit beyond the value they generate for their customer. 
However, there is another type of efficiency - the efficient use of resources. A counter to your point is that: you can't use a low-profit-margin as a measure of wealth generation (or efficiency). You can have a terribly inefficient business operating in a lucrative market at break-even profit margins. 
I disagree wholeheartedly that profitability can't be used as a measure for wealth generation. If you have a set of resources to use on either a business generating 4% ROI or one generating 5% ROI, it would be inefficient to choose the lower yield. For a given amount of resources, you're producing more, and therefore yielding more in profit from their production. Starting a business in a crowded market where all the actors are forced to efficiently use their resources (in a constrained context) in order to break even isn't actually an efficient investment of resources. This is why a startup can generate literally thousands of times more profit than opening a new franchise location, per dollar spent. The startup (that becomes successful) is generating thousands of times more wealth per dollar. 


All factors *are* in use, if you consider not being used a use. See the next couple responses for clarification..


When a piece of land isn't being used, its still owned by someone. Someone who's not doing anything with it. Generating 0 utility with something you own is obviously worse than generating some utility (if possible and non-conflicting with other endeavors). By owning a piece of land and not using it, you **are** blocking someone from using it at a higher efficiency, if there is a higher efficiency to be attained.. 


Sure, he's not preventing someone else from fixing them at 2%, but he's preventing *himself* from fixing them at 2%, or doing something he's better at for 2% ROI. If an economic actor isn't recognizing more lucrative opportunities in the market and acting on them, he's holding the economy back. Of course everyone does this to a degree, but anyone who's doing this more than others might do better by changing tack - learning something new, or learning a better way to do what they're already doing.


While I agree about what the definition of rent-seeking is, I don't agree that someone holding a currency where the available quantity isn't changing is "increasing his share of wealth" when the price of their currency goes up. After all, its only going up exactly as much as the economy has grown by - therefore the amount of value the currency has grown by is exactly the same share of the economy as it was before it grew. Right? So its not rent-seeking. 
I've said this before, but its the same with any commodity. If the world has 1 billion kg of steel and the economy grows by 5%, as long as the demand for that steel hasn't changed and the quantity hasn't changed, that steel will have 5% more buying power. But are the holders of steel rent-seekers that should be prevented from extracting value from the world? Or were they simply people who knew steel was going to remain in demand?

I think you misunderstand how the LN works. First of all there is nothing called "pre-funding" that I've heard of. You create a channel with funds and then you can use those funds through the channel and network. But you can't use a lightning transaction to create a new channel. 
Also you're incorrect about payment. If Alice just wants to pay someone using lightning, her channel partner Bob does *not* need to put any money into the channel. Bob must only have funds in the channel for Alice to *receive* money through Bob. Once Alice makes one payment through Bob, Bob will then have funds on his end of the channel without having to have originally put any in.

Software is a field where patents tend to be either impossible or malicious. For whatever reason, it's hard to make a good product, even if you're trying to just rip off someone else's idea. The patents that do exist are almost all used by big companies to scare away their small upstart competition (ie the opposite of what patents are supposed to Ve for). 
Problem with patents is that if you're small, they don't protect you and if you're big you don't need protection. It's incredible difficult to successfully defend a patent as a small company. Now of course, one major reason is our broken court system (I'm taking US here). But patent law itself is anti competitive by nature of it giving exclusive rights. Patent law needs to be changed such that only a portion of the profits derived from patented works should by owed to the owner. The owner shouldn't get the right to exclude other parties from using the idea - that only slows progress.

Not as awesome as i expected, but still a good technique to know about, since it means you only need one secured lightning node that can service any number of points of sale. But i think this solution is unnecessarily complex. After all, if you can communicate with the point of sale (via nfc or whatever), the point of sale is effectively online and you could enable arbitrary communication that way. 
A much easier solution would be to have the point of sale give it's id and a transaction id to the phone, your phone can then pay the lighting node with those ids, and once payment is complete, the point of sale can verify the receipt using the lightning node's public key.

True. As the economy grows, value deflation will happen. As money is lost, monetary deflation happens. 


Also true. Given any potential investment that has a lower rate of return than the currency and a similar risk profile, people will choose to keep the currency rather than invest. Also true for anything that has a less favorable risk/return ratio. 
However, the rate of the currency will increase in value (ie monetary deflation + value deflation) will exactly match the economic growth + monetary loss/destruction. While the *price* may fluctuate and exceed the currency's value, the average will track the value in the long run. This means that any "runaway deflation" is just an ordinary bubble - something that will be corrected over time. 


If this is true, its just as true for an inflating currency. However, I don't think it is true for any currency. There is no such thing as the "correct supply" of a currency. Whatever amount of currency is available is just as good as any other amount. If less of the currency is in circulation, then it has the same effect as if that currency was destroyed, and if more of that currency starts entering circulation, its the same thing as monetary inflation. This naturally balances to the transactional needs of an economy, although the market does take time to adjust to changes in supply (as it does with any commodity). When entities like central banks try to manipulate the supply, all they do is introduce more uncertainty into the market and slow down the market's process of coming to an equilibrium. 






Why would supply have to exponentially decrease? Agreed that demand would have to exponentially increase (which it has been year over year btw).


Disagree. Volatility is a cost, for sure, but not a large one. Exchanges, for example, handle it readily. A dynamic price based on exchange prices has worked well for things in the past, and for bitcoin in the past. I see no reason bitcoin should be different here.

1. I think this is basically the case, yeah.
2. Yeah, that sums up the consequence nicely actually
3. A small correction to this is that "a higher margin business/industry is always generating more wealth than a lower margin one **per unit of investment**."
4. This isn't quite right. Increased investment in a particular area *should* reduce the ROI of all competing businesses. However even so, this might result in the average ROI changing (increasing if the area being invested in retains above average ROI after the additional investment is done). But at the same time I *think* I agree with the statement "there are no inherent limits to profitability/efficiency" tho of course there are physical limitations, I don't think any of those limitations affect the conclusion. 


This line might be significant to where exactly we differ. Not sure specifically how tho.


I actually disagree that this is rent-seeking. You're providing something of value, which is generating wealth. The trade involved in someone paying money to rent your land constitutes profit on *both* ends, which generates wealth just like any other trade. 


Just like farming subsidies example, this is an example of a government distorting market forces and corruptly enriching some constituents at the expense of others. This is the real rent seeking, not the basic ownership of land. 


Since I disagree that land rental is rent seeking, I disagree with this premise. What I think is the real reason for the incredibly dysfunctional land and housing market is continued government intervention - zoning laws, prohibitions on plot splitting, height restrictions, onerous building permitting process, and other NIMBY fueled restrictions that pump the price of land while screwing everyone (ironically including themselves) in the process. Land price bubbles of the size we see are also due to these things. Without these distortions we'd see a slow ebb and flow, rather than bubble and crash.


I agree that if you suddenly came into owning a huge amount of previously unowned land, like happened during the English Agricultural Revolution (in the .. 1800s?), then that would be the right approach. But what about once that land has all be doled out, either by purchase for own use or by rental, that's no longer possible, nor profitable. It should almost always be more efficient to rent the land than let it lay unused. Holding back one unit in a sea of others only reduces your profit margins. I'm curious if you have any sources you can back up the claim that such behavior happens at equilibrium.


Only if the area you're buying land in will increase in value *faster than the rest of the economy*. Otherwise you're holding onto a losing investment. This is the case with most land. Its not generally a good investment to buy a house if you pick at random and put no work into the house.

Circular reasoning. Its currency because its currency. Doesn't really add to your point in any way.
I think our discussion is getting confounded by the differences between precious metal currencies and paper fiat money. Let's change it up.
Let's say you had a paper fiat currency called the Dorru where money was printed at a rate of 0.1% per year, and a paper currency called the dollar which was printed at a rate of 5% per year. Everything other than the rates of monetary inflation of those currencies are the same. You seem to think that people would prefer to accept and pay for things with the dollar, whereas I would think people would prefer the dorru. Why would you think people would prefer the dollar? 


People hoard everything. People hoard dollars. People hoard grain. The hoarding isn't the problem, its *why* they're hoarding it. In a shit economy, you might hoard your currency because there aren't any better investments. In an economy with a pegged currency, you would hoard what that currency is pegged to because its worth more than the currency even tho you can buy the same amount with the currency (or risk legal penalty).

The consensus in the bitcoin community is that those policies are unsustainable for those (and any) currencies and come with enormous security risks. Bitcoin already has a centralization problem and increasing the blocksize further would only make it worse. The only reason altcoins aren't seeing even more problems is because their volume and the value of attacking them is so much lower. In fact, bitcoin itself might be in the process of experiencing the problem of miner centralization. The thing is it takes a long time to manifest since its essentially an economic attack.

This is why I advocate for adding multiple hash algorithms side by side. That way if we need to switch one off, it wouldn't completely halt the network. It would allow for smoother switch overs and would likely increase decentralization as well.

I see what you're trying to say about them not having a unitary body that made decisions, but there's many ways of doing decentralization, and there's many ways of doing it wrong. They did it VERY wrong. It wasn't decentralization that caused the problem, it was their shitty decision making process.

It's not about 0 competition, it's about 90 or 95% dominance with no competitor retaining a grip. Look at Google in search, or Facebook in social networks, or operating systems. All of those industries have very few competitive alternatives. There is a lot of market pressure to consolidate on one solution when there are network effects or massive economies of scale. This never means there won't be upstarts, but it usually means the vast majority of those upstarts won't be competitive.

There's no way for any individual node to know if a block has propagated through the network without asking every node and trusting their response. 
We can agree that the orphan rate would go up, right? Right now the orphan rate is about [once per month]( A 51% attacker that wanted a 10% advantage would have to orphan 10% of the blocks that aren't theirs, which would be a bunch of orphans per day.

*Oh note: I answered this one before reading your prior one*


I agree. I'm not saying deflation produces any incentives. Actually, I think predictable inflation or deflation should theoretically not produce any incentives or pressures at all by themselves. The problem is that with inflation, you usually have a wealth transfer from currency holders to money creators (ie central banks and governments). 
You could theoretically distribute this inflation equally among the people, which would be better, but still wealth transfer. If you distributed newly created money back to holders of currency in exact proportion to how much they currently have, you can see that monetary inflation there would have no effect on distribution of wealth or put any pressures on anyone to do anything differently in response to that inflation. It would be the same situation as deflation. So surely inflation can't be the answer you're looking for. Perhaps its wealth transfer? However, if wealth transfer is your goal, isn't that also the rent seeking you're speaking out against?
I think that's where we differ. You see deflation as rent seeking, while I see inflation as rent seeking. I suspect you also see how monetary inflation is almost exclusively (in the real world) done in a rent seeking way. So I'm a little confused about your argument based on rent-seeking.


If you decide to dig a ditch all day, making nothing from it but a useless hole, you're blocking yourself from doing something more productive (having fun, learning something, or making money). Its easy to block yourself from opportunities, people do it all the time. 
However, I think I miscommunication last time. I tried to say that this hinges on people not finding the best opportunities *themselves* and it kind of does, but what I really wanted to do was clarify that no matter how much of a particular currency is in circulation, that currency can only (on average) purchase the same amount of resources. If only 1 bitcoin was in circulation for a year, it should theoretically be able to purchase just as much as 1 million bitcoin. Would you agree with that? 
If that's the case, someone who spends money on an investment with a below average ROI *is* blocking someone else from using it on an investment with a higher ROI, since by using that money, everyone else's buying power is reduced (albeit after the use of that money propagates through the market). 


Its possible that investors *thought* it was more profitable to hoard money than invest it. However they were wrong. The people that invested their money in start ups during the great depression made far more money than most people did in the boom (after all was said and done). Check out the top answer here:  . Why was this? Well, the money they invested while everyone else was hoarding was worth a TON more than it would have otherwise been, allowing them to command a lot more of the economy's resources than other people. However, there's a limit to this. If everyone but you stops investing their money, you can't suddenly command the entire world. You have a limit to how quickly you can grow a business (or businesses) and thus a ton of people that stop investing at the same time absolutely puts a huge damper on the economy. 
Their stupid behavior isn't an indictment of deflation as much as it is an indictment of short-term thinking. Many people acting inefficiently absolutely causes economic downturn. This psychological effect has nothing to do with rational reactions to currency price fluctuations. 
And unfortunately, its exactly the thinking you're espousing (that deflation means you should rationally hoard your money) that *causes* these kinds of events. Its actually not the correct move, but if enough people think it is, down the economy goes when newspapers start saying things like "Investors are making more money by buying dollars than investing in equity!" It might be true from day to day, but in the long run, you lose that way. As an individual and as a whole economy. 


I agree for the most part with that. But what's important here is the *buying-power* of the money in circulation, not the quantity of currency in circulation itself. And that doesn't change even if the market doesn't realize it. The value of something isn't always equal to its price. Markets can be slow moving beasts.


The real-world truth of that is irrelevant to my example, which explicitly specified a fixed quantity of steel.


Fiat currency isn't an IOU. Neither is cryptocurrency. 


I agree that would be a bad currency. Even in the case of a labor-backed IOU currency, if you give 1 million HoursCoins where each one gives the bearer 1 hour of your labor, you will never be able to fulfill all requests to get that labor (since it would be more than 100 years of continuous work) and therefore your IOU currency would be insolvent. So I agree, a currency doesn't grant you an ability to escape the bounds of your limited resources. You must have as much resources to back the currency you're backing in the case of a backed currency. 
But I'm confused about your point here, because the inflationary currency you're advocating for has exactly this property where you would expect that IOU to decrease in value over time (eg it would "decrease to only 0.9 hours labor"). So I'm not sure what your point is with this example. 


Again, I agree with your definition - that's the definition I'm using. I'm trying to show that in the example of a non-monetarily-inflating currency the "share of wealth" is not increasing as the economy grows. If you have an amount of non-monetarily-inflating currency that can command 1% of the world's resources, and the world's resources double, you can buy twice as much stuff, but you still only command 1% of the world's resources. Therefore the *share* (ie the ratio of your buying power to the amount of resources available) remains constant no matter how much or how fast the economy grows.  Therefore, a non-monetarily-inflating currency does not fit the definition of rent seeking.
My guess is that you would advocate a currency that inflates at exactly the rate of economic growth. Is that right? How would you say the currency created (in order to make that inflation happen) should be ideally distributed in order to not distort the economy?

I agree, there will be other cryptocurrencies that work alongside bitcoin. But only when they aren't actually competing. Monero's fundamental tradeoffs mean it will be more expensive, but much more private, for example. Because of that, they're not competing (ie they're not being used for the same purposes). 
But even with currencies with non-competing purposes, the possibility of side-chains means that a completely separate currency will have to compete as a store of value. Anything that isn't competitive on that front will end up as a side chain of a better store of value. Even smart contract coins will end up as side chains of something with better security and store of value.

Precious-metal based coins have downsides that outweigh the benefits of their non-inflationary/appreciatory value. 


You use copper as an example of a metal that works as a currency, and yet don't acknowledge when I call you out on why copper coins have exactly the same issues gold coins had. I would appreciate if you'd concede some points, otherwise I don't know whether we're on the same page or not. 


I agree, and think this is the primary driver of moving away from precious-metal based coins - ie increasing value of those precious metals is not the reason.

This is pretty much the same thing as trusting an exchange. There is almost no security in this system. How do partnered exchanges get chosen? Whoever controls the signatures that can validly sign blocks is a single point of failure. But even if this is a quorum based system, if a significant amount of those entities merges or simply sells their key to liquid, the system becomes fully centralized and you wouldn't even necessarily be able to get bitcoins back out (since the central controllers can censor those transactions). I honestly don't see how this system is interesting at all. Why not just use a centralized database at this point?

You're an absolute idiot. Central banks caused the great depression. Central banks caused the recent "great recession". They exacerbate business cycles and are complicit in the inflation that steals all our money. 


You can't wish away inflation by imagining the money is always flowing. This just turns each dollar into a hot potato no one wants to keep. This is a very bad thing because it distorts market forces and makes it harder to save for your future. Someone is always holding the ball and experiencing that inflation. If it's not you, it's the company you're invested in that holds some cash so it can meet it's unpredictable obligations. Apple, for example, holds billions of dollars. Or maybe it's your employer would would be paying you more in real value if the government wasn't devaluing your pay check.

Yes he is. He's providing the use of the stretch of river he now owns. You're comparing a public-use asset to a private-use asset and saying that charging for using it is "rent seeking" with the justification that it was free when it was public-use. 
You could make this argument about literally anything. Someone buys some land and charges rent for it - not providing value so: rent seeking. Someone buy some land and mines some steel from it, they're providing value by extracting the steel, but they didn't actually produce the steel, so still rent seeking. Man buys a lawn mower and rents it out, he didn't build the lawn mower himself, so rent seeking. 
It sounds to me like you think natural resources (like land) shouldn't be owned. Is that really your position? What if we took the time to equitably distribute (or redistribute) all those natural resources to the people. People would still then own those things and should then be able to charge for the use of those things. While humans didn't produce the land, the market construct for charging for its use incentivizes that the land (or whatever resource) be used in the most efficient manner - thus creating (or at least preserving) wealth. This is a good thing. 
I say that none of these things are "rent seeking" because the owner of that resource is providing the use of that resource to other people - thus providing value. But if your argument is that the resource wasn't *produced* by humans and thus is simply commandeered for "extortion", I see your point about how that might meet the definition of "rent seeking", but I would then be forced to change my position about rent seeking - I'd have to say rent seeking isn't always a bad thing. 


Localized bubbles sure. But were there entire housing market bubbles on a national scale? I'd be surprised.


I don't think there's a rational economic incentive. I think its a widespead and common misunderstanding that leads people to *think* its in their best interests to put these restrictions in place. Too many short sighted people.


I agree. The NIMBYs. They just don't realize that those restrictions hurt themselves more than they help themselves (tho they hurt everyone else still more).


But you rent until then. So the entire time you're providing value. I would have to see some math to be convinced that the strategy you're talking about works out economically without them renting or using their land.


This is an interesting example, but also one fraught with confounding variables. Their marketing campaign is generally recognized as the most successful campaign in history. There's also irrational psychological reasons people buy higher-priced items over lower priced ones in certain realms (especially jewelry). These are not the rational decisions of investors, but rather the poor decisions of the ignorant that caused Da Beers to be so successful. Those confounding variables make Da Beers a particularly poor example to learn from about the phenomenon we're talking about. Tho I agree that the strategy of holding back their diamonds unused is one they've certainly benefited from, but only in the context of having primarily irrational buyers.

Oh ok sure. I wouldn't use the word "correct" to describe that. But what's wrong with a floating value?


I don't think that's clear at all. Just like its not at all clear that a seller is super happy to be forced to raise prices because of inflation. The number of bills aren't what's important. What's important is the buying power, and the buying power of one steel's worth of tokens in your simple example isn't changing. 


I don't agree, and I don't think your logic has shown that to be the case. I understand the logic of why you would think that, but it simply isn't how things operate in a closed system as I explained in my last comment.


Who's is wealth being transferred to and who is that wealth coming from?


True. But in such a case (assuming an equilibrium state) this means the economy at large is growing at 5% (or more if you take into account any population growth). In that case, the factory is a below average contributor to the economy and is actually in the red if you consider opportunity cost. Getting rid of that factory is exactly the right move in your example. Instead, the investment that would have gone to the factory shouldn't be invested in currency, but should be used for the 50% of the economy that has a better ROI.


It absolutely does. If your factory has a negative ROI (which it does in your example if you consider opportunity cost) it can be just as beneficial to hold the currency rather than operate a failing business.


What do you mean by "distortion"? If you're talking about things that make it less likely economic actors are going to have accurate information, I don't agree. Neither constant monetary inflation/deflation (ie monetary expansion/contraction, to your point) nor value inflation/deflation should cause rational economic actors to make worse choices. Only unpredictable changes in inflation/deflation do that. 


Ok, I think this is something we can work from. Why would the simple case work for this and not a more complex case? What's an example additional element that makes my conclusion break down? 


I was using "supply" to mean total quantity. If you're talking about the rate of coin creation, yes it will exponentially decrease. But I don't understand why you think that will be catastrophic events. The reduction in created coins will only lead to faster price rises. I guess I just don't see your point here.

That's not true. If you wanted to reduce the difficulty by 25%, you'd only have to keep the partitioned network fooled for a little less than half the retarget period. 
I think you'd be right if we were talking about retargeting every block by measuring the time between this block and the last block, but what I'm talking about is retargeting every block my measuring the average time between the last X blocks (similar to how bitcoin retargets every 2016 blocks using the average time between each of the last 2016 blocks). Retargeting using a measurement that spans a large number of blocks is important to prevent an attack, but I don't think the frequency of retargeting does anything to prevent any attack. In fact, more frequent retargeting would mean better blocktime consistency, and better resilience against hashpower witholding attacks (like has happened unintentionally because of bcash).

That's a pretty rude way to put it. I don't appreciate that. Of course there's tons of shit about USB I don't understand. But telling me I "don't know how USB works" is insulting and not accurate. Your information is interesting, but your tone really makes me want to say "fuck you". 
In any case, when you "copy the signed version to a usb", you're putting your trust in the manufacturer of that USB stick. So the security is of the same order of magnitude as a hardware wallet. If a maliciously modified hardware wallet can compromise your computer and steal your coins, so can a maliciously modified usb drive.

I'll agree with both papers that when you normally see price deflation of inflating fiat currencies, you're likely to also see fewer market activity. No disagreement there. 
I'll also agree that paying a penalty for not using your money incentivizes people to use their money in more cases. Inflation is effectively just that kind of penalty. Likewise, I agree that rewarding someone for not using their money incentivizes people to use their money in fewer cases. 
However, the cases that inflation causes to happen or deflation cuts off are the least efficient trades in the economy. So what would really happen in a long-term stable non-inflationary environment is not fewer trades, but more efficient trades. In an environment where deflation is bigger than the rate at which the economy is growing, then you see elimination of beneficial efficient trades (even tho they're still the least efficient ones).

Poverty is absolutely a government created problem. Pretty much everywhere you have poverty, it's because of some military dictator fucking his country over. In richer countries with real democracies, the poor are better off, but they're still poor because they're marginalized and have much worse representation in government. The legality of a plethora of predatory lending is an enormous part of what keeps people poor (not to mention the cheap credit that funds it via the Fed). So is the public education system that keeps all the school money in rich neighborhoods, so is welfare designed into cliffs, and unfair court systems, and over emprisinment. Poverty is absolutely the fault of bad government.

Who safeguards that asset? You are required to trust the entity providing that security. The company storing the asset for you can decide not to produce it when you ask to redeem the token for the underlying asset. Or the government can force them to freeze accounts or seize the stored assets. Therefore, any stablecoin currency isn't trustless like bitcoin is.

For the reasons i mentioned. Gold sucks as a currency: either too heavy or too small, not durable enough, etc. Precious metals stamped with some value other than "this much metal is in here" inevitably fail. Even if you accurately stamp the weight, people will chip off pieces, devaluing in the currency. 


The usability of a currency has 0 to do with whether its increased in value or not. If this is how you've interpreted my comments, you've misunderstood my points.

The goal shouldn't be to limit the types of people that are scammed, the goal should be to prevent scams and provide a mechanism for reimbursement to people who have been scammed when the scam is discovered.

How do they mandate the upgrade? 


Fork is in the word. Its a split. Its just that usually everyone's been in agreement and all gone with one of the fork's chains. 


Cryptocurrency consensus isn't like UN consensus. Its not a vote. Each individual decides what rules they follow. If they don't want to upgrade to the new monero node, they follow the old rules. If they're a miner, they'll be mining a different chain when the rest of the network splits off. Anyone using the old software would then follow that chain. This is how it works in bitcoin and monero and pretty much every other cryptocurrency. 


I'm happy to read a link you think is a good overview of your point. I don't quite understand what you mean when you say "If they can decide the connectivity requirements".


Devs are less powerful than you seem to think. Since anyone can make a fork, there is no monopoly. The second the devs start making bad or malicious decisions, people are gonna fork.

If people decide that saving money is worth more to them than non-necessity goods, who are you to tell them that's bad? You think people buying fewer TVs will hurt the economy? The economy isn't run by wasteful spending. The economy grows by finding more and more efficient ways to do what we want to do. If people don't spend money on TVs, more money will be spent on something else - for example investments in innovation. Any money that is "hoarded" increases the value of the money that's used for other things and so it doesn't matter how much money is hoarded - the money in circulation can't change in value for very long.

Your only point is:


This is not at all true. Its demonstrably and substantially harder to life a happy life if you're poor. The best thing to do is to get out of poverty as fast as possible. Its a terrible strategy to take one enormous risk that has a 1/1000 chance of succeeding on a reasonable timescale (say 2-4 years), because 999/1000 times, you'll just go deeper into poverty and spend the rest of your life trying to escape it. 
This is exactly why poverty is cyclical in the first place. The richer you are, the more disposable income you have to take risks with. That's why most inventors throughout history have been rich. That's why the US's economy during the 19th century grew so quickly, because a larger fraction of the population was able to save up enough wealth to take risks and innovate (because of a non-oppressive political environment like other countries had). 
I'll concede that's true if you're trying to win in a board game. If you're trying to make *more* money than whoever you're behind, you do need to take more risks. But life isn't a board game. You don't need to be the richest person in the world. Happiness is far more important. 
But you're the one who made a claim. You claimed that when you're behind, you need to take bigger risks. But you didn't bother to substantiate it, and yet hypocritically you asked me to substantiate mine. Which I've now done. How about you substantiate your claim now?

It's a non-inflationary currency, not deflationary. It just means prices will continue to fall as technology makes things cheaper and as the wealth of the world increases. There's no deflationary spiral unless you're country is going to shit so hard that currency is a better "investment" than real investments. Deflationary spiral really doesn't exist, there's not actually a net negative feedback loop that drives the value of the currency up without bound. Sustained deflation of a normally inflationary currency is just a symptom of other economic problems, not a cause. Intentionally non-inflationary currencies really can't be compared to those.

Monetary inflation is bad because it implies that someone is leaching the value of your money away from you by printing more of it. If the government (or the fed) printed more money, then instead of using it themselves, they sent an amount to each person in proportion to how much money they owned, then inflation wouldn't have a major downside unless it made pricing more difficult (which it usually does a bit).
If instead you're taking about *price* inflation, where no significant money is being printed, this is always bad because it means that things are getting more expensive, usually implying that they're getting more expensive to produce. In a real bad situation, this might mean your currency is losing value for other reasons, which is also bad.
What are the equivalent situations for deflation? 
If money is being destroyed in some way, this wouldn't be bad for owners of that currency unless someone was destroying their money directly without their content. So barring that unlikely case, this is actually always good for currency holders, and neutral overall.
If no money is being created or destroyed and prices are falling, this likely means that the economy is finding ways to be more efficient in how it produces things. This is normal and good. 
However, if instead of things getting cheaper it really means your currency is rising in value, this isn't normal and usually means that the market for investments is incredibly unhealthy - unhealthy enough to make a deflationary currency look safe by comparison. These are situations where the economy is in dire straights, but it's not the currency that's causing it, rather it's the fact that the economy is broken that is temporarily making the price of currency go up.
So no, monetary deflation (as in the destruction of money) is not bad.  Neither is a currency like future-bitcoin where no significant amount of currency will either be created or destroyed (or lost). What is bad is a shitty economy that makes your currency look like a good investment.

Apologies accepted. I definitely can see targeting hardware wallets to be more likely to be targetted for bitcoins specifically, but from the perspective of the state, it would make the most sense to only put effort into compromising the most popular devices they can get away with. For example, if the govt was able to compromise Intel's hardware manufacturing process (via bribery, threats, or covert design injection), your air gapped computer could transmit anything it wants via the usb drive (according to the article you sent me). This would be far more effective than trying to compromise trezor or even large companies like Kingston that make usb drives. They could monitor or steal a whole array of things, including bitcoin on air gapped computers (tho not ones on genuinely produced hardware wallets).
So if the target is only Bitcoin, i think you're right that trezor puts a larger target on you. But if the target is anything and everything someone might want to steal, something with a larger customer base would be much more likely to have this problem. In fact, for your process you need to trust both your pc hardware manufacture(s) (including chip designer, motherboard manufacturer, usb port manufacturer, etc) and the usb drive itself. Plus, you can never use that usb drive for this purpose ever again, or you also have to trust that your non air gapped computer hasn't been compromised (defeating the purpose of the air gap). Is it really feasible to buy a new  usb drive anytime you want to withdraw from your cold storage? With trezor, it's a much simpler device with fewer parts and therefore far fewer manufacturers and entities you need to trust.
I guess it all comes down to who you trust for your hardware. Until we can print our own hardware, this will have to be the case.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:58:16


lol, that's ironic. 


Fair enough, I apologize. 


The minimum requirement for money is that its a medium of exchange. 
Backed money represents an obligation. For example, when the gold standard was enacted, the dollar represented an obligation that the government would exchange 1 dollar for 25 and 4/5 grains (about 1.67 grams) of 90% fine gold. 
Fiat currency on the other hand doesn't represent any such obligation or any obligation of any kind. Holding a dollar does not grant you any kind of rights to impose obligation on the US government nor any private person. 
Money hasn't ever represented anything that the *holder* is obligated to do. It has only ever been either a commodity or a note that represents an obligation of some other person or institution to the currency holder. 


What someone says a currency is "backed" it means that some entity is obligated to redeem it for something. The dollar isn't backed by this definition. 
And the dollar is the world currency mostly because of the Bretton Woods agreement:  . And its remained the world currency from a combination of momentum (from Bretton Woods), the massive purchasing power of the US, and the relative historical stability of the dollar in comparison to most other national currencies. 


No its not. Think through that logically. What value does that guarantee exactly? How would you estimate that value? The tax obligation is an ephemeral one - you only have to do it once a year. The rest of the year that mechanism provides the dollar no buy pressure. Its a very very weak guarantee of value.

Usage is up from a little over a year ago. Volume has been dropping since the surge in price a year ago, pretty much tracking the price. So what this indicates to me is not that trading volume in bitcoins has declined over the past year, but that the price has declined and therefore the volume being transferred around has followed that price. So given that information, I'd have to disagree with you that adoption is "going backwards". Looks like at worst its staying flat. Which is what you'd expect based on historical precedent of people getting bored of bitcoin when the price isn't wildly fluctuating. Notice the uptick in transaction volume following the recent price upset?

Seems like it could be easily detected what proportion of a block is filled with transactions at the top of the mempool vs ones farther down and set fee rates according to what's likely to get into the block. Maybe set the fee to something like the minimum between the 10 percentile fee rate from the last few blocks and the top of the mempool.

I'm not sure that's the case. Are you saying that if you're a merchant paid with a credit card, your bank gets usually credited within a single day? What about charge backs? Anyone can file for a charge back for like 60 days if not more - so the transaction can't be final until that period of time has passed (unless banks are willing to take legal action to claw back funds - usually a liability corps avoid). 


Yeah, that's a good catch all word for what I was talking about. Fraud was only one example of a cost you pay (indirectly) when using a card that you don't need to pay with bitcoin. Of course, all the interchange fees above the cost of a bitcoin transaction fee are things you don't need to pay for. I was just trying to say that traditional payments via a credit card are complex processes involving heavyweight financial machinery that aren't cheap.

This is also misleading. Yes bullet proofs would reduce transaction fees **for monero**. But for bitcoin it would actually increase fees because while bullet proofs would replace a less space efficient structure in a monero transaction, bullet proofs would add a new previously nonexistent structure to bitcoin.
It sort of feels like you're aggregating information in this blog entry without really understanding the things you're writing about.. I'd appreciate this article more if i had confidence the things you're saying are accurate. Like you don't seem to understand that confidential transactions aren't "like" bullet proofs, bullet proofs are a technique that decreases the space necessary for confidential transactions. What you're saying is akin to "A car is like an engine" - no it's not. An engine is part of a car.

Ensuring "third-party" oversight isn't a goal, its a technique. This assumes that the SEC knows how to do a reasonable job at oversight. It assumes that the SEC *wants* to do that job right. It also assumes the SEC can't be corrupted by organizations that want special protection. Yes, fraud requires proving intent. Guess what: we have innocent until proven guilty in the US and many other countries. If you can't prove you're being defrauded, then chances are you're not being defrauded. Putting up barriers that every legitimate company has to go through in order to prevent a handful of fraudsters can be very wasteful. Assuming any regulation put up is good regulation is a terrible idea. 


So what? We're not discussing having any regulation vs having none. No one is talking about that. Regulation should be minimal and effective. Often its neither.

What? What account? Who's storing the assets in that account? Can we please make this concrete? It certainly doesn't sound like you're talking about gold, which would have to be stored and guarded by a 3rd party (if you think that a 3rd party need not be involved). However, even if you're talking about completely information assets, like ownership of stock, this requires trusting that the relevant government jurisdiction will fairly judge your legal case if the company decides to reneg on its stock. This is trust in a 3rd party. This is fundamental to a backed asset.

That's mathematically impossible. Mixing pools cannot get to 100% uncertainty. Not even monero or zcash can do that. Actually what I hear is that the only way to make a transaction completely and 100% untraceable is to forfeit the ability to constrain the currency (meaning anyone can simply create the currency from thin air) - which makes it not that useful.


But trading two currencies with base level privacy isn't practically traceable. Any ephemeral transformation through a private currency or mixing service where the source and destination are non-private can be deanonymized via correlation techniques (among other techniques).

What complicates things is people using irrelevant information to come to wrong conclusions. Almost every time someone talks about how deflationary currencies aren't sustainable they point out deflationary events in fiat currencies as if it would be at all related. There's an enormous difference between a normally monetarily inflationary currency that is suddenly and surprisingly rising in price even as more continues to be printed, and a currency that has a 100% predictable amount of monetary inflation with a hard cap rising expectedly in value over time. 
Imagine your currency is monetarily inflating at 2% in an investment environment with a *negative* average ROI of -2%. In such an environment, even if you couldn't predict the currency will rise in value, you would choose to hold your currency (and lose 2%) rather than invest in a losing venture (since the additional risk has a cost as well). In such an environment, it's no surprise that the currency's value goes up as people want it over normal investments. But this is indicative of an economic shit hole, not a normal economy with a positive average rate of return. The problem in such a situation is that the economy is losing money and therefore it contracts. But of course a losing and contracting economy is unsustainable. The price rise of the currency is the effect, not the cause. And without exception these events occur with a currency that is monetarily *inflating*. Monetary inflation and value decrease inflation are *very* different beasts.

The problem isn't interest. The problem is that ridiculously irresponsible behavior has been normalized and even encouraged in our society. Everyone has a credit card. Why? To make payments. But why the credit? Cause "you need to build credit". It's the stupidest thing in the world to me that you aren't in good credit standing if you simply always have enough money to pay for what you buy.
Credit cards are predatory and regularly mislead customers by changing their interest rates and rewards without any agreement by the customer. People don't need credit cards. The ones who "need" the extra money to "make it by" are exactly the ones who shouldn't have credit cards because they'd be better off without the credit (and the interest costs). Credit cards are a trap for the poor and are useless for those who aren't poor.
Also, why the fuck is it reasonable to get a $500,000 loan to buy a house? You are losing money on that deal i guarantee it. Why don't people buy something affordable like a condo and upgrade when they have the money? It's stupid. And guess what: A HOUSE IS NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT. Sorry to burst anyone's bubbles (tho i won't have to in a year or two when the market does it for me.. again), but you'll make more money by investing in govt bonds that you would in a house.

What I'm trying to say is primarily that "centralized" can apply to almost anything. Bitcoin Core, for example, is a centralized organization. They're a small group that control what they work on. Same with the open source Bitcoin Core project - they control it. However, the code itself is open source and is therefore open to decentralized forking of the code. And there are clients other than Bitcoin Core you can use. So while the (arguably) primary Bitcoin project is centralized, the system as a whole isn't. 
And this is exactly the same situation with Open Bazaar. Its an open protocol with an open source project. You could create your own Open Bazaar program that interacts with the main one just fine. People could then choose to use yours instead of theirs. So are you saying Open Bazaar the *company* is centralized? If so, I definitely agree. But if you're saying Open Bazaar the protocol or system is centralized, I don't agree.

It also discourages people from accepting it as currency by the exact same factor. Adding more negative charge changes nothing if you add the same amount of positive charge.

Interesting. Thought Bisq was the only one. However, some of these seem to be advertising themselves as

Etherdelta, IDEX, cryptobridge in particular absolutely aren't "decentralized" tho sounds like they all use some kind of installed program (either a browser extension or a standalone installation) which is a step in the right direction. Sounds like they might tell you that you're sending into a multi-sig address or something like that where you need to sign as well, but with a webapp its pretty easy to trick users if you want to. I wouldn't trust a web app where everything happens in-app. Kyber has an option that asks you for your *private* key! That is shady as fuck.
Am I right that Bisq is the only P2P decentralized exchange that doesn't require interaction with a central 3rd party? (I know Bisq still requires 3rd party mediators, but you can pick and choose from a large list of mediators rather than everything going through one company)

I agree with you that in the current environment, most vendors will immediately exchange the bitcoin for their country's currency. 
However, I disagree that "you're just" doing that. There's other things taking place here. If you buy something with bitcoin, it means that business is more likely to *continue* taking bitcoin, and put in efforts to make paying them with bitcoin easier. It also sends a signal to *other* businesses that its in their best interests to start accepting bitcoin. And beyond that, it puts businesses in a better position to do things like buy things with bitcoin *themselves* or pay their employees with bitcoins. None of that happens if you just hold onto your bitcoins forever.


I don't know why you thought I was implying otherwise...
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:45:12


I don't think this is a good point. Your example made no mention of subsidies or other market distortions. In an example like this, there is nothing to look at other than profit margin. 


This tho is a good point I think. I see what you're saying. If an economy is operating at maximum possible efficiency, there will still be a range of ROIs where some investments end up being in the 1st percentile and some in the 99th percentile. 
This one caught me for a bit, but after thinking about it, I see that isn't actually the case. In any situation where you have a type of business that has above average ROI, you can theoretically convert your below average business into that type - or at least funnel the money going into your current below-average investment into that above average one. So while your statement that "10% GDP (per capita) growth is not only made of businesses that have a 10% profit margin" is factually correct in a complex ever-changing market environment, in an equilibrium state, every business *will* have the same ROI. Even in a complex ever-changing environment like the one we live in, the right economic move is to cull businesses with below average ROI and start more new businesses in areas that have above average ROI. This competition in higher ROI areas will bring that area's ROI downward while at the same time bringing the average up. 






All true. However, I think what you're trying to show is that money sitting around doing nothing is a waste. That I disagree with. No matter how much money is in circulation, that's how much investment can be done. If you double the amount of money in circulation, you are *not* doubling the amount of resources that can be invested. In fact, the amount of resources that would be used with double the money in the economy would be exactly the same, because each unit of currency would be worth half as much. I think this is perfectly encapsulated by what you said: "Money is a token for wealth, not the wealth itself."


This is also true of any decreased available quantity. This is simply supply and demand at work. In your money/steel example, if you add a second commodity, say rice, if the quantity of available rice is increasing faster than the quantity of available steel, the steel will be worth more rice. There's nothing inefficient about this, its exactly what should happen in an efficient economy. It does mean that steel holdings are gaining net worth while rice holdings are losing net worth, but this is because steel is becoming more valuable. Similarly, any currency you own is a reward for past services rendered or products delivered. In an economy where products and services are becoming cheaper (which happens as the economy grows), past services rendered were more valuable at the time than current services. So it makes sense that the currency you got as a reward for those services increases in value.
So this is not rent-seeking, it is simply the value of your past economic activity holding its value. 


Yes.. but doesn't change how I'm used to reading the word "supply". Let's use "rate of supply change" or something like that rather than "supply" since that word is ambiguous. I used "available quantity" above for talking about the amount available for trade on the market.

Saying something is "centralized" is meaningless unless you're talking about consequences of that centralization. Your bitcoin node is "centralized" because only you control it, but that fact has no relevant bearing on bitcoin. This is the same as Bisq the organization controlling the code - they don't own the code (it's open source) and anyone can work on it or change it. The organization is just one actor in the open source project. If they fuck it up, someone else will take it over. That's not significant centralization.

You're not understanding me. There are only 4 ways buying a stock can make you money:
1. Dividends
2. The company buys it back from you
3. Somebody else buys it from you
4. Company Liquidation
Case 3 is completely disconnected with the company's operations - that money made buy the stock owner didn't come from the *company*. Case 4 is almost always means you're losing the vast majority of your initial investment.
So the true (and at the end of the day, unknowable) *value* of the stock is only dependent on items 1 and 2. A stock that will never pay dividends and will never be bought back from the company is a stock that its owners will find out was worthless. Do you disagree with that?

Windows is a bit terrifyingly insecure, but honestly so is Linux, and mac os. How do you know if you have a keylogger or screen capture virus? If you do none of these OSs will tell you. Since they're all monolithic OSs, there's huge attack surfaces. And often you can't do the things you want to do without giving programs root access. Popular OSs (Linux included) are simple garbage for security. 
At least with Android and iOS almost all programs can't even ask for elevated privileges. That's why mobile is often considered more secure than desktop.

But pretty much everyone with a computer is vulnerable to spectre. That's why having a hardware wallet is so important.

The moral foundation that I see is that you should be able to use the fruits of your research and protect those from freeloaders. But if someone independently discovers what you discovered, then you morally shouldn't have any right to bar their use of their own discovery (I understand that's a difficult thing to prove - but I think the moral foundation is theoretically solid). 
But at the same time, you don't own nature, you just own your research. The fact that you discovered it shouldn't allow you to prevent anyone from using natural laws however they want. But it does make sense to guarantee the discoverer/inventor receives a substantial fraction of the initial benefits of its use.

A trezor also never connects to a network. The exact same process happens when using a trezor. An unsigned transaction is sent to the trezor, the trezor sends the transaction back signed, electrum allows you to evaluate the signed transaction to your heart's content (verifying that it does what you want it to do), and then you broadcast it. 


Even on windows computers newer than 2007, this isn't true. A USB device can't simply execute anything it wants to on your computer. Something has to be using it. So no, it couldn't be doing "anything".

Ah, that's a good point. I stand corrected. Tho I'd still say "locked" isn't quite the right word to use there.


I've been wondering if it would be possible for a hardware wallet to validate LN through-way transactions so there is no significant increased security cost. I would imagine a hardware wallet could validate that they have an incoming payment that is not less than the outgoing payment, and only then provide the software LN node the info it needs to complete the payment. It would have to store the lightning transactions in case the computer it's connected to is malicious, but that shouldn't take up too much drive space. Is this possible?

A) nope, the LN is completely trustless, so fraud is impossible.

Yes, it does. What is anything worth other than what you can do with it? A hot dog is 30,0000 satoshi of deliciousness, but the ability to send $1000 any where in the world for 10 cents within 10 minutes makes it more valuable. The lightning network will bring this down to 1/100th of a cent for instant transactions, making bitcoin more useful than the dollar in almost any context. 
The store of value comes in because we know the currency's monetary policy is stable. It's predictable to a level far above what any currency that's come before it has had. It's inflation is predictable to the minute even a century from now. It gives confidence that that value it has now will still be there in 10 or 100 years.

Bitcoin does finalize faster, but other people are right that confidence in the payment happens faster with a credit card. Settlement is a gradient, it happens over time as the probability the money will be irreversibly yours grows towards 100%. For bitcoin, 1 confirmation is probably usually just as good if not a lot better than a completed credit card transaction. While a credit card transaction is much faster, the cost of charge backs and investigating potential fraud, and reissuing cards, etc costs a lot, which is why credit card transactions are so expensive for merchants.

The biggest problem bitcoin can solve is inflation and the resulting wealth transfer (from the people and to the bankers and wall street) and market distortions. The dollar has lost over half it's value in the last 20 years because of this. This is all value that has been taken from everyone and given to the federal reserve. Also, central banks are becoming the biggest investors in the world. In Japan, their central bank owns over 3/4ths of their ETFs. This puts everyone at enormous risk of both subtle and [obvious]( insider trading and market manipulation schemes.
Giving your money to a bank to lend out won't necessarily stop, but perhaps they'll be forced to give you a fair cut of the proceeds. And hopefully credit cards will become less prevalent and less parasitic. But the real win is ending the fed's reign of insanity that caused the great depression and exacerbates every single business cycle.

Well I mean historically, precious metals had a far longer run than even the best of fiat currencies. But you just asked for some examples, those are the clearest ones. 


Paper notes became more used than gold only because paper notes are substantially more convenient than gold. This additional convenience lends them extra value than the gold itself, but it comes at a cost. The cost is trust. Trust in the bank that issues those notes. You'd be trusting the bank will honor those notes when you redeem them. The most stable and trusted institutions meant that this trust-cost was low enough to make using paper notes worth that cost. 
But when the backing of the currency was removed, this was a genius move for the banks, since this was effectively the first inflationary move. The banks got to keep the gold, and we got to keep the notes. The only reason this worked is because at this point our society had been indoctrinated to treat those notes as having value in their own right. This would have been all well and good if post-gold-standard dollars (dollars that aren't backed by / redeemable for actual gold) were released on the market and fairly traded (like Bitcoin has always been), but instead money holders were promised gold but only ended up owning paper. This immediately devalued all that paper, and subsequent money-creation only devalues it further. 


Plenty of people want to spend it, but its a chicken and egg problem and these things take time. People want to spend it, but the places that sell the things they want to buy don't usually take bitcoin. And most businesses don't really care about taking bitcoin yet because most people don't have it to spend. But there are niches where businesses do care because their customers do have bitcoin. And the size of these niches is growing. That's why people celebrate pizza day.
Compounding this is that the technology still isn't easy to use. But it'll get there in time. The lightning network holds a lot of promise once it demonstrates full functionality (I'm waiting for good watchtower programs or services). 


Maybe, but I think over time the growing pains will substantially ease and there will be almost no reason to use a currency that isn't a cryptocurrency. The necessary technology and network growth for its convenience to be more than credit cards and cash takes time. As more people use it, the less volatile the price will be (ergo the law of large numbers).

Economic principles work just as well in china as they do in the US.

You can't talk about the day bitcoin stops inflating in like 2140 and then say "who's spending bitcoin today?" How bout asking "who will be spending bitcoin in 2140?" Things will be a hell of a lot different in the world when bitcoin stops inflating. People say hodl today because we haven't reached market saturation yet - bitcoin is massively undervalued because most people in the world don't understand it. Things won't be like that forever. Eventually the price will stabilize as the world at large understands and starts using bitcoin, especially as things like the lightning network make it far more convenient to use.

Ok, you use your fiat to buy groceries what do you do when you run out of fiat? Why don't you ask to be paid with fiat? Once you use up your fiat and aren't getting anymore, you're gunna use your bitcoin at *least* for necessities right? And then you're bound to think "fuck it, life is short, I'm gonna use this bitcoin I'm earning for fun stuff".
The idea that people won't spend a deflationary currency is absurd if you think about it. Yes there's more value in holding into it than an inflationary currency, but on the other hand there is **exactly** as much more value in accepting it as payment vs an inflationary currency. These balance each other out. So if you think no one will use their deflationary currency because they want to hold into it, you should expect no one will accept an inflationary currency as payment because they want to get rid of it. Obviously this hasn't held true.
Not only that, but eventually bitcoin will stop being deflationary and start being non-inflationary. It will stabilize probably to a level of volatility below what the dollar has now (since it won't be being manipulated unpredictably by central banks). It's value should then only rise at the rate of population growth or perhaps gdp growth. 
And merchants probably *will* give discounts for using bitcoin because it costs them so much less than either credit cards or cash (lots of places are going cashless because of the cost and risk of handling cash).
The only reason people yell and scream about "deflationary currencies" is that when a normally inflationary currency becomes deflationary, it is a very strong indicator that your economy has gone to shit. Think about it, if there aren't any investments in your country that give a return higher then -3%, you're country is well and fucked. And that's exactly when people move their money into a currency that's inflating at 3%. But there has never been any intentional deflationary or non-inflationary currency before bitcoin. The "deflationary spirals" are symptoms of a shit economy, and have nothing to do with an intentionally designed non inflationary currency. Central banks have encouraged shill economists to say "a little inflation is good" so they can be more comfortable the sheepulation won't get too pissed off about it, but any monetary inflation *is* bad. Non inflation is only bad if you're used to being able to print money.

Legal tender law is not a significant factor. All it means are that *debts* can be settled with the legal tender, but not that shops must accept the currency for POS purchases.


You're comparing apples to oranges. There are a million differences between the market environment for dollars vs bitcoin, and yet you point to one and say "thats it that's the one, and the proof is that they're different".

@_date: 2018-03-06 23:06:09


I'm not saying its deliberate. I'm just saying you're doing it. 
To quickly summarize my opinion of your points:


Irrelevant. I'm only concerned with a currency once it has stabilized (ie reached full adoption or approximately whatever maximum adoption it will get).


Very wrong. Monetary inflation or deflation is only a function of creation or destruction of the currency, so I agree that monetary inflation/deflation has nothing to do with the economy. However, if you're talking about value inflation/deflation, it very much depends on the economy, since as an economy gets more efficient prices go down because real material *costs* go down. On the other hand, if demand in general goes up, prices can go up.  It sounds like we agree about monetary inflation. I'm going to use the term "value inflation" for decreased currency value independent of monetary inflation.


Um, I never claimed that.


Not sure why any of this is relevant.
If you'd like to have the last word on any of the above, go ahead. But I'm not really interested in continuing those subtopics. 
I'm getting pretty tired of this conversation. In an effort to save it and find some way to come to a conclusion, I'd like to propose we enumerate the possible reasons deflation is unsustainable/bad in a currency and discuss the logic behind each of them separately. While using history to support logic is certainly useful, its a far more time-intensive and often less precise way to get to the truth. Using historical currencies is complicated by the fact that historical currencies simply don't cover everything that's possible with a currency, so let's avoid them.
I'll start. Reasons Bitcoin's low-monetary-inflation policy is unsustainable / not workable as a currency:
1) Deflation in a currency causes people to hoard that currency
I'll agree that if a currency is consistently rising in value, it will act similarly to any asset at that risk level and appreciation rate. If the currency is consistently appreciating faster than say, most stocks, people will stop investing in most lower yield stocks and instead "hoard" the currency. 
2) Hoarding currency causes a "deflationary spiral"
This is false. Holding supply of the currency constant, the maximum value a currency can reach is proportional to the size of the economy. Therefore as "hoarding" continues, the rate of increase in value will decrease until it reaches a maximum, at which it'll stay until the market environment changes (which of course it always does constantly). 
Do you have other logical reasons to add?

Bitcoin is more than just an investment craze because a large fraction of the investors *do* believe in it as a currency.

Absolutely. In fact the program already does this. Its the line that says something like `47% transactions batched (estimated) (73230/154603)` (from data for the last 12 hours).

Why would anything need to be "reblanced"? If you mean that people might need to add more funds to their side of a channel, sure. This can be done in *one* transaction (not two). How would an unbalanced channel lock up funds? 
I don't think garbage collection is an adequate metaphor here, because garbage collection isn't economically driven. Garbage collection only occurs on unused memory. By contrast, in the LN, restructuring a channel requires a fee, and this has to be weighed against the benefit of restructuring the channel. 
But for all your exposition, you still haven't explained to me how inefficiency would happen in the LN. Give me a scenario.

um actually that's exactly what happened. If you split the network, not only does bitcoin lose value (temporarily) as some people decide to move to bcash and therefore some of the value gets stored in bcash rather than bitcoin, but bitcoin's network gets a bit smaller making it have exponentially smaller value. Of course this is all temporary until bcash dies an ugly death.


Now you're a *lucky* weak handed bitch. Great job being lucky. As much as you think you can, you cannot predict the market. By trying you're just gambling. The fact that you won doesn't make the gambling a good idea in retrospect. It was a shit idea that ended up in your favor cause you got lucky. 
In a market where the price is not only rising on average, but it's rising compared to most assets in the market, selling is an especially stupid gamble. And if you did enough research to understand why bitcoin has a significant shot at being the first world currency, you'd know bitcoin can realistically still rise 50,000% from where it is now. If you understood the state of the lightning network, you'd understand how fast things are moving. If you had done your due diligence, you'd be terrified to sell.

You're absolutely wrong. Bitcoin isn't deflationary, it's non inflationary. When market saturation is reached, the value will only grow at the rate of gdp growth. 
People are absolutely right when they say gold is a similar value-increasing currency that never had any catastrophic deflationary spirals. A deflationary spiral is not the result of anything related to the currency directly but is, rather, a symptom of a failing economy where investments have gone rotten and people don't feel safe in lending their money to other people in that economy. It has nothing to do with the money itself. 
The fear of a deflationary currency is not rooted in solid economic theory, but is misinformed historical analysis. It's misinterpreting the symptom as the cause. You should rethink why you think a deflationary currency is unsustainable.

But wars don't help the US economy and don't help bolster the value of the dollar. In fact, having a strong military that mostly stays *out* of wars is the best for the dollar. And the government doesn't really have much to gain from keeping the value of the dollar high. As inflation rises, tax revenues also rise so the buying-power of tax money in total stays the same (or rises with productivity). And the FED can simply create more money as needed to keep up with any inflation. The main concern is keeping the dollar strong against other national currencies. Banning bitcoin won't help do that, tho it would preserve the ability for the FED to extract value from dollar holders via inflation. Bitcoin's ability to close the inflation loophole is the only incentive governments have to ban it.

To where? First of all, if you're paying a fee for banking, then obviously costs are built into that. Its likely that your money shuttling is subsidized by all the people who don't shuttle money around in the same way. 
But wire transfer fees are usually charged for transferring money between *different* banks. Is that what you're doing? 
Here's some information on what costs and limitations generally are in wire transfers: 
An example is Xoom which is limited to $3000 for a $5 fee. Bitcoin currently beats that. $600 billion are wire transferred each year. So small fee saving can really make a huge difference there.

What I'm saying is that the same amount of investment will happen regardless of people's saving habits. If more people spend money faster because its currency is being inflated, more money is around and its value's decreasing by exactly the same amount as people's mad spending is increasing the velocity of money. If you have a deflationary currency, the opposite is true. The number of businesses started and projects built in the world doesn't change depending on how much inflation there is (ignoring any misuse of the inflation revenue that might happen).
Inflation neither causes people to buy more things, in the long run, nor causes more investment. It just causes more money to be needed to buy all those things.

Monero not only has confidential transactions but anonymity of the sender and recipient. Not only that, but almost *every* transaction is like that since privacy is default. If bitcoin actually does get bulletproofs, it will either be optional or will be a side chain, so not default. You only get maximum privacy if everyone's doing private transactions. And if your base chain isn't private, you'll eventually be losing some anonymity when interacting with it. 
So in short, bullet proofs in bitcoin don't obsolete monero and bitcoin is unlikely to ever obsolete monero because of the inherent trade offs necessary for full privacy.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:56:57

You don't lose your money by losing your hardware wallet. The attacker has to also have your pin and password (assuming you've set one up, which you should). 


Because your laptop has a GIFUCKINGANTIC attack surface. If you install trustworthy software on the laptop and never bring it online, then its the same as a hardware wallet, but way more expensive and way harder to use (you have to sign transactions then send them to an online machine to use manually, since software doesn't support your custom setup like they do for standard hardware wallets).

A block size increase is dangerous. Block propagation times were already 40 seconds (for distribution to 95% of the nodes) for 1mb blocks. With segwit's 2-3 mb block size limit, that increases to 80 or 100 seconds, which cuts off about 15% of the avg 10 minutes of time that miners have to find the next block. Centralization pressure is already that 15%. Doubling that is not an option. Multiplying it by 6 would literally make it impossible to be profitable as a smaller miner. 
So yes it's dangerous.

China's authoritarian directives have absolutely pushed it far ahead of the squalor its previous authoritarian regimes had perpetuated. Its really flabbergasting to me how people point to this as a positive for china-style authoritarian regimes. Even more stupid is the people that try to say China has a new form of government. They don't. Its basically a dictatorship. 
Countries with authoritarian regimes can certainly have massive growth between huge valleys of economic stagnation or collapse. You should read Why Nations Fail by Acemoglu and Robinson. They have a very clear and well supported theory on the effects of government institutions that explains china, russia, the US, and all the rest: 
And lastly, democracy vs non-democracy is not a binary thing. Russia, for example, has a "democracy" but very little real representation of its people. India has a similar problem to a far lesser degree. And so does the US for that matter. Democracy is new and something we still have to improve on. But the economic effects a democracy has, of causing sustained but slow growth, are far better than the massive economic swings and generally far lower economic prosperity of authoritarian countries.

I do remember hearing something about this. Something like the only way to ensure decentralization is by sacrificing anonymity. Imagine if all the major mining operations and pools were secretly owned by the same entity, how would you know? Of course one of the nice things about cryptocurrencies is that we don't have to come to any consensus (decentralized or not) about which coin/chain is the right one to follow. We can all individually choose which ones we transact with. So we don't need to sacrifice anonymity for users even if it would help to ensure that mining is decentralized.

Give me some credit. I read shadow stats. 


What's your definition of hyper-inflation here? A common cutoff for "hyper" inflation is 50% month over month inflation. That's clearly not happening in the US.
Believe me, I agree that we're getting fucked by inflation, but we're also getting fucked by things that aren't inflation. Like zoning laws and health care regulatory capture. 


Lol, no its not. They want you to believe that rising housing costs (aka housing prices) are a GOOD thing. And they want you to believe that not enough government subsidized housing is the reason people can't afford apartments. 


Detroit was a one trick pony that died when their one trick did. Detroit isn't any kind of bastion against zoning either. Houston is the only major US city without heavy zoning laws.
The rhetoric for zoning is "keeping a place desirable" - but its really all just NIMBYism that benefits specific people to the detriment of everyone else. 


There isn't only one problem in the world. I agree with you that inflation is a problem, but its not the only one.

Let's be specific. You're talking about a small degree of monetary inflation and a larger degree of value inflation (caused by a decrease in supply vs population/economic-growth)


Not quite accurate. As many many others on this subreddit have pointed out, Gresham's law only applies to pegged currencies. If you have an otherwise worthless piece of paper you can claim for gold, you'll use it since who knows how long that situation will last (it never lasts long in the grand scheme of things). 


People have done that with so many kinds of coins. Recently we've seen people melting copper coins because of copper's rise in price. The problem is that these coins had a pegged value when their actual value is different. This will always create problems one way or another. It has nothing to do with using the actual metal as currency. If you want to print notes, doing it with valuable metal is just dumb if you have cheaper alternatives. 
And gold coins (and pretty much every other coin throughout history) have been often watered down by the issuing governments over time. This kind of watering down is exactly the kind of circumstance where Gresham's law holds. Your coin is supposed to be worth 1 ounce of gold, but it printed on metal worth half that. Of course you're gonna try to offload it as quick as possible. This is more a function of low-level fraud (ie pretending a coin is worth 1oz of gold when it doesn't actually have that much in it) than of deflation.

For sure : ) . Monero and Bitcoin both have solid utility as actual currency, in my opinion. Monero has some potential to do things the Bitcoin community might not be willing to do. Or it might become a side chain. Or it might overtake Bitcoin. I don't think it'll do that last one tho.
Like DCS implied, Bitcoin has major first-mover-advantage in the cryptocurrency world. It has the ability to incorporate many if not all of the improvements that altcoins make. And even better, it can wait to see the consequences of many of those altcoin "improvements" to see if they're really improvements or not before deciding to incorporate those changes. Bitcoin will likely be the major player for a long time. But monero certainly is one of the few that might give it a run for its money, and has the potential to exist as a slightly nichier currency alongside bitcoin as other alts die (tho niche may end up being the wrong word for what monero becomes).

I'm so tired of talking to people like you that don't understand how money works. Money is not a resource. MONEY is just a number. If people save $1 trillion more dollars rather than spending or investing it, it means the money that *isn't* saved is worth $1 trillion more. You can't change the amount of value circulating in the economy for any significant length of time just by withholding or adding to the money supply. Hoarding more money just makes the money being used more valuable, and spending more money makes that money less valuable. If someone starts saving more money, that does NOT negatively affect the economy at all. It just means that the people who are using their money in the economy have more say as to what gets done.

For sure : ) . So key in my explanation there is that propagation times increase linearly with block size. But there's reason to question that, since there are multiple components to propagation time, and only one of those components is linear.
The components are throughput time and latency. Throughput time is the time it takes to transfer a full block to the node with the route with the slowest bandwidth in whatever percentile set you're choosing to look at. That is clearly linear. But the latency to node with the slowest bandwidth. Really you need to find the node where latency + bandwidth is the slowest (plus here being conceptual, not mathematical). Also (usually) minor is the time it takes to verify a block (since that happens before the block propagates). That might be linear (not sure), but should also be pretty small (maybe insignificant? also not sure).
But the concept is the same. At some block size, there will be nodes that literally don't get to even start mining. And below that obviously harmful block size, less-well-connected nodes will just get less time to mine the block. And since blocks are almost always found within 9 minutes, if they get 2 minutes less time, that's usually just as bad as not being given a chance to mine the block at all. 


Yes indeed. Here's one study that did exactly that:
To quote the study:


for small blocks, less than roughly 20KB in size, latency was a significant factor
in block propagation times. Beyond this size, throughput was the dominating
factor, and was invariant in block size; thus they found that for large enough
blocks the block propagation times grew linearly with respect to the block size.
This indicates that since we're well beyond 20KB, the linear effects dominate, and so 4MB blocks are where you start getting &gt;2min propagation times to around 5% of the network. Since with segwit we're pretty much there (max blocksize is technically 4mb, but will probably almost never be more than about 2.5mb).

Volatility depends in the time frame you're looking at. If you're looking week to week, yes it's very volatile. But week to week volatility has no bearing on whether or not it's a good store of value. Year to year volatility is far more appropriate, and the volatility of bitcoin's rate of growth year to year is pretty stable. 
Holding an asset that's growing in value is an incentive to keep it, but anyone would spend it when what they want to spend it for is worth more to them than keeping it. Since bitcoin doesn't have any monetary deflation (or inflation), this will be a low rate of value growth eventually. Is a 3% interest rate on $20 more valuable to you, or is eating food today more valuable to you? People spend their money whether or not that money is an investment.

Bitcoin isn't some unknown risky asset anymore. While, yes, it is volatile, volatility is not a factor in long term investments. I think you mean to be talking about "risk", and bitcoin's risk of crashing below $3000 is getting vanishingly small. Of course, that's only my opinion.

I'm using it to change bitcoin diamond, but so far its absolute garbage. It won't deal with amounts more specific than 3 decimal places, which means I'm inevitably going to loose some bcd that I can't exchange through their system and I'm probably going to lose some bitcoin that I can't withdraw from their system. 
Also, THEY CHARGE YOU FOR WITHDRAWAL. I'm not just talking about bitcoin transaction fees, they literally take $16 from you for withdrawal that they don't use as a bitcoin tx fee. Their fees for transacting bitcoin are around $18 and yet the fee they place is only about $1.50. Here's an example of a transaction where I requested 0.0245 BTC be transfered:  . As you can see only 0.02249999 was sent even tho there was only a fee of 0.00012321 (their site advertises a 0.002 withdrawal fee). 
Don't use it unless you have to.

True, but a hardware wallet storing keys shouldn't be a problem. And if that hardware wallet is only signing transactions that net to 0, it "being online" shouldn't be a problem either. Any hacks to the main machine should be entirely unable to steal funds in that scenario. 


Software like this tends to be built in backwards-compatible ways. Not upgrading in the lightning network shouldn't be a deal breaker. Not to mention, hardware wallets have firmware that can be upgraded just as easily as software (because firmware is software).

The correct miner business strategy is to spend all your money to build a mining array, then keep spending their earnings until the expected return on new hardware is lower than the expected return on the bitcoins they would spend on that hardware. There is some cutoff where a given miner should stop investing in new hardware and start reaping all the benefits of saving up their mined coins. I haven't done the math here so I don't know when that is.

If you had looked at the price chart 4 years ago, you would have also seen a recent huge spike. Where did it go, you ask? Why don't you see it on the price chart now? It's eclipsed by newer gains on the LINEAR chart you're looking at. The thing is that bitcoin's price is growing *exponentially* at a relatively consistent rate. In the beginning of 2013, a 1000% price rise meant $180. In 2017, a 10% price rise meant $1000.

Its all about block propagation times. With 1mb we were already at 40 seconds to propagate to 95% of the network. Now with 2-3mb segwit blocks, thats 80-120s. That's 15-20% of the avg 10 min time miners have to find the next block. That's a 20% advantage to the miner who just mined the last block and those well connected to that miner. That's already some big pressure. Any more will make it huge

Well think about it this way, Bitcoin is poised to be the next world currency. It has numerous advantages as a store of value and means of transaction over national currencies like the dollar and traditional safe investments like government bonds. Most of the disadvantages of Bitcoin (namely capacity) have already been solved in design and are being implemented as we speak (schnorr signatures, the lightning network, etc).

Thats something you say when past performance is all you're basing a prediction on. In fact, if they understood bitcoin, they'd understand that it will gain speed until after it has hit half of it's worth. Since bitcoin is poised to at least be the world's store of value if not it's currency, bitcoin is headed for multiple trillion $ market cap. The rate of growth will accelerate until it hits somewhere over 500 billion or even 1 trillion. When ever it his that point you'll start to see a rocky road of volatility that slows down that growth until it starts hitting a ceiling. We're no where near that point yet.

If you went into a store now and tried to buy something with a German Mark, do you think you could find anywhere to accept it as a currency? Your question and its answer is evidence of nothing. Doesn't mean a german mark isn't theoretically usable as a currency. 


This loaf of bread costs 1 gram of gold (or whatever). 


That's easy: as soon as there's a form of currency that's easier to use either because it doesn't devalue as fast or because its so much more usable for some other reason (but usually that first reason). 
By the way, its ok to say "I don't know". I'll accept that, but it seems like you'd rather say "I don't know and no one can know" when that's obviously not the case. 


Yup, I agree. But I was more specific about what a better substitute is. 
The concept of a hyper-inflationary currency fits right into my model that less inflation = better. The question is when does the opposite happen? I still haven't seen you give any answer for what conditions a currency is replaced with a currency that inflates more rapidly. Is it when the deflation reaches higher levels than a significant portion of other investments in the economy? Is it something else? I'm looking for a discussion here, not a hard-and-fast answer.

Fee "paid by merchant" is not the same as no fee. Also, incidentally, there's no such thing as "paid by merchant" - fees are charged for transactions. Both the merchant and the buyer pay those transaction fees, even if the buyer isn't told which part of his money went to the fee.

Thanks! The block time isn't really relevant, since smaller times also have corresponding smaller blocks. The important metric here is block-size divided by time. Until recently, ether had 15s block times and ~3kb block sizes. The ratio there is .2 whereas bitcoin with 1000kb blocks had a ratio of 1.66 . So it was pretty fine. And even more recently, ether's been having 20kb blocks with 30s mining times, which pushes the ratio up to .6 - still significantly less than bitcoin. So they're pretty safe for now on that front. Dash's ratio is more than double bitcoin's tho at 4.4.

That is a huge common misconception. The naive analysis would indeed conclude that inflation encourages spending and investment. In reality, inflation discourages people from keeping money. By definition this encourages "spending" and "investment" when you define "spending" and "investment" as any use of that inflationary asset (eg dollars). However, this definition also makes such a conclusion absolutely meaningless. 
Would less *real* investment happen when inflation is 0 or negative? Of course not. People still want to maximize the appreciation of their holdings. Read my comments here if you wanna know why I think so: 


In the last, 30 years, any savings you had in dollars has decreased to 20% of its original worth. That is a ton of value. That's the power of exponential growth (or in this case, exponential value contraction). Suggesting that this is "marginal" is absurd to me. 


Have you no foresight? I'd argue that today its not that complex or expensive, but sure. In 5 years? Its gonna get pretty easy and pretty cheap. Have you not been keeping up with developments? Lightning network, etc?

I disagree that bitcoin will be earning a significant passive return when it stabilizes. I also disagree that one more asset you can hold that has a positive return on holding will affect people's spending in any way. Unless bitcoin remains the most quickly-growing asset in the market, it shouldn't affect anyone's spending habits. People could invest in anything instead of buying goods - so why isn't that currently a problem? The answer is that we're already at market equilibrium for spending and saving. The lower utility of the dollar vs bitcoin means people will want to hold more bitcoin than dollars, but it doesn't mean they'll actually want to save more. They just might buy fewer low yield investments like govt bonds.

The only case you'd have to worry about is if the hard fork makes the commitment transactions invalid, which is unlikely since backwards compatibility for transactions is both easy to do and causes chaos if not done.

Well there's 2 possibilities here (given that this information is definite info):
1. This is new "for sure" information that is different than what people thought yesterday. 
2. This is old "for sure" information everyone has known basically forever (or more accurately, long enough that equilibrium has been reached)
In case 1, the value of bitcoins will jump (or drop) immediately to 3 mansions minus the time-value of money. It would jump if the time-value of money is less than 2%, and it would drop if the time-value of money is more than 2%. It would then continue upward at that 2% rate from then until 50 years has passed (when in this hypothetical scenario maybe new information will be discovered?). 
In case 2, the value of bitcoins will continue on its constant 2% upward trend. This case happens if and only if the time-value of money is already exactly equal to that 2%. 
But regardless what happens, in an uncertain situation, the growth in monetary value always exactly equals the time-value of money, and therefore there is never any friction preventing people from using their money. Its only uncertainty (which causes volatility) that creates friction.

Um, not in the context of running a store. If someone is waiting for a transaction to come through to a particular address, it is entirely possible to detect a double spend simply by querying the mempool of your connections and blacklisting transactions where a double-spend has been propagated. 
If someone created a transaction to themselves first, then tried to double spend, its likely a thin client would know within seconds that its a double spend and can blacklist the transaction - rejecting it until it confirms. If the double-spend transaction is sent *after* the actual transaction, its likely that it would be rejected outright and would never make it into the blockchain. 
So unless you're selling coffee to a hacker who's sybil attacking the full node you're connected to, the likelihood is near 0 that you won't detect it within seconds. And if they detect you when you successfully double-spent to yourself, you've just paid a fee and still won't get your coffee.
Regardless, with the lightning network, this won't even be a problem at all, since fully verifiable payments can happen in milliseconds.

No.. I'm not seeing it. First of all, that logic is invalid since you're multiplying a maximum times the entire population - its gonna be a huge overestimate. But I'm not even sure where your logic is going here. Let's say that amount was $50,000. $50k * 1 billion == $50 trillion. So what? What about the lightning network couldn't hold $50 trillion of bitcoin? It just means bitcoin's market cap will be significantly bigger than that (given our premises here).

It should be theoretically possible, but would require that your software is aware of each other. Any time you made a transaction or routed a transaction, you'd have to have a way to get the new commitment transactions to your other machines. A watchtower service could help do this for you.

Bitcoin will be critical for giving people in poor countries the freedom their government tries to deny them. If their stored wealth can't be taken from them, that removes a huge tool from governments that want to keep their population down.

If you have no idea how much bitcoin is worth, than you have no idea whether it can be 100x. Do some thinking first before telling people they're wrong. The person willing to pay the most right now has almost nothing to do with how much value bitcoin has as a technology or asset. Bitcoin will be the world currency. If that statement holds true, 1 btc will be worth at least $600,000. And it can do more than just overtake the dollar.

Interesting. I suppose I can see non-digital currencies being used in places where network access is spotty. All you need for seamless use is NFC or QR codes tho - then you just scan the destination address, confirm, and go. Just as easy as coins. So wherever you don't have good network access, or people without NFC or QR code readers, I suppose I can see the use for physical currency.

Looks like you're investing in crypto currencies without any in depth knowledge about ANY of them. You shouldn't even be investing in *bitcoin* unless you at LEAST have some logic based prediction of what it might be worth in 5 to 10 years and WHY. 
I, and the rest of this obviously biased subreddit can tell you that bitcoin is the only thing in your portfolio worth holding on to, but unless you want to trust us, you need to do your own research. 
I hold bitcoin and monero because they have solid fundamentals. Bitcoin has major first mover advantage, and monero has private-by-default coins and a dev team thats just as well respected as bitcoin's devs. I don't hold etherium, for example, because in all my research, i haven't gotten to the point where i understand why ether would be a better store of value than bitcoin (which it would need to be to overcome bitcoin's FMA and be worth much). The rest of your portfolio is garbage.
But an investment is just a gamble unless you try to make logic based predictions about the potential and the likelihoods of various potentials. If you can't defend each and every currency you hold, you're going to get burned

That's still stealing the 2% more you would have had if a central bank didn't print money, lend it out, then keep the interest generated by they money they got for free. If I had a way to get interest free loans, I'd borrow as much as possible and lend it out, just like banks do. 


Yup exactly. In a situation where inflation is pretty consistent, this isn't as important, since if people know the inflation rate will be pretty stable, they'll just factor that into all their prices. But in other situations where inflation isn't stable, a lot of times people will use inflation-indexed contracts like inflation index bonds. But that requires that the measurement of inflation is accurate (which it often isn't). 


Its literally instantaneously if everyone knows that information. Like, what seller is going to sell if they know the asset they would be selling is worth more? What causes a price to slowly increase outside the context of uncertainty is the time-value of money. Like, money used now has slightly more value than money used tomorrow. If everyone knows exactly what value bitcoin will be at any given time in the future, the only time someone will sell is when they have a current use for the proceeds of selling that bitcoin that's a better investment than holding that bitcoin. 
So really to be more accurate, when there's 0 uncertainty the price of an asset *immediately* jumps to the future value of that asset minus the value of selling that asset and investing in something else right now.

Formal verification is just as possible in a language without types like JavaScript. Here's a js formal verification library: 
An electron app isn't "the web". That article mostly talked about websites using out of date libraries. Obviously not relevant for an actively developed desktop application. 
I don't see how the left-pad thing has anything to do with security. There are so many things to disagree with that author about. He didn't even say how left pad caused the problem! This author's advice of " use as few dependencies as possibly" is stupid. He's telling people to reinvent the wheel cause otherwise "they won't know how to program" and won't be able to debug anything. He sounds like a crotchety old man who for some reason hates the fact that he now has access to thousands of high quality modules. Modules written by someone else *are* more likely to be correct than modules written by you, cause they're more likely to be written by an expert. Also, modules available in a package library are FAR more likely to be correct because they're used (and therefore debugged) by FAR more people than you could ever get to debug your software. 
Now i will agree that npm sucks in some important ways, making it harder to avoid a left-pad type of issue. But this is because npm's shrinkwrap mechanism has always been pretty broken. Now that people are starting to use yarn with it's yarn lock file, this should be seen less and less.
I'm not reading anything that convinces me that js is any less secure than other languages.

The way you communicate is confusing. 


That's nonsensical. We have learned about how evolution works without "walking through it" ourselves. Futurologists can predict how things will play out in the future by using theories verified by history.


Its not irrational to want to save wealth to ensure you can support yourself in the future. If one of those "scores" your keeping is your happiness, health, and lifespan, its of fundamental importance. Keeping those "scores" high requires resources, which are then themselves important. 


We do actually want to do those things, or we wouldn't do them. Do you mean that these things aren't **good for** us? That they're things we **shouldn't** want? This is what I mean when I say your communication is confusing, you're writing something that doesn't mean what you're trying to say. 


No it isn't. Its a solution to a problem. Solutions to problems aren't symptoms, just like a cure to a disease isn't a "symptom" of the disease. But if you're trying to say that UBI is a good idea (which isn't at all clear from what you wrote), then I agree, tho I think the Negative Income Tax is a more feasible and more beneficial form of it. 
Regardless, you're assuming that this hypothetical system that you can't even describe is possible and better. It might not be possible. If its possible, it might not actually be better. But we don't know unless you can propose such a system. 
The conclusion I came to when discussing with my friend I mentioned is that the only way to achieve a moneyless society is to have a society where there is no individual - all either follow a single central command, or are somehow all part of that central intelligence (like neurons in a brain). Individuality would be lost, because there would only be one individual. In this case, that single individual is the owner of all the resources and directs them as it wants. If you have a society with individuals who have differing goals, there must be some system to decide who gets to control which resources to reach those goals. Doesn't matter if they're people, or aliens, or AIs. Goal-seeking individuals need resources to achieve their goals and resources are limited. Because they're limited, they need to be allocated. Money is the only known system to do that without a central command.

Take a picture of the printed wallet. If the paper wallet is unencrypted (I know some of them are), that's all you need.
Another vector: install a keylogger or screen capture virus on the victim's machine, and install a wallet finding and copying virus on their computer. You then can get their password and their wallet. Game over. You don't even need their paper wallet, since to use their money they have to have it on their machine (since they're not using a hardware wallet).
Neither of these things are possible on a properly set up hardware wallet.

No. That's not how a double spend works. A double spend happens when the attacker mines a secret longer chain that contains a transaction that conflicts with one that has been confirmed on the main chain. After the product that was bought with those main chain coins is delivered, the attacker releases their longer chain and that chain becomes the "real" chain. Since the longer chain now has those coins going else where, the seller of the product doesn't get their coins after all while the attacker retains the coins and the product, thus successfully "double spending" ( even tho one "spend" was done on a chain that is no longer canonical).
Neither chain contains a double spend on their own, both chains would be valid according to the same normal bitcoin consensus rules.

Definitely on the right track! If it overtook just the dollar it would be around $600,000 per bitcoin (in 2017 dollars of course, since 2040 dollars are worthless). So I'm not going to consider selling until we get there.
Nobody likes pennies. A US half-penny was worth more than a dime is today when the half penny was removed from circulation in 1857. So 1 satoshi could easily go up to 10 cents with that logic. But like Noncognition said, changing the format of the amount field in a transaction is one of the most trivial changes we could do. Beyond that, the divisibility of a bitcoin doesn't really limit it's market value directly. Only indirectly by limiting it's use for smaller transactions.

In a ponzi scheme, the underlying thing being sold has no value. Bitcoin, however, has numerous kinds of value in the form of favorable properties vs competing systems. Bitcoin is much more easily secured and transacted over distances than cash, and its cheaper and finalizes far faster than credit/debit cards or wire transfers. Its also provably scarce whereas fiat currencies have inflation and often unpredictable behavior of central banks. You don't necessarily need to have money or papers or answer KYC questions in order to obtain bitcoin, so it can bank the unbanked. 
tl;dr bitcoin has real value while a ponzi scheme does not.

Friedman was nothing if a practical man. He understood the difference between a perfect world and our current world. He was adept at considering a set of premise conditions and advocating policy that would improve things given those constraints. One constraint is often that its not feasible to get rid of central banks. Given that constraint, his advice of what those central banks should do was in no way in opposition to his opinion that the Federal Reserve should be abolished. 
I can't find a video from way back in the 70s with him saying "we should abolish the fed" but you can find tons of content on him railing against how the Fed created the great depression and causes inflation and boom/bust cycles, and other things.

Nodes can prune, which helps a lot. However, this doesn't entirely solve the problem, because the more nodes that prune, the less nodes there are that can serve historical block data - which is a sybil/dos risk.
we should work on a way to eliminate the need for downloading and validating all historical blocks anyway. It should only be necessary to download a few weeks of chain data unless there are multiple competing chains with similar PoW weight. However, this would require some kind of UTXO commitment (eg Utreexo), which would require a softfork at least.

I agree that certain types of privacy can definitely be implemented in higher layers. However, other types cannot. For example, bitcoin outputs can be traced forever. For any output, you can find out what other outputs contributed to its value. If some government decides to blacklist a particular output, there's nothing higher layers can do about that - that particular output would be prevented from being used in certain situations (eg paying organizations that have a legal obligation to refuse or report payments associated with blacklisted outputs).
Sure, something like coinjoin could get you a fresh new untainted output, but who would want a [tainted]( output? It'd be likely that your tainted output would have at least slightly less value, meaning you'd have to pay someone to swap your tainted coin with their untainted coins. If you accidentally accept tainted coins, I guess you're SOL? This applies equally to the lightning network as to on-chain transactions (tho the flow is certainly different, since you're not usually paying the recipient directly with your outputs).

Thanks for the detailed explanation! You make a good point that security by obscurity does work for a limited time. However, I don't think the CVE protocol addresses the main problem I'm talking about, which is the trust vector u/time_wasted504 brought up. 
The question I have is: what if a 3rd party (or someone random) reviews the submitted change that fixes the bug and asks "This piece of code looks out of place. What is this for?" Is the information released to that person so they can fully review the change? Is this done for every person that asks questions about it? What about the kind people who would rather yell about something publicly before asking about it nicely? I suppose perhaps those are rare cases, but should they be? 
If secret code can be inserted into bitcoin software by the developers without anyone else getting wind of it for the whole CVE process (months?), I think this would be something substantially wrong with the project - not enough review on the code.

Well this isn't entirely true, or rather the fraud proofs don't need to be anything special. You should be able to validate a block using only the previous block's UTXO state, and the full block data itself. If the UTXO state was committed to in an accumulator like Utreexo, all an SPV node would have to do is download and validate the whole block like any full node would do. So if a node wants to signal the network that there is a problem with a particular block that has a valid block header, that node can simply say "validate block &lt;whatever&gt;" and SPV nodes can just validate the whole block with the exact same C code the full-nodes use and will then know if the signal was correct. 
Am I missing something that makes this not possible?

No. Opportunity cost is different. He's talking about the risk of keeping all your eggs in one basket. If bitcoin becomes a real world currency, holding dollars in the bank could lose lots of their value. Its prudent to diversify, and not diversifying increases your risk. This is separate from the opportunity cost of making money on bitcoin's rising value. 
While the dollar decreasing in value may happen at the same time and for the same reasons as bitcoin increasing in value, they are separate things.

Actually UBI implemented correctly has real economic benefits based on the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics. If a system if pareto optimal, something like ubi (or much better yet, negative income tax) can improve the optimality even further. Regardless, it would be a good replacement for the current broken welfare system that traps people in poverty. 
The bad thing about UBI is the sheer amount of money that needs to be funneled through government. You know some will be siphoned off. That's why negative income tax is better, far fewer people get paid by the government, but the economic outcome is identical. Only people who's income is too low to pay taxes would receive money.

Your thinking is too black and white. An incentive to hold is not the same thing as never spending. It just means what you hold will be different. Instead of investing in government bonds or gold or companies you don't understand, you'll hold a bit more currency than you would with dollars. A higher incentive to save money isn't bad. Maybe it means people will scrutinize their investments better and only invest in things they understand, rather than feel pressured to invest with the herd because the government is constantly stealing the value of your earned and already-taxed savings.

Stay far away from "trading". Trading currencies is simply gambling. You will lose. If you want to get into cryptocurrencies, learn about the technology. Read about how the blockchain works and how proof of work is done, learn how decentralized networks operate, learn what kind of attacks there are against a system like bitcoin, and how bitcoin mitigates those attacks, learn how key security and safe backup works. There's lots to learn, but trading is not one of them. The only "skill" in trading is overconfidence and survivor bias. 
What you should do is find a cryptocurrency you believe in long term, and buy and hold that currency. Since you said you can't buy it tho, at least you can learn how to use it. Download a wallet you can run on bitcoin's testnet, get some testnet bitcoins from a faucet and play around with it. Maybe get a friend or two on board. You can play around with lightning network apps with testnet coins and can learn by doing. Then when you have the money to actually buy some real coin, you'll know how everything works.

You're not listening. Have you ever heard "past performance doesn't guarantee future results"? If you don't reason about the future and just use historical behavior as a reference, you're going to miss the big shifts. 
Gold has been positive because of its high stock to flow. Its scarce. But Bitcoin is more scarce, along with all the other benefits it has over gold. Gold's only benefit is historical reputation. It costs a whole buttload to secure gold - far more than bitcoin. Why spend your money protecting a less-scarce asset that has less utility as money?

That doesn't make the problem much harder. All you do is find a few potential routes, then verify that those routes are able to handle your transaction. Unless channels are being completely drained and replenished every transaction, this shouldn't be much more additional network traffic. Not that you can use multiple paths in conjunction to execute a transaction even if none of the paths individually have enough funds for the full amount.

In the very short term, when money is *suddenly* saved in their *savings* accounts (people don't hoard money like dragons), yes you're right that those things happen. However, if the consistent rate of savings went up this wouldn't happen. Why? Because if less money is in circulation, the *value* of the money that is in circulation goes up to match. $10 trillion in circulation is worth exactly the same amount as $1 trillion in circulation (after a &lt;1 year period while people adjust to the change). 
Savings should be encouraged more because people [aren't saving nearly enough money]( especially in the US. Consumption might go down a bit, and that would be a good thing. Overconsuming and undersaving is the reason so many people are in debt.

Sure.. its a useful technology that can be useful outside of currencies. But everything this guy is invested in is currencies. Shitcoins are shitcoins because they don't do anything significantly better than bitcoin. Monero clearly has advantages, and etherium is still a question mark in my mind. The rest are worthless. If you disagree, please convince me.
In my mind, etherium is a great technology that will probably be useful for something, but I just don't understand how ether being "gas" for dapps on etherium means it will be worth a lot. I would imagine the value of ether would depend on demand for dapps and the velocity of ether (since you only need as much ether as it takes for everyone to pay for their dapps in any given period of time). If anyone's done any math on that, I'd love to see it.

Well, no, fractional reserve isn't the same thing as what the Fed does tho. The Fed literally creates money from thin air and buys assets with it (including bonds from banks). This has unlimited money-creation potential.
Non-central banks in the US can lend out only a fraction of the deposited money. The money, once lent, is not directly usable by the bank or its depositors, so no money is created. However the perception that money is created may be there because someone "has" x dollars in the vault while someone else has 90% of those x dollars as a loan. It only works well as long as most people don't ask for all their money all at once.


Well, yes and no. No they are not lending out a multiple of the amount of money they have recorded as deposits - they are lending out a *fraction*. However, when they lend out new money, they also record new deposits (and a new liability), which means they can then lend out a fraction of those new deposits, and this can happen repeatedly. So while $100 cash came in, at 10% reserve minimum, and they can theoretically lend out $900 in *deposits*, only $100 can ever actually enter the market as cash - those other $900 would stuck inside the bank as deposit records. That is unless they do further tricky things like take loans themselves with their loan instruments as collateral. 
But again, this is not "creating" money. This is simply how lending works in a situation where you're not allowed to lend more than a fraction of your money. 
This could even happen in a world run by bitcoin. Person A lends out 100 bitcoin to person B for 1% interest, then person B lends out that 100 bitcoin at 2% interest to person C, etc etc. And notice the whole amount is being lent. The only limit to how many times this can be repeated is what the market is willing to bear. Since there is no enforced "fraction" 1 bitcoin could be theoretically multiplied by 1000 or 1 million. Of course that will never happen, just like $100 never turns into $1000 of deposits in a fractional reserve system.
tl;dr Loan chains look funny, but they're not creating money.

A constant issue rate doesn't significantly help the lost coin issue except in the short run, since inflation still tends toward 0 in the long run (it just takes longer to get there). Also, lost coins are not a problem. Not enough will be lost to significantly affect it's volatility. Also, the rate people lose coins is likely to be a pretty consistent (and low) rate, meaning even lots of loss would not add much uncertainty into the available supply.

@_date: 2017-10-16 01:00:40
Monero is the only practical private currency at the moment. It makes transactions private by default using ring signatures to hide who sent the monero, stealth addresses to hide who received the monero, and some other technique (I forget the name) to hide the amount of monero sent. This means that monero has a property called fungibility that bitcoin doesn't have - basically the idea that any given amount of monery is indistinguishable from another. In bitcoin, this isn't the case. Organizations can and do blacklist bitcoins that have come from a transaction seen as illegal or undesirable to associate with. Monero doesn't have that problem, and in general is far more private in ways that bitcoin isn't. It also has some of the most well respected devs in the cryptocurrency community (including fluffyponza, who you may have heard of or seen around). 
The fungibility/privateness is monero's primary differentiating factor from bitcoin (tho there are other more minor things). Pretty much all other altcoins have only minor differentiators to bitcoin - like litecoin's different hashing algorithm. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:47:57
Bitcoin will dominate for all those reasons. The technical benefits of the rare non-worthless altcoin are very minor improvements in comparison to the improvements of bitcoin over fiat. 
The only thing that could lead to the rise of a different coin is demonstration of an attack on bitcoin that it isn't prepared to defend (and that another coin is). This is pretty unlikely, but possible. And if that happens, it's more likely than not that the bitcoin community will accept a hard fork to fix the problem by integrating whatever solution those altcoins use to prevent that security hole.

Saying that people won't be motivated if they get a small amount of free money is like saying people won't be motivated to invest unless their money is losing value (via inflation). It's the opposite of the reality. 
The reality is that people want to do interesting and profitable things for themselves and their community, and if you give them free time, they'll come up with clever ideas to do it. You can't invent things if you're working 3 minimum wage jobs just to pay rent.
Welfare recipients have the lack of motivation you're talking about only because welfare has cliffs where if you work too much you lose your welfare benefits and are *worse* off than if you hadn't worked harder.

It would probably be around $800 million or $900 million, but also could be more like $300-400 million. Probably not much less, because at $1 million, bitcoin still probably wouldn't have taken more than 10% of the dollar's worth. But its anyone's guess really.

It's an interesting exploration, but I would call it an exploration of the minimum mental cost of new contracts, not an exploration of micro payments. Thousands of micropayments resulting from a single contract are no different from a single payment made for the same contract. For example, the electricity bill is just as complex no matter whether you pay once every month or once every second. The same mental processes need to happen. If, however you trust the provider less than they trust you, you might still want to defer payment until you've had a chance to look over the bill. This of course means that services need to be rendered before payment is made, which is an additional risk to the provider. Regardless, micro payments allow smaller resolution (as he put it) without adding mental complexity i think. The mental complexity only comes from the number and complexity of new contracts, not the frequency of payment.

Money is not a resource. We don't need people to use all their money all the time. We need people to use their resources to the best of its ability. Distorting the market to overincentivize spending/investing of money means that people will put their money to worse use, causing a waste of resources. The less money that's used, the more the money that \*is\* used can buy. Inflation distorts the market to force people to put their money towards inefficient use. 
\&gt; If productivity is increasing and you don’t see inflation, then labor is being devalued
That makes 0 sense. You can't "devalue" labor. It has the value it has. Devaluing money can only happen because a central bank can freely print it, stealing value from everyone else who holds that currency. Adding more labor to the system means that the \*price\* of labor decreases, but it doesn't steal value from anyone. In fact it adds value to the competitive market.

Yes it is. Inflation has no benefits and only downsides. Please read my comment here, which details why Bitcoin's eventual non-inflation is a very good thing:
tl;dr Bitcoin is eventually non-inflationary, not deflationary, historical deflationary events are not comparable to Bitcoin, central bank money creation is theft, deflation encourages better investments, and discouraging keeping savings is a super bad thing.


No.. you'd have to be crazy *not* to take that risk, even without any insurance/hedge. If you don't have to risk your whole savings, then just risk $20k-$40k. The expected return in your example is 150%!


If investment risk-reduction is your goal, inflation has nothing to do with it. You'd be just as incentivized to reduce your risk in a deflationary environment.

Fees are lower than credit card fees, confirmation times are measured in minutes for Bitcoin instead of months for credit cards, and where you can spend it has absolutely nothing to do with how good it is at money, only how few people have realized it.
When compared to cash, Bitcoin is not as easy but it can be far more secure. A thief can lift your wallet when you're not looking, but that can't be done with bitcoin. Also, that cash, its losing its value every minute it burns a hole in your pocket. Bitcoin is currently gaining value every minute because it's verifiably scarce. Better store of value by far today and it should remain a better store of value as adoption grows.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:50:15


Gotcha. 


I think this isn't the best way to view it. Custodial storage of your bitcoin is only custodial until you spend or withdraw it, not "always and forever". If you create a lightning channel with all your custodial funds, its custodial for the same amount of time that a turbo channel would be.
I'm curious tho at what point it would be decided that "now's the time" to publish the opening channel transaction in the case of turbo. Is the point just to speed things up, so you don't have to wait for the confirmation? Or is the point that some turbo channels will be exhausted and closed before they ever need an on-chain transaction?

Or they can adopt policies that make life harder for people in certain somewhat arbitrary ways (eg "if your UTXO was held by a known criminal in the past 2 years, you're liable and fined for accepting or using that UTXO"). Coin join isn't a silver bullet. Its not as simple as tainting all coins and then its all or nothing. Individual liability can be enforced in numerous situations regardless.

There is no such thing as "unused money". Any money that's unused gives more value to the money that *is* used. This is an entirely symmetrical phenomenon that means that total investment is always the same no matter how many units of money is used to make that investment. If half of bitcoin is "locked up" in a way that's unusable (something I'm still waiting for you to clarify as to how exactly that would happen), the bitcoin that *is* available to spend will be worth more by exactly that amount. So comparing dollars or bitcoins to bytes is simply an invalid metaphor here.

Well, I suppose I should explain in more detail. The wallet would be an address where money could be spent by your personal key only, but would also be spendable by the bank's key only but only after a timelock. So you would run software (or ask a 3rd party to run software) that watches for a timelocked transaction on the blockchain (similar to lightning network watchtowers) so that if the bank tries to steal your money, you can cancel the attempt (by sending it back to your wallet or another wallet you own). However, if you lose your key, you can go to the bank and ask them to help you recover your funds. At this point, you're at their mercy, so it might make sense to have two banks that need to cooperate to do this, but the principle is the same. The bank submits the timelocked transaction to the chain, and after a period of time (perhaps a couple weeks or a month) they can then send your funds back to a wallet you control. 
This ability to lose your key and still have recourse to recover your funds is exactly what joe-bob and billie-sue need to store their savings in bitcoin. You don't want to have the possibility of forgetting your password and lose everything you own. 
I think this might be awkward to implement with bitcoin's current opcodes,

Supply and demand means that when we don't have enough of something, the price goes up. If the price goes up, the value of putting effort into technologies to produce that thing also go up and people then produce more so the price stabilizes.

Sustained inflation is bad because central banks are literally stealing your money's value. Sustained deflation is not bad in this respect: someone is giving you value by destroying their own.
Uncertainty in inflation/deflation is also bad, because it makes predicting difficult when you're using that as a unit of account. This could be mitigated if only we had a reliable and credible measurement of inflation.
Temporary inflation and temporary deflation aren't really bad or good (except as much as they're causing uncertainty), just a consequence of market flow - supply and demand.
Bitcoin, once it reaches equilibrium, will be far more stable and predictable than something like the dollar that's manipulated by huge governments. 
All this is why the deflation = bad argument is bullshit. Another reason is that it is often supported by examples of fleeting deflationary moments outside the context of an intentional deflationary currency. 
If people are 100% sure bitcoin will be worth 50% more in 1 year, guess what, it'll be worth 50% more in 1 day then stay that way for 2 years. That's how markets work. That's why there will never be "hoarding" going on in a non volatile deflationary situation. Rate of change in a market is higher when uncertainty is higher.

I don't think you spend a second to think about my comment before you responded to it. What I wrote is very different from what you read. I'm talking about transactions that miner A sends to miner A to fill up an otherwise non-full block. Miner A doesn't propagate those spam transactions to any other miner, so when miner A mines their block, miner A gets back all the transaction fees they spent, successfully filling the block with spam that cost them nothing to produce. 
I agree with you that someone who isn't mining the current block can't produce meaningful spam, because of the fee market in the mempool. But a miner can put spam in their own block for free.

Also it seems like you're conflating the mining reward and the inflation rate in this analysis, but they aren't the same in reality. Eventually transaction fees will be greater than coin base rewards. So does your paper basically say inflation decreases value unless it's used to increase the mining rewards up to the ideal level?

The network copes fine. It's just some users that can't seem to cope with a fluctuating fee market.

In what case do malicious nodes (Byzantine nodes?) change the equation here in the context of routing? The most a malicious node could do is give you a real route through them and then refuse to complete your payment when you try to execute. At most a few seconds of delay? Not exactly the crime of the century.
And others are right, the graph will mostly be very static on the timescale of even a month. The only things that change constantly are edge-of-network nodes that don't have many connections and go offline frequently. This doesn't change the routing problem either - just means you have to test a few more routes before you find one that's adequate

Well spikes half this high have been pretty regular. Two spikes in the last 2 weeks reached about 75% the height of this recent spike. It also looks like the spike is over. I would assume its organic - just that everyone happened to want to put a transaction in at the same time. 


Looking at the chart, I can see that's not the case. There are a bunch of transactions pretty much evenly distributed at all levels from 1 to 100. 
Remember that the relationship between demand and fees is highly nonlinear. If every transaction fits in the blocks, your fee can be minimum (1 sat/byte). As soon as transactions need to compete for blockspace, fees rise rapidly. That's why you see a ton of sudden spikes in this mempool chart rather than smooth slow increases and decreases.

Yes there is. Real economics uses the concept of "utility" where everything can be quantified. Certainly everyone values things differently, and so the utility of a given item is a very personal thing. But if you invest $5 in a box of cereal, the return you get may not be money, but it is utility and it will be more than $5-worth of utility unless you're a terrible cereal buyer.


No. A fall in consumption is indicative of bad things, but it is not necessarily bad. Especially in the case of a bubble, a decrease in consumption is a necessary thing to bring the economy back into efficient and sustainable levels - which is good and good for the quality of people's lives.

This asshole making hoofoo is so clearly a charlatan. He gives so little info about how security works, constantly sets up straw man arguments comparing to "other wallets" that are insecure, outright lies about things like a usb connection to trezors and ledgers being somehow insecure (it's not - as if a Bluetooth connection is more secure..), lies about it being the only hardware wallet that signs your transaction offline, among other giant red flags and huge breaches of moral conduct. Since the joofoo doesn't require confirmation of the transaction, that opens up a ton of attack vectors, including the very common address swap out while copy and pasting.
I agree, this poser doesn't deserve one penny for his scam wallet.


This isn't a problem tho. If you use good encryption, the transmission mechanism doesn't matter security wise.


Just like the above, the communication mechanism doesn't matter. If the device is compromised you can leak your private key even if you use qr codes. However, you're severely reducing ease of use that way. No security gain for a lot of trouble. Keep the usb.

One of the incredible things about bitcoin is that it's entirely opt in. It can be something where each individual can decide at any given moment to be subject to a given monetary policy. But most things aren't like that. You can't do that with laws against violence for example. Otherwise murderers would just opt out. Currency's monetary policy and transaction regulations are one of the few things usually considered the purview of government that can be removed entirely from it.

Interesting framework, nice work! I think choosing to abbreviate "trustworthiness" as "trust" harms understandability of your paper tho. What you're calling "trustworthiness", I'd call "security". People in the cryptocurrency community especially don't like systems that require a lot of trust because that almost always significantly degrades security.
Also, you left out a huge reason why people value Bitcoin: stability of monetary policy and especially it's eventual non-inflationary monetary policy.
And I'd recommend that you not use those abbreviations you're using (CR, DN, DNA) - they really hinder the ability to skim the paper. And even tho i caught the definitions of those things, it makes it much harder to read. Your non technical writeup doesn't even define DNA so i just thought you meant..

I see, you're in the camp that thinks deflationary currencies aren't sustainable. If you want to read a (very) lengthy debate between me and someone else on whether or not that's true, [read this](


Could you support that claim?


Unless I misunderstand you, I don't think that's accurate. What people usually call "contractionary monetary policy" is when the Fed sells more assets than it buys. The Fed couldn't sustain this forever, since they'd run out of assets to sell. If the Fed simply stopped buying or selling anything, that would be equivalent to what bitcoin does, and I don't think anyone calls that "contractionary". 


I agree that sudden and unexpected deflation (what some people misleadingly call a "deflationary spiral") is not good for an economy, just like sudden and unexpected inflation is bad for an economy. Sudden and unexpected events like that catch a slow-moving market by surprise and cause market distortions that result in inefficient trades and other behavior. 
However, the deflation of a currency like bitcoin is nothing like that. Its neither sudden nor unexpected. In fact, you could almost say there isn't actually even any deflation.  See Bitcoin is a non-inflationary currency, not a deflationary currency. Over the past few years the value of bitcoin has been rising fast on average, which you could call "value deflation" or something like that, but this won't last forever. The price will level off at equilibrium and the price should only grow at the rate of economic growth (eg GDP growth) on average. 
So after this equilibrium point, no monetary deflation would actually be happening. And no sustained decrease in the velocity of money would happen over time either. The only thing that would be happening is that the amount of resources in the economy would be growing while the currency would keep the same quantity, pushing the value of the currency up proportionally.
So I completely disagree with you that non-inflationary currencies like Bitcoin are unstable or unworkable. There are a ton of rebuttals to that position, and I'm sure you've seen some of them. But if you want to look at more, do read [the thread I mentioned](

The complex parts are security and backup of your private keys, and exchanges. When there's a non custodial bank for crypto that gives people that security and backups without having direct access to your money, that will go a long way towards mass adoption. Also, as more people use bitcoin, fewer people will have to deal with exchanges. This is a gradual process and doesn't need to happen for everyone all at once
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:29:26
But if you don't have a small enough block size, fees won't be high enough to support the security we need the system to have. Mining reward is directly linked to the hashpower that the system will have and thus the security of the system with regards to double-spend attacks (etc).

The benefits are that you can choose someone you're more likely to do many payments with, rather than just whoever you happen to want to pay first. I mean, it could basically be the same by asking you "do you want to open a channel with this person?" and you say yes or no. But also, you would control how many potentially-expensive on-chain transactions you do as well as have more manual control over who you trust to be your channel partners.

What this paper shows is that there are feedback effects between value and how much work is put into mining. When they say "value" by the way, they don't mean the current price.

Interesting. Do you have a personal theory on why its possible to do this kind of prediction? Do you think there's any possibility it might be confirmation bias (ie maybe the method works now, but later it won't and that will bring it below statistical significance)? 
Like, doing this kind of prediction reminds me of the concept of overfitting in the area of machine learning. Its possible to get a program to predict (the past) with arbitrary accuracy, but often trying to predict the future from that goes awry. I'd be curious if you can use methods that only use data from say 5-10 years ago, and still have useful predictions for today.

Yes, but it's "by design" because of practical constraints. 10 minutes isn't ideal at the user-level. I would love to hear more about why this idea couldn't help minimize the practical constraints that the 10 minute avg block time is based on.

Depends what "hasn't studied much" means. You find professional economists with shitty grasps of whole sections of economics all the time. The thing people forget is that you can't be an "expert" in an entire field like economics or math or physics. You specialize by becoming an expert in one tiny concept at a time. Common (or uncommon) sense allows you to far more easily become an expert in a tiny concept. And this is often all you need when designing something specific. 
While writing a consensus protocol, I've had to become a passing "expert" in maybe 4 or 5 tiny things (eg the statistics around probabilities of which actor will win a probabalistic race to achieve randomly given points). It's doable with some research and thought. The same is really true for cs, tho it seems a lot of people give up on it faster than other subjects.

"the primary concern, the total cost of running a node"
I would say that the ability to process transactions in a timely manner (within an hour) is what is concerning the general community at this moment, not the cost of running a node.

Ah I see, so you're not talking about any capacity limit the LN might have, gotcha. In that case, I'd say the LN might make any blocksize increase at all completely unnecessary. Why would you say "10 times as many users"? Why not 100, or 1000, or 1 million? Since LN channels can be open indefinitely, there will be economic pressure to open larger and larger channels for longer and longer periods of time. Its certainly not crazy to think most people might open $5000 channels for 6 months at a time. 
Not only that, but as the LN becomes widely used, the raw number of transactions on the blockchain might actually decrease in the short-term, lowering on-chain fees. 
Then again, I did the math on 6 month average channel duration, and if everyone in the world opened and closed a new channel every 6 months, we'd need almost 10,000 transactions/second on-chain. So clearly still some on-chain scaling needed in the next few decades. But not a whole lot more than credit card networks currently handle. Of course, this would mean basically unlimited tps, and we'd likely be seeing around 150,000 tps or more if everyone in the world was using it like a credit card.

Comparing hashrates is absolutely meaningless for currencies that use different hashing algorithms, what matters is the amount of money spent on hashing by honest miners, and that is capped by the block reward.
Bitcoin's block rewards in the last 24 hrs were [$9.85 million]( while Ethereum's rewards were [$2.2 million]( So no, their security is not separated by "5 orders of magnitude". It means Ethereum is about 1/5th as secure as Bitcoin, in terms of mining security.

If you didn't build the software yourself, you are trusting that the organization you downloaded your software from isn't malicious. If you didn't audit the software yourself, you're trusting none of the developers were malicious. If you didn't verify that the checkpoint hashes with multiple independent sources, then you're also trusting that the developers weren't malicious. And finally, even if you do all those things and verify the source code matches the Bitcoin spec, you still have to trust that the set of people you got the spec from gave you the right spec and that the people you got the checkpoint hashes from gave you the right hashes.
Trust cannot be eliminated. To evaluate the level of trustlessness, comparison against alternatives is the only appropriate way to it.

If there was an easy (cheap) way to verify routing information sent to you, a fee wouldn't be needed necessarily, because nodes that identify bad actors could disconnect with them, or at least stop propagating their information. This would be similar to how full nodes operate in an adversarial environment. The question would be: how would that verification work and is it cheap enough?
My favorite half baked idea for routing is to build multiple routing trees where each tree tries to choose different parent node configurations as much as possible. Then honest nodes could very cheaply put together 1 route per routing tree in the worst case. Also routes could be made that link different routing trees giving you trees^2 routes in the best case. Those routes would then each be very easy to verify just by talking to the nodes that make up the route.

News is driven by hyperbole these days. Even within a single article you get the biggest hype and the worst Fud. Anything to get a click or a share. And hype, anger, and fear do that much better than good journalism.
Why? Because news isn't the product. Ad space is the product. When we start paying for our news again directly out of our pockets and only to the articles or sources that each of us feels is good quality, and when they stop making money off ads, only them, only then will we have consistently credible news again. Maybe we can finally do this with the LN.

What is a "rebalancing trick"? Are you talking about moving funds from another lightning channel? That isn't what people mean when they say "top off" or "splice in". See [this article]( about how splice in and splice out work. My understanding is it basically means you can do anything on-chain you can do with a personal wallet, as long as your channel partner is cooperative. 


You wouldn't want to. But if *someone else* wants to, why do you care if they do or not?


I disagree. All of the following sound like misleading hype to me:










All of the above don't make sense to me given my knowledge of the lightning network. Also lowering my trust of the author of this article is the mention that they're "not without its downsides", but then doesn't mention any of those downsides. Makes it sound like just another hype article.

Its my lack of understanding by what specifically is meant by checkpoints that's causing the confusion. I'm sorry about that. 


Yes, that sounds like what I'm suggesting. My thinking was that by doing that, new nodes would only have to download blocks from the checkpoint blockheight and on (and wouldn't have to either verify previous blocks, previous transactions, nor build the UTXO set from the genesis block). How would a node avoid all those things without having some mechanism for them to download and verify a UTXO set for a given block height?


Did you take a look at "Case IV" on my other post? The benefit is that even in the worst case scenario, a node would not have to download blocks before the checkpoint, whereas in assumevalid, there are cases where the node would have to download back to the genesis block, and validate the whole thing. Case IV is a longer but invalid chain.

I see Bitcoin as being the next world currency. So its really easy for me to hold. And like Manitclops said, getting a decentralized currencies (honestly any secure currency) out to the real world is incredibly important. Banks (especially central banks) steal so much money, they slow down technological progress, perpetuate corruption and waste, and keep people poor. Its an enormous problem, and cryptocurrency can solve it. So I hold so one day we can be free.
And buying dollars is a losing game, whether bitcoin is tanking or spiking. As a wise man one said:

If the cycle repeats itself, the next ATH would be 20 times the previous ATH of $20k ($400k) then drop to 1/10th the value ($40k), just like that was 20 times the previous ATH of $1000, then dropped to. 1/10th the value ($2000). So i think his sentiment would only intensify.

When the Fed creates money and lends it to banks, the interest those banks "earn" from their loans and investments is money they never should have had. It's money stolen from the people. The Fed only takes a small fraction of that interest, most is kept by private banks. So when you see that the fed "earns" almost $100 billion/year, the banks are making $trillions on top of that. The value that money holds is coming from somewhere. Where do you think its coming from? Who do you think they're stealing that value from, primarily, if not you and me and everybody? 
And let's say, for instance, that the government only stole from farmers. Would that mean that us non-farmers are A-OK? Not at all, because, while it would certainly be worse for farmers, it would be bad for everyone because we would all have to pay more for food - proportionally more depending on what percentage of farmer's money is stolen. So even IF you're correct that inflation doesn't directly decrease your current wealth, it *definitely* negatively affects your future wealth.
Don't be complacent. The Fed is bad for everyone except the Fed and their cronies.

Obviously bcash has enormous coin centralization, but this is actually really worrying to me.

You don't need to trust the software devs any more (or less) because of the inclusion of a UTXO snapshot. If you (or anyone) found a bad hash, you'd yell about it and people would hear. If the devs wanted to tho, they can add arbitrarily different consensus rules that follow whatever chain they want - even without hardcoded UTXO or block hashes. 


You aren't understanding the idea. A bad third-party UTXO set would be detected and rejected unless the software has a bad UTXO hash that matches that bad UTXO set.

Technically, you're right that it could ignore what you're trying to flash it with and use something else. It could even evaluate what you're trying to flash it with and decide whether or not to swap something out. That way, it could still work right if you flash something completely different onto it (which you can definitely do with a trezor), but if you try flashing the open source firmware, it could use a malicious version. That way it wouldn't be as obvious - it might even be impossible to know it was doing it. 
This is why the only real way to know for sure is to build your own hardware, and that's not feasible for most people today. Maybe when 3d printers get WAY better we can do hardware too.

Hold MF. Long term. Never sell, you'll get rekt. One of these times it'll go up and never come down. If you really want to sell, sell like 5% of what you put in, enough to cover your initial investment and hold the rest. Don't bring the stress of trying to time the market into your life, it's not worth the risk and the stress.
Based on past spikes, it's likely to go up to a new long term high around $300k. So if it gets there, sell just a little bit maybe, before buying back in at the new low of $50k.

You can't know it's 100% safe unless you print your own circuits and build your own trezor yourself. But barring that, it's about 
the best you can do. 
If you only ever connect your trezor to a machine that will never go online ever again, you can be almost 100% sure they could never see your keys (unless they have a wireless transmitter in there or there's a deep conspiracy of usb drives connected with them). Note that for this to ensure the Trezor manufacturer won't know your key via some kind of deterministic generation of private keys, you also need to generate your seed externally to the hardware wallet (eg using a protocol like [Bip39-diceware]( and restore that generated key onto the device. Security is hard.

Surely there's a way to splice in someone else's payment into your channel, just like you can splice in your own payment into a channel to fill it up without closing and reopening. What makes you do sure that's not possible?


 I don't agree that accepting an on chain payment "defeats the purpose" of being on the LN. However, i can agree that many merchants would want the instant finalization time of lightning. However you don't get that with submarine swaps really.


Everyone in bitcoin must support layer 1, that's how layers work in technology. You don't have to be aware of the other layers as a user, but your technology must support them. Eg HTTP over TCP over IP. You aren't using IP as a user directly, but your software sure does support it. The same must be true of Bitcoin and the LN and any other higher layer.

I don't get it. You pay a swap provider on-chain, and the swap provider pays the merchant via the LN. Its cool this can be done atomically, but why is this better than just doing an on-chain payment directly to the merchant?
The article claims:


But no they can't because you need to wait for the on-chain transaction to confirm. So if the swap provider is comfortable with 0conf transactions, and the merchant isn't, then I guess you gain some benefit. But I don't see why a swap provider would be comfortable with 0conf. I mean, I guess that's a whole other debate - luckily mostly happening on r/btc...

Paper wallets are security by obscurity. Ie the only reason they're secure is because potential thiefs don't know you have bitcoin and don't know where you put your piece of paper. That is unless you're using an encrypted paper wallet. But then how do you use your funds? You kinda can't.

Well if you want to do something like this in table form, I would remove items that don't make sense to compare, so remove both supply rows (since the supply is the same for both, literally the same coins, not just equal amounts), energy consumption (again, since the LN is built on bitcoin, it requires the same exact energy consumption), remove consensus (they both rely on proof of work). 
And then you'll want to remove nonsensical rows like "staking" (neither require any staking), Scalability (Demonstrated) since its super unclear what it would even mean for scalability to be demonstrated, ease of use (since its just reitterating other rows).
Then you would need to reword some of these things so as not to be misleading, like Decentralization (why doesn't it just say number of nodes? "Decentralization" has many meanings and just confuses things unless given a lot of exposition), Security (what kind of security is it talking about? LN relies on bitcoin's security, but there are also other security considerations with LN). 
And then you need to correct all the factual errors in the table and update the information for the current date. Honestly, it could be a useful comparison chart if heavily overhauled. But in its current form, its worse than useless.

Shouldn't it be possible to detect connections that are offering you the majority of the data (and blocking bad data) and ones that aren't?
I would think that to ensure the network can scale, nodes need to place limits on how many leacher connections they can take on.

Stable currencies are helpful to business because stable currencies are usually *predictable*. The rate of change in value of a currency doesn't matter as long as businesses can predict it. If a currency increases in value between 99% and 101% year over year, that's way better for business than a currency that  increases in value between 0% and 5% per year. And if it does that without devaluing people's money, so much the better.

You take a hash of a UTXO set formatted in a standardized reproducible way (so people can verify it). It would be done in the same way that "Assume UTXO" would be done (see [this transcript](


The blockchain is over 200GB in size. So that's a bigger problem than the UTXO set.


It could be literally anyone. As long as you have the tiny hash, you can verify it from anyone. The software that encodes the hash could distribute it - that would make the most sense since they know exactly which UTXO set to distribute.


Would you give some reasons why you think so?

One way to make it more secure that's a bit harder to do is to create a special offline password that you only store in your head, that you only use on machines that are forever air gapped, and encrypt your trezor keys in a file with that offline password, then back up those files in multiple places (eg on [an Mdisc]( and on your main computer and with a friend or two)  since it's encrypted with a password no one can ever steal (because you never input it on an online machine), you can be sure no one will be able to decrypt the file except you.

Not sure I follow you here. What's R? I would have thought that if A and B have a channel (with say 5btc each committed in a multisig), and A sends 1btc through or to B (so a new multisig with A/B having 4btc/6btc), B can send the "watching entities" both the transaction to watch for in the blockchain, and a transaction to post in such a case. So it seems like everything is in place for the case where A then submits the old 5btc/5btc multisig, any of those watchers can submit the contingency transaction (and claim a fee). What am I missing here?


But in a usual bitcoin scenario, even in this MITM situation, the MITM can't steal your coins and wouldn't even likely be able to trick you into double spends. So this seems rather worse.


Hmm, I'll have to read more about that later.

The thing is that there are enormous systemic problems in our financial system. It's very clearly been rigged for a long time. Real estate is a safe investment, but only because everyone seemed to be irrationally cooperating to keep real estate prices growing (despite the fact that this means it's harder and harder to buy a house in the first place and harder to afford rent). Commodities can be a good investment, but only if you know what you're doing. And stocks have been a great investment but have been eroded by automated trading and the lack of stocks that release dividends, which means most stocks don't have a meaningful connection to the value of the company (the only way to actually make an ROI from a stock is to get dividends or get payed out when the company is liquidated, and companies aren't usually worth a damn when they're liquidated).
Bitcoin isn't going to solve the stock problem, but there's lots of good reasons for doom and gloom when thinking about the financial sector.

How would you evade detection as a leecher tho? Since every node gets all the data, if you have a connection claiming to be sending you all the data, and they don't, then isn't it pretty obvious which are leechers? Similarly, if someone is sending you invalid blocks or invalid transactions, you can immediately tell and drop them.


Well, but because of replication, the network is susceptible to spam unless you can identify and shut down that spam. So yes, you're right that scale is kind of a circuitous way to describe that, what I meant is that the more spam there is in the network, the fewer people will want to run a full node. Any spam problem would only get worse as Bitcoin grows - so it is kind of a scale-related issue, even if not about technological scaling per se.

I suppose the fact that its a soft fork means that it on its own can't cause a permanent chain split. You're right that it would absolutely cause many many temporary forks that would likely all resolve pretty quickly. 
But it would absolutely cause miners to get their asses in gear and either upgrade to conform to the UASF *or* choose a different version that does cause a chain split. Without some action, those miners would lose their mined blocks.

Surely you aren't serious. How much bitcoin do you think was created today? How many dollars? You're absolutely insane if you think the value of Bitcoin created today was higher than the dollars. I have to assume you're talking percentage, but even then, over the last 30 years, price inflation (how much less a dollar can buy) has been an average of about 3%. And the monetary inflation (what percentage of money is newly created) is certainly higher than that (since as technology improves, costs decrease for any given item). Bitcoin will be below 2% per year after the next halving, which is lower than the dollar on average.

Inflation is an overloaded term. There is monetary inflation which is printing money, and there is price inflation, which is often caused by monetary inflation but also can be caused by shortages or belly introduced inefficiencies. And then there are meta complications when the metric for measuring price inflation is modified, eg when the basket of goods used as a baseline is changed. So please be specific as to whether you mean monetary or price inflation, otherwise some one will inevitably drag you into a stupid argument that ends up just being about semantics

There's your problem. USBs are [notoriously insecure]( Basically, a USB can automatically run arbitrary code on your machine and there's nothing you can really do about it. I don't quite understand why that's the case - but I think its basically OSs giving people "convenient" features that require giving USBs free reign. Probably for most USB devices, the reverse is also true (you can put whatever malicious code you want on the USB from the machine). Its real bad.


So I have a hardware wallet - Trezor. It uses USB. So I'm trusting that hardware. But other than that, I don't use any USB on the airgapped machine. What I did was:
1. Boot standalone, non networked machine from Ubuntu live cd (Actually I did it from a USB - shit)
2. Create my trezor wallet keys (I haven't done this yet, but best to use something like  rather than letting your Trezor create it for you, so there's no possibility it could create a compromised key)
3. Backup my trezor wallet seed in an encrypted document with my offline password (only use it on a forever-offline machine)
4. Shutdown the machine (which destroys the live OS)
Now I can use my trezor with an online computer and the only people I'm trusting is Trezor and their hardware manufacturer. I have a calendar event that reminds me once a month to recite my offline password (cause its only in my head and I basically never use it). All I'd need beyond this for perfect security is a multi-sig wallet with keys distributed to friends or maybe a bank, and to manufacture my own Trezor ; )

No it doesn't. Even cursory research will show you that much.


You misunderstand how money works. Any money spent devalues other money spent around the same time. By the same token, any money *not* spent  bolsters the value of the money that is. So money not invested does *not* mean less real investment is made, only that different money is buying it.

Well, even if $1 channels made sense, don't on-chain transaction fees essentially make this kind of attack a wash? Like, lets say the attacker opens up 8 million $1 two-way channels where the victims all put in $1 as well. This means the attacker would steal $1 for each channel, but would (with current fee levels) lose more than $1 for each channel closing. 
Let's take a more realistic scenario of opening $10 channels with $2 fees (for a total of $4 for opening and then closing the channel). An  attacker would need to commit $80 million to open the 8 million channels, and would be able to at maximum steal $80 million, but would lose $32 million to fees. And likely some of those refund transactions would go through. Would victims be able to increase their fee for the refund transaction to ensure they get preference to the attackers transactions in the blockchain? If not, I definitely see the problem, tho I think you understated the difficulty and overstated the reward.


Sure, we'll have to wait and see.


Really? Why's that? 


This is why there shouldn't be just one watcher. I'm imagining a scenario where every time you make a transaction, you broadcast it to anyone that wants to be a watcher. If your transaction is being watched by 1000 computers, you should be good.


My understanding is that the revocation transaction (or what i was calling the refund transaction) is only valid if a bad actor actually posts an out of date multisig transaction. So I don't think this can happen - if posted early, it would be rejected as invalid.


I haven't heard of a "unilateral channel close" transaction. I thought the previous watcher case was the only case.

There's a huge market for remittances like that. Even if you don't care about the rich and businesses sending millions of dollars (which you should, cause it translates to more money you pay for the goods and services you buy from those entities), its also important for poor immigrants sending money to their poorer families. A $4 transfer fee is cheap even for sending $200. And that's a pretty huge transaction fee these days.

Well if someone can control the entire network, then sure they can block bitcoin (or anything). But if communication is encrypted they can't know which traffic is bitcoin. If you're thinking of a Sybil attack, neither number of nodes nor percentage of nodes really matters much there. The only thing that matters is that you have one connection that gives you access to the rest of the network (which really means that most users need at least 2 honest connections, maybe 3). 
But the reason why percentage of full nodes matters is for chain splits. If a majority comes along that wants to make a dangerous change to the consensus rules, the likelihood is that SPV nodes will simply follow that new chain with its new rules. Full nodes are the only thing that can protect themselves from that kind of split.

I see a couple arguments. One that double spends could trick old clients once segwit activates (is this true?). Another is that LN could nerf fees to basically 0 which wouldn't provide enough incentive to secure for miners to properly the network. That also seems plausible in the long term, tho unlimited block sizes has the same effect. 
But mostly in those posts and comments I see mostly support for segwit, or at worst skepticism the LN will work well, but not assertions that segwit is bad for bitcoin. Just that it might be relatively neutral + hating on bitcoin core devs.

@_date: 2018-12-28 00:55:42


That's because most posters just say "inflation" without specifying, which is what you did.


Um, yes it does. Monetary inflation necessarily causes price inflation. To make myself clearer, if prices are falling at a rate of 2% per year, and someone starts inflating the money supply such that prices begin falling at a rate of 1% per year, that is an increase in price inflation (caused by an increase in monetary inflation). You literally cannot inflate the money supply without also inflating prices. 


In most circumstances, inflation is bad. In fact, even in Bitcoin the inflation devalues holders' bitcoins. Bitcoin is in a weird place because its a new currency and the inflation is there in part to ensure a verifiably somewhat fair distribution of coins, which is good for holders. But once a currency is distributed and stable, any inflation will mean devaluing holders' coins. If cryptocurrencies want to subsidize the usage of coins by using inflation, that might be a reasonable tradeoff, but it has to be weighed against the negatives of having a devaluing currency. 
But when most people talk about inflation, its in the traditional context - where a central bank or government creates money for themselves. 99.9999999% of all the inflation that's ever happened is that kind. And that's always bad for people holding the currency.

Ah, cause all transactions still have some part of it that's in the old part of the block, right? Ok


Number 1 does seem like a major problem. Tho I can see services solving this (by watching the blockchain and submitting contingency transactions) being pretty acceptably.
Number 2 seems mostly about regulations, which I think can be changed if its important enough. But that's a good point about bitcoins being locked up. Someone responded that that might not be an issue, but I didn't understand the comment.
Number 3 seems like its pretty unlikely 8 million people would try to close channels at the same time when closing channels requires paying a high transaction fee. 


Sure. But fees would drop. With unlimited block sizes, the unlimited supply would put pressure towards 0 fees with any limited demand. Its not clear to me how the blockchain would be secure in this scenario unless miners able to collectively agree on maximum block sizes, and even then, I'm not sure the economic equilibrium there has any relation to what's necessary to secure the blockchain, but maybe it'd work (shrug).

A node that repeatedly tries and fails to build a route is just as bad as a spammer. Routing should be done such that failing isn't a common occurrence. 


Perhaps, but I think there's avenues to explore that might eventually make that unnecessary. In the half-baked idea I described above, what you're basically doing by building one tree is partitioning the network where each of your child nodes gives you a claim about their (small) part of the network, and your parent node gives you a claim about the rest of the network (everything your child nodes don't make claims about). By building multiple of these trees with a different configuration each time, you allow each of your connections to make claims encompassing the entire network (or at least most of it). This way, if a bad actor is giving you false claims, you can track that and start ignoring their information. Do you understand what I meant when I paralleled this to how bitcoin full nodes work when one of their connections passes along invalid blocks or transactions?

@_date: 2017-06-17 23:20:28
So after looking into it more,  seems to be less of a problem than i thought. Sounds like the contingency transaction has a fee that can be claimed by anyone that publishes the transaction in the case that an old balance is published. This gives an incentive to the network to watch the blockchain for maliciously published old balance transactions. 
However, it seems like a man in the middle attack could be performed here. Let's say A opens a channel with B. If A manages to control all the connects B has to the bitcoin network (becoming a man in the middle), A can censor all B's attempt to propagate or publish refund transactions. In this case, A can send some money through B to another address A controls, then publish the original balance transactions. If A can continue to MITM B for the 10 days it takes for that transaction to go through, A would have successfully stolen all the funds A was able to convince B to transfer. B could potentially become aware that either the blockchain data he's getting isn't valid or simply become aware the balance transaction has been published, but if he can't get on the bitcoin network to publish the refund, he's screwed. Am I missing something in this? 


Large payments can remain on-chain, depending of course on your definition of large. 


First of all, having to be online to *receive* payments isn't a problem. What is a problem is requiring the recipient to be online to *send* a payment to them. 
This does seem like a huge problem to me. But can't a form of Hash Timelock Contract be used to safely give a 3rd party custody over a transaction to your destination so you can go offline? Like, I can imagine a scenario where Source (S) encrypts a value with the Destination's (D's) wallet key, then write a contract that says S will give Middleman (M) 1btc if M has the unencrypted value. S can then go offline, and when D comes online, M can create a transaction that executes of the original transaction executes, D can then give M the unencrypted value, and the transaction could go through. Seems like this would allow the sender and receiver to not have to be online at the same time. This does seem like it has the downside that you can only give a transaction like that to one 3rd party, rather than allowing any 3rd party to execute it (which would be more ideal), but one problem at a time. 


Not sure what you mean here. Do you mean that 6 attackers could cause 8 million channels to close? That also seems pretty unlikely to me. If the LN works out, it would seem that the usual scenario would be for channels to be kept open basically ad-infinitum.

Ok, I comment that you don't understand the Lightning Network, and you comment only about Segwit. I don't have any meaningful disagreement with that comment that other people haven't already disagreed with. Would love to hear why you think high fees on the main blockchain would make the lightning network useless. Cause I just don't think that's true.
And the hijack attempt is because everyone agrees with segwit, and yet a faction of people (who also support segwit) are preventing segwit from happening for political reasons. They want to choose their own direction for bitcoin rather than creating an altcoin people could get behind, or joining the community of an altcoin that *already* has no blocksize limits (like monero for example). Any change to bitcoin that is contentious simply shouldn't happen, and yet this faction is looking for ways to circumvent widespread agreement to bend bitcoin to its will and make changes tons of people don't want. That's why I'm calling it a hijack attempt.

You can make an on-chain payment directly to someone's lightning channel, can't you? 


I don't see how this helps that.

@_date: 2017-06-19 05:07:40


I agree. But I was trying to find a situation where an attacker could cause 8 million channels to close at once, like you had suggested. If channels were only opened at $2000, that would mean $16 billion would have to be committed to perpetrate an attack. Pretty much infeasible. 


Ok, I think I'm missing something here. Are you saying the *protocol* caps lightning transactions to 0.04, or are you saying people aren't going to want to commit more than that (like.. organically)? Or are you saying that the balance transactions would be limited to 0.04... I'm just not quite sure what you're saying here.


But people don't have to pay a thousand watchers. They only have to pay if the watcher actually posts a transaction (gaining a fee in doing so). The only issue I see here is if the lightning network is so error-less that no mischeif happens and therefore fees aren't prevalent enough to make it worth watching. In this case, I can see sudden spikes in attacks when watchers aren't watching enough. But watching is pretty cheap, so it might never get that bad.

This wasn't the article that convinced me, but it puts forth essentially the same argument:  . And here's a paper that analyzed the effects of various potential changes to bitcoin and concluded that bitcoin's blocksize shouldn't be increased any higher than 4MB:  . 
It would be awesome if bitcoin could make instant transactions with sub-one-cent fees on-chain, but there seem to be physical limits that make that impossible. Also, the lightning network promises to do the first two items while still being pretty safe to use. I'd rather have a large-transactions-only blockchain where miners are decentralized than have an all-transaction blockchain where only huge well connected companies can effectively mine. 
So tl;dr what convinced me is that I'm convinced the lightning network will work + I'm convinced that bigger block chains is a huge centralization risk + numerous altcoins have no hard blocksize limit and so that arena of experimentation can happen without risking bitcoin.
