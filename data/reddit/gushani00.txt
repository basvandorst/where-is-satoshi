but that option were there from before so there is nothing except to check out your claim that you have filled but the new option that they added "acceptance and rejections list" is to check if they have accepted your file and you need to search your claim number there and click to verify it! I still cannot open the "acceptance and rejection list" If you try multiple time the mtgox will block your ip address for 24 hours, it is happened to me twice.

Same thing happened to me. I got the mtgox email but i still cannot open the option of " acceptance and rejection list of all the claiment"
and there is no option to confirm their decision.

You said on your previous comment to check my claim and use the middle option, but that middle option is to transfer your claim to another person!
The 1st option is to check your claim
The 2nd option (middle one) is to transfer your claim.
The 3rd option is acceptance and rejection list for all users!

Have you managed to open the acceptance and rejections list?

I can see only my total claim but not the "Amount accepted by the bankruptcy trustee"?!

I have 3 button 
1st check your claim
2nd transfer your claim
3rd check acceptance and rejections list which cannot be open due to errors

I can view my claim too but cannot open the acceptance or rejection list to verify my claim is approved!
I am getting same error as you.
Has anybody opened it yet?!
