I know there are other block explorers and am hopefully sure that my transaction did not go through but now the site has been down for over 50 mins....my problem is if its schedualed downtime let us know and if its not whats up?
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:14:04
im in south western europe.....its been down for about an hour but ive just realized that also coinbase, coinsetter and kraken are giving the same probs
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:52:51
all the sites have seemed to have turned back to working here

It's simple. Convert CAD to Btc with cavirtex ... Open an account with kraken or bit stamp ... You don't have to give them a lot of info (if you don't have it already since you are moving to France) transfer the Bitcoin from the Canadian exchange to kraken sell them and you can do a SEPA transfer to you bank account in France. With little info you can withdraw 10,000 a month. The only way u would lose money in this transaction is if Bitcoin go down in value before its all done...the euro is falling in value as well though... From a Canadian who moved to Europe.... Stay in Canada!

I think certain types of encryption is considered a weapon or is classified as arms. Thus sending it across borders would be considered arms smuggling. I think he's referring to that.

I have translated the skyhook ATM manual in Italian,  (just sent it off) and have launched 2 small bitcoin sites for Italian users and am about to launch a little bigger one but have a lot if ideas .... I'm a programmer/ designer that puts all my spare time and effort into promoting of bitcoin , the studying of the protocol and further advancements all in Italian ..... Italy lacks investment banks or seed capital.... I've read up on every single one of those startup Italia projects but I have no idea where to start in this country!

this isn't a major newspaper.......it gets distribution by being given away free with the purchase of the local newspaper that ever little bar/caffe buys...i had to beg my local bar owner to at least buy some other paper......
its run by berlusconis brother and is a horrible newspaper..but accepts bitcoin..im torn
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:27:08
But the word in question here is bitcoin. If you replace the word bitcoin with any other fiat currency (eg euros) the statement remains valid. So to me the sentence is devoid of any real meaning. 
People use money to fund things ... That's how things get funded

5 star movement? Are you joking? The guy who runs it doesn't shut up about the wonders of the internet and his success and the success of his party are all thanks to the internet but he never said dick about bitcoin.  He also made videos about how stupid the criminalization  of canabis was then does shit about it once he gets some clout. There are no political saviors here
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:38:19
the voice didnt work either....i rebootted for a second time and it magically worked...thanks for your quick suggestion! 
edit--addition: it didnt work either but i did manage to get it to work but was a very unpleasant experience. the app is aesthetically nice but its gonna need some updates
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:22:31
I agree .... But please show me these open minded people in 5 stele that have done one thing to promote bitcoin? I am an immigrant here and have a hard enough time convincing people that I'm not out to rob them or steal their job or their daughter let alone convince them to accept digital currency (I am an immigrant but of Italian decent and not a real immigrat) 
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:20:21
Wow this article is pretty scary and italy seems to be taking a much more severe stance towards Bitcoin. With respect to the ECB &amp; some other European Union  countries . They want to do a trace of everyone who is currently using electronic currency?

I have tried to get a pizzeria of a friend to accept bitcoin. It's a huge pizzeria lots of international traffic, they love the idea but no one has a freakin smart phone...   For me perugia would be the best place to have success and not Rome but ci vuole un po!
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:59:06
inconvenient is not the freakin right word when you wait 20 minutes to see if they meant what they said, only to have the transaction sent now twice.....and i aint as lucky as you as there is no way i can expect a refund.......for fuck sakes
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:32:55
Kraken.com just opened to Canadian dollar deposits. I don't know how they accept Canadian funding but kraken is a solid exchange

What no one has mentioned in any of these posts is the freakin  damage that that virus is causing.  Imagine if your first experience with bitcoin is being extorted for it? You don't know what is it, or how it works but now you have to purchase some to give to a guy who is threatening to delete your hard drive. 
I know these people who dont have an antivirus, or back up and randomly execute files they find in unknown emails shouldnt be touching a computer with sentistive information but there are ALOT of people whose first experience with bitcoin is one where they feel violated. I dont think alot of these people would be further inclined to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:14:42
believe me its leaps ahead of "bitcoin is used for illicit activity etc etc"
....for god sakes a few months ago on the front page of an italian newspaper the had a huge title saying Bitcoin has declared bancrupcy!
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:48:23
this newspaper is the financial times of italy. The only people who read it are people who want to know what to do with their money without being propagandized with the bullshit of italian politics. Anyone who is reading this newspaper in Italy speaks english.

Other than the standard stuff of how bitcoin works and a bit of its history, it is a very well laid out argument for the use cases of bitcoin written extremely well. it talks about various possibile use cases such as: micropayments, smart  contracts, non falsifiable university degrees, the handling of leasing contracts, an uber without intermediary, the internet of things, it talks about nasdaqs use of the blockchain....it talks about how the blockchain can take the place of a notary, or also handle the access to digital rights. 
It also talks about where bitcoin can be studied showing Princeton, Stanford and MIT as the top three places in the US.
It shows other use cases for the blockchain like backoffice applications, social networks possible uses, diamond tracking, how we can better manage and track catostrafic funds more efficiently, how goldman sachs wants to create its own virtual currency...
For what ive seen in italy it is a very concise and well written and shows alot of application uses. I showed the pamphlet to a few people already and just for the fact that Il Sole 24 published it it gives it an authoritative position (not that they'll actually read it.) 
Italians have always been suspicious of banks and their government.....bitcoin is idilic for Italians!

Awsome! I was writing to them to see why they never mentioned Bitcoin once. And that they should accept Bitcoin donstions! Èspecially the tips!

its already like this in italy for years and i dont think it has increased bitcoin use.... It is illegal to make a purchase of anything with over 1000 euros in cash. Merchants have to refuse you by law...

Actually on the online version i just saw:
says: An American company that operates in bitcoin requests bankruptcy filings...
I dont see anything false or misleading about the title 
it does have a stupid line at the end saying that this is some how an indication of how all virtual currencies will be going....
im gonna go out and buy the paper to clarify what it says in the printed edition that they cant edit after printing! be back in a bit
UPDATE: yeah they seemed to correct the error on their site... i gave up on reading italian news 3 unelected presidents ago...... our last three presidents have been unelected and the last one that was elected (years ago now) was Berlusconi...

it maybe because we 'forgetful europeans' read history...i would think that we are all not all nazi's because of Russia's role in the second world war....the Italians liberated themselves from their oppressors, the americans came in and reinstated the Facists ..but thanks anyways
