read your own coinbase's answer to this 
most important:
"In the last five years, bitcoin’s difficulty has increased by a factor of 350,000 times. Today, the vast majority of bitcoin mining takes place on expensive specialized hardware, in locations where the weather is cold and electricity is cheap.
For example, $1,089 will buy you an Antminer S9, which mines blocks 10,000 times faster than any desktop computer and burns 10 times more electricity. This is all a long way from the democratic ideals with which bitcoin was created, even if it does make the blockchain extremely secure.
Well, kind of secure. If someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain, here’s how they would do it. First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together, creating a so-called '51% attack'. Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process, they would mine their own 'secret branch', containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest. Finally, when the desired amount of time had passed, they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network.
Since the attacker has more mining power than the rest of the network, their branch will contain more proof-of-work than the public one. Every bitcoin node will therefore switch over, since the rules of bitcoin state that the more difficult branch wins. Any previously confirmed transactions not in the secret branch will be reversed, and the bitcoin they spent could be sent elsewhere.
By now, most bitcoin believers will be laughing, because I wrote "install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together" as if this is trivial to achieve. And they have a point, because of course it's not easy, otherwise lots of people would already have done it. You need a lot of mining equipment, and a lot of electricity to power it, both of which cost a ton of money. But here's the inconvenient fact that most bitcoiners brush over: for the government of any mid-size country, the money required is still small change.
Let's estimate the cost of a 51% attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions. At the current bitcoin price of $1,500 and reward of 15 bitcoins (including transaction fees) per 10-minute block, miners earn around $1.2bn per year ($1500 × 15 × 6 × 24 × 365). Assuming (reasonably) that they are not losing money overall, or at least not losing much, this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range. (I’m simplifying here by amortizing the one-time cost of purchasing mining equipment, but $400m will buy you enough Antminer 9s to match the current bitcoin network’s mining capacity, so we're in the right ball park.)
Now, think about the reports that bitcoin is being used by Chinese citizens to circumvent their country’s capital controls. And consider further that the Chinese government’s tax revenues are approximately $3tn per year. Would a non-democratic country's government spend 0.04% of its budget to shut down a popular method for illegally taking money out of that country?"
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!!

it amazes me that people here sound surprised this kind of legislation is going forward. it's only the beginning boys, now that bitcoin has caught mainstream attention and its value is like ridiculously high there is gonna be all kinds of new laws passed to regulate how it works.
a lot of people just think crypto in itself is gonna bring down world governments. give me a break, they are gonna sink their tendrils in this and take over. you really think they gonna let something like bitcoin just run open and free....
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:49:59
...that anybody with the resources and desire (ie. central bank, government, big scary authority) could potentially reverse a whole year's worth of transactions or worse. running your own node doesn't protect you from this, not sure why you think it matters that you mine some btc. my 1998 gateway computer can technically "be a node"
and further the cryptography that is used to hash the private keys there's no guarantee this won't be broken in the future with quantum computers etc.. in fact, some security professionals already believe it has been by the likes of the CIA, GCHQ, etc
again you aren't really saying anything to combat this. i'm open minded to any reasonable answer, yours are just smarmy and condescending like "oh if you were smart you would already know it's impossible blabla" like please, give a real answer
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:27:38
ok then please enlighten me
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:13:16
ok so we're kind of getting somewhere now. so satoshi, the legendary creator of bitcoin, had to convince people to rollback... i'm guessing this was no simple task and there was prolly a lot more drama discussing it than our little back and forth on here. how could a consensus ever be reached today? how would things go if a consensus like this had to be reach every week or month or even every year?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:22:14
could you link me, i am having a hard time finding it exactly
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:42:17
.... not just the price fool, the whole thing can be manipulated. did you ever read satoshi's original paper on bitcoin? guessing you never did. it's pretty short like 8 pages yet he spends like 4 pages of it describing how the network can be brought down with a 51% attack. don't be so naive
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:47:53
ok so the community would have to pick a consensus as to which snapshot to pick? how can this be done? as in come up with a consensus and roll it back... i'm not tryin to be a prick with this question, i legitimately want to know
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:06:10
some real manipulation going on by big money players right now
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:51:28
i don't necessarily disagree, but it's one of the reasons bitcoin is so valuable. it is the 'cash' of the internet. your question (tho logical) is a lot like asking why aren't disney dollars worth more than USD or euros or any other currency... it can't be answer in a single reddit post
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:26:00
i also think bitcoin is overhyped but it serves a very very useful function: it works like 'cash' but over the internet.
this is what satoshi said in his original white paper. people can trade with cash in their in-person day to day transactions and don't have to worry about chargebacks etc all the BS associated with credit cards. though obviously most people are using credit cards these days, everybody knows for dealing on craigslist or whatever it is always best to do it IN CASH but until bitcoin this was impossible to do online without a third party like a credit card processor etc.
so bitcoin is basically this. cash-like security and anonymity but over the internet. this is prolly the coolest thing about it imo and why a lot of people see its longterm value.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:47:12
exactly man. i'm fascinated by bitcoin but the way people worship it and totally ignore its weaknesses is a little annoying
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:21:20
sorry man feel free to look up circular logic and read about it to learn more
i'm not a security professional but the consensus is that yes bitcoin is vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. if not today, some day. you can tell me it's not or that it's impractical but the consensus is that it's a real issue facing cryptos.
something that can happen today, as in right now, is any large enough group with a grudge against bitcoin (basically all of them) can make things very difficult for users of bitcoin. it's only now gotten real attention from world governments, don't be so sure they aren't already working on fucking it up right now.....

STILL LOOKING FOR A REAL ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IF ANY NON-SHILLS COULD ANSWER!

i'm glad that people are getting rich off of this, everybody deserves to make money/have a decent life. i don't really have a horse in this race only just as an observer it seems there's a lot of exuberance surrounding bitcoin and the real threats that seem to be out there just go ignored....
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:41:20
agreed. it's a great option to have
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:15:54
and what about 51% attack
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:53:29
i think with conventional banking since its been around a lot longer it's been discovered a lot of the ways money can get lost etc and there's precedents in how to handle it, whereas with bitcoin this is all new territory so i don't think things will be 'figured out' until there are at least a couple more mtGoxs
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:56:44
i don't understand what's stopping literally any central bank from making their own crypto?????? why is BITCOIN in particular worth $1MM?? really seems like nobody can actually explain it other than saying "DE BLOCKCHAINZ", yet literally hundreds of alt coins exist that cost like fractions of a cent a piece so why can't a central bank let's say take advantage of blockchain tech by updating the USD or other currencies??? serious answers only please
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:19:46
something bitcoin shills never discuss: no dispute resolution procedures for crypto! at least with cash you can make sure whatever you are buying is what it's claimed to be. paying with crypto for goods online not yet received and you run this risk. you pay someone in bitcoin for ANYTHING before you receive it, and that money is GONE!
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:38:11
you realize btc can be manipulated as well right?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:09:17
so basically the 'honest nodes' would collude to 'fix' the blockchain, the same blockchain that's supposedly immutable. don't see any circular logic there big boy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:49:40
hey but bitcoin shills, 1 BTC = 1 BTC !!!!!!!!!111 Isn't this all that matters with your magical moon 'currency'???????//
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:06:58
and you're gonna accomplish this by fixing it to the price of USD?????????????? who are you jamie dimon you sell out lizard person nosferatu banker
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:23:15
what's your exit strategy for bitcoin??? it's as if nobody here actually gives a shit about **using** bitcoin as a currency and just wanna get rich quick (but get rich in fiat)?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:17:54
jamie dimon!!!!!!!!111111 you are teh nosferatu STONE MASON

the case for gold is a tricky one with modern understanding of chemistry. it's already possible to make gold in a lab so surely one day they'll be a breakthrough which leads to it being more cheaply made in a lab than to actually mine. what happens to the value of gold then? 
or if you're bearish on the idea science could ever reach that point, what if mining equipment were improved a lot making it cheaper, or a huge cache of gold is found somewhere, or an entirely new process that refines gold from the tears of orphaned dogs. who knows, but it's not that hard to imagine imo
what happens to the price of gold is prolly the same shit that happened to the price of salt

since this thread has become about whether BTC is valuable or not, I figure I'll put in my two cents
seems a lot of people in here are often repeating "if ppl think it's worth X then it's worth X" which is an overly simplistic view of just about anything imo. this is a complex topic but just would like to point out it isn't as simple as that.
BTC might always have some value going forward but there are many reasons people buying now should be careful at least (we'll use USD as an example)
1. USD is backed by a government and its military. For some this is why they prefer crypto but in the end we know that USD comes with the strength of the US military. Until governments and their militaries are willing to kill to protect the value of BTC it will never have the same gravitas as something like USD
2. USD and banking systems around it have built in dispute resolution and ways of correcting errors. Wires can be reversed if sent to the wrong account, money can be returned if stolen by fraud etc, whereas with BTC once the money is out of your wallet that's the end of it. Again, for some they consider this a strength of BTC but for practical uses in the real world many times dispute resolution is required and in fact produces the greatest good (even outside of finance exampled by the congested court system)
3. BTC will need to put up with new pressures from existing financial monoliths that are creating their own cryptos/equivalents that can be used to reconcile payments and apply the technology that makes BTC so interesting in the first place. I think this further marginalizes BTC/cryptos in the longterm
These are just my opinions on this and I hope this can open up a larger discussion concerning these points and why you agree/disagree
