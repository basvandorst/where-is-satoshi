So you prefer services who don't wont support BU even if 99% Would use BU instead of Core?
Makes much sense. NOT
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:32:35
Most can be automatic monitored and alerts sets for certain events.
Compared to the work with all the other altcoins this sounds like a lazzy job to me :-)
I manage a lot altcoins on BTCPOP and believe me thats a lot more work.
Maybe its my view on things in General?
I search for solutions on problems and not on problems for solutions.
If BU becomes the main chain then there will be solutions to deal with those things.
If core solves the scaling quick enough BU don't become a thing.
If other solutions are created what are maybe better than BU and Segwit then those will become a thing.
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:38:23
I'm not debating PRO or CONTRA BU.
You accuse me for being amateurish and not caring about user Funds.
If whatever becomes the main chain its just logical to support it and at least allowing users to withdrawal their coins also on the other chains.
Some People read BU or CORE or whatever and get instantly emotional.
When ETH hardforked and ETC was created we also supported both chains. No feelings about whats the right or the wrong one.
I did read a lot about both sides of arguments ( Segwit vs BU ).
And TBH BU has for me better arguments but also for sure BU don't become a thing if problems not solved.
So no real point in fighting at all there.
And also I think BU and Segwit wont become a thing. But at least many people think about many possible solutions.
I still hope it will become something automated with fixed rules someday.
Blocksize limit = avg blocksize over last N blocks + x%
For my logic that would be the only logical solution and the limit automatic increases or decreases based on demand.
Then there are many possible solutions to reduce needed resources.
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:55:23
No, not really. Based on that we should already have bigger blocks. As you know the 1 MB limit was a temporary limit.
And this debate is going on for more than 2y now and causes more damage than what ever solution will "win" in the end.
Why not build a dynamic blocksize limit?
Bitcoin changed so much over time and its not what it was in 2009 so that statement is just wrong.
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:46:40
For Btcpop i can say that we'll support BU but would integrate another chain so users could withdrawal on the other chain(s)
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:49:10
So if BU wins in the end its protecting user coins by not supporting it?
I guess users would love it if whatever becomes the main Bitcoin and exchanges and other services then say "No we don't support it we just keep the coins".
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:24:13
Thats how it works. If people don't like it they use other solutions.
You make such decisions every day several times.
Support for other options just shows ( some ) users are unhappy with the current option.
Rational seen it would make more sense if all work together on solutions but you won't be able to agree even with 3 people on all things in the same room.
My personal favorite solution would be an variable automated blocksize limit.
Something like blocksize = avg blocksize over last N Blocks + 10%
But that won't happen either.
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:35:25
Fill in whatever, doesn't make my statement wrong or illogic.
If BU becomes the main chain its just logical to support it. No matter if you I or whoever like it or not.
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:55:53
Sure it is, no one is forced to use BU or CORE or one of the many other nodes.
Group A says its propaganda what the other Group says and the other Group says its propaganda what Group A say.
The Truth is somewhere between or not on both of the Groups.
But i'm out here now. Was just saying we'll support BU what is just logical if it becomes a thing and everything else would be unfair to users to say you don't get your coins on the BU chain now or on another chain if they become real.
And personal I prefer the idea of BU but see also lot of problems.
And changes aren't always bad at all.
And my personal opinion doesn't count much anyway.
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:05:25
With growing demand.
Now such attacks can cause more damage as mempools get larger.
Use enough blocks for the average and it becomes pretty expensive to attack.
Can even build in more protection like max x% over last N blocks average but also max % over much more blocks.
Fact is the demand keeps growing, that doesn't work with no bigger blocks.
And i see also no problem in bigger blocks specially with pruning its still possible to keep own nodes up with limited storage resources.
And Traffic doesn't increase it would even decrease as many transactions get rebroadcasted a lot when there is a backlog.
Over time it increase with more demand but thats valid for small and big blocks and more valid with small blocks because the rebroadcasting. If you want to reduce traffic with small blocks you need more RAM over time to keep transactions longer in your mempool.
More demand = Bigger Blocks or Bigger backlog + more RAM usage.
Doesn't mean there should be no work on efficiency like xthin and/or segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:29:07
Lol before you make such accusations you should be sure that you can prove them.
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:25:32
Thats an assumption by you.
I believe in Free markets.
And the Free Market find solution for problems quicker as few people can with planning.
If the scaling debates going on instead of creating solutions ( whatever those solutions are ) BU and other FORKS will become more popular. Simple as that.
No feelings about that debate, I prefer to use Logic.
And Humans aren't Rational and not everyone sees the best solution in what you or I might see as best Solution.
And its you who talk more like an Dictator. You Talk about consensus but if the consensus doesn't fit what you want you call it dead.
Just try to keep it logic. No fight Pro or Contra BU needed. I just said I would support BU if BU becomes the main Chain. Not more not less.

Its not all on Hetzner and its not 150 nodes.

@_date: 2017-03-30 15:45:06
and what what?
Point is that most nodes are up with no real reason no matter if core,classic,bu or whatever.
BU/Classic nodes helps at least in propagating Xthin blocks better between nodes supporting Xthin.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:45:31
Xthin doesn't caused it. Bad code caused it. Bad code get fixed. Other solutions are created. Not only BU supports Xthin and EC.
Try again.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:11:54
Supporting BU is more effective with the mining on EC Supporting pools like I also do.
Running nodes has more an promoting effect for btcpop and EC.
I'm not a BU hardcore supporter but I support EC.
I would have no problem to switch to Classic or other solutions if problems on BU continues.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:22:24






I think you don't understand that nodes doesn't control Bitcoin.
Read again about PoW.
Most other nodes have no real use either.
Most users use lightweight wallets or online wallets.
The few who use a full node for their wallets or doing transactions keep them up to date anyway no matter if EC or SegWit will win or whatever. And no one cares about the Zombie nodes.

@_date: 2017-08-24 10:19:06
And even if diff had been adjusted with BIP148 people would not call it Bitcoin.  
The same would've been happened as with Bitcoin Cash, some people call it Bcash maybe the UASF would've been called Bseg or whatever.  
To make it clear: I'm not happy with the split(s). I would've prefer that there was only 1 chain but for me the most logical would've been to start with increasing the blocksize.  
That way there would've been not such damage as happened now and still there could be Segwit and LN.  
Probably it would've been active for a year by now then...
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:29:06
We keep the name Bitcoin Cash.
We have also BitcoinDark and BitcoinPlus and our users are smart enough to don't get confused.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:44:58
And I see the EDA on Bitcoin Cash as issue as well and suggested to change the "normal" difficulty adjusting to 72 Blocks.  
That way the avg Block time would still be 10 min in the long even if its gamed as long its gamed.  
72 Block adjusting would just mean that 12 hours close to no mining and then 12 hours lot of mining but still limited to ~144 Blocks per 24 Hours.  
Bitcoin would still suffer more than Bitcoin Cash from this as miners would just mine ~12 hours Bitcoin and ~12 Hours Bitcoin Cash.  
The backlog on Bitcoin would increase and on Bitcoin Cash it would be cleared with the first 8MB block as long its not much used but even if it would be used a lot more it would clear in minutes once the EDA hits in.  
No matter if you like it or not, the only way to avoid this would be bigger blocks on Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:09:01


True, we're getting lot support tickets about unhappy users asking about their Bitcoin Deposits not confirming.  
Not all users are technical enough to know they have to pay $5+ to get them fast confirmed, and some use wallets or services what sends with lower fees.  
A real problem with Bitcoin at the moment.  
Besides the fact that Transaction fees are already one of the biggest position for us.  
Refilling hotwallets can be expensive with lot inputs.  
But we're investing already in more developers to offer our services also for other coins.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:34:56
I know what you mean, you know what I mean.  
I could use Bcore as well but thats childish in the end.  
There is Bitcoin+, there is BitcoinDark and probably 1000 other alts with Bitcoin in the name and no one gets confused.  
Doesn't change the arguments at all.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:10:18
Thats nonsense. Even bitfury stopped to dignal BIP148 support. The BIP148 activated segwit would have end with 1% or less mining support without other diff adjusting rules.  
It would've been a dead chain.  
The stalling for years caused such forced action no matter if you like it or not.  
A HF to bigger blocks would have require to update full nodes and miner nodes, most users wont have even notice something.  
There could still have been development on Segwit and LN and probably everyone would just have accept it if there was no scaling issue.  
It was bad played from many sides and now we have to live with 2 splits and soon probably 3.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:43:19


Posting a fact = Paid shill?  
Without NYA and Segwit2.x there would be no Segwit now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:13:46
bcash doesn't exists yet.  
I'm not a Bitcoin Cash developer at all nor I'm a blind believer of whatever.  
My Arguments was the same 2y back.  
It will work in practice as well.  
Bitcoin worked all the time that way till the 1MB cap was reached.  
Blocks wasn't full all the time till end 2016.  
I think rational and bigger blocks are needed.  
Do you think Bitcoin will be used for long with $5-7 tx fees on Standard Transactions?  
Do you think merchants will use complex solutions or will they switch to easier solutions?  
Watch the market cap and you get the reality.  
Users don't buy bitcoin and pay high fees to buy something with paying another high fee again when they just can use other payment methods with low fees.  
Bitcoin became popular because easy cheap and fast transactions, not because high fees or "Store of value".  
The value of Bitcoin would be 0 if it wasn't used and became more popular by easy and cheap sending money.  
I suggested since years people to use Bitcoin also as saving plan by buying each month for an amount they can afford.  
Now i can't suggest that as they would need to keep the coins on an exchange as sending them to own wallets would just cost to much money.  
Try to keep emotions out of the game, if Segwit and LN are good solutions they will be used with bigger blocks as well and then the blocks will be smaller no matter what the max size is.  
If not then Segwit/LN isn't good ( yet ).  
Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:19:32


No, maybe its now the best solution, maybe not.  
Some other solutions looks interesting as well ( HF needed ).  
But you describe the problem again pretty well:  
Many trying to solve problems now what could occur in the future and thinking they are smarter than people in the future.  
Can you really say that Segwit is the best solution forever?  
Can you really say there can't be a better solution?  
Can you see a way making people use Segwit and LN without forcing them by keeping the Blocksize small and onchain fees high?  
Now already many people moved to Bitcoin Cash and Altcoins.  
The development on those is huge and more and more merchants are using other coins.  
Thats what the Market does.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:43:15
Try to get a coin successful without support for it.  
Could become hard.  
Its also double standard. All the time it was "We need to avoid a split".  
Then BIP148 came and it was ok, NYA was supposed to avoid the split but then came Bitcoin Cash...  
Now it will probably end with 3 chains. That isn't good for anyone in the end.  
But the market will decide what chain becomes the most used and valuable in the end.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:57:16


No, I proven that wrong by running 150 nodes a while back for €1 a month each. ( Pruned mode ).  
For your own use Pruned mode is perfectly fine. For Business use or for Hobby its not an expensive thing to run a full node either.  
The avg user uses SPV wallets anyway.  
At the moment I still run several full nodes with the full chain for my business.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:30:35
I don't call Bitcoin Bcore and I don't call Bitcoin Cash Bcash.  
And i'm in Bitcoin since 2011 and I sell only if i need Fiat money.  
I still have a lot from 2011 :-)  
So its in my interest that Bitcoin survives and Bitcoin Cash as alternate on top is ok for me as well.  
I'm not thinking like others that Bitcoin Cash gains value on cost of Bitcoin, I think that Bitcoin Cash moved lot money back from people who switched to other altcoins.  
And thats valid for both chains.  
Still I think the moving out of Bitcoin to other Altcoins could've been avoided and the split as well with just bigger blocks earlier.  
I'm ok with Segwit and LN even if i think it isn't needed for long time. But thats my opinion on Segwit and LN.  
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:07:51
Bitcoin is at the point where everyone is on broadband but Bitcoin is still on dial up.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:45:19
I'm ok with LN as long users don't get forced into to reduce onchain transactions.  
Tx fees aren't are problem, they wasn't before and they will increase even if they are lower per TX.
If Bitcoin is still used by then, then probably there will be so much transactions that the tx fees are more than the current block reward if you compare to the current buying power of the block reward.  
50 BTC Block reward had less buying power than the today 12.5 BTC.  
I don't see problems with the UTXO either, there was now some bigger blocks on Bitcoin Cash as well.  
And paying a coffee is also ok with 0 Confs tbh, the risk is lower than on traditional payment channels ( Chargebacks,Counterfeit and so on ).
For now every Halving in the rewards was followed with a big price jump as well.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:15:14

@_date: 2017-08-24 09:34:42
Yes thanks BTC1 who made it possible.  
Now lets wait for the 2MB HF so Bitcoin would be usable maybe again.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:59:07
SegWit isn't needed for LN.  
And to face problems with bigger blocks will take decades.  
On a 384kbit connection you can download 8mb in 2:46 minutes.  
A 2TB HDD doesn't cost much either.  
Its a bit strange trying to solve problems what maybe could happen in decades ( if ever ) and thinking we're smarter now than people in decades maybe facing such problems.  
If all would think that way we still would use C64's having no HDTV no 4k movies. No online Streaming no 2.3MB+ avg websites...
But yeah.. Now we have Segwit and nearly no one understands it and nearly no one uses it.  
If LN becomes available then still nearly no one understands it and nearly no one will use it.  
It solves exactly nothing at all.  
Meanwhile the Mempool keeps growing and even faster halving on Bitcoin Cash wont change that. EDA just need to drop it far enough down to be even profitable to mine with 0.001 Bitcoin Cash block reward.  
Even if the price would be $0.01 for Bitcoin Cash there will be a point where its more profitable to mine it with EDA.  
Markets works and don't care much about feelings.  
This all could've been avoided with just increasing the blocksize, no one would have say something against Segwit or LN and those are possible with bigger blocks as well.  
It all started with refusing to increase the blocksize because fear that the blocks would be full again but even if they are full again then it would just mean Bitcoin is more used and the value would be much higher.  
With a 10mbit connection you can download 1.25MB each second.  
Increasing the Blocksize will work for decades.  
Even with 1GB Blocksize you would need in pruned mode only 550GB + Header data. On a 100 Mbit connection you would need 1:20 minutes for 1GB.  
On 20 Mbit you would need 6:40 minutes what would still work in avg. Could happen you get sometimes few blocks behind but you would be able to keep it synced with 10 min avg blocks.  
I assume that once 1GB blocks would be full that Bitcoin price would be several $100k or Millions and that many people would have access to 1gbit+ Internet connections.  
The whole "we need to keep small Blocks" makes technically no sense and even less economical sense.  
And in the long you will be on the losing chain with 1MB cap.  
No hard feelings there, I'm in Bitcoin since 2011 and I hope Bitcoin survives and that also the small Block advocates will change their mind.  
Hope is low but its still there.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:01:50
Not sure, but with Bitcoin Classic devs on that chain I would guess they want to hardfork Flextrans at some point.  
Didn't read much technical about it but looks interesting for me as well.  
If i'm correc there is BitcoinABC, BitcoinClassic and Bitcoin Unlimited developing on Bitcoin Cash.  
We'll see how that works out.  
Maybe it works or there will be at some point 3 splits on the Bitcoin Cash chain as well.  
Think the fear for splits has been a lot lowered now...
Edit: I still don't like splits!
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:14:35


Without blocking scaling it wouldn't be possible.  
Here everyone said that Increasing the blocksize wont solve the problems and Segwit would solve it instant.  
Now users here say it need time and now its the others causing backlogs like Bitcoin Cash with EDA.  
Without all the Fud,lies and Propaganda there would be no Bitcoin Cash at all.  
Dealing with the split was a lot more work than just upgrading nodes.  
If the Blocksize was just increased to 2MB to start with, no one would have blocked Segwit at all.  
Everything else are the consequences of being irrational.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:53:00
To download 8MB takes 2:46 minutes on a 384 kbit connection.  
You could run a pruned mode also on a cheap vps and verify your own transaction that way.  
You can't except that everyone can run a node.  
Some have limited Data others run old hardware.  
But there is also no need that everyone runs a node.  
That doesn't work with 100Kb and not with 1MB and also not with whatever Blocksize.  
If you argue that your Internet is capped then you should realize that the traffic doesn't change much. You get the transactions and they are stored in your mempool till they get in a block. In fact smaller blocks could lead to more traffic even if transactions get rebroadcasted...
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:12:56
For some that might be true but most time it isn't.  
Its because some of the people who control this sub created a site (bcash.io) and a sub with the name bcash.  
The confusing is BS and there is also no right on the name Bitcoin. Everyone can use that.  
There is also Bitcoin Dark and Bitcoin Plus and no one cares.  
As reaction on that the name Bcore was created.  
To avoid confusion I usual use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash when I talk about them.  
Its all very childish.  
For years was said if you want bigger Blocks then fork off, now that happened and its called attack.  
It was even a nice Fork with good replay protection.  
I excepted a much bigger mess.  
The concerns of Bitcoin users is now that EDA hurts Bitcoin but in the long it will balance it self anyway.  
I'm Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash user and I support NYA.  
No bigger blocks makes no sense. Still everyone is free to choose what he want.  
If Bitcoin Cash had no replay protection I would have not add it to our site ( still would have allow withdrawals on it ).
Same will be valid in November for the chain what becomes the minority chain if no replay protection added.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:35:24
It will just adjust more down to be still profitable to mine.  
Bitcoin is  now.  
Bitcoin Cash is   
Still its more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash at the moment.  
If the block reward drops then the difficulty just need to adjust more down to be profitable with less coins per block.  
For Bitcoin its a bigger issue as meanwhile Bitcoin Cash only need a few hours to adjust down till its more profitable again no matter what the block reward and price is and Bitcoin looses lot mining power during those times.  
We can see the result already with a huge backlog and high TX fees.  
Same time those issues on Bitcoin will let people move to other coins as well.  
Markets search it ways.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:06:52
Same for BTCPOP. We wont support the minority chain if it doesn't add Replay protection.  
Users will be able to withdrawal coins on all chains but there will be no trading without replay protection or any other features offered for such minority chain.  
And for now it seems that the most miners will follow NYA.  
With replay protection we would add such chain also to the exchange.  
We don't decide what users do with there funds or not do but based on the fundamental Bitcoin rules the longest chain is the valid one.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:38:34
Pre mining + releasing nodes what doesn't sync when own mining is running already is scam for me.  
We don't know about bcash yet, guess we have to wait till its released.

You talk like the world would stop working in such event.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:44:36
How could you call it attacks?  
Any evidence at all?  
If he want to attack Bitcoin he would invest most of his money into mining, causes huge diff increase and then just stop mining or point everything to BCH.  
If he buys or sells whatever then its not an Attack and the Spam theory is pure BS as well, everyone saw that a lot of transactions was with more than 700s/b what was stuck.  
If the mempool is close to empty i do also lot 1-5s/b transactions ofc if it then increases those transactions will be stuck but still not spam, just trying consolidation when the mempool is low.  
Many users bet also on low/empty mempools in the weekends and put their low fee transactions in short before the weekend.  
Many early adopters like my self never excepted that there would be no on chain scaling, we risked a fortune when everyone was saying Bitcoin will fail and we're crazy.  
We promoted Bitcoin and build businesses around Bitcoin and now most of that businesses doesn't work anymore because the blocksize isn't increased.  
Bitcoin became a success because easy to use for everyone fast and cheap to send money to everywhere.  
There is not a single Rational argument against bigger Blocks, even if some say it can't be increased forever.  
Even if it can be increased forever, Onchain scaling doesn't mean there can't be development on Offchain solutions like LN or whatever.  
If they get adopted the blocks would be smaller or get smaller them self.  
Running cheap nodes is not an argument either as its just pointless to run $5 nodes when you pay $20 or more in TX fees and to just hold as SOV you don't need a node at all.  
I keep BTC and BCH and with trading the swings I increase my holdings on both chains.  
I didn't start to support Bitcoin to become Rich quick, I joined for more Freedom.  
  
Maybe it becomes time to get rational again and not fighting against each other.  
No matter if you like Roger Ver or not, he was also one of the early Bitcoiners who promoted it, invested in startups and lead to the success of Bitcoin and he sees all that also under attack by not scaling.

Till 2013 2 pools had most time 50%+ Hashpower no matter how many solominers there was or not was ( There was no solominers in 2013 anymore anyway ).  
The Network becomes more decentralized with more miners/pools and even the non mining expensive wallets who keeps copies of the blockchain becomes more decentralized with more absolute number no matter how many users there are.

On the way to become Rich you get a lot robbed by taxes.  
And everyone can avoid them as much as possible.  
Still the rich get robbed the most and even if not then there is still no valid reason to rob from 1 group or justify it because another group get robbed as well.  
Terrible to see even such postings and questions here, that describes the fall of Bitcoin pretty well.  
Those statists here doesn't even realize what is happening now and arguing like communists that competition is an attack without knowing how to "defend"...

I was live on an exchange chat that time and people made deposits and withdrawals during that split. A friend lost 400 BTC that time.  
Everyone on the new version was on the wrong chain for a few blocks.  
That was a much bigger "fuck up", still it got fixed and everyone moved on.  
Few years back probably the community would have point out such errors and help each other, now everyone fights against each other.  
In the end no one will win if this goes on.

2x was called off, if there was consensus more teams including core would have developed it and that would've been probably better than 1 dev coding it without peer review and proper testing.  
Just because someone tries to fork badly doesn't mean it need to be done badly all the time, on the unintended fork in 2013 it was solved quickly by the whole community.  
With a node you follow the chain what is valid for your node if no one mines it then you just follow nothing, If miners mine different chains then you can pick the one you need but your full nodes doesn't make miners mine whatever.  
If you decide that the max blocksize should be 300kb you would just end without getting blocks.  
Your node doesn't change what miners does in the end.

There was more than 50K Transactions yesterday with 700s/b in Fees.  
If you call that spam you must be really stupid.  
LN doesn't exists yet, it need to be L3 already.  
Before Blockstream all current core devs was for bigger blocks btw...

TBH, if I remember correct the 400 BTC was recovered later.  
But I guess lot was not recoverable or at the cost of the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:47:22
I'm not having the computers anymore from that time.  
So that wont be possible.  
Thats not the point either, people blame here for something what would've 0 impact if 100% supported the 2x HF and probably also 0 impact if not 100% supported it.  
Stupid bug but happens and happened with Core as well.  
Bugs could happen and if you're dev and find your own bugs you see your self it was stupid.  
Question is how you deal with the bugs when you find out about them.  
If the HF had happen I would have stop transactions on the Bitcoin Network 1-2 Hours before like I did on the BCH fork.  
I would have update my nodes and if a split is excepted install the Node supporting the split chain, wait till everything is working and stable and then move on.  
Every exchange and service would have stop transactions several blocks before the HF.  
And for the little chance that someone would have send me coins on the wrong chain because a HF happened earlier or later than excepted I would be honest enough to return them on the "wrong" chain.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:41:07
Just check how many pools there was in 2013 and before and how many there are now.  
Check how many nodes there was and how many now.  
Not so hard to check your self...
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:36:40
You can view that in a few blocks on BTC as some trolls also want to do still the 2x Fork.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:58:22
And I bet you have some backup plans for worst case scenarios.  
I run a Multi Million dollar company as well and dealing with user funds, if the Fork wasn't called off we would have stop deposits and withdrawals a few hours before the excepted Fork and had enabled them back as soon the Network would be stable.  
In this case the Fork would probably just be delayed and nothing would've happen. A big fuck up yes but to blame it now is pointless as well.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:17:27
Just to get it correct:  
Now fewer miners with bigger share temporary, so more centralization and this is celebrated by those who say mining is too centralized.  
Did i get that correct?  
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:12:26
In fact even less chances for newbies to send coins to a wrong wallet compared to pure Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallets.  
If they click receive on the wrong wallet they will receive their coins still in the correct one.  
It offers a Bitcoin and a Bitcoin Cash wallet what makes it easier for newbies instead of dealing with multiple wallets.  
Why just not create another one what list Bitcoin as the first one?  
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:55
You can ignore reality but you can't ignore the consequences of reality.  
BTC can't survive without HF as more Hashpower will move to BCH and they will switch back for short time when the diff decreases on BTC.  
We'll see the same as on BCH all the time but on BTC there is no EDA.  
If you see it as attack you should at least know your own weak points and try to defend correct.  
Most are just ignoring the danger probably till its too late.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:57:40
You know that Core fucked up also in 2013 but then a split really happened what did cost lot people a shitload of BTC?  
2x was called off you don't know if the error had been catched or not if it wasn't called off.  
Making problems of something what isn't a problem at all.  
Even if 2x hat happened probably everyone had stopped to do transactions like they did on the August HF of BCH.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:00:09


Thats not true at all.  
You can easly convert the version bit 28 or 40 to 0 or 5.

Yeah nothing to see here all is ok.  
Bitcoin Diamond has not even a github so all will be fine as well.  
And why did you sell them all if you think they are legit?  
I dumped BTG as soon i was able to move them.

Nice quote in that context:  
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:11:16
And I also guess if there was 100% Support for the 2x then Lot other devs would've worked on it as well and the bugs wont happen.  
It was called off as there was no 100% support, I still think it would've been better to scale on chain as well but with high support from the community ( I don't care if one dev team wont support it, if the majority of the community wanted it then they would've to accept it ).  
With 50/50 Support or 80/20 or whatever there would've been a huge mess anyway no matter if there are bugs or not.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:36:54
Congratulations, Your node is probably Cheaper than a Standard TX right now...  
Thank you also for slowing down Block and Transaction propagation more.  
Here a list of benefits to run a non mining node in a list:
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:05:30
For me Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.  
No need to get emotional about competition.  
Bitcoin.com provides services for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  
More decentralization comes from more demand and use not by limiting blocksize.  
Even with bigger blocks more miners will join, more pools and more businesses who run nodes.  
But I understand that many people here don't understand basic economics, was a bit different till 2013 but after that many Statists and Socialists joined.  
You can even read the early mails from Satoshi Nakamoto and the Whitepaper instead of just following blindly whoever ( No matter if that is Core devs or Roger Ver or whoever ).  
Here people think they need to run non mining nodes and scaling would be solved by LN, they argue that nodes are important so you don't need to trust others even if a non mining nodes can do nothing about except not following the chain anymore.  
And with LN you're still trusting 3rd parties and relay on no bugs/exploits or whatever ( We see on ETH how that could work out ).  
I'm not against Sidechain solutions at all but i'm against forcing users into them.  
If they work as you except then the blocksize wont matter at all and the max size wouldn't just be reached.   
But its also hard to share opinions here as every different opinion will just be called out as trolling without proving the arguments of each side and argue with facts and logic against them if something should be wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:57:34
Thats nonsense as well.  
You're not trusting strangers with your money by not running a node.  
You still keep your privkeys and you trust 3rd parties for transactions what you can verify against many nodes or by running a own node.  
If you don't want to trust the network you can run a node in pruned mode as well, no need to keep the full blockchain for that.  
You're ok with an SPV wallet as well and just waiting for at least 1 conf and 6 confs or more for bigger transactions.  
Thats as safe as trusting your own node, with the make double spend easy function RBF you can't trust 0 confs anymore ( What was perfectly fine for small amounts before ).  
Your own node still does nothing than a reorg if a block or blocks get orphaned, you don't win anything extra.

@_date: 2017-11-17 16:55:14


Probably nothing as with the BCH hf in August everyone stopped much earlier to do transactions.  
Exchanges/Merchants and all stopped few blocks before to accept deposits and proccess withdrawals for the case something goes wrong.  
You also don't know if someone would have catched that error before the fork if it wasn't canceled.  
No one cares anymore as 2x was called off and no one is supporting it at all. Block 464783 will probably be never mined and 464784 also not on that chain.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:21:59
See, people realized pretty quick it didn't work.  
In that event there would be pretty quick a fix and you update your nodes, those who are stuck would realize latest when they want to make transactions.  
As responsible node operator you monitor your nodes and keep uptodate about latest security news and ofc also news about the software you run.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:31:04
Did you read the part about pre mining, spreading malware, linking coin stealing wallets/sites?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:04:49
Ofc not. BCH wont suffer from Hashpower switching anymore but still miners will switch to the more profitable chain.  
In the event that 10-30% switch to BCH after the DAA HF that would mean the Diff on BTC will decrease and probably become more profitable to mine.  
The miners will switch back to BTC till the diff increases again and then move back to BCH.  
After that BTC will be slower for longer time and this could increase with every cycle.  
Same what was done with BCH EDA will happen to BTC but without EDA on BTC.  
That could make BTC unusable for long time or for good.  
The only way to avoid that is a HF on BTC but most even don't see the issues it will create so guess it wont happen at all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:23:41

Did he force anyone to trade?  
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:17:54
Probably it would, a user withdrew once BTC to an LTC address and the BTC ended there ( just another address format ).  
On BCH a user tried to withdrawal to the new Bitpay format and it failed ( He had to convert the address via the Bitpay tool ).  
The Bitcoin.com wallet shows Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash clearly different and for Jan 14th there is a update planned to support the new address format global, wallet developers can then just give a warning that the address is not an BTC or BCH address, probably most will adopt the new Address format.  
We're developing at the moment for btcpop to support the new format already.
@_date: 2017-04-07 22:04:58
There is not such thing like BTU. If EC wins the smaller chain will probably die with increased confirmation time + diff adjusting.
No one knows if exchanges will change BTU to BTC then.
And those BTU on exchanges aren't anything real at all.
Don't know who wants to keep his assets on exchanges without knowing what will happen.

Don't forget my 175 TH/s in mining power for EC.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:46:59
My nodes are real.
How do you setup Fake nodes?
Or do you mean if a single person or Company runs more than 1 node its Fake?
In your perfect world probably miners should also be limited to a max hashrate for a single person?
Bitcoin = PoW thats the only thing what matters in the end. Setting up nodes is easy and doesn't say anything nor it has any meaning.
I could setup 10k nodes for $15k-$20k would that mean EC won or would that change anything for the other nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-07 22:02:10
Not all are in pruned mode.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:36:06
Most setup with pruning and some with full network mode.
Not a secret at all and easy to track:
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:54:02
Who is "they" exactly?
Can you give me his phone number?
And why you think the non crashed nodes with EB/AD strings in the UA aren't real BU nodes?
You can disable Xthin in the bitcoin.conf or with a startup parameter, those who hadn't Xthin enabled didn't crash.
Another secret but please promise to tell no one:
People even own several miners and control Bitcoin more that way.
Some really own more than the power of a single CPU!
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:34:47
Where is something coordinated?
No one asked me to setup my nodes.
"/Free the Markets - Free the People -  /BitcoinUnlimited:1.0.1.3(EB16; AD12)/ (80002)
NODE_NETWORK, NODE_BLOOM, NODE_XTHIN (21)"
Looks like a useragent for me and looks like a string with EB/AD in it.
Looks like nodes with Xthin and some without Xthin.
Lot assumptions of you without proof.
Any proof for what nodes had what settings before the remote crash exploit?
Still its funny how people complain about someone setting up a bunch of nodes. I remember times where people said there should be more nodes...
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:47:48

Your Arguments on a list:

Try again.
Bugs in BU != Bugs in Xthin
Lucky that there aren't bugs in Core...
And happy Core nodes run so stable...
And Lucky that Segwit is such great idea and has no bugs:
Hope that facts doesn't hurt your feeling.. Ok that was a lie. I don't care at all.

So medium sized servers makes them fake?
Only nodes on high sized servers are real?
Why again you guys don't support bigger blocks then?
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:55:30
And how is your gameplan if Hashpower will be 10% or less?  
That could lead to even more hashpower leaving b1x.  
The mempool will be several GB till the diff adjusts.  
Probably you'll need your 750 B1X coins then for TX fees...

I don't know tbh.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:03:25
You can trade them away on btcpop. No KYC and we will list that on our Altcoin Exchange. But it could take 100+ Days till the diff adjusts on that coin. So sending them could take very long time and could need a high fee.
We'll allow withdrawals on all possible splits and trading on all if there is replay and reorg protection.
And tbh, there are worse altcoins in the wild :-p
