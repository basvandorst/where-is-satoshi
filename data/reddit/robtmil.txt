Haha. The voices also told me Deutsch Bank today hit it's lowest price in history, a 98% loss. The Italian banks are on the edge of defaulting, when the weakness of the Italian banks hits the weakness of Deutsch Bank the cascading failures will be unstoppable. That's when TPTB will want you to have all your money in banks, stocks, and bonds. Ref. Cyprus.

Bitcoin is also pegged to gold. As the dollar approaches zero the price of btc approaches infinity in dollars, stays the same in gold.

Again, you're preaching to the choir. Until you convert the world to bitcoin I have to continue to work in it and get things done. I've pumped about $60K though my Shift card, that's $60K of bitcoin churn that would not have taken place had I not used the card. You should not discourage people from using Shift simply because we have not yet gotten to your utopia. If given the choice I would spend btc but until then this will have to do.

No, the fact that Bill Gross today, the second major money manager in as many weeks, recommended getting out of all asset classes and putting your money in gold. Gold, silver and btc are the 3 major safe places to go. Ref the youtube series on the ETF and you might not think I'm so paranoid.

I thought Tesla already accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:23:13
Once Fidelity offers it as part of their retirement savings package and Bakkt is offering it as an investment vehicle it's going to be difficult to make it illegal. I suppose they could say that owning it without a money transmitter license is illegal but it could be tough. Especially if you consider, as Max Kaiser says, that politicians can be bought and there are a lot of bitcoiners with a lot of money. Additionally, no politician wants to have their legacy be "the guy who killed innovation". The current head of the Finance Committee is firmly of that opinion. I believe that when btc is large enough to threaten the usd, the use will already be on the ropes and btc may be welcome.
@_date: 2019-07-23 02:16:25
I'm with McAfee, 1M in 2020. There's a lot going wrong in the financial world, everyone knows what's coming and the media isn't talking about it. For gold to double in price (which will happen and then some) it'd take $8T. That same $8T going into btc puts it at $470,000. But the money looking for a safe haven won't be just a few trillion. It will be, as the Cryptosniper says, "like stuffing Jupiter into a basketball". That's a perfect analogy for what I think is going to happen. Very few people realize how tiny the crypto market is but it can accommodate all the money in the world. For this to happen in the slightest degree puts the valuations at levels that today seem ridiculous. I got into crypto because I saw how difficult the internet was in the beginning and what it became. Same thing is happening with the financial world. I further believe the global financial system collapse has already started so yeah, things may happen faster and bigger than people are currently able to believe.

If I were a big money Wall Street type I'd buy massive amounts of btc that I could sell before I short in order to guarantee a win. In my mind the only question is whether this has already happened or not. I believe very large money is coming in.

If the ETF is approved there should be a huge infusion of cash, I've seen estimates of btc going to $3500. If people have expectations of it happening I would think the price would tend to be higher as we approach March 11th and a drop if it doesn't.

Allow me to answer for him. For the past year banks and financial institutions have been testing the blockchain for settlements and other functions. All these tests have been successful. In order for banks and countries to use btc for settlements they must first own btc. Today the market cap is 15billiion - that is less than Carl Icahn's share of Apple, it's less than Samsung's share write-down on the exploding Galaxy. I'm estimating that the minimal market cap needed for financial institutions to even partially use it is 10 times what it is now. That puts us at 10K per coin before individuals across the globe start to see it as an investment or storage mechanism. I'm of the opinion that the growth to 10K is slow compared to the explosion that will happen after it hits 10K which will catapult it to 100K or even over 1M. This is also not considering the massive devaluation/collapse of the dollar, if you factor that in you can add a couple zeroes.

Look at the volume compared to 2 and 3, coming from below they may be doing double the others soon. Their largest banks have now invested in bitflyer which will ultimately ease the flow from yen to btc and back. Additionally it's officially recognized as a currency.

@_date: 2015-01-24 05:29:22
Not likely I suspect. It will be a way for non tech savvy people to invest in bitcoin with minimal risk,  I would expect a lot of money sloshing around , especially if the economy gets scarier. I don't think many people are considering how big bitcoin will (not can) get. There is a certain inevitability to its widespread success, the timing of the bizarre dollar action, the tightened coil of gold and silver about to spring, the devaluation of all major currencies including the rising dollar (yes) , everything is in place for a usurpation of money as we know it. Whether the Winks can get an IPO may be another story but I hope they can and if they do I predict that it won't be a failure.

I think nearly everyone is radically underestimating Bitcoin’s upcoming roll in world finance.

 He claims that humankind is psychic and leaks its psychicness in the emotive value of its words. The bot enumerates the weighed value of the language and he makes predictions based on this. On the face of it it sounds ridiculous but it does seem to capture the worldwide sentiment toward bitcoin and to a lesser degree, the precious metals. A lot of the predictions that are claimed to be hits are vague or specious like "3 female heroes" or "rivers in the sky".

I don't think it will drop for long if the ETF fails, there's too much going for it right now. Japan, Nigeria, the imminent devaluation of the yuan, the US debt ceiling crisis next week that nobody seems aware of, and all the knock on effects from all of the above portend a continued rise in the value of bitcoin. However if it is approved the upside will be tremendous. Either way I believe your 2k number will be history long before the end of the year. The greatest downside risk to bitcoin is the inability to reach consensus on scaling and I think that will come together as pressure is applied over time.

The possibilities _are_ broad. My belief is that Trump will engender enough ill will that other countries will begin to avoid doing business wherever possible as Mexico is  already doing, and they will also begin to avoid using US dollars as Russia, Iran, and China are beginning to do. Given that over half the US currency is outside the country when it returns the dollars shrink (faster than they currently are) to the point that it could become hyperinflation. Even if those dollars don't return as I expect inflation has already started in the US. The Fed thinks they can dial inflation like a thermostat but it may behave like a tidal wave or a storm surge. No matter how you slice it the toothpaste is out of the tube. At the very best the dollar will continue to shrink at the rate it has been. Officially it's 0% but ask anybody who shops regularly at the grocery store and the dollar buys less than it did a year ago. Therefore even in the best case scenario you should hold your wealth, whether it's 20 dollars or 2 million dollars outside the US dollar system.

The fork may be The ETF rejection all over again. I'm hodling long term. In two years, five years, ten years, these bumps won't matter but bitcoin will be faster, more scalable and way more adopted. I'm in for the long haul, dollar cost averaging no matter what happens. 
Non-bank non-state currency is going to be bigger than nearly anybody is thinking, similar to what the Internet did to (too long to list here) - this will disrupt everything having to do with money in any form. I jumped into the Internet as fast as I could and I'm jumping out of fiat as fast as I reasonably can. We're on the cusp of a major change that will shake the world.

That's why a trezor or similar device is essential. Your passwords act as a 25th seed so you can have many accounts on the same device . During a wrench attack you unlock an account with a distracting amount of btc while you're main stash goes untouched.

Anyone who uses bitcoin to launder money or any other crime for that matter is an idiot. It's a ledger that lasts forever and can be viewed by anyone at any time. Even if you get away with it, it's still there years from now, the proof of your wrongdoing. Real money laundering is usually done by banks, they laundered over 6.5 timess the entire crypto market cap last year, this tidbit from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. If all money laundering and terrorist activities were done with bitcoin the world would be a better place.

Part of this process is shaking out the n00bs. Many people buy in and when the price goes down they sell - this is not a money-making strategy. As long as humans behave this way, entities that can swing the market will take advantage of it. At some point the weak hands are all shaken out and the price can go up again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

You must write down the seed, your memory turns to crap as you get older, I know. Write the seed down twice, very small on a sheet of paper, laminate it and cut out your seeds into two squares that should be about an inch square each. There are a zillion ways to hide these, one where you live, one at a relatives house in case yours burns down. Just look around the room you're in right now and think of all the places you can safely stash a flat one inch piece of paper. Under a floorboard, behind a mantle, inside a wall, in a light fixture, in the foot of a piece of furniture,inside a door ,you get the idea .You're relative wouldn't even have to know about it though that may be another discussion.

Seems like everyone knows it's coming. I've talked about it to an awful lot of people, not just cryptophiles, and nobody, even financial types, has argued that the dollar has a future of any kind. It's reigned as global reserve for a long time but the US has engendered so much ill-will around the world that I believe other countries will be happy to use other currencies, banks and payment systems wherever possible just to starve the beast that the military-industrial complex has created. And it will starve if they do that, those dollars will return in a tidal wave and we (the US) had better be prepared for it. If/when it does collapse it will affect nearly the entire world.

You're right, that was a terrible idea. Mycelium had had the simplest, most intuitive design but they seem to, whenever possible, throw scruples aside for a quick buck. The industry is begging for a phone wallet with a great interface that can handle multiple currencies whose owners and developers have a sense of morality as well as aesthetics. Mycelium, if you believe their web page, was intending to do just that until they had that share-buying ripoff that squandered the goodwill of their userbase. I'm not holding much hope they'll come around, they've given no indication they will, but the market is ripe for someone to step in and take it over.

IMHO China will be pro. There is a good chance that they, if not the US, will drag the entire financial system precipitously down possibly right after inauguration certainly by the end of the year.

In the US you're supposed to pay taxes on profits, or capital gains. You have to know what you've paid on average vs the value when you spent it. You'd want to talk to an accountant about long term vs short term capital gains taxes.

I work at an accounting firm and the owner, manager and chief financial advisor are all very concerned that we be prepared for the massive changes coming over the next few years - they're trying to learn as much as possible. IMHO we're at the beginning of a sea change from decaying fiat currencies with all their associated devaluations and manipulations to crypto based currencies that are impervious to such corruptions. This change is already underway and will result in a new class of wealth holders and a lot of luddites (like the doofus today who likened btc to tulips) being left behind.

You didn't mention India, which could be much bigger then people realize,  the ETF could happen any time, some banks that are more savvy than others are beginning to seriously use it for settlements. Also, the bond market appears to have a very serious problem which almost necessarily has to lead to economic contagion that the mass media will be the last to tell you about. All told its not beyond possibility that btc could be well into 5 digits next year. If you read Kurzweil: technologies are adopted with increasing rapidity, I'm of the belief that this is going to be bigger than imagined, sooner than imagined than anyone could hope for. We are in the midst of a perfect storm in waters we've never sailed. Get btc.

Old guy here too, no Fortran but I remember what I thought of the internet's potential in the early 90's and what it has become.

Happy to do so! I had been using Jaxx but it had too many issues with balances especially across devices. Coinomi was similar, I'd be missing entire coins. Atomic has a slight delay in balances but improves with every update. The interface is clean and efficient, no garbage, and a pleasure to use. You can tell that people are working on it and care about it, you folks should merge or create the interface for CoolWallet.

Yes. The stock market is a rigged barometer crucial to making the masses believe everything is great.

How long would it take to crack an 8 word brain wallet?
Oxford English Dictionary contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use.
If you use only lower case letters and they are mostly random words (no phrases - "four score and seven years ago" is like having your password be "secret"), there are about 7.47e41 possibilities.
At 50 million attempts per second, it'll be about 4.74e26 years.
The current estimate for the age of the universe is 1.2e12 years.
If you reduce it to just the most commonly used 1000 words, at 50m guesses a second, it's reduced to 634,195,839 years.

I believe Trezor has to generate the seed, that seed should never leave the trezor except for the light that hits your eyes. You could verify this with Wireshark or other sniffing tool or get someone to review the source code which has been done already and should be discoverable with a web search. You should have no problem using a legit trezor on a computer, there should be no need for doing anything offline. Other people are keeping 10's of thousands and probably millions in them. I only use offline tools when I'm not using a trezor.

Don't know where. There's a Twitter feed called whalecalls that tells you when contracts change, seems to be the best indicator I've seen in price direction. I made $200 on the last big drop,  I'm out $10 so far on this one.

Nobody but a bank will trust a banks coin, banks don't even trust banks. Concerning the network effect, not only does btc have more value the more it's used, like the telephone, fax, etc., but it has more literal value too. Sort of the traditional network effect squared.

We have a couple new driving forces, possible war with North Korea, and Mnuchin's threat to kick China out of the dollar. The former will be obvious in headlines, the latter will be an undermining of the US dollar by China and any other country that is tired of US military adventurism. There has been some progress on that front, witness the 10% decline in the purchasing power of the USD. It bumped up a bit this week but the trend is well established and not likely to be reversed. If so, btc and precious metals are the place to be, nevermind the   current drop, the long term trend is not only up but way up. I don't care how much btc drops, I'm holding for the long term.

That was very minor and I think unrelated to the btc drop. It's up a buck but still in the downward slide. In December it was 103 and now it's 92.45, if you've been holding cash through that period it's going to start to hurt. Though it rose against other currencies, they're all in a falling elevator car, one can be higher than the other but they're all falling.

Unless the penalty is death they're going to have a hard time stopping it, it could become a status thing to have means of transacting btc. It seems they haven't really considered the miners either, what are they supposed to do with all the btc they're mining? That could be the next domino to fall.

I'm conservative so I would spread it out more, especially since we're at an ATH at this moment. However you do it, commit to letting it cook even if the price drops. There's only been one one year period in the last eight where the price has gone down. If you think you might need the money at some point soon, don't put it in.

For the S curve, ref.  - different technologies have differing angle on the straight part, think how quickly smartphones were adopted after the cellphone had been around, I think it was about a year until a few people had them to everyone had them. There are charts on adoption rates, the television had a longer curve, the transistor, microwave ovens, flatscreen tvs, smartphones, btc, the straight part of the S curve goes increasingly closer to straight up. That's why I've been saying btc to $10K by the end of this year, it's driven by network effect, the more people that use it, like a phone, the more value it has. btc has the additional network effect of increasing literal value as it get's adopted thus increasing the adoption rate. I would think if we're near $10K by the end of this year, in two years we'd be at at least 50-100. I believe that's why McAfee made his ridiculous bet to the world, he claims it will be 500K in 3 years because he did the math and it actually came out to $2.4M in 3 years.

When I said $2000 in April people said that was far-fetched and I nailed it to the dollar. Whomever had started the thread contacted me to remind me that I had been right though I forgot about it in the meantime. There's a Japanese chartist on Youtube who goes by the name Bitcoin Geekend, his ideas are often out of the box and always worth considering. He suggests theres a link between Google Trends (bitcoin) and the price of bitcoin. If you marry the two charts together they do go in near tandem though its hard to see if its correlation or causation. Anyway the point is that the adoption of new technologies follows an S curve, reference that because it's not exactly an S. The speed with which btc is going to have serious impacts is going to be much faster and more dramatic than most prople are thinking. When making predictions with cryptos, especially bitcoin, it's best to err on the side of ridiculous.

IIRC all the money in the world would put btc at about 5-10M. I believe the smartest money is getting out already. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:35:20
Then the solution should be distributed. Problem there is that if you handed out btc addresses the people would have to know what to do with them
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:01:00
Smart of them to not allow comments.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:28:12
That would feel weird but could get the job done. If people knew for sure it was getting distributed and not enriching one guy I think the amount you received would be shocking.

Life in a citadel. Seriously, BTC could easily hit 100K this year so life won't be very different. As time goes on it will be easier to jump in and out of different cryptos on the fly on an as-needed basis. Today we are to a crypto saturated world as Gopher was to the internet years ago. When everybody's grandma can easily use crypto, possibly without knowing it, we will have arrived.

No, so your question is excellent. They're all dressed up with nowhere to go. The specifics of the exchange shutdowns are gray, I saw somewhere that they may be able to operated if they meet certain regulatory requirements but I'm not sure what to believe.

I don't think it can go down to $2500 unless the US deems it illegal. There's a lot of hot money itching to get in. Despite China you have Kenya, Nigeria, Japan, investor interest, bitcache, and a non-stop slow-motion US dollar crash. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:04:38
All the downsides you name for gold are upsides for btc. Tested PMs will be accepted anywhere, any century and hold their value for millenia but are cumbersome for transactions.  If you hold both you have the best of both worlds, the ancient and the new. Both are beyond the ability of banks and governments to ruin.

Larger forces are at work. I believe people have given up pinning their hopes on ETF's, the Winklevoss rejection dropped the price for a very short time and recovered very quickly. Currently Nigerian adoption, Japanese interest and global economic jitters are , IMHO, what the main price drivers are today. All markets except for Crypto are manipulated, people are becoming more aware of this as time goes on and are starting to seek safe havens. BTC is the canary in the coal mine of safe havens i.e. btc will jump in price way before silver and gold due to the comparatively small amount of market cap as well as the extreme thinness of liquid btc. If I'm right, not only will all 3 assets go up, btc will go up higher and faster than most reasonable people are expecting. I guesstimated months ago that btc could hit $10K USD by the end of this year and given recent financial shocks I'm sticking to that claim. I expect we'll hit new records this weekend if not today.

The difference between 32 billion  and 160 billion is not that large in financial investments terms. 128B could come in very quickly especially if investors need a liquid save haven.  Consider that 2 Trillion dollar dow moves are currently expected, the investment in gold is 7 Trillion, the global bonds market is 82 Trillion,any pieces of this can swing into bitcoin any time especially if there are dollar problems which we are now starting to see. I'm only thinking of smart money getting out, what if there is a full blown financial panic? People on Reddit earlier this year were wistfully speculating whether btc could hit $2000 this year, I said 10. 128B is less than a fifth of Apples market share. We are not thinking big enough.

When you set up the Trezor you have the option of using passwords, you will want to do this. That way if it's lost or stolen you have time to restore the seed backup into another device or software.

Many strong hands keep btc liquidity thin. I would not think 10K by the end of the year should be considered a bubble. We will have sharp rises and falls due to the thinness, 10K is when btc starts to take off.

Bitcoin could remain slow and clunky and still go to millions per. Ether can run circles around it but btc is the father of all cryptos and may serve as a new form of central bank. I wouldn't mind holding wealth there forever no matter how slow and expensive it gets and using more appropriate cryptos for everyday expenses.

Multipool mining, How many blocks are needed before a generation transaction is released?, Merged Mining, Mining Pools, Scrypt, Premine, Greenlisting, lock time, Generation transaction - all seem beyond intermediate to me. I believe your expectation of what is intermediate and what is advanced is where your disconnect with the scores is. You could possibly delineate that a bit by asking a few questions about the user as to where they think they are and/or how long they've been involved with bitcoin.

For the first time provable trust is introduced to the internet.  The ability to transact in a measurable unit that can't be co-opted by banks or governments or perverted in any way and has a fixed predictable supply is where it gets it's value. The burning of electricity to create them is by design. Given the above, bitcoin has great desirability as the first true international currency as well as extending banking type services to the two thirds of the world whom don't have access to these services. Bitcoin is going to do to the financial system what the internet did to:
The music industry,
The newspaper industry,
The television industry,
The travel agency industry,
The Stock brokerage industry,
The porn industry,
Brick and mortar stores,
Being lost,
Blockbuster, Borders, Circuit City, the Tribune, Musicland, record stores.

@_date: 2017-05-24 02:48:47
If you look at a dollar chart it's been in steady decline most of this year. Some factors which may not be the cause of this but are piling on: Trump stated he wants the dollar lower, more countries doing business in non-US currency, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the petrodollar hegemony is beginning its decline (IMO this may be the main reason) , global fears of fiat collapse are getting stronger, growing awareness in foreign countries that usage of the USD allows the US to export its inflation and subsidize the war machine. Any country that is getting tired of the US bullying it's way around the globe can simply walk away from the dollar and starve the beast. If the decline continues it could easily turn into a panic in which case Cryptos, gold and silver will explode beyond your wildest imaginings. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:08:45
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:02:03
Currently Nigerian adoption, Japanese interest and global economic jitters are , IMHO, what the main price drivers are today. All markets except for Crypto are manipulated, people are becoming more aware of this as time goes on and are starting to seek safe havens. BTC is the canary in the coal mine of safe havens i.e. btc will jump in price way before silver and gold due to the comparatively small amount of market cap as well as the extreme thinness of liquid btc. If I'm right, not only will all 3 assets go up, btc will go up higher and faster than most reasonable people are expecting. I guesstimated months ago that btc could hit $10K USD by the end of this year and given recent financial shocks I'm sticking to that claim. Longer term as fiat currencies crumble around the world the aforementioned assets will take on a larger role. BTC could easily hit between 1 and 3 million per depending on the degree to which other cryptos are able to supplant it.

$10,000 by 12/31/17. 
The difference between a market cap of 32 billion and 160 billion is not that large in financial investments terms. 128B could come in very quickly especially if investors need a liquid safe haven. Consider that 2 Trillion dollar dow moves are currently expected, the investment in gold is 7 Trillion, the global bonds market is 82 Trillion, any pieces of this can swing into bitcoin any time especially if there are dollar problems which we are now starting to see. I'm only thinking of smart money getting out, what if there is a full blown financial panic? People on Reddit earlier this year were wistfully speculating whether btc could hit $2000 this year, I said 10. 128B is less than a fifth of Apples market share. We are not thinking big enough.

I've been doing this for a few years but I've been cashing them out and taking the coin when they want it.

We're not agreeing on much, btc is not the enemy of silver though you could say they compete for the same dollars. I see it as a precursor to silver.

So far you are correct. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:12:10
From what I understand it couldn't happen all over the earth  at the same time in which case btc would be fine as long as one copy of the blockchain survived. A question you must ask at the same time is what will happen to fiat currencies in the same flare? 9/10ths of USDs are digital.

I still have it, several downsides - you can't see the balance, you have to email them to find it out, no list of purchase transactions, 6 digit pin makes the card fail in half the places you use it,  the only way to zero out the card is with an atm which is nearly impossible with an odd amount. I was stunned that there's no way to check your balance, poorly thought out.

There isn't an address associated with the card, another flaw. To use the card you have to dump bitcoin into it, they don't remain as bitcoin til you spend them like you'd hope they would

A bitcoin transaction is irreversible, part of it's charm. Nearly everything else is reversible. Especially Paypal.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:57:19
Given the oceans  of money purported to be on the sidelines I think this run will be faster and higher than anyone is anticipating. As soon as it's evident that the low is in, and I think we're there, we could see $10,000 days.

Today it would take a 1.6 Trillion market cap to hit 100k, roughly all the US money in circulation. Theoretically if the dollar collapsed it could go much higher.

There will be some wealth inequality but at least the wealth is going to those that took a huge chance on a new technology as opposed to the current inequality based on what family you were born into. Being born wealthy is a better indicator of adult success in the U.S.  than academic performance, a recent Georgetown study found. (via [~~

Technically it may be the strongest but since Jan. 1 it's been steadily weakening. The Sterling and Franc could easily outlive it.

Amazon wants to be the store of the internet, they should accept the currency of the internet. They own the domain names, they could actually combine cryptos into their cc and purchasing options, I assume they're dragging their feet due to support needs?

Any time there's a steep rise a bunch of people will take some profit. At some point it will be obvious to enough people where this is going that that dynamic may skew toward hodling. If so, as the price goes higher if should go higher faster. Lay men call this a bubble, I call it Pre-early adopter phase.
