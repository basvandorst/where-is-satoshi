Ultimate bitcoin security involves blacklisting the driver for the network card in your offline laptop where your offline wallet lives.  That machine should never touch the internet EVER.  Then use ANY online machine to broadcast the transaction as no security is required to do that.

I really tried to like this album when listening on YouTube, but it's just not working for me.  I'd love to support him since he's accepting bitcoin, but the market is the market.  Regardless of my tastes, I hope it's successful!

OLPC was a noble goal, but I think it was a bit before its time.  Cellular infrastructure has made internet access a possibility for many people in impoverished areas, and Keepod is a way for them to be able to carry all their information with them to whatever internet-connected terminal they can find.  I think it's brilliant to use old laptops to fuel this cause.

When you receive almost anything worth money, it counts as income in the IRS's view.  Otherwise, people would just barter to avoid tax.

I made an app and some python scripts that allow one to use Armory offline without moving transaction content back and forth with USB keys.  This makes it so you can have an offline wallet in Armory that never touches networks or removable media after setup.
Google Play submission is happening soon.

If you're worried about a gun to the head, buy a gun and learn how to use it.  If you cohabitate, buy as many guns as you have adults in your household and teach everyone how to use them.

A sufficiently small pool (say &lt;10TH/s right now) will take months to find a block at 50% CDF.  It may NEVER find a block during its operating period, meaning all miners mining there would suffer a complete and total loss.  I agree that a sufficiently large pool (5% or so of the total hashrate) is just as good as a 30-40% pool over the course of several weeks.

Oh I see segregation is the answer.  Sorry I polluted this post with my enthusiasm about the topic (Keepod).  I'll be sure to censor myself from now on when commenting in threads in - thanks for the tip!

RE: adding LTC to each wallet, any ideas people have for that would help.  There are a few different ways this could be done, but ideally we'd be able to load wallets once they're used for the first time.  The ultimate experience would be opening the wallet app on your Keepod, then a few seconds later seeing money flow into it.  Also, we wouldn't be shelving a bunch of LTC during manufacturing, and we wouldn't need a custom image for each key.  Perhaps if each Keepod has an ID, I can use that as a one-time-use token (as long as I can get a list of which ones shipped) for LTC.  A simple server could initiate the transaction when the app starts the first time.
Of course, this presents the problem of fraud - someone could predict the IDs and steal the money.  hmm...

Find several people you trust (N) and choose how many of them would have to get together to reconstruct your wallet (M), and do an M-of-N fragmented backup with armory:
This way, if you die, they can reconstruct the private key chain from the fragmented backups, even if not all of the fragments can be found (only need M of them).

Call it "international digital currency" rather than "virtual currency".  I want more people to highlight the fact that we're abusing national currencies as international ones now, giving certain countries complete power over international commerce as a result.

While I would enjoy if Ron Paul got behind bitcoin, I don't think it would "make it more mainstream."  It already has good backing from the libertarian crowd, so getting Paul on board wouldn't necessarily get Bitcoin more followers.  It would, however, give anti-bitcoin bloggers another straw man to tear down (eg. Paul hates gays, Paul loves bitcoin, Bitcoin hates gays).  I'm not against him affiliating with it, and I don't agree with the arguments of the Left against Paul generally, but for it to be mainstream it would have to get support from someone surprising.

Not that it's necessarily the greatest idea, but with the Android wallet you can choose to immediately put the backup in Google Drive.  Litecoin wallet has this same feature, and it works well.  Just make sure you use a good unique password for the backup.

Um I don't see Andreas Schildbach in here yet - I would definitely not be opposed to him putting Bitcoin wallet on Keepod.  I guess I'll generalize too and say whenever someone mentions an altcoin in a bitcoin discussion somebody gets upset for no apparent reason... are you saying there should be no altcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:31:31
I'm a miner and I didn't assume mined coins were not income.  Nothing else works like that.  I paid my 2012 taxes that way and now I don't have to change them.  Remove "all miners" from your post because this is certainly not the case.

Claiming that bitcoin is bad because it's used by "priviliged" people first is silly, as that is true of **every technology improvement ever.**  Did they diss the iPhone because poor people didn't have one before rich people?  What about the flatscreen TV?  What about the computer?  Just because innovation, and very risky innovation at that, is adopted by people with money doesn't mean it's not going to improve the lives of the poor 2, 5 or 10 years later.  Only rich people had internet to start with, and now any kid can go to the library and use it for free.  This is how the world works.

OMFG just read some of your other little comments about how "altcoin trolls ruin everything" - this is total trolling in itself.  Brilliant baiting.  This is my stop.

They responded answering all my questions, and their answers were very positive regarding the possibility of internet access.  Obviously, cryptocurrency won't work very well if you can't sync the blockchain.  I've asked for an image so I can get started, and hopefully there will be at least one wallet on there by launch date.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:20:39
I'm the lead developer of the Android Litecoin Wallet, and I'll get in touch with them to see if we can include the wallet and some small amount of LTC on each one :).
EDIT: For those of you who are concerned that I'm just promoting Litecoin here, I'd be happy to drop Andreas' Bitcoin app on there as well while I'm at it (of course, it would have to be the unsigned version).  I suggest contacting Schildbach himself to see if he could add the app - once I get the development kit I'll probably email him myself and let him know how to get started if he's interested.

Um it adjusts to make it linear, and has lasted through GPU and ASIC speedups, still remaining close to linear.  I think we'll be dead before bitcoin is completely mined.

Emailed.  We'll see if I get a response!
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:21:12
Well, time will tell.  Thanks for bringing it up.  I'll have to use it for a while and see when that becomes a problem - it probably will.  Perhaps I could split it up intelligently somehow such that one would scan several QR codes and the app would put them together.  I could encode the content such that you'd get kicked back to scanning every time there was no end marker found.
Feel free to improve the code if you figure out a way around this!
