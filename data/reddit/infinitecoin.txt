The big thing is... Most of these "risks" are not risks at all. They all are far better than their comparative risk in current fiat currencies.

I stopped taking that horrible little article seriously when it implied that a group of people would want to band together and crash Bitcoin with 51%... The amount of money a group would have to invest in BTC mining equipment, and then to just go ahead and crash the currency... Makes NO sense.

What you say would make sense if BTC was a fully matured currency; it is not. Spending extra money on something like this is an investment. As companies see that there is a legitimate market for BTC, more places will begin accepting it. By spending money in BTC you are essentially making a statement that Bitcoin is a largely untapped market and a supperior form of currency. Essentially, by spending BTC, you are supporting a revolution. That revolution could see your BTC increase dramatically in value. It is an investment.

Just realized you also have to wait 30 days from your first purchase to buy over 0.1 coins... That is stupid....

Exactly... At the moment Coinbase is doing horribly with customer service and providing a service at all.
