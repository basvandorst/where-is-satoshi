Hard to believe that it will all but replace those. Those systems of transfer (middlemen) will always serve a purpose.. Well at least for the near future. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm a believer.

Asked Blendle about accepting Bitcoin, here was their response: 
Hello ---,
Thanks for reaching out! At the moment we don't offer bitcoin but it's definitely something we would consider if enough people ask us. Of course you are not the first one to ask! We will continue to monitor the amount of requests we get and will seriously consider adding it as a payment option!

Yes, Still a viable option. 
They were bought up by Coinsetter a few months ago. 
I do however find their fees a bit steep compared to other exchanges in Canada.

Can't really comment on their Rep. Never used them . I'm personally with Quad. and haven't had any problems with them.

You can try Paxful. How quickly do you need it?

Would love to order some bars as well. Did he mention anything about adding a bitcoin payment method on the site?

Has Greece adopted bitcoin yet??

Is this a competitor to the XRP network? Trying to replicate the ripple payment gateway system? Just putting this out there to see if someone can confirm.

Is this what you're looking for? 
@_date: 2016-05-31 08:03:01
Yes. 
Their volume looks decent. A little higher than Gemini.

I've used Coincheck for about 6 months. From my own experience, they are reliable. Had one issue with a fiat transfer and it was dealt with in an hour.  
But then again, Like says, you are handing over your private keys to a custodian service.
