All I'm saying is it's mattered little in history if you have all the tanks and troops in the world. What's mattered is paying for them. Napoleon had to requisition troops' supplies from where they marched, while England was able to muster his defeat via deeper pockets. Financiers don't GAF about tanks. Money rules the world, not bullets.

Soooooo you don’t think the guy with advanced degrees from amazing schools and a firm understanding of the tech (and who writes technically relevant yet still “available to the layman” books about it)...has considered the tech.

Or perhaps without an entrenched system of legalized counterfeiters that buy up assets for pennies on the dollar with every “business cycle” they manipulate....
We just won’t fucking need them.��

It’s implausible in the sense that it’s bleeding edge and I’m not worried about nation state level actors coming after my piss poor stack of coin.
If I were a whale I’d be worried. But nah. I mean I’d heard of the exploit, but I’m small fry, relatively.

This isn't Enron. That's apples to oranges. This has utility. The very fact that it's an impossible-to-defraud ledger system pretty much makes it the diametric opposite of Enron, so well played.
That said, it's sad to see people that don't have any faith in the tech mad over money. If you invested more than you could lose, meh. Sucks. We're all down today. Tomorrow, who knows?
We're balls deep in bear country, but you never know what's coming down the chute. I've seen bitcoin do nothing but make fools of "experts" since I spent my first 20 bucks on it.

No. I'm seeing the dis-coupling of ETH from BTC.
It's been really apparent of late.
