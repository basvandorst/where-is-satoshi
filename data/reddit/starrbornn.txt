 I find it’s better to do a bunch of smaller sells. A percentage at $20k, another percent at 20100, another at 20200. You get the idea.

Bought a Hyundai Accent a few years back for 75 Bitcoins. I made good profit on those coins at the time and I decided to purchase my first car. Fast forward a few years and I now purchased the most expensive Hyundai Accent in the world at well over 1.2 million dollars. The fact is spending Bitcoins is what makes the community grow. If no one ever spent we would never be where we are today. None of this changes the fact that I still want to physically harm myself every-time I sit down in my 80 horsepower Accent thinking I could be revving up my 700HP Aventador, but it makes me feel like I did my part.

Safe from what? Are you worried you will get your money? or are you worried about the IRS contacting you. The answer is yes to both.

The IRS doesn't care about losers

That’s not the lesson, the lesson is not to sell when you’re losing like a moron. Seriously. If you’re down, hold until you’re up. Is it that hard?

Sick gains you 100% know what you’re doing. Next step is to go on Facebook and give all of your friends investment advice.

Download the gyft, and egifter app.
You will surely find a gift card you can purchase for food. Was at the airport just yesterday and did the exact same thing(minus losing my wallet).
EDIT: Egifter let's you choose the exact amount for some retailers, so you wouldn't have any funds left on the card.

I just attempted to take a Lyft by purchasing a card through Gyft as I always do.
I was EXTREMELY upset to find out they no longer have the cards.
They need some sort of mailing list that notifies of no longer carried cards.

Damn. Contact them and hopefully they credit you with the coins for the Nov24th price and you can sell for profit. Goodluck!
