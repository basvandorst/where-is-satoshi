Yes, which incurs the transaction fee.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:01:54
Im not sure what you're suggesting. Im saying mining rewards indicate a good floor. And that stocks tend to trade on multiples of it's P/E or P/B so hitting that floor is unlikely. Neither is a great metric for crypto obviously but we have to work with what we've got.

It was just on here. I tried to find a LN subreddit, but all the discussion was happening here. I started getting more active on but Bitcoin/LN discussions didn't get much traction there. I've actually had at least one of my posts on here muted for some reason. Nothing of note, but someone dug through my history, screencapped it and made fun of me.

I agree the altcoin space is oversaturated with trash, but that's gonna happen: People get that way around free money. For collaboration, not everyone works well with others. We've seen that with the core/cash split. Bitcoins currently expensive and slow, mayne will stick around for the first mover and branding, but not everyone. Lots of people like to create new things without being constrained by legacy code, so we get ETH and attempts at going  blockchain free.
Disruptive tech disrupting tech... It's the wild west right now.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:29:18
Same here, though since my last banning I've found good places to talk about Bitcoin (More tech, less memes, mods have much lighter touch, can talk about the sector outside of Bitcoin). I can totally see why was created. Shame it's now landed as a sneaky misbranding, but we know how we got here.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:05:32
Perhaps. But I can see why someone would prefer the 'old way' on a different blockchain. As it stands right now it's new, untested tech with a steep learning curve and high cost. It's not people like me we have to convince. I like bleeding edge tech. LN has to be at least as easy or easier than the standard way of accepting crypto for merchants or payment processors to get on board. Time will tell
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:07:05
Learning curve, alternatives, security concerns (untested), cost (As far as implementation, channel security) is concerned. Those are just off the top of my head. I think it's dangerous to assume LN adoption is a given.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:24:38


No shit, I've been saying that for ages. Even Dogecoin is better than BCH. So's LTC. So's ETH. Please don't take my rational discussion of why I'm not accepting that LN is 18k times cheaper than BCH as support for BCH. Because it most certainly is not.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:17:49
No offense, but this assumes LN is fully, and completely adopted. Not just by vendors that accept bitcoin now, but actual LN adoption. We're way more than a year out from that. I personally wont mind leaving a couple hundred bucks on a channel long term, but the moment a counterparty shuts down their end I take the transaction hit.
I also think by the time were at that point, adoption of crypto will have increased enough to fill up the cheaper blockspace (The old induced demand problem we're trying to solve without increasing block size).
Gotta have a truthful discussion on this. Im not a fan of BCH, but I'm not going to support misleading info because 'fuck those guys'.

@_date: 2018-01-19 08:13:56
Yes. Mostly because a BTC fork got to keep the same BTC whales with BTC adoption. Everything Roger Ver wanted was done already in LTC/ DOGE, but he needed that easy transition. That's why BCH has more volume than the others. If Coinbase added Doge tomorrow BCH would tank.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:37:14
tbh I was muted on for the last 3 weeks so I stopped testing LN (Couldn't communicate in threads so not worth it). I have relayed some thoughts to a couple different teams on slack. It was a few weeks ago so Im not sure who I spoke with on what team. I was testing both the 'faucet to LN' tutorial, the Electrum wallet one, and another one that worked with the core-qt testnet chain. I suspect my issue on acinq was port forwarding (my end), but after I was muted I shut it down.

Man, it's crazy how you can write such a well reasoned reply on one hand, and go for such low-brow personal attacks on the other. On the latter I'll just leave it that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but Im a good contributing member of society regardless what pepole may think of my hobbies.
But I appreciate this write up so much that and I'll reply. To be honest we're on the same page with most of it. Full disclosure: I have run lightning a number of different ways on the testnet, set up a node, bought blockachinos and articles using Electurm, the qt-testnet on windows (via eclair), and the Eclair acinq testnet wallet on Android. I've also posted a couple of issues to one of the dev teams on slack. Short version is I'm far from an expert but Im not coming into this with no knowledge about LN. And Im not a 'bcash shill' as is often suggested. I don't like BCH (&lt;2% of my portfolio). I hate that I have to mention that but as this is haw many of the conversations are going I wanted to clear the air; I want LN to succeed but I've got concerns.
1+2  Yes I understand that LN works like a meshnet and I dont need a direct connection to whom I want to pay. And I also know I can get 'recharged' on LN, but as I currently do not earn BTC on mainnet or the LN network, I have to recharge directly, so thats where I would take the re-occuring financial hit.
Fully agree that *Bitcoin* in it's current form needs a 2nd tier solution. The bcash bandaid is short sighted, and if that's all Ver et al really wanted they could have co-opted a better coin like LTC or Doge.
What will the fees be on mainnet after lightning? Impossible to estimate. If I were to take a guess, block size will remain low as long as possible. Assuming current adoption levels I would be shocked if the fees are smaller this time next year if the block size stays where it is, regardless of LN adoption. 
Anecdotally I've been in tech long enough to see the unseatable, unseated, including when it's the technically better technology.

@_date: 2018-01-19 04:37:36
Eh, Bitcoin will win that 10/10 times. It's the most adopted so has the most nodes. Take adoption out of the metrics and Doge/LTC start catching up due to speed boosts on confirmation times, and transaction cost (which you missed but matters to most people transacting in it).
I don't think we'll ever convince each other to change our minds, you appear to be all-in on BTC and LN. I prefer to hedge my bets.

2 year old account, lots of posting in Bitcoin and other crypto subs, 80K+ positive comment karma, actively playing on the LN testnet... Not a troll, but gotta be honest with the conversation - The OP's assertion doesn't account for loading and closing a channel (The latter which can be triggered by the counterparty).
Your scenario assumes *full adoption*, ignores the cost to open the channel, and assumes I never close a channel. Im pro bitcoin and excited for LN, but I desire honesty in a discussion.

Traders, in equities, often hold a cash position. There's no such thing in crypto right now. Sure Bitcoin is the big daddy, but it's not stable. Fiat, though inflationary, is only slightly so. And realistically if you're getting out of the market for a while you'll probably convert to bonds or equivalents; Anything deemed safe and low risk. Tether on it's face fits that bill. I *personally* don't trust tether the asset, but if it was everything it purports to be; Pegged to the USD, I'd be holding a decent cash position there for a while.

Well ya. "Only" as its relative to supply.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:50:22
How do you figure? Lets say we spend $5 to to open and $5 to close a transaction (Current cheap rate to confirm inside of 3 days). $10 total, no further fees charged.
bcash is an *average* of .40 per transaction (Should be less, but people are idiots that down know how to customize fees). $10 / $0.40 is 25... So in the current environment it looks like we need to do 25 transactions between open and close to beat bcash. And I'm being generous here.

And I have done. "Bought" me plenty of blockachinos and 'articles'. Opened a channel (though wasn't able to get my node onto acinq yet). Id love to know how many people in this thread have even taken it that far. Short version is, Im actively checking out LN and will say again: It's not ready for mainstream yet. No merchants accept it. No payment processors accept it. LN hasn't had "big target" money on it to attract national level threats yet (BTC has). I spoke with an infosec pro that had some very specific concerns with certain attack vectors (Way out of my league but he seemed knowledgeable enough for me to take it under consideration).

@_date: 2018-01-19 07:28:12
Well that's a chicken and the egg thing. "Cant ever be popular because its not popular". Doge, LTC (And all other coins) get the huge advantage they get to look at BTC as a testnet. That's literally the LTC game plan. So like in F1 racing, if the leader makes a mistake there is room to schoot ahead. No-one is poised for that *now*, but it could happen. And lets be honest, if coinbase added doge... It would jump a few spots to at least compete with LTC
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:48:49
This is truly the best way to evaluate the 'true' price right now. And before you pleasant gentlemen start smashing that downvote button or ban me again, remember that equities for the most part trade above book value, specifically seen in the P/E ratio.
"But Kooriki you furry fuck, Bitcoin doesn't generate revenue, you can't calculate that!" 
True, but the P/E ratio is more a gauge of market sentiment. And even though we cannot calculate P/E, we can assume Bitcoin will trade higher than it's 'Book value' because people expect it to be 'worth' more later.
In the real world though the price is almost totally driving by speculation, and the only real anchor we have is to see what it costs to support the system (mining). And while Im here stop looking at market cap.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:18:02
Im not 100% sure of the settlement as it relates to fees, but I believe that's built into the original transaction when it's set up kind of like a smart contract. Don't take my word for it I've just bought blockachinos.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:39:38
We're gonna be low and slow for a while. Media (and public) we pummeled with Bitcoin news for months, so now it's going to be a long breather until a major development happens or another random price breakout.
Because everyone loves a good ~~guess~~, technical analysis:
6 months: $8k-$11k
12 months: $9k-$12k
24-48 months: $20k-$40k
This assumes true LN adoption and no show-stopper hacks. If LN turns out to be DOA for adoption from merchants, BTC flatlines sub $9k.

Na, you can hedge one thing versus another. Say you're not sure how graphics card companies are going to do next quarter, but you're certain no matter what happens, nVidia will do better than AMD. You can buy nVidia and short AMD. Even if the market goes down you can make money by playing the two major players against each other. This is one way to make money in a bear market. Or the way I do it is I think Bitcoin will come out on top, but there's a chance that might not happen, so I also have some ETH just in case.

You don't need to load the full blockchain if I recall correctly. In bitcoin-qt, click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right), and select the 'console' tab. If you had a password on it type:
    walletpassphrase (your password) 600
This will allow you to access your private keys for the next 600 seconds. Now to get all the public addresses which have received funds, type
    listreceivedbyaddress
That will give you a list of all addresses that have received funds. Now, for each public address run this command:
    dumpprivkey (your public address)
This will give you the private key for each address. I'm sure it goes without saying that you should be careful doing this. I would personally disconnect form the internet and make sure you're in a private location. Do not save these private keys in a plain text file. You would be wise to sweep the coins directly to a new address. I personally used Electrum wallet.

By a lot you mean the Bitcoin transaction fee to fund and close it? Or do you mean funding the channel? (Which is returned when you close the channel, plus any fees you've earned).
My BTC is sitting in cold storage right now. I don't mind 'lending' some of those funds to a channel to generate a little passive 'interest'. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:33:09
I'm really not the guy to explain that as I don't fully understand it myself. The idea is if you just want to sell your thing without risk, someone else will probably take on that risk for a small fee.

No real answers yet. It already happened once in November, they called it 'The flippening'. The miners switched to Bcash leaving less miners to mine blocks at a high difficulty. Transactions got backed up because it took longer than 10 min/block to confirm. After difficulty reset (few days later), it because much easier to mine, so blocks were mined at 10 min or less for the next little while, and all the miners came back to BTC. This is why bcash has their difficult adjustment set to change much faster; To account for this fight. The "profitability" is what causes this jump back and forth, but it has stabilized for the most part.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:31:41
Putting in a little every week is good as it 'dollar cost averages' your total holdings. There's also the school of thought that 'time **in** beats tim**ing**'. Personally I think the latter only applies to people trying to time entry and exit points.
If Bitcoin interests you, go in a little at a time to a level you are comfortable with. Even if it goes up forever you wont miss out on much for playing the game a little smarter. Plus with DCA you automatically buy in some dips.

"You can just rebroadcast an old transaction". Neglects to mention what happens when you get caught. Draws a BIG FUCKING CIRCLE FOR A HUB, neglecting that you can pick your route. CENTRALIZED! Neglecting that's the BCH roadmap for eventual block chain verification. "They're gonna charge fees!", don't mention that for a low fee you can license ASICBoost on the BitcoinCash chain [here](

If merchants accepted more coins, then that solves itself. LTC / BCH, even ETH are seeing increased adoption. I'd totally consider those as alternatives while fees are high. And if any coin ever solves scale-ability, people can move (back?).
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:46:33
Has potential, adoption is the question mark. Ill tell you this though, when nerds that are not on the dev team start playing and getting excited with the alpha/beta versions, that's been a sign for me that the idea is going to take off.

If you are worried about what to buy, don't want to miss the boat, find you're trading emotionally etc. Diversify. In the stock market there are products called ExchangeTradedFunds. It's a lot like a mutual fund, but instead of having a manager, they just follow the market. I own $SPY for example - Follows the American S&amp;P market. Short version is, don't go all in on one and try to beat the market. A lot of people in here think of buying a coin as a zero-sum game. IE: If someone new comes in and buys BCH instead of BTC, the BTC holder loses. 
So buy both. If the market goes up, so do you.
SO how to balance? Taking the top coins on the market you can balance like I have below. If you don't like a coin, buy less or skip it entirely. If you have a good feeling on one, add more to your position. As the market shifts every couple months, re-balance. The only way to lose is if the whole market loses. Im not a professional but I've done well in the market as a passive investor in equities. I've beat the (equities) market by a bit using a similar strategy as a foundation. The most important thing is the markets don't keep me awake at night; This strategy takes the panic out of it. Today I saw Bitcoin drop and BCH climb, and I'm not far off of where I started this morning. Considering I'm heavily weighted in BTC, I'm pretty sure I've come out a little less scratched than most.
Feel free to throw my advice in the trash, but if you're finding yourself stressing out checking prices ever 10 minutes, this is a good step to alleviating that stress. And the more tolerance you have for risk, the more you can deviate from the plan.
(These numbers are old, from this morning) 
60% BTC
16% ETH
9% BCH
9% Ripple
6% LTC

It's a red herring. It may affect the price by scaring Bitcoiners, but of all the actual things to worry about, this isnt one of them.
It's not settled in Bitcoin, it's settled in cash equivalents. In other words, these people are not buying Bitcoins themselves, they are gambling on what Bitcoin might do with USD.
Futures is zero sum. Gotta have a bull for every bear as fast as I can tell.
Futures will be good to get a feeling what institutional day traders think.
If you want a real fear: Bitcoins price can still be HEAVILY manipulated. It's not hard to conceive someone may make a big play on the futures market, then come over to the actual bitcoin exchanges and start wreaking havoc. Not sure if Wall St has regulations for that.

@_date: 2017-12-17 06:30:22
Personal opinion:
People are more stoked on Lightning. Segwit was just one of those things people thought "Eh, I'll check it out eventually". It didn't 'feel' like it reduced fees enough to be worth risking some new tech. Of course it turns out segwit is easy and doesn't limit you at all, but it's just one of those things that was like the dentist telling you to floss. "Yeah yeah, I will".
Lightning... It's different. I don't think it will replace the way people are used to, but some people, the techy people, will run with it, and will love it. It will eventually bleed over into the more casual user once it's simpler to explain, better understood, bugs and beta-tester-tier problems are smoothed.
The hard truth: I don't think lightning will beat Credit cards etc unless they prove viable for microtransations. I also don't think the more 'casual' user will adopt a 2nd layer solution like Lightning if an altcoin like LTC, BCH etc just works the 'good old way we like'.
Bitcoin is somewhere in the [early majority]( of adoption in my opinion. Lightning will be in that 2.5% for some time. I've tried once to set up a lightning node and failed. Ill be trying again tomorrow hopefully with a different method. Most people don't have patience with proof of concept tech so... The early adopter gets the channel.

Not to be elitist, but a large percentage of the user base now don't keep up with the tech, and are actually resistant to try new things. I see this all the time in my job; A few people are willing to try things in buggy early stages, and eventually that turns into effectively forcing the last bunch to use it.  This is the price we pay for new users and adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:57:27
To be expected. In Canada there are already lots of checks and verification before an exchange will sell to you. More still if you want to convert back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:36:19
ASIC miners are tiny people entering math contests, the winner of that round takes coins from everyone then evenly distributes it amongst the users. The transaction fee is what users pay to get a front row seat where more money lands. Exchanges are where you go to buy wallets and you need to have a bit wallet otherwise all your coins wont fit in there.

Guy below me missed the key point: Bitcoin as it stands will still exist, and the miners will still collect fees like they are now. Lightning is a 2nd tier solution, so instant spends are 'off ledger'. (Think of when you buy and sell on Coinbase, each one of those transactions isn't logged onto the blockchain. It's only when you deposti or withdraw you get the hit. Whatever you do on Coinbase in the meantime is not hitting the mempool. Lightning works the same way, but instead of a 3rd party like Coinbase, it's decentralized and trustless. (Because we've all learned not to trust exchanges by now... Right ? :)

Having ridden one bubble to the bottom, the advice I give to friends is this. If the price drops 80% over the next 3 months, and stays there for a year... If that makes you nervous it might be best to stay away. We certainly have a crash coming. When, how much, and what price is up in the air, people need to plan for that. A lot of newcomers don't remember the suicide hotline stickies (Unironically). Another new poster last night asked if he should keep his holdings less than $250k for FDIC protection... Really?

@_date: 2017-12-11 21:05:09
Scaling (fees), and confirmation time is the biggest issue right now for Bitcoin. BCH's answer for fees is a bandaid solution which works great short-medium term, keeps confirmation times to 'next block' and is relatively cheap. Long term not viable for 'instant' or micropayments. Bitcoin is throwing their eggs into the Lightning network basket, which doesn't solve issue today, but if it works *and* gets adopted will solve scaling on a 2nd layer and will allow for instant sends and micropayments. It's a larger change so expect slow adoption from 'laggards'.
IOTA is trying to solve scaling with a "I'll verify 2 transactions so you verify mine" decentralized method, but is too small and unadopted to see how it may work in practice.
Those are some keywords for you to google anyways.

Stocks are fractional ownership of a company. Companies are expected to *generate* revenue. The price is tied to the future *expected* revenue. IE: Stocks cost more than the company is "worth" today, because they are expected to be "worth" more eventually.
Bitcoin is money. There is a limited number of coins, like stock, but "Bitcoin" is not a company and does not *generate* revenue. This makes bitcoin a store of value. Like with all currencies the value fluctuates based on confidence in the currency. This makes trading bitcoin, like FOREX traders, a *speculative* investment. This is also where the notion that Bitcoin is a zero sum game has *some* merit, as FOREX is also a zero sum game. IE: For the USD to rise, other currencies must fall. The difference in my opinion is that this assumes eventually everyone will want to cash out of Bitcoin. I don't think that will happen any more than Americans decide to stop using dollars.
**TL/DR;** Stocks are ownership in companies that generate revenue. Bitcoin is a scarce speculative asset who's value is driven by adoption (users, not merchants)

@_date: 2017-12-18 21:22:45
Can't speak for everyone else, but here's why I'm into it a bit more:
It been close to Bitcoin, added segwit, is involved with lightning dev. It confirms the same block size, but more often, effectively tripling Bitcoins current network capacity. To me Litecoin is a good hedge against the to bitcoins, and is pretty much what segwit2x could have been. All while being away from all the drama and sketchy propoganda of the BTC/BCH crowds.

You don't need to load the full blockchain if I recall correctly. In bitcoin-qt, click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right), and select the 'console' tab. If you had a password on it type:
    walletpassphrase (your password) 600
This will allow you to access your private keys for the next 600 seconds. Now to get all the public addresses which have received funds, type
    listreceivedbyaddress
That will give you a list of all addresses that have received funds. Now, for each public address run this command:
    dumpprivkey (your public address)
This will give you the private key for each address. I'm sure it goes without saying that you should be careful doing this. I would personally disconnect form the internet and make sure you're in a private location. Do not save these private keys in a plain text file. You would be wise to sweep the coins directly to a new address. I personally used Electrum wallet.

Am Canadian, buy with a credit card on Coinbase, it's the easiest. I also like Coinsquare. Once you buy, transfer your coins out. Electrum wallet for android is good if you want fast access to them, you can print a paper wallet out and send your coins there if you want some long term storage. And for best long term storage I'd recommend the ledger nano s, it's what I use.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:46:09
You have the choice when you log onto your nano "I don't know", "Legacy" or "Segwit".
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:48
Lol, just hold both coins and let the plebs fight it out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:51:13
Because I've been using BTC for a few years now, and it's always been a novelty open as a payment. I prefer credit card for almost all purchases. So being that regular daily purchases are low priority for me that brings me to why I got into BTC in the first place (Currency hedge), and secondly I'm very interested in micro-payments. Something most (all?) blockchain cryptos would not be able to handle as they would be considered spam. I don't know what alternatives there are to LN in the future of all the main cryptos, but Im pessimistic of the 'just put it all on the blockchain' approach there.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:06
It's a bit of an understanding curve for sure, but as another bro linked some other stuff, let me answer your two questions directly:


Not really, it's much more like trading FOREX. USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, and now XBT (Bitcoins official currency trading symbol).


Most money in my country exists only on the computer. There is a lot of physical cash, but more exists as created by the banking system in general (Look up "M0" money supply)


Better question to ask is *how*. The worlds largest nations cannot take it down, it's decentralized. Quantum computing? If that cracks the bitcoin code, it also cracks every bank, government, military encryption there is. Satoshi comes back from the dead and dumps his coins? Price tanks, millions of little fish get to eat up the cheaper coins.
This sounds cliche, but really it comes to this: Fiat is backed by the government that issues it. Bitcoin is backed by the sheer number of people using it. And the more it gets used, the stronger and more stable it will become. This is the first step towards a truly global currency, and has the potential to unseat the USD/EUR/GBP etc as the reserve currency for the world.

Maybe. But if something happens to Coinbase, you may be shit out of luck. The people at MtGox never got anything back. Thats all tied up in legal shit that may never get resolved. Exchanges have been hacked where the company took equal amounts of money from all users to cover the losses. Exchanges have shut down while holding onto coins, could be frozen if a government decides to step in. Wallets are bigger targets for hackers than individuals... You know that Coinbase is probably being bombarded by the smartest hackers in the world right now - Huge target on their back.
It's just safer to get your coins off as soon as is reasonable. I certainly wouldn't keep more than a paycheck's worth on there.

Predictions: 
* Lightning network will be slow to adopt, and critics will cry 'centralized' until casual Joe blow users start setting up nodes.
* Roger will dump, threaten to dump, or will in some way try to manipulate via his massive holdings, BTC in the next 3 months, and it will be a catalyst for a multi month sustained dip. 
* Super prediction: Same as above, he will time it the first time a big stumbling block comes up with lightning or segwit.
* Block sizes are staying small/fees are being kept high to 'encourage' users use the lightning network. Block size will increase a lil bit after Lightning is somewhat adopted. 
* Same as above, but Roger Ver will make some comment about "See!!? Told you you would have to increase the block size all hail Satoshi
* Ledger will announce support for Iota inside of 3 months.

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:42:38
Eh, I'm still holding mine from the fork. I'm in no rush to sell, though I'll be real interested to see what happens once all the forked coins hit coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:46:10
Im not risking my expensive coins for that
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:14:14
I agree. I'd stick to something "less popular" like LTC, BCH, ETH. Even Dash or Doge. All same shit really, key is for new people to keep the fees low.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:36:56
Smaller transactions are going to be difficult for a while. Right now a TON of people are sending lots of small transactions so the mempool is full. I recommend LTC to get started, similar market to BTC. ETH is also a top 3
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:29:59
Yup, spot on

@_date: 2017-12-14 04:27:09
Eh, there will always be coins trying to say why they are better imo. Plus a few long term haters now that BTC/BCH are in two camps.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:08:20
There are a few for sure. I am not one of them.

Other than some small purchases I've never sold
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:06
You should be able to. Are you American? As a Canadian I can only withdraw coin, and can only direct buy via visa
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:46
I'd need to see it but unless if it was provably decentralized and open source no one would touch it. The only thing I've seen that had a chance in recent years is ETH. BCH had a chance, but lost that chance when people were waiting for segwit2x. All this recent new adoption came in post fork, so these new people are mostly in Bitcoin. Segwit was a good idea in theory imo, shitshow release. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:06:01
Eh, right now other coins are 'better' for speed, cost, usability for new users. Scaling is a concern for sure. I personally would like to see a block size increase while a more long term solution is worked on. In my career there used to be a top-dog software called Softimage. They were working on a new gen tool called Sumatra that was next level. Delay after delay ended up pushing people to a new tool called Maya. Eventually Sumatra was released, and was technically better than Maya, but the users had already shifted camps. After a couple more years Sumatra was suped up and rebranded as a Software called XSI, that was top to bottom better than Maya. But they never got their market share back.
This is the way I see Bitcoin going now. And it's fine, I just hope there wont be hurt feelings when LN is slow (if ever) to adopt.

"Whales" trigger small moves which send an emotional wave through the markets, and everyone panics to basically self-fulfill the fear. You can watch people hop from one coin to another. Right now BCH is the trendy one. Litecoin had a big boost a while ago. IOTA before that. Eth before that. Bitcoin boosts scattered throughout. Even Dogecoin had a boost.
If I was a day trader (which I'm not), I'd be buying trickles of BTC and LTC. Maybe some IOTA, and selling BCH right now. But Im not. It's fun to guess.
!RemindMe 1 week. Whos popular today?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:59:54
Depends on the conditions. Why did it drop? Is it something that affects all coins? Only in one country? is it temporary? How many people also know? HOW do you know?
Too many variables.

Ooooo... very interesting..!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:03:38
If you're not sure, buy both. it's risky to go 'all in' with one camp. And to be honest, take away the names/history there are several coins that meet or beat both Bitcoin forks imo. LTC has faster block times for example. ETH dealt with scaling without the drama and has created a whole other niche industry around ICO's. Monero has privacy. Ripple is a safe port in a storm....
Seriously, if you don't know what to pick but you do know you want 'in', buy a bundle of the main ones. It's how large cap ETF's work in the stock market.

If you think you might end up "holding a bag", you should not invest. Not meaning to sound condescending, but if you buy anything you're not super stoked on avoid it or it will stress you out.

All hail the infallible whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:49:22
You're exactly correct. And on that not I love having a diversified portfolio in Crypto; As long as the market goes up, who cares whos winning the race. Fun fact: I have more coins in BCH than BTC. I prefer BTC, but if "The flipping" ever happens I'm going to do even better. 
Both camps call me a shill: I ask for ways how I could attack the lightning network *and* why should I prefer BCH over LTC. And while both camps piss themselves in anger at the subordination I ride Ripple and ETH up haha.
ETF's are the greatest thing ever invested for the passive investor. I've beaten the market for the last 10 years+ (on average) with ETF's at the core of my strategy. And have recently applied the same methodology to crypto. Bonus points: Random jumps or dips dont make me nervous with this strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:51:05

This guys telling the truth. My first BTC purchase was over $1000 at the end of 2013. It went down and down, I bought more and more, 'Just DCA' that shit I kept telling myself. Until I ran out of disposable income (didn't have much). Then the subreddit's got toxic and on my nerves so I unsubscribed and mostly forgot about them. Had them on an old PC (But knew I'd have to get them off before I wiped it). Got back into it when I saw it crossed $6000. Thought "holy fuck!". Got sucked up into the subreddits again, caught up to the drama. And now here we are doing the exact same thing, right down to the same month.
And I've put my coins all on cold storage. Am tired of the drama, and am slowly pulling away from the social side of it again. Looking forward to seeing you bros in 3 more years..!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:29:46

Well, the whole market dipped. I probably fared better than a person that was all in on BTC, or BCH, not as well as someone that was all in on Ripple. But that's part of the strategy: Coin vs coin is not a zero sum game if the market average is going up. Gotta think in terms of months and years, not single days; "Time in is better than tim**ing*"


Totally agree.

I was around then. FUD feels about the same. "Blocks are full, it's a proven limit", flippening or some other up-and-comer alt. ETH was looking like an option until the cats took it down. People starting to see the power the miners actually have. Withdrawal troubles (Im having an issue there myself). Ver threatened (by action) moving his stash to an exchange during the flippening to scare people...

This was a wake-up call once I hit adulthood - "Saving" is just a slow bleed with inflation. A sneaky little tax. Mutual funds... Rarely beat the market when you account for the management fees. Have to learn to invest just to keep your head above water.

It's not that the argument is getting thinner, its that people are starting to question their reasoning. I try and distance myself from the MASSIVE circlejerk and echo chamber our crypto subs are, but smart, experienced money people are beginning to question some fundamentals they've always assumed were facts.
For example... Fiat money is backed by the government. Does that include fractional reserve lending? Yup. And the people have to trust they can get their money when they want it, knowing full well if everyone wants it at the same time, they cant get it (bank run, see Cypress).
Bitcoin and other cryptos are backed by the users sentiment. Smart money people have considered this value to be zero, and akin to a so called Ponzi scheme. Thing is... People aren't cashing out. We're using it. 
Hell, this last weekend I had my credit cards all frozen because of a false fraud alert. I asked the vendor jokingly if they accepted Bitcoin. Never happened and it's sorted now, but having an alternate payment channel I can use with a trusted vendor would have been nice.

Haha, a *bit* of an itch, not gonna lie. But I've been investing in equities for a while, and I've learned I don't do as well picking and timing as I do holding long term. Besides... There's not much else I can do with the money right now. Real Estate is overbought IMO (Canada), equities are at an all time high, bonds don't pay shit, I got *out* of precious metals to get into Bitcoin... Feels like we're in an 'everything' bubble haha.

I think we're in a 'temporary' reduction of utility time. First no-one but coffee shops would care to accept it. A novelty payment type for nerd. Price went up enough where there is adoption by the people, which put enough pressure on fees to make smaller purchases not worth it. Lightning will bring back Bitcoin as a utility payment option, and I highly suspect block size increase will be quick to follow lightning adoption.
Birds eye view and conspiracy thinking me thinks the high fee and small block size will be good leverage to push users into adopting the new technology.

Go with your gut. HODL is a meme, but bad investment advice if you're not comfortable with the risk of it going down. And it WILL go down again. To what and from where is anyone's guess, but Bitcoin is not to be invested in with money you want to use elsewhere.

BCH got listed on the biggest, public facing exchange yesterday (GDAX). Was put on without confirmed time (And of Dec vs on Dec 9 at 5pm pst kinda thing).

@_date: 2017-12-03 21:41:33
I disagree on a few points. Consumer protection is offered by a 3rd party, Visa for example. If I (the consumer) buy an item online from a vendor that doesn't arrive, arrives broken etc, I can call Visa and do a chargeback. In this example Visa is a defacto escrow. Now we could argue how the consumer has unfair advantage, but that's just the way the system is now. Visa wants to encourage spending, so they take all the risk out of the sale. The fees get charged to the merchant. (Yes, who increases the price of the merchandise, but for all customers not just credit card customers). This consumer protection is a feature users like, and Bitcoin does not offer. For example: I tried to make a purchase on I sent the coin, the item never got delivered... That's that, I got scammed and I have no recourse.
Fraud protection is separate from this, and there are different kinds of fraud. The specific kind of fraud protection I suspect you are talking about is stealing/cloning credit cards, and you're right that Bitcoin doesn't require this particular type of fraud protection. You either steal Bitoins or you don't.

Cool, think Core would let me commit a block increase? ;) But seriously, it's easier said than done for the average non-programmer to commit bombproof code for a multi-billion dollar project. The best thing regular people can and should do is support the features, fork or coin they prefer. I've been testing LN, certainly not something my mother would be able to do. I'm pointing people new to crypto to try LTC, BCH, Doge before thinking about BTC.
That's the landscape right now; If you don't like this coin try that coin and let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:10:11
Eh, you can add a note if you like. I know in Electrum it logs the price  the day it landed in the wallet. Not sure if that helps, but coins on an exchange is considered a very dangerous practice. SO many BIG exchanges get hacked, 'hacked', go missing, stop processing... all sorts. Coinbase is the biggest one right now. So was MtGox, Cryptsy...
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:03:35
Well... Depends. Both BTC and BCH are evangelical about their way forward. BCH works as the way Bitcoin always has before the clogged mempool, BTC wants to push the utility to another level. Lots of people wont switch either way out of spite.

This is exactly right. Start shuffling your portfolio balance around until you're comfier again. OP is at real estate level with is a relatively safe bet if you do an income property.

@_date: 2017-12-19 18:27:41
Ok, to be specific **ETF's that track an index**, like $SPY. And to be even more specific: A *large-cap* index ETF because you don't need scamcoins/garbage in your portfolio. And "market cap" as it relates to cryptocurrency is a shit metric but the best we've got.

Eh, I make a distinction between release and adoption. Once Lightning starts doing its part, I expect a small increase to keep the blocks full but not backlogged. 2x sounds like a good first step. Maybe even something dynamic that work require hard forks in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:03:04
That I would not know sorry. It all depends on the number of inputs. I consolidated my coins a while back so my transactions are all small.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:02:52
From the actual Bitpay website:






So... Bitcoin Cash is the 2nd option, other altcoins to come shortly thereafter, and they are planning on being front and center for Lightning. BCH is small part of this story.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:25:00
It's so true. Fàngpìchòu coin is a true up-and-comer though. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:56:02
Oh totally. Imo the blocks are going to stay small to 'encourage' lightning adoption. I think core dev is fine with people using alts if they need low fees RIGHT NOW. BTC has been a novelty payment for me since I got into it, but micropayments are the new frontier if they get it right.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:28:48
Talking for myself only... I sold my gold and bought Bitcoin a few years back as a hedge against my local currency, the CAD. That's why I bought gold originally; Bonds were (and still now) pay shit. I didn't want to 'all in' on stocks, so that was my hedge. 
I also got into Bitcoin because I like learning new tech. Im the dude that gets a 3d printer before they get popular, fund niche kickstarters etc. Bitcoin piqued my interest the same way. I also have bought a lot of things with Bitcoin to see what the experience is. Now for the unpopular statement:
Bitcoin for me has only been a novelty payment option. I've been swindled before, and if I'd used a credit card it would be sorted. TAP is way faster than anything I've bought with a live payment in the world. Last time I did that the person wanted me to stick around until a confirmation went through (2014). Just made the whole interaction weird. Purse.io was fun, but not user friendly enough for me to expect my mother to give it a go. I've lost coins on an exchange going down. Hasnt happened with my bank...
So to answer will it ever be used as a currency? Lightning is the only thing I'm interested in for that at the moment. Sure BCH isn't backed up like BTC's mempool, but its still the same old novelty payment platform. The instant micro article test payments though... I see this as a potential for another revolution. I miss the tip bots, lightning would improve on those. I want to one-click tip a Youtuber, a news article, a Reddit comment. I want to tip people that make memes. We're not there yet, but we could be.

It's so odd having someone that hates Bitcoin hold so much of it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:52
Well... As I see it:
Consumer protection: Nothing Bitcoin has compares with chargeback for example. Fees. The Visa/Mastercard terms of service requires the merchant has to charge the same rate regardless of payment type, so non-credit card users participate also pay into that fee.


Which GREATLY favors the consumer over the merchant. Short version is, that particular battle may not be very easy.

Nothings wrong with it at all imo. Long established altcoin, faster blocks, good dev team, close with BTC devs, adopted segwit, open to testing lightning.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:57:17
Not to do an "Us vs them" (I hold equal BTC and BCH). I prefer LTC because they are not only moving ahead on segwit, lightning, but have fast block confirmation times and through that confirm more transactions.
I don't hear that mentioned much though. BCH is pretty much the exact same Bitcoin I remember when I unsubbed and forgot about bitcoin late 2014 or so. And nothing super exciting on the roadmap for me at least. BCH credit card? I have credit cards with better features already.

If you can see the address you sent them *from* we can check there. If they still exist in the original address someone smarter than me can probably walk you through how to re-broadcast the transaction and shake them loose. (Though from what I remember after a certain time in the mempool if a transaction doesn't go through it returns to the original address.)

Thing is, 'shorting' Bitcoin is insanely dangerous. I don't understand futures and wont pretend to, but I do know shorting is risky because:
* Your maximum upside is 100%
* Your maximum downside is theoretically unlimited. 
In practice, if you short a stock and it jumps up quickly then back down, you can trigger a margin call. Meaning you looked like you were going to lose a lot of money so we cashed you out. You're fucked even if you bet correctly and the stock tanked. Guarantee whales would smash some volatility in there to trigger these calls.
Full disclosure: I invest, but non of this fancypants shit. Feel free to throw my opinion in the garbage.

Only by more if you want it, at these levels I would never want to convince anyone of anything. For energy consumption estimates, we could run the exact same network on a fraction of the nodes we have active, it's just the competition that consumes the energy.

It's a fair comment imo. My problem is that Bitcoin's had a lot of problems that dont get fixed when it forks. Same old whales, same old ASIC semi-monopoly, same drama, same block frequency. Oh, BTG is not ASIC SHA256 now (Most altcoins)! Oooo BCH upped the block size! (LTC confirms faster, ETH did it on a whim), SEGWIT2X (Almost like LTC again).
If Im going to get away from Bitcoin, Im going to go clean-slate into a full on different alt. LTC, ETH, maybe even Vert/Monero/Iota. Somewhere Whales like Very don't exist yet.

Gonna be interesting to see what happens when Coinbase releases the BCH. Market flood or newfound interests...
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:16:01
I hear you. FWIW I've felt like (short term) prices are massively manipulated in the cryptocoin space, and have been since I got in. I'd never heard of how buy/sell walls worked until I bought some BTC, and I've been (casually) investing in equities for years. The whole market, even the big boys like BTC, seem to trade like penny stocks. And being a truly globally exchanged asset... I don't know how it *could* even be regulated. 
My thoughts are whales can only splash around so long until enough minnows nibble them down to stability. Personally I invest slow and steady, listen to the news but don't trade on events. I also test and use the tech, so even where I'm wrong I have a strong opinion on a few of the more known coins and where I think they'll end up.

Awesome...! Commands above should work now so you shouldn't have to wait for the whole blockchain. If you have coins, you also have forked coins you can collect. If you have a significant number of coins (1+) I would recommend getting a ledger nano s and just doing it safe. It's VERY easy. If it's not too much then you should:
* Backup your private keys
* Send your Bitcoins to a **new** bitcoin address
* Download a [bitcoin Cash wallet](
* Load your private keys in the
* Transfer *those* BCH coins to a **new** bitcoin cash address
Once those ones are done you can also grab Bitcoin gold. Do this last as it's the sketchiest of the good forks
* Grab a [Bitcoin Gold wallet](
* Import your private keys, transfer to a new Bitcoin gold address
An important warning: do not transfer your coins to the wrong address or it's a LOT of work to get them back. Best of luck and congrats on the find.

From an investing standpoint I've found crypto to be different from equities in that people get 'married' to their coins. Traders push things around like crazy, but some people are just born to HODL. There's a price these things can never dip below barring a major issue in the actual tech.
BCH and BTC are here to stay, just dont know the price they will stay at

Demos I've seen let you pick max total fees for the network. A hub too expensive? Go around it. The fee's will be kept low from competition. Lets say a centralized hub charges $1. I'll run a node that charges $0.50. Some guy see I'm making $.50 per and says "Fuck, I'll open channels with a bunch of rando's and charge $.01 per transaction". Guy looking to send cash says "I want to pay no more than $.05 total in fees". And if he finds a route, he bypasses us guys trying to skim too much off the top and go the cheapest route.


Eh, if LN is adopted, great. If not there are like... 200+ altcoins that are going to stay doing the current 'Everything on the blockchain no matter what'. Well. Except for people who keep their money on exchanges. Which is a lot of people. Many (Most?) new users for sure.

Eh, I consider them like a chequing and a savings account. Truth be told, I've been using BTC to buy things since I got in a couple years back. The fact of the matter is, it was always a novelty payment option. Credit card would be better in almost every case for me. But BTC has better potential beyond what credit cards offer. Its the ~~only~~ best coin out there to potentially solve micro and macro transactions.
I'm using LTC and ETH (and BCH) as the band-aid a block size increase would be for BTC. And truth be told who knows, maybe different coins ends up being the solution to decentralization. Is there a reason 1,000,000,000 transactions need to all be on the same blockchain? It's why Im not getting rolled up in the BTC/BCH nonsense. It's the smallest potato concern I can think of
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:13:21
I can write a smart sounding, factually incorrect article that will certainly be picked up by a news source at some point. Does that help?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:30:23
Most of them generally work that way ya. But "storing coins" is not a really accurate way to look at it. Private keys are just a way to prove "These specific coins on the blockchain are mine. Here is a signed message that only the true owners of these coins would be able to show you to prove it". So you *can* have the same private keys stored in multiple places, and even across multiple wallets. (I wouldn't do that personally, but you can if you want.) 
Sorry if that makes it a bit more confusing but it's the foundation of the way it Bitcoin works and is kind of essential to grasp.

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:51:43
Bitcoin until/unless something comes along which unseats it. First mover advantage certainly helps Bitcoin retrain it's spot. It's been around the longest. Eth has good potential to be number 2, LTC is up there as well as they appear to be more nimble. Biggest thing on technically inclined peoples minds is how to solve the scaleability problem. BCH says 'just increase the block size, it's an easily solvable solution'. BTC says 'that is a band-aid, we want to solve it to compete with speeds and volumes of Visa etc'). Community seems to have high hopes still for bitcoin and lightning network, but it fractured the community and many (most?) of the people have dug their heels in on what choice they support. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:04:02

Hmmm.. super old versions should still have something similar. If I were you I would back up the wallet.dat file, download a new version of bitcoin core-qt, import the wallet.dat, and do what I said above. You won't need to load the whole blockchain to see what addresses you have, and you can check the public addresses right on the blockchain explorer. You wont see actual holdings in the gui until the blockchain is fully loaded though.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:10:31
Eh, time will tell. Don't expect Visa/Mastercard to take this lying down. I could absolutely see them embracing Bitcoin before they lose any real market share. Plus they offer services Bitcoin (the stand alone asset) cannot offer.

By default you grab the transactions offering the most sat/byte. I'm not sure how accelerators work, but I think some miners can opt to prefer certain transactions if they mine the next block.

[Finally, China has an enormous surplus of electricity that can be harnessed for mining. In 2016, for instance, overcapacity from hydropower stations in Sichuan and Yunnan amounted to a whopping 45.6 terawatt hours. To put that into perspective, the entire US generated 4,100 terawatt hours of electricity in the same year.* By partnering with these power stations, cryptocurrency miners get access to discounted electricity rates in exchange for a cut of the mining revenue.](

BCH is a clone of Bitcoin with a couple small edits. Technically pretty much the same thing minus the name, with some edits to make things smoother for now. Lower adoption currently. Bitcoins long term plan is the Lightning network: A 2nd layer off-chain solution that is being worked on and tested. Awesome if it works as expected *and* is adopted. Also opens the possibility of micro transactions which is potentially groundbreaking (Low/zero fees, instant, can do things like one click and confirm upvotes, buying articles etc.

Absolutely agree. A merchant with slim margins wont be able to eat the kind of dips we sometimes see. I could predict an actual payment system that loops in something like what futures do. Merchant sells product at that days price while an investor accepts the risk.
But totally agree on the limits to adoption. I think this is why many merchants are pulling out, as well as the high fees.

I'm the same as you, got interested because of the tech. Have you run lightning on the test network? I see a ton of potential there, next level stuff. Most of the other coins seem to be different solutions to the same problem (Except ETH of course). BCH, LTC, Doge are like neopolitan ice cream: slightly differing flavors of the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:33:54

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:19:28


No shit. Pull your coins off so you personally hold and control an address that contains coins when the fork hits.


Being that most exchanges hold everyone coins in massive combined addresses and do exchanges/transfers off-chain. They shouldn't have to split the coins yet shouldn't hold onto them either? You know those are opposites, right? They probably aren't 'keeping' them for themselves, they just aren't going through the stress that comes with splitting a billion dollars worth of crypto and the risks that come with it.
Or here's something that'll ruffle your feathers... when you deposit your money in a bank, the bank uses that money to make other money. That new money isn't yours, you just get the stuff you put in. What the bank makes on that money in the meantime is theirs to keep.
Again, be a Bitcoiner, be your own bank, hold your own keys. Want to reap the rewards of a fork? Make sure you control keys that hold coins at the forked block. Simple stuff, or you're at the whim of whoever is holding your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:50:35
**Cheap answer:** Only you know. 
**Real Answer:** As an investor that is massively overweight in a single asset in a niche sector in emerging tech. Generally speaking, if you feel like you are overexposed you'll be skittish at the first sign of trouble. You know when they ask what your risk tolerance is? This is where you find that out.
Ask yourself: If a month from now we're down 10%, Feb you see we're down 10% more, March we're up 3%, but April/May/June we lose 15% each month... Can you hold through that? If not, reduce your position, because that's not far off what we rode in 2014 after a run up like we just had now in 2017.
I would also *highly* recommended you diversify across a couple other top-tier coins.
Majority should be in BTC, **ETH**, Ripple, BCH, LTC, and likely in that order.
**Edit:** ETH not ETC

I finally did a test run... I think? I put a bit of BTC on a segwit address of the Ledger Nano. The address started with a 3, not a 1. It went through (Still confirming, I cheaped out on fees).

Heres the funny thing, I've been using Bitcoin for a little while (2013), and I pay for things with Bitcoin when I see it as an option, BUT it's always been a novelty way to pay. Realistically if I'm making a "real purchase", I use a credit card for all the things Bitcoin cant do. Consumer protection/chargebacks, awards, points, customer service when something goes wrong, fraud detection, insurance. Im super pro Bitcoin, but even when fees we're an issue it's not something I was using day to day.
To me Bitcoin cash is going to be a novelty akin to a starbucks giftcard. I still hold all my BCH from the fork just in case Roger the whale flails around and destroys the market on his shameful walk out the door.

Question: What's to stop an attacker sending money to another node he controls through the network to drain wallets and force channels to either 'top up' or settle on the chain? Say I see a bunch of nodes with .1 BTC available, I send .1BTC from address A to address B through these smaller channels, then pick another route to send from address B to address A. All different routes to drain as many nodes as possible. Assuming many/most of those nodes send more than they receive, doesn't that effectively give an option to block many routes with limited funds?

Don't take my advice.... But I have a bunch of coins, weighted loosely by market cap. It takes the volatility out of individual coin rallies and dumps. Pretty much made my own crypto ETF. WAY less stressful, especially considering the BTC/BCH markets actually fight each other.
Put differently, if you hold both coins it doesn't matter who wins as long as new people are buying one of them. And as I said, it's low stress and avoids FOMO.

Putting the work of splitting and managing airdrops on the exchange is a fair step further than an exchange should be concerned with. Bitcoin is about being your own bank, not 'I don't understand the tech so plz do the hard work for me'. And that puts the environment of the forks in their corner too. Do they support every fork and airdrop that comes along? 
Funnily enough, having them hold onto forked coins might be a good middle ground to discourage users using them as coin splitting tech support.
I'll tell you what "sounds incredibly stupid" - leaving coins on an exchange and acting like you have a say in the matter.

A Bitcoin node would be to secure the network. It's something we do for the kindness of our hearts to confirm transactions.
A lightning node gives you the opportunity to collect a small fee, and diversifies the network, allowing for more paths to be found from a payer to recipient.

That's when I got in. Bought my first bit of BTC at the Dec '13 peak, rode it all the way down to the bottom. Held on because I only had a couple bucks invested anyways. Started to get sick of the subreddit drama so I unsubscribed and mostly forgot about Bitcoin. Couple months ago it gets in the news and rekindled my interest.
FUD was high when Mt.Gox went down. That's when everyone started really realizing you had to keep your coins off the exchanges. Panic to withdraw and cash is, everything ground to a halt, similar to what happened with BCH/BTC a couple weeks back.
If you don't think you can handle an [80% drop]( reduce your exposure. Or you WILL panic and you WILL sell low and buy high.

Not really a comment either way, but as I understand it the Bitcoin funds/ETF's charge a hefty premium to 'kinda match' what Bitcoin is doing at any moment. Short version is holding actual Bitcoin will beat the fund every time. *Except for fees* currently. That's the wild card.

Biggest reason is that it's long established. The name, the dev team, it's survived MANY attacks, and we're including nations here, not just teenage script kiddies.
A lot of the tech may be old and 'legacy', but it's rock solid. Other coins need to work up to the level of confidence people have in Bitcoin. That's also the number one reason BCH gets mad if you don't call it BitcoinCash - They need that name for legitimacy, or it might as well be LTC or Dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:50:20

Want to sleep a little better? And survive the storms? Diversify! Here is a starting point to weight a crypto portfolio. I am similarly weighted but plan on rebalancing in a couple months. (Bonus point: if 'the flippening' ever actually turns into a thing, you'll have more BCH *coins* than BTC, even though the value is much less).
* 64% BTC
* 19% ETH
* 12% BCH
* 5% LTC
And if you want to spread a little safer:
* Put up to 10% in Ripple
* Put up to 4% in IOTA
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:04:35
It's a short term problem. Truth be told VERY few people were using Bitcoin as a day to day transactional currency. I think I probably pay via crypto more than the majority of users, and that's once or twice a month max. I think this is the deflationary aspect of the asset. (I'd just re-buy what I spent at that days rate, no gains lost)
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:47
Maybe in the distant future when cryptocurrency stabilizes, but there are very few investors who are torn between the worlds most volatile asset vs a barely beating inflation savings account.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:00:52
Eh, we'll see. I thought the same about Bitcoin when I got into it. Still kinda see very little utility for *me*. Assuming coin security isn't an issue, I'm cool with leaving some of my cash in channels to generate a little interest and help strengthen the network. Like how my full node does (and that's for free).
But if it flops, so be it. Plenty of alts to fill the void in the meantime or after. It's still proof of concept stage to me, but I was really impressed when I bought some 'blockachinos' and articles via LN.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:06:27
It puts people off spending money, which is one of the core worries about a deflationary currency. Personally every time I buy something with Bitcoin I just buy more to 'recharge'. I bought a Trezor a couple years back, probably is $2000+ in today's money. Doesn't bug me in the slightest.

Also where something goes wrong, you're on your own.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:01:19
It just gives something that can be traced. If you have an address with 11.27423148, that's a pretty unique number. unique enough that it might be able to point to a unique address. You can then see where those coins came from, and if they eventually lead back to a known address, they can follow the trail to you.
Plus its a bad idea to let people know you have money. If you don't have much (like me), cool, if you do have a good amount, let people think you dont have much.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:36:55
Biggest reason I'm bullish on this tech is all the criticism I'm reading here is inaccurate or outright wrong. There are concerns with lightning, I've had a good chat with an info-tech pro about some specific potential concerns. Non of those arguments have been listed here.
Short version is, hosts will have to have a step or two better security than someone just running a Bitcoin node. For now keep it to small transactions and keep channel funding low to keep your exposure limited.
In the meantime expect attacks. Co-ordinated, well funded attacks.
Anecdotally I've had some trouble getting LM working reliably on testnet (My fault and high learning curve to blame). But this has some next-level potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:15:44
So real question, in this scenario does this make me, the guy funding a couple hundred bucks, make me the whale? I think eventually the truly destitute (&lt;$10/month) will have the choice between something like LN, going through middle class whales like me, or can just pick an alt coin and do things like they are now (Everything on blockchain, long confirmation times, coin must remain low/no fee).
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:50:13
Ya, I would have liked to have doubled block size. Segwit2x was a good idea in theory if it didn't turn into a simmering turd. Saying that, I think blocks would still be full with 2mb. People are being more conservative with how often they are sending right now
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:28
Would be nice
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:36:38
Slow bleed for next couple months., small jump when lightning hits main net, another slow bleed until adoption actually ramps up. major dip when attack/hack on lightning is mis-reported in the news (buying opportunity). 2-5 years out we're double/triple our current price and will start leveling off as 3rd world starts joining in to the financial system.

That's rough. I consider them safe, and have s few Xmas presents done though there. Checked the URL (and my hosts file because I'm paranoid), also offline and checked the hash. But still I would really like to know how they were grabbed as well. Scary stuff. Were they grabbed right away or after a while?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:44:53
These are all good questions that I don't have the answers to haha. Truth be told, buying things with Bitcoin has always been a novelty for me. I've never bought a coffee with it for example. Nothing beats tap imo (yet).
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:30:06
I said this in another discussion thread but it's the reason Im still mostly in BTC, and am talking for myself only... I sold my gold and bought Bitcoin a few years back as a hedge against my local currency, the CAD. That's why I bought gold originally; Bonds were (and still now) pay shit. I didn't want to 'all in' on stocks, so that was my hedge. "One store of value" for another, and this was in 2013/2014.
I also got into Bitcoin because I like learning new tech. Im the dude that gets a 3d printer before they get popular, fund niche kickstarters etc. Bitcoin piqued my interest the same way. I also have bought a lot of things with Bitcoin to see what the experience is. Now for the unpopular statement:
Bitcoin for me has only been a novelty payment option. I've been swindled before, and if I'd used a credit card it would be sorted. TAP is way faster than anything I've bought with a live payment in the world. Last time I did that the person wanted me to stick around until a confirmation went through (2014). Just made the whole interaction weird. Purse.io was fun, but not user friendly enough for me to expect my mother to give it a go. I've lost coins on an exchange going down. Hasnt happened with my bank...
So to answer will it ever be used as a currency? Well the whole time up until the mem pool filled up it wasn't a very popular payment choice. I've used BTC a lot online and a few times in person... It's pretty rough around the edges tech right now. Lightning is the only thing I'm interested in for that at the moment. Sure BCH/LTC/etc isn't backed up like BTC's mempool, but its still the same old novelty payment platform. The instant micro article test payments I've been playing with on LN though... I see this as a potential for another revolution. I miss the tip bots, lightning would improve on those. I want to one-click tip a Youtuber, a news article, a Reddit comment. I want to tip people that make memes. We're not there yet, but we could be if LN works. If not, well that's sad and we're left with the same bloating blockchain, 10 minute confirms, and rough around the edges tech we had before the block side drama came to a head.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:39:37
I'm expecting a massive pump around then, or a big Roger Ver BTC dump to scare the markets. Hell, I could even see him doing some behind the scenes shit with some of the exchanges to stop/hide/reverse the bleed.

Take your dirty money, and a bunch of either people's money. Shuffle the coins like a deck of cards, take the same value back out. Plausible deniability if someone says the coins you have were used in an illicit transaction.

A bit of advice you can feel free to throw in the garbage... I've been investing for a while, casual investor level. Been in Bitcoin for a few years... I make personal predictions, but I don't trade on my gut. And it's done me well for a long time. I like both ideas of dollar cost averaging and 'Time in beats timing'. I think Bitcoin is going to be boosted a little for Christmas. Easy present to give, and Bitcoin being hype in the news is certain to be a topic at the dinner table. FOMO is big right now, people just want a bit 'just in case'.
People are going to tire of it, maybe some ominous news.... and we're going to be back into a slow bleed for a while. We're going to be sub $10k for at least a year. Maybe two. But we'll be back way above these highs within 5 years. A decade max. Why gamble $2k savings to miss on potential $90k gains over a decent time window?

I've read a good number of your posts, it's awesome to read some informative and 'neutral' posts in here. I'm holding pre-fork coins so I dont worry about the infighting too much but... In your opinion do you think lightning has a chance? Or are some of the problems unsolvable?

Warren hates bitcoin for the exact reasons he hates gold. Warren is also *very* hype-averse. 
But the real pill to swallow is that Bitcoins price might be valued way out of line of it's utility right now. What percentage of fiat users are FOREX traders? Pretty low. What percentage of Bitcoin users are trading on exchanges more than purchasing goods with BTC? I'll bet its quite high.
Don't give Warren a hard time for sticking to his strategy, it's done him well for 70 years under almost every time frame.

Ok, he gets paid to pump crypto; Literally a paid shill. He's also batshit crazy in a bouquet of ways and keeps promising to eat his own dick publicly. Privately he pays women to shit on his face through a hole in a hammock and very likely got away with murder.

@_date: 2018-05-18 14:07:04
I don't know too much about his stake in Wells Fargo tbh. Warren tends to have a hands-off approach to companies he holds, preferring to leave good managers in place. He's got a really good eye for good managers, but maybe the guys over at WF pulled one over on him. Next years letter will surely touch on it

@_date: 2018-05-07 21:32:02
And we've yet to see how much that economic utility is actually worth. And on that note our best metric for a store of value is gold. Lot of gold bugs have moved to crypto for the same reason they were in gold (like me). Many of the arguments against gold can easily apply to Bitcoin. Right now the largest 'use' for bitcoin seems to be speculation. Until(unless) merchant adoption starts getting the same kind of volume trading does, then that's all Bitcoin will be; a speculative asseet.

Exactly this, it's not about what he stands to gain or lose, it's that he's seen hype like this before and he is warning people to stay away. Warren holds the exact same opinion towards gold for the exact same reasons. I suspect he has a similar attitude when it comes to FOREX plays.

Depends on one big question, do people focus on adoption and development, or is the majority of the space still revolve around speculation.

He doesn't need to understand the technology, he understands the economic utility. He understands market hype. Intrinsic value.  And as far as a payment platform, Bitcoins got some other competition on the horizon if Wechat, Apple Pay etc starts taking over. Right now Bitcoin has a looooong way to go before it starts cutting the lunch of established payment processors.

Sort of. It was in that transfer window where they were not replying to my emails. IIRC I received an error on the site when I went to move some altcoins off the exchange about no coins available and/or having to convert them to another coin before removing them. Emails to support didn't receive any replies. In the end they walked off with the crypto I couldn't withdraw. I got my BTC and Dogecoin off for sure. I know I lost $300-$600 in Peercoin, and I feel like I had some LTC/something else as well (cant' remember now).
I consider it a lesson learned

The trap is we don't know how far we are up the left side *yet*. Get out too soon and you'll get out at the level we crash too. Wait until it finally dips a little bit and it may just be a bear trap. I don't do tech analysis, but patterns like this are common.

When it all boils down to it this is what open source dev is. (As opposed to having a centralized development team).

And if there are any exchanges out there doing some fractional reserve banking... Ain't no safety net for a bank run.
For a bit of fun, here's my prediction: Ver is going to put up an obscene amount of BTC for sale on the market. Might even eat the order book, sending markets into a panic. Might leave them on for a full day to keep the price low. BCH will bubble up, might overtake BTC briefly. Roger will bring the sell walls down, BTC will regain top spot, but lower than we are today.

I dont have all the answers, but maybe some...? I believe the Ledger nano S tracks price at time of transaction. I know the Electrum wallet does, so doing historical look ups of every transaction is likely already done for you.
If you're using someone like bitpay, I'm going to assume it's even easier.
For business wallets, you probably should keep the private key accessible to you only. Public addresses are safe with employees.
For converting to fiat, I think bitpay dumps on an exchange at market rates, you could probably do something similar. I believe overstock and a few other companies like that keep the crypto unconverted.
If you're going to accept a varity of crypto, you can use a service like [shapeshift]( They may even have extra features Im not considering, but they do work with businesses. Certainly worth checking out.

After such a long and sustained rally there is often a pullback. Usually some arbitrary catalyst triggers a slight retraction, then more and more pullback as people lock in some profits (Fiat/bonds in the case of equities, fiat/altcoins in the case of BTC).

I think in the last few months the price has been ballooning up on very little news or increased adoption. So much so that a light fart could change sentiment. Throw in a contentious fork to split the community and it will be prone to collapse.

Neither Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash dev is really decentralized in my opinion. Consensus, sure. Same with happens with mining via ASIC's imo, but that's a whole other thing.

@_date: 2017-11-21 14:41:01
Yup, but at that point we get into discussing if it's the tech of bitcoin that keep people around, or we discuss if Bitcoin with it's first mover advantage, name recognition, and highest rate of adoption/acceptance is worth *more* than wether or not it has better tech than a handfull of other altcoins.
Not a conversation this subreddit would welcome, so I'll leave that hang there.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:54:00
Yup... and imo I think we'll be back sub $4k within the next 6 months. I don't buy based on hunches, but those are he hunches I have.

Or the regulars are tired of the pump and dump, told you so, banks are evil, fiat is on its last legs, drive-by shitcoin/altcoin spam, random lines on a chart "tech analysis" that comes when Bitcoiners post on that sub. And the ones that do post on that sub are never the chill, knowledgeable users - It's the "Lol I got rich fuck you're ETF index investing losers!" crowd.
**Source:** Active Bitcoiner *and* active on @_date: 2017-11-11 16:41:53
Completely agree. It's still VERY easy to manipulate the price. The buy/sell walls are not *as* obvious any more, but it's still easy to panic the market, introduce volatility, and buy on the dips. The money that rushed into Bitcoin this last 6 months is still here. Maybe in BCH, ETH, other alts, maybe even sitting idle on an exchange, but that money is in the system now, much of which is on the sidelines waiting to rush back into BTC.
I don't buy on predictions, and I hate technical analysis, but here's a prediction: Within 3 weeks we'll be back over 7k. Within 1 year we'll be sub $5k, within 5 years we'll be north of 10k.
Set your reminders.
**Protip:** Feel free to split your coins if BTC forks, but hedge your losses by keeping both. I'm willing to bet a good number of people who forked and sold their BCH coins are kinda wishing they'd held them a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:54:18

To be fair so is Bitcoin. This whole infighting is over who gets to keep the branding of 'Bitcoin'. And the only reason Bitcoin is top is because they have first mover advantage.

I think FOMO takes care of that angle. I know lots of people who bought gold a few years back. I'm one of the few that moved over to crypto, but I think the interest is there. 
Talking to friends who come to me with questions, it's a confusing asset that they struggle with the concepts of. What's bitcoin backed by, how do you hack your bitcoin password, will the government assume Im buying drugs with it etc...
Of course, the couple of peole who are now getting into it are going altcoin crazy, but I think they're searching for 'the next Bitcoin'
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:22:02
Ah, if it goes down that way it will be a slow bleed
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:01:00
FWIW, Im treating Bitcoin as gold; Something to buy and hold, to save. It's not a day to day transactional currency right now (Thus the Bitcoin/Bch split). I liked using Bitcoin for those things, and it's a shame to see it go away, but that's the price of adoption for now.
Day trading cryptos... Lol, not my thing but I get it. I like BTC as a main holding, Eth for it's potential, then either LTC or BCH as a hedge against BTC falling out of favor. (Though to be honest if an altcoin takes over I'd like it to be non-ASIC).
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:00:00
What's the buy/sell rate at, and what is the max $$ they accept on a trade? I'll tell you this about Vancouver, they are crazy careful about money laundering if it's not a casino. I've had countless large purchases blocked, so I have to sip $1000/week max.

@_date: 2017-11-17 21:38:35
I first got into BTC, largely in part as a hedge against the CAD.
It's been fun.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:40:46
Well here's the rub - You're right. It's up to the exchanges, venders, users to say which one is the 'real' one. That's what was going to happen with segwit2x (without replay value).
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:46:39
I learned long ago to not argue with people over those points. I've got no interest in 'convincing' anyone of anything.
Could be a bubble, but if it pops how far would it drop? It's unlikely to go negative on the year with all the new users.
Value comes from the network. Gold's value as a thing you can put on your finger sounds just as silly, but it's the reserve asset of most large economy countries.
I have and do use it to buy things. Never once bought anything illegal with it either.
It's volatile, I'll give them that. Zero assumes no one on the planet would buy it from you. Chances of that are effectively zero.
But ya... don't go around posting in investment, forex, gold groups about crypto. Let them discover it for themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:55
Man, for me it barely ever did. Bitcoin as a day to day currency has a long way to go to even consider itself in the league of something like a debit/credit card. I've personally considered Bitcoin to be akin to something like gold for a long while.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:23:58
"How could anyone HODL like that? So strong!" That's you right now. Downvote away bruh, you're nuttier than squirrel poops.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:12:36
See, I think all the new money coming in is just straight up "Buying bitcoin". They don't know the nuances of the different forks. None of the people I've talked to seem to care much. Definitely not as much as the price. If the segwit2X camp went full BCH at the fork in the beginning, we *may* have seen a different Bitcoin by now. Who knows. And those of us that have a bit of an interest in the tech know about the alternatives. I'd rather buy with Eth than Bch for example. Lots of cool things happening in that space now. Wild west and full of scams, but then again not far off of Bitcoin in the Mt Gox era. Moving Doge is fast and easy even...
Lack of segwit adoption/fees/transaction times are big concerns of mine right now, and I'm hoping these are issues that get sorted out soon. In the meantime Im getting my eggs out of one basket. Cryptos are here to stay, but the winner is far from final.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:53:36


That's a long winded bit of fluff. Bitcoin has use of course, as does the cryptographic foundations separate from Bitcoin. Why is Bitcoin Cash worth less than Bitcoin? Why is Doge work WAY less than bitcoin? All have the same attributes that you outline in your wall of text, that leaves us with the brand and adoption (specifically the user-base).
Why is a Bitcoin worth $10,000 today? A month ago the same coin was worth half. What has changed? The number of people willing to buy it. And this isn't a bad thing, but lets call it what it is.
It's like the gold bug that think gold has 'real' value because people like putting the metal on their finger.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:09:40
I think Bitcoin has been a discussion at many dinner tables this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:34:20
Yes... But lets be honest it's a lot about the "brand" at this point. Newbies to the space 'just want Bitcoin'. Which one is Bitcoin *to a newb*? Whatever one is called "BTC" by exchanges.
And this is why I'm all about hodling pre-fork coins and waiting. Buying right after a fork is risky risky stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:07:21
Bitcoin could drop $1000 in a single day right now. If that makes you nervous, stay far away
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:00:28
It's my biggest beef with the 'decentralized' bitcoin(s) - Have to run on ASIC minors, so it's not really decentralized mining like... most of the other coin out there
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:38:48
Well... might get some downvotes but equities go up because they 'make' money. Speculative assets don't. Bitcoin has *utility* though... Whats that worth exactly? At the end of the days it depends on who's asking.

@_date: 2017-11-17 18:00:47
 means nothing until it means something, but that something has not happened so you get to worry about nothing. Like last weekend where something big happened that also turned out to be nothing
**Or real answer ELI5 style**: Business as usual. A while back someone wanted to change the way Bitcoin worked (BitcoinCash). Most of the community said "Fuck you, we're sticking with the current method" (Bitcoin). Of the people left using (Bitcoin), some of *those* people said "Hahaha, ok but seriously guys we want to change the way bitcoin works just a *teensy* bit" (Segwit2x). The rest of the community said "Fuck you, we're *still* sticking with the current method" (Bitcoin). The Segwit2X people said "Fine, we're going over to BitcoinCash then, fuck you, and we're taking the miners with us!". 
The miners were the children in the divorce, and they pick the parent they favor based on who has the best payout (Incident last weekend where prices went crazy and Bitcoin transactions slowed). The kids went over to dads (bitcoinCash) for the weekend which made mom sad and mad, lots of yelling between mom and dad (BitcoinCash price surge, drama in forums), but in the end the kids have decided to stay with mom (bitcoin) for now (transactions going through).
As for Segwit2x - That was a party Mom and Dad were supposed to go to together; Mom didn't want to go in the first place and now that dad's gone no-ones into it anymore.
This recent nugget of news about the fork and the segwit2x stall? It sounds like a few people actually showed up to the party only to find out not only was party off, but that they were given the wrong address to begin with. It's really not a big deal though because the only people who were going were just there to eat all the food and leave (Sell the segwit2X coins for more bitcoin).

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:11:06

Segwit for now, lightning network eventually. Core devs view Bitcoin more akin to an asset like gold than a day to day transactional currency like the USD or credit cards. With that in mind, longer confirm times are viewed as not too big a deal for now. Im sure you're getting a bit more of a feel for how the community was split over this...
For what it's worth *everyone* was caught off guard with the massive influx of new users/transactions this last short while.

Ya, I was being funny. But lets be honest one of the biggest reasons Bitcoin is on top is being the first and the branding. If core devs had said a year ago "Ya, we're doing 2 mb for now". No one would have complained. And if we take a step further back and look only at the tech... Is Bitcoin *really* the best? That's why this recent split is so maddening, it's like in a war of soda companies Coca-cola splits because one team added a half teaspoon more vanilla to the vat.

Stumbled on this so I'll answer:
Don't keep your coins on Quadriga. You'll understand when you see posts of an exchange being inaccessible, going down, hacked etc. 
Best wallet... Eh, hard to say. I love my ledger nano s for longer term storage. Safe, not fucked if you lose it (and have your keys backed up). Paper wallet is good as well imo, though it's more physically fragile. Up for debate, really depends on what you prefer though, both are safe. For apps I like electrum, but I only keep smaller amounts on there
No need to make a separate bank account. Banks gonna do their thing regardless. You're legal so its all good.
Uploading photos etc... Eh... Hard to say. I mean, you have to if you want to use those exchanges as per (Canadian) law. Equifax got hacked last year so even the main stream populace is at risk with those guys. I say you're fine - I've submitted my docs to a half dozen sites now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:32:18
Lol, gotta hold out for that Crypto Large-Cap ETF.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:18:06
I think the next attack vector will be from Russia or China, maybe pressing CORE devs down a certain path. Maybe throwing superior hashpower to destabilize the system. Maybe set up a (insecure)wallet/exchange, let it gain popularity then run off with coins in hand. A purposeful MTGOX 2.0
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:12:25
Tend to agree. Would be a lot of trust lost to screw over all the adopters since the fork who bought BTC. I could see another coin taking place as number one some day, but not BCH, and not today.

@_date: 2017-11-19 16:58:59
Eh... Not to be 'that guy' but if you're in to get rich and scared you'll lose... This is a BAD investment choice for you, no offense. The market eats emotional investors just like any stock market.
If you're actively interested in the tech, then you're coming from a better angle. If you start learning why your coins can't be hacked, what confirmations are, what a soft vs hard fork is and how to get your coins from one fork and when it's safe. Maybe why Bitcoin is minded with ASICs vs other coins, what a hardware wallet is as opposed to running bitcoin-qt on your computer, what a 51% attack is, dust attacks... 
The short version is you gotta get your head into those things or when news comes out you'll be in full panic mode like last weekend was for a TON of new people and you'll get chewed up. In the investing world we are what you would call 'at all time highs', which *can* mean we are prime for a 'correction'. Or not. No-one knows. Would you be happy with 10% gains next year? That blows the stock market out of water. Would you hold as you slowly bleed 50% of your value as some new altcoin takes off to triple digit gains?
Sorry for the meandering reply... short version is, be careful if you get invested. Not for weak hands.

Nvidia, ASUS, AMD, Intel, Gigabyte, Saphirre are some of the bigger GPU manufactures, which supply to an even larger range of video card manufacturers. Compare to all I can find for ASIC mining: Bitmain, Coinminer, Avalon. The ASIC manufacturers produce nowhere near the amount of hardware the GPU companies do, service a smaller niche crowd. Worth mentioning Bitmain also mine coins, run a pool, and have a patent on some modification which essentially blocks others wanting to enter the space (asicBoost)
Most people who own a computer has some sort of GPU already. That's a very diverse range of people who already own (potential) mining hardware.
**Short version:** For to suggest there are only 2 GPU manufacturers, and that ASIC mining or manufacturers is as decentralized as GPU mining is inaccurate at best.

Well... Many (most?) investors feel the stock market is overbought right now as well. In the stock market the gains have been slow, sustained, steady. And is supported at least somewhat by fundamentals (business is good, USA is safe, employment is decent, etc). Conversely bitcoin has gone hyperbolic this last year with no real catalyst that I can see at least. Make no mistake, Bitcoins value is based largely on what the next person is willing to pay. The rest comes from its use a utility. What's that worth exactly? Today its $12000. 
Gold bugs hate to think about it, but same goes for gold. The 'utility' of gold is that it's a store of value. I don't think jewelry is much of a utility, especially these days, but eh... a bit I guess. And gold is used a little bit in industry/electronics. Enough to justify the valuation...? Well then we're back to the same questions we have for Bitcoin.

Not really. All my Bitcoin holdings are pre-fork. Not sure if you know what a fork is, but simple version is that's where bitcoin and bitcoin cash parted ways. Sounds complicated, but people who hold coins before a fork get coins on *both* chains. There's also a more recent bitcoin gold fork, but that might complicate things for you.

I've been investing since early 00's, and held a little Bitcoin since 2014. I think every investor needs to have that one experience where they take a loss. Everyone assumes they are comfy with risk until they see a -80% staring themselves in the face. My first Bitcoin was at the 2013/2014 peak, and I saw that value drop from $1000+ to $300 or so. I'd been doing stocks for a while though, so I bought a bit more regularly in that time; Didn't try and time anything, just regular purchases. 
Around that time I admittedly got tired of the crypto subreddit drama, threw my coins on a hard drive and unsubscribed. I came back when I saw Bitcoin was in the news... So here I am again.
If Bitcoin goes down to $5000 over the next 6 months you're going to see a lot of people slowly making exits and cutting losses. I grew up in poverty no-one knows more than me the stress of what happens if I fuck with my savings.
Don't gamble. Ignore FUD, or at very least don't trade on it. If you can't handle that, pull some money back out for a while until you find a comfortable level. These subs are toxic if you're an emotional investor.
See you next year.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:15:22
Yes.... But it's a bit more complex that this.
One of the terms Mastercard/Visa has is that to accept these cards, the merchant is not allowed to charge more to people that used credit cards over cash. Any 'extra fees' are absorbed by all customers. Bitcoin does not have consumer protections, this is a big one. If I buy something with a credit card, I can run a chargeback. Not with Bitcoin. This of course is a benefit to the customer and a penalty to the merchant, but as a customer credit/debit comes way ahead.
Then there is the hardware and training. Not hard for all us nerds in here to learn, but my mom will 'just want to pay and get out'. Bitcoin has to be at *least* as easy as credit cards for [laggards]( to get on board. The piece of mind of being able to 'just call Visa' is under-rated.
I love bitcoin, have bought lost of things with various crypto... I do not see it taking market share from payment processors any time soon.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:19:32
It's the wild west right now. Bitcoin is winning because it has the brand and adoption, but the tech in other coins is at LEAST on par, often times better. The dev teams on Bitcoin are either centralized (Core), or uncoordinated (Bitcoin Cash), straight up failures (Bitcoin Segwit2x), or unadopted (Bitcoin gold).
Also you should know... when forks like these happen, holding for a while is often the safe bet - Wait until there is a clear winner before dumping the less popular coins on an exchange.

Do you really think the two forks are so wildly different that its the tech that made the difference? I'll bet if Core team increased block size like Bitcoin Cash did no one would bat an eye. Hard fact for you to chew on, Bitcoin's biggest advantage is that it has first mover advantage and branding.

Oh god man, no not at all. Look, you do your taxes the way you see fit, but capitol gains taxes kick in when those gains are realized by exchanging for something else. There are probably instances where you can claim 'in kind' (Like when you move stock from one account you hold to another account you hold, you may be able to convince the taxman no sale actually happened).
If you buy a bitcoin for $1, sell it for $1000, you have to tell the taxman about that $999 in capitol gains. What happens at that point depends on where you live, in Canada capitol gains is a bit different.

@_date: 2017-11-12 22:09:28
Pretty much. Safeset move imo is to hold both and play both sides until there is a winner.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:01:33
Bitcoin spits out rewards in pre-determined intervals. In the beggining, every reward was huge. Lots of supply. As time goes on, less and less are mined, which means new coins get more and more scarce. The interval where the reward is dropped is called the halving, because half the coins from before are being rewarded. 
Make sense?
The hard fork is like this: JK Rowling is going ahead with a new Harry Potter book. All the books written until now are accepted by everyone. She give an outline to two ghost writers to continue the story. Which book counts as being canon, and which is the fanfic? 
Us, the readers (users) decide. Everyone wants to be the official book. No-one wants to find out they're only reading a fanfic.

Nothing on reddit, too many people split on bitcoin, wanting 'their team' to win. Best advice I can give, having been through this before, is put your coins in storage and leave them for a bit. It's not worth 'using' Bitcoin right now. Split your coins if you want, but keep both chains.
People on both sides are trying to steal from the other. Shady shit going on right now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:26:17
I feel the same way
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:33
Controversial opinion, I think split coins should be kept by the exchange. Encourage people to not treat exchanges like a fucking savings account. They are holding your Bitcoin only; Want to fork your coins, do it yourself imo.

Tend to agree. I keep generally quiet on crypto in my friend circles, people know it's something Im into, but thats it. This last 3 months or so I've had a number of people ask me how to buy it, how it works, all that stuff. NO-ONE has asked where to make purchases ("Cashing out" doesn't count).
And at the risk of angering the crypto fanatics: As a consumer, credit cards and debit beat Crypto for purchases... It's a hands down fact. Even if we do want a transacting crypto, the deflationary  and hard to buy nature of Bitcoin specifically makes it a bad choice; Why buy when I can save?

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:26
Right now a lot of people are 'finally getting in'. I'd say we're at the peak of the adoption chart. [Near the middle]( when people who generally are into new tech but aren't bleeding edge start getting in. This is when your construction worker buddy, your aging uncle, the secretary at work starts getting interested. Same thing with instant messaging software, Facebook, 'getting a blog'. Saying that, we *are* going to have a huge crash. Easily could go down 75%, and it will be a long slow bleed when it does. 
Big question is, 75% from when/where? It's going to be a stressful next few months, so if anyone needs some good adult diapers I got a guy.

Keep both coins, let the plebs fight it over. To be honest considering Bitcoin and BitcoinCash are almost the EXACT SAME THING, with the same limitations and issues... It would be a good time for a technologically sound altcoin to swoop in.

Not such a big worry for me IMO. If you don't know what to do it's safe to just do nothing for a while and see what happens after the dust settles. That's what I'm doing. Hell, lots of big Bitcoin players are doing that (See all the heat exchanges and wallet developers are getting for not choosing sides). Honestly the best move is to sit it out for a few weeks or so, see who wins and go from there. If, later on, *both* coins exist like with Bitcoin cash, then you can sell the one you don't like and buy more of the one you do.

@_date: 2017-11-14 02:18:45
Everyone used to play Monopoly with  standard rules. A bunch of people said "The game is more fun if we have more houses and hotels. Team A (btc) said the "games fine with the hotels we have" team B (bch) said fine, we'll make our own rules and add the hotels and houses to make it play faster. Most of the people stay playing original rules with team A. Some of the bigger players of team A (Roger Ver etc) said "ok, we'll keep playing with the main team, but we have to speed up the game somehow". They suggested a smaller rule change - one house counts as 2 houses (Sexwit2X). Team A (btc, the guys that own the board), told the players (Roger Ver etc) "Na, were cool." Roger says "Fine, I'll go play with team b then, but we'll have to share the guy that plays the banker" (Miners). The guy that plays banker always plays with the guys that have the best snacks (Best block reward), meaning the larger team A has to play a shitty, slow game when the banker goes to the other guys house. (Transactions get backed up).
So right now you've got 2 teams of people playing almost the *exact* same game, but due to a super minor difference everyone's getting evangelical over those minor difference, as if the number of houses and hotels in the box is something to get worked up over.
Hard to ELI5 something like this, but that's my attempt.

My thought is this: Both were Bitcoin. Then the fork. Both are Bitcoin. HODL both, because both have the potential and ability. At this point it's really about branding and picking sides. And if you never sold either fork, you've never had to pick.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:53:42
The unfortunate thing is, anyone that bought bitcoin since the BTC/BCH split just got fucked. I hold both, but buddy of mine has been getting interested in bitcoin and theres a non-zero chance he's been buying on a chain that may not be the main chain.
Bad new for adoption - Same thing could happen to BCH again if the power-users want to. Im telling everyone to stay on the sidelines for now.

The back and forth narrative is part of the Chinese negotiation culture. It's playing hardball, knowing full well they can change laws/rulings/'precedent' as they see fit.

It acts like one though. Pick a fork, adoption is your defacto vote.

He accepts Bitcoin, tweeted about Bitcoin, and with a few other people are building a platform who's core payment structure will be built with the goal of receiving payment that cannot be influenced by credit card companies. If you sincerely think he has never said the word "Bitcoin", lets lock up some funds in a smart contract bet that make it worth my time to comb through his Patreon to find it.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:43:05

@_date: 2018-03-01 15:31:08
Well ya, but he knew about Bitcoin before more than most, and should know the economics behind it better than anyone. I get that he's all in on one, but if he hedges with gold Im shocked hes not hedging with Bitcoin. I got *into* gold largely because of Schiff. (And I got *out* of gold because it was a pain in the ass and expensive to buy, store, sell).
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:18:26
I doubt there is much/any corelation there, but if ever Bitcoin overtakes gold as a safe haven from a correction, shits going to go wild. 
And imagine if crypto starts sipping from bonds (which currently pay close to nothing)
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:59:08
Ok, here's a tweet from him then:
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:20:13
Great analogies actually. Better than the way I've been explaining it; Bitcoin is the value, blockchain is for transactions, lightning network wants to compete with credit cards; Might not beat credit cards for day-to-day, but is poised to disrupt with micropayments.
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:17:20
I don't watch everything he posts. The guy makes a lot of content. If you require a soundbite, I dont have the time to hunt one down for you. You hate him *regardless* of the 2 pro-Bitcoin examples from him anyway, so to be fair, it's a moot point even if he became the next Bitcoin mouthpiece on CNN.

TIL people still care about BCH. It's not even a competitor - Different roadmap, different plan... The only difference is that the BCH devs can use things they like from BTC devs. BCH is more a competitor to LTC imo. And even though LTC is 'worth less' (by cap) I prefer LTC top to bottom over BCH.

Eh, I'm not into arguing which is more important; Consensus vs immutability. I think what Eth did in the early days made sense at the time and in the situation. Holders got both sides of the fork so they could either play both sides and keep both, or dump one and lock in.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:31:37
Sounds like a gift card to me.

Eh, article is skint on details. This seem WAY shadier and riskier than bonds. How are the petros 'tied' to their oil reserves? Trustlessly? Can we audit how much oil is there to put a true price to the currency? Venezuela is already well known for corruption, so while they wont be able to just 'print more' coins, they can get around that by 'selling more' of their stash.
I'm predicting Venezuelaconnnneeeeeeeeeeeeect

Lol, Warren Buffet wouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 12 foot pole. He's been very outspoken about why he doesn't like  gold as an investment, and Bitcoin parallels everything he doesn't like about gold.
I fucking love Warren Buffett. Berkshire is my largest security holding. He's a very smart man that I think people would do well to listen to. Saying that, he is notoriously averse to technology stocks, especially new tech. And absolutely would never invest one red penny in Bitcoin.

Ok, so what happens if the project goes over budget? What happens if on Game day ABC (third party) doesn't air the commercial? Ad company has fulfilled their obligation, they still have to get paid. What if the commercial gets clipped by sensors and need reshoots, does the smart contract have a provision for that? What happens if the ICO runs out of money before the commercial is done? Does the ICO automatically collect more money? Who's left holding the bag? I see no way an ICO can account for all of these variables. And I definitely don't think you could move at the pace of production if you're voting on contracts through the process. And I dont know enough about immutable contracts, but what happens if you need to change the smart contract after its made to account for future unknowns?
Short version is I see smart contracts as a massive hindrance in any scenario I can think of. - Full disclosure, I work in post production and have actually worked on a couple Superbowl ads (art side, nothing to do with the contracts but know the agency side of that process pretty well)

Sorry, no those are price to earnings ratios. At the risk of having someone rip my head off for oversimplification, it's market sentiment over the potential for the stock to do well. Traditionally 15-30 means people are happy with it, lower means it may be underestimated, over 45 means it may be overvalued.
With that in mind, Amazon and Netlfix are priced "Well out of fundamentals". 


Sure, but think of how much more Amazon has to expand to catch up to it's valuation.
Full disclosure: I've done well investing, but do not take any advice from me on anything, ever.

Eh, not really. Aside from stocks that pay out dividends, stocks are ownership of a company. That includes assets, contracts etc. That's often why investors will complain about cryptocurrency and say things like "But it's not backed by anything". If you own shares of Apple, and apple goes out of business you own a portion of those assets. Granted it would be way less than what you paid for the stock, but that's where you get into the price-to-book calculations. And stocks generally 'cost' more than they are 'worth' because of expected future earnings/growth. (High p/e means people have high hopes for the company)
None of these calculations work for Bitcoin. That's why many people (myself included) think of Bitcoin more akin to gold than shares in a company.

It's been a while since I've done it and I don't have an option on me to get the details perfect, but...
The idea is in your wallet you write a message. That gets 'scrambled' by a code generated by your private key. The only way to unscramble it is with a that code. So you send that scrambled code and your original message to someone. In *their* wallet they enter your message in one field, and the scrambled code in another. Their wallet can confirm that "This message was scrambled by a person who has access to that private key".
Does that make sense?

See, so here's where I'm confused. Lets say you have these tokens, that means the company (Depending on the product) would want to restrict growth/resources. Access to a supercomputer?

It's funny, I've been suggesting this since I got into Bitcoin. I think competing with the likes of Visa as a payment processor/facilitator is a losing battle. I'd love to see higher retail adoption, maybe online, but I see no way Bitcoin could compete with Visa Tap with confirmation times. Nor is there any kind of consumer benefit like with Visa, and fees are borne by the customer, not the vendor.
But as an asset, now we're fucking talking. For years there has been speculation that Fort Knox doesnt hold all the gold it says it does, and has fought a full audit. Want to audit a Bitcoin user? Get him to sign a message. Prove you're a millionaire. Easy. Hell, it's how we would prove someones claim to being Satoshi.
Bitcoin for me is more akin to gold than day to day cash. I *do* spend Bitcoin to test the system. But I'll tell you this... I prefer Visa.

Im sorry you feel that way, because I legit would want to see a working case for smart contracts. I just feel many (most?) people into the idea of smart contracts are ignoring how it would break down in practice.
Some backstory on why I view Eth/smart contracts with a critical eye: I bought some Eth earlier this year, and looked into smart contracts. I thought it would be a perfect way to run a hands off betting script - Simple dice roll. Spoke to some tech smart contract guys who pretty much said at some point there needs to be trust. They also said there would always be a way to manipulate "random", even if someone had the skill to write top-tier bombproof code (Which most programmers are not able to do).
Add to that I work in this specific industry, and the idea of doing contracts, art directing, payments, legal issues/mediation all through democracy and/or code... I'm exceedingly apprehensive.
FWIW, the 'no true random' is why I got 100% out of Eth.

Some things to consider: 
I have found many, many more places that accept Bitcoin as payment than I have for gold.
Gold is much, much more expensive to store and transport.
Gold is much, much [harder to audit]( 
Current estimated "Market cap" of gold: $7.7 trillion dollars USD
Current estimated "Market cap" of Bitcoin: $0.1 trillion dollars USD
I try to be a little self aware and avoid the bitcoin circlejerk, but I could absolutely see Bitcoin taking some market share from gold strictly as a store of value and hedge against currency/inflation.
And I don't think it will ever happen, but imagine if international countries also started treating Bitcoin as a [reserve currency]( That's where valuation would blow up - We're not comparing Bitcoins valuation to companies like Apple, we're comparing them to *national economies*.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:44:07
I would like to see how that would work. Not meaning to shit on Eth, but real questions. My scenario:
Money goes into a smart contract, whats the trigger? Once we reach a certain threshold? Cool. Now who gets the funds? Shit, we have to **trust** that the person will finish and not walk away with funds. Pay after completion? The workers will have to **trust** the funds will be eventually be released to them. Ok, how about half at temp delivery/half upon completion (Similar to how commercials are paid for)? Ok, we have to **trust** either the workers to say when temps/finals are done, or trust the... Client? Fuck, it's a community, not a client. Who approves the work? Can we **trust** them?
Ok fine, lets just go balls to the wall, we (somehow) get a bunch of  *qualified* volunteers to do the commercial, and get paid out when its on the air. How are the funds triggered to be sent to pay the workers? Do we *trust* the community to release the funds once the commercial airs? What if they don't like the add and people vote *no* out of spite?
I will admit I've not got my head into Eth enough to talk too much about it, but I've yet to see a way something useful can be truly trustless. And at that point I'd prefer to **trust** an agreed upon 3rd party to do the escrow.

I forced myself to get my old coins sorted after the whole Bitcoin cash thing. If you want to 'separate' your coins:
**After the fork (wait a week or two or whenever the subreddit says the dust has settled)**
* Backup your wallet.dat and/or private keys.
* In your BITCOIN wallet, send your coins to a new address. Let that shit get some confirmations.
* Once that's done, download a wallet that supports S2X
* Import your (Old, now empty) Keys or wallet.dat into that S2X wallet. Holy shit you still have coins there wtf woo!
* Sell those S2X coins on an exchange, get your free money.

The ego to say Warren Buffett is foolish for passing on Bitcoin is mind blowing to me. He know's enough about Bitcoin to see it as an asset not unlike gold. He's quite a smart and quotable fellow though so I'll leave you with a quote of his that replies more succinctly and articulately than I could:
"The trick in investing is just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot. And if people are yelling, 'Swing, you bum!,' ignore them."
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:21:35
Ok, I like a good circle jerk over Bitcoin as much as the next person, but Warren Buffett would be one of the most anti-Bitcoin investors you could ever quote. Here's a few ones he thinks about gold:

* Good dev.
* Decent (relative) adoption.
* Cool potential tech (smart contracts)
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:07:49
The author, who claims to have "studied both legends in depth…", completely avoids saying *why* Munger and Buffet dislike bitcoin so much. It's not about 'trust in digital assets' or the fact its only 9 years old or that they 'just dont get the tech'.
They dislike gold for a similar reason: It's a non income generating asset. To quote Warrens opinion on gold "Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or some place. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head."
But the author purposefully misses the mark on why they hate Crypto so specifically and so strongly. Because their reasoning is a hard truth: Much of crypto is a pump-and-dump pyramid scheme draining money from suckers in a fight to be the last one holding the bag. "FOMO" is so counter to Warren and Mungers core values, so having a full asset class that is driven by FOMO angers them on a deeply personal level. The painful truth that this author misses is that they are not completely wrong. Pump and dump groups, scamming ICO's, "I wish I hadn't missed out" sob stories, more exchanges than vendors... 
Im pro Bitcoin. I legit got involved because I like being up on the latest tech, but everyone I know in person only cares about how much the price has moved. I've yet to see a person in the wild even know what Lightning network is, let alone care about the strides in dev.
**TLDR:** Ignore Warren and Mungers opinion on Bitcoin if you like, but have the integrity to accept *why* they dislike it; It's *not* because they 'don't understand the technology' but because they despise shills using peoples fear and greed to get them swept up in hype to throw their money into high risk non-income producing asset.

Dude... Holy shit check the smug. Warren has said his entire investing career that he avoids sectors he doesn't understand. Tech being a big one. Secondly he is a value investor, and Bitcoin being backed by no assets, has no management structure, is bleeding edge tech, and is fueled by speculation more than utility. 
He's a fabulous investor now, and avoiding tech has done him very well. Bitcoin's price has done well, but lets be a little self aware here.

Lol, don't feel sorry for Warren Buffett. He happily passes on gold for the same reason. And he passes on tech in general. To paraphrase his outlook on investing, he's like a batter in baseball. For ever swing and a miss, you get a strike. Some people swing at everything, and their batting average goes down. Warren only swings at pitches that are in his comfortable zone. And his batting average is sick
Add to that the fact he is the worlds greatest *value investor*, and insanely good at picking out good management/CEO's. Non of that skill picking businesses can be applied to valuing a cutting edge new asset class in a sector he is notoriously wary of.

And there's the crux of it. This guys heads in the noose if the stake holders decide "No thanks". Even in an escrow/forfeit situation, once the commercial airs you're trusting anonymous people to honor releasing funds. Or if it's a time based, no votes required thing, that the ad company does it's best. (In the latter case they are getting paid no matter what, so put your C-tier team on it.)
I don't know how a smart contract would work if the contract needed to be amended. (And in production these are approved and negotiated quickly by higher ups the company trusts.)

I buy coins, spend them, buy more. I buy things to see how the use-ability is, try new things (Bitpay, purse.io, people who happen to accept Crypto). Technically I take a loss a lot of the time, because of the cost of buying and transaction fees, but it's the price I pay to test the system.

I don't see why decentralization helps for anything other than funding in this scenario. If democratically voting on every item that comes up is a good way to run a project like this, I'd need to see it in action first. I'd take the 'risk' of having a real person I can talk to that I can sue for breach of contract if they mess around over a sea of faceless voters debating every question that comes up. And unless these voters are available on call, 24/7. ALL of them for every vote, you'll have to trust the ones who are awake to drive the ship.

Is the safest way not to simply transfer the BTC to a new address, then use the previous key to claim the fork? New coins are safely in a new wallet, only risk is to the forked coins. This is how I've split all my coins so far anyways.

I wonder why. Keep transaction fees up?
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:00:06
They got in late and feel the tech is missing all these new fancy bells and whistles other coins have. And they might be right in a small way, but Bitcoin has been stress tested, attacked, and survived. Bitcoin has WAY more developers (Not just talking CORE, but people building tools and infrastructure for BTC). Bitcoin has pushed for adoption, and while that has fallen a few steps backwards in recent months, most other coins' utility is just to daytrade or speculate.
Bitcoin has some legacy concerns but it's still the most globally known and used coin out there.

$2581.07 USD on 2017.09.01. We've seen higher prices than this recently, so it may be a boring prediction, but my reasoning is that this is the trend currently. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:00:20
To clarify: Buy coins on main fork. Then make your own fork. Coins before the fork exist on all forks. More forks means more coins.

It's funny, off all the shit theories that get posted here (Lots of them), Bitcoin becoming a solid alternate to gold is something I've thought could happen for a while. Mostly because I used to be a bit of a gold bug, sold it all and dumped the money right into crypto. One of the best financial moves I've ever made.

Summary: fuck you OP
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:46:45
It had 82 upvotes, little disagreement. The OP, has not mentioned how far off the last prediction was in the most recent prediciton post. Unsurprisingly, is posting more bullish 'tech analysis' this week. This time even though we are $600 below last prediction, now predicts a quick bullish move from $2409.09 to $2,691 "in the next few days".
Gotta be careful when you're riding the hype train.
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:13:00
To be fair it's likely an alt.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:07:19
Haha, I was joking around. Props to you for saying when you don't understand. When Bitcoin forks, all coins made before the fork will exist in both chains. But, the important part to note is that people will only accept coins from one fork. Lets give them names for example: Bitcoin forks, giving us our coins on both BitcoinA and BitcoinB. Amazon wont say "We accept BitcoinA and BitcoinB" because that wouid mean you're able to spend those coins twice. Amazon would say "We only accept BitcoinA", which means coins before the fork: All good. Coins created after the fork will only work if they are BitcoinA coins.
**TL;DontCare:** I can make all the forks I want, but unless a majority of Bitcoin users accepts my fork, coins on my forks are pretty much worthless.

The crazy thing is, Jordan leans Liberal and used to be very active with the NDP (leftmost of our 3 major parties). Granted he is open about his dislike of Trudeau (I've gone that way recently myself). That's a far step away from far or 'alt right' that he gets labeled as

No, back in the 90's people were much more friendly and helpful to noobs. Bitcoin is in a different social era. And in the 90's internet users weren't using FOMO to get people interested. The internet sold itself.

Its for a business purpose. For what I need as a utility, QR codes are perfect - Direct link to the address on the block chain so people can see 'OK, this address has this much Bitcoin'. The downside in my case is QR codes are difficult to make look 'pretty' from a design perspective, and worse yet the design has the stigma of being in the league of low-effort ad campaigns on the London tube.
Snaptag is a step better look, but there is low/no adoption as far as I've seen... I'm aware that what Im hoping for may not exist.  
**Edit** The snapchat code is interesting, Ive not seen that before. Im not sure it will work for my purpose, but thats very interesting, thanks..!

I'm not sure what your position is, but after the controversy Lindsay's life in campus was purposefully made into hell,  and her career in that field is all but impossible. Saying that, she's turned that negative into an excellent positive for herself at very least.
Since graduating she's posted what some of her former class content, and man, Wilfred Laurier looks like a pretty lame institution
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:11:08
He took off only after his teaching position and practice was at risk. I can see why his enemies would hate that, but it is what it is. Then again, Im up in Canada so people like Jordan Peterson get labeled alt-right Nazis, but BLM is like teflon for all of their shady dealings up here.
And the crazy thing is I lean left, so if *I* see this kind of lop-sided shit it must be even worse viewed by someone who is objective.

@_date: 2018-12-28 18:34:38
Oh man, if you don't know who he is you're in for a treat..! There is a bit of irony in this lawsuit. He was one of the loudest people to speak out against the government's implementation of 'compelled speech' legislation in Canada. (We don't have free speech the same way Americans do). An obtuse summary: If you don't use preferred pronouns you are now guilty of a crime under the human rights act.
Some people high up in academia got caught lying about provably wrong things about him in a very public and embarrassing controversy that exposed Wilfred Laurier and their conduct towards Lindsay Shepherd. The school doubled down on their position in that so  Jordan decided to help Lindsay throw some salt in their wounds with a second lawsuit.
That's more or less the summary as I see it
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:02:09
I sure have, ever heard of virtue-signalling? All sorts of new-school terms in this social landscape! Do you *sincerely* think Jordan Peterson is covertly aiming to be a figurehead or mouthpiece for the far right? Outside of baseless conspiracy theories I've not seen anything that would suggest that at all.

No-one could actually watch him and think that. He's been labeled enemy number one of the socially progressive far-left, most people parrot what they assume his position is. 95%+ of what Jordan talks about isn't even about the new pronouns.
