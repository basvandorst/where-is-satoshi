Bitcoin-restricting legislation needs to pass. The clowns who believe we need the government on our side are wrong and completely misunderstand the paradigm. 
This is the cusp of digital systems replacing Industrial systems. Effectively, these people are the same as government politicians who insist on forcing government into religious paradigm. 
Government becomes more irrelevant every day. Stop concerning yourself with a failed, legacy system and build for tomorrow 
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:27:07
Only when I'm correct
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:50:26
Oh. Well firstly alcohol. Secondly, The State changes to suit contemporary paradigms. 
Society evolves. It's not that there is a particular order, if anything the different civics are constantly at odds. 
[The list is pretty long](
Forms of government are reflective of the period. For example, the nomad/farmer roots of humanity. Eventually the meat-eating, weapon-toting, warrior nomads figured out they could raid the grain-eating, tool-toting, pacifist farmers. The more 'progressive' ones figured out tithing/taxation and -blam- the State/Social Contract was born. 
There are lot of folks who think the State moves society forward, but I disagree. It's innovation and invention that spurs change and ultimately advances humanity. 
That matters because as society advances it becomes more difficult for whatever the State is to keep up. For example, [an Industrialized people likely wouldn't tolerate religious Imams making their laws](
[It's a long and interesting list]( but societal regression usually leads to greater restrictions on individual liberty and freedom. Advancements are just the opposite. 
I used that comparison because the people who tell us we need the government involved in Bitcoin are like the American founders who said they favored Religion over the opportunity to form a Republic. It's my belief that most of us are going to be alive to see the end of the Nation State. It won't totally go away, but it will exist the same way the Religious State exists today. It will be small, likely voluntarily, and they'll probably knock on your door to solicit you.
I also chose that comparison because the advanced parts of the world are moving on from industrial society and into a digital one. There will be a new form of governance that comes out of the maturity of the digital era because the level of innovation and creation of new technology/ways to live will outpace the ability of contemporary governments to have any effect. 
Bitcoin is the keystone to all of that. It gives you a way to spend your resources on the form of governance that works for you. Without the ability to tax, modern governments cannot exist. The demand they attempt to satisfy does not go away their absence just leads to the opportunity for someone else to try and satisfy.
Power never rescinds power. Government is not just going to transition power away from itself into organizations chosen by small groups of people. It's going to take small groups of people withholding their funds from government and using that money to form their own communities and ways of governing themselves. Bitcoin let's thousands of small groups like that form together into really large groups.
It failed, but The DAO was an interesting attempt. Essentially, we're forming private nation states. Nothing would stop a smart contract from hiring an army to protect itself, buying property, hiring firemen and police and paying them to enforce their rules.
That's amazing. And saying the government needs a hand in that is either outright malicious or entirely unimaginative.

I purposefully spread misinformation about private blockchains and have been waiting for a post like this. It's just a huge red herring on my part. 
There are zero use cases for a federated blockchain outside of the kinds of private interests made irrelevant by Bitcoin.
So my question is: What are you innovating outside of the blockchain that would make private blockchains useful. Because there is zero use case for them right now.

Neither you nor the OP have been able to show how either situation solves any problem or is useful to anyone in anyway. That is what I am asking.

@_date: 2016-08-25 00:25:39
No, no. I'm saying that there is no use case for a private blockchain. I'm asking you what problem you are solving. 
For example, Bitcoin is run entirely by private interests and contributions. In that sense, it is private. However, participation is open and the data is publicly available by nature so we refer to Bitcoin as having a public blockchain. We have a lot of great ways of using that and solving problems. The opposite isn't true just because it is the opposite.
Your post is nebulous. You never actually say what you consider a private blockchain, but I'm left to assume that it is one or both of:
1) Participation is limited
2) The data is only available privately.
So what problem do one or both of those things solve? What are you innovating? Your faux Q&amp;A with yourself was just, like, your opinion man. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:56:34
Stop giving politicians bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:55:39
Also, that perspective neglects time. E.g. there are a maximum number of addresses that can have funds - 1 satoshi in each. 
In addition to your metaphor the target is moving. You may generate a private key that maps to an address - but there is also the factor of a moving window of time where that private key would be valid. 
Basically, the target of possible valid addresses at any given time has a maximum value, but those numbers change with time as bitcoin is spent.

This is completely mitigated with a really old inventions -backups and synchronization. 
Banks currently share data. All the time. Are you proposing that Banks are constantly corrupting databases or that none of those people have thought about the inevitability of 'Those other guys might fuck up' - or have you never worked in a corporation and learned that most people are fucking up day in and day out and the majority of corporate leadership and process revolves around mitigating that via process?
You have not provided anything innovative and you are not doing anything different. You are just shoehorning a blockchain where it does not belong.

By this definition, colored coins cannot exist. Also, using coins for anything other than a denomination of bitcoin would fall outside your strict and limiting definition.
Some coins are going to be more valuable than others. This already happens. Mined coins are bought off-market and are considered more valuable than others. US Marshall Auction coins have different values than coins in circulation. Consumers who wish should be able to decide for themselves which transaction chains are suitable for themselves. This is how the market works.

Well maybe, Lincoln used the Greenbacks to fund his efforts in the Civil War, dollar hegemony wasn't even a thought. 
Even Continentals were just used to fund the war against Britain and even that currency was destroyed by British counterfeiters/pushers.
Dollar Hegemony did not come about until post WWII when the US had loaned money to everyone to fund their war efforts, most of the other industrialized nations' factories were destroy and at Breton Woods the US refused to accept repayment in anything other than dollars.
Germany forced the US to maintain a gold standard to attempt to stabilize the price/prevent the US from doing what it has done since Nixon took us off the standard.

Oki Doke. 
Pumping that much into a market turns you into the market. Kind of. You basically picked a number that is an entire power of ten greater than the current market's entire valuation. 
You probably couldn't actually buy all the available bitcoin for your 50B. The last people to sell always get the highest prices. Like the parable about the little old lady who refuses to sell her house when all her neighbors do because someone wants to put in a highway. Scarcity drives up the price. Furthermore, why would I divest 100% when I just made so much money?
Regardless, whatever share you end up with means you'll have to wait until enough innovation takes place to actually match your bubble. Maybe it'll take 15 years for the market to actually reach your valuation (aka a power of ten greater). Now that you've driven out so many people who will make these great innovations? Wouldn't it be easier to just work on Litecoin at that point? How's that going to help you?
But hey, you just bought the market. What you actually did was spend 50B empowering people who are way smarter than you. This is why the market is so great. You completely mismanaged 50B to 'buy' Bitcoin to influence only the projects you want. Great! Nothing says we have to help you now!
So you'd have created a slew of millionaires and billionaires - a great thing. And have little to show for it brother.

Yogurt mistakes capacity for thoroughput. It's self-evident.
Blocks have a maximum tx capacity. When the hash rate goes up between adjustments there is increased thoroughput. The rate of block production increases. There is zero change in capacity. Yogurt doubled down on their mistake here:

This is one of the best points made in a while.
Fiat systems can transfer value between media much faster than trustless systems. A 'benefit' of everything being made up and the points not mattering. (not really but some people still won't read that sarcasm)
It's not like the legislation would only be in the US, either. Global Banking makes Global legislation. 
In the future, instead of buying the fresh water rights of a nation, like in Bolivia, for a loan they'll just force you to use the bank's sovereign currency if you want a loan. Good thing the bank's currency is pegged to whatever value the bank says. After you get a loan they spin up the miners, patch, and suddenly supply increases 100 fold and the bank controls all of the new coins.

Rough Theoretical Max Tx per Block = 2,857
Current block reward = 25btc.

Ok, maybe I'm not the best person for you to talk to.
Bitcoin XT supports larger blocks. If 75% of the miners were to support it by this January there would be a contentious hard fork.
Like I said, maybe you don't consider that contentious but the entire community has been arguing about it since August. 
But you're wrong about it not being the proposal. Maybe I'm mixing up my BIP  but it says right on the XT page that the intention is to force larger blocks
I'm not going to take the time to step you through this. If you don't think a developer releasing a client and proclaiming doom and gloom unless everyone supports them a dictator, fine I don't care. It's Hearn's own words that Bitcoin needs a dictator - him or Gavin.
Effectively XT is a premine equivalent to Bitcoin's blockchain prior to the hard fork. That's why it's a parasitic altcoin. It creates a perverse incentive for larger miners and destroys decentralization.

I understand and appreciate your position. My perception on the risk of operating in this space and ignoring compliance with government systems is different from the business owners.
Every resource spent on government systems is wasted. It's a resource that could go toward developing Bitcoin. At the least, I hope the non-libertarians who visit this board can understand and appreciate the innate harm that does. 
E.g. For lack of better phrasing, this person is pulling a paycheck instead of developers. The only 'good' this person may do is keep the same wolves at bay that we're working to defang. We could just hurry along the development and make this person, and the arbitrary system she navigates, moot. But... men with guns...

Especially when Hearn came out and said he would force the contentious fork at XX date/time regardless of what anyone else said.

@_date: 2015-12-01 16:44:05
Yeah, religious zealots and socialists do that too - constantly calling out anyone who won't 'debate' their version of ideology. It gets old and moot.
Bitcoin - It's voluntary. Whatever standards you set for yourself don't matter. That's why none of us have to debate you. We don't have to engage you. We don't have to listen to you and we don't have to care about you. That's what makes voluntarism so freaking sweet.
I will take a hobbled, broken, low latency Bitcoin that is voluntary and free over a dictatorial XT any day.
There is no debate. There is code and who chooses to run it. XT lost. 


That is a great example of why the XT mindset fails. You can set whatever standard **for yourself** but you can't hold other people to them. You think Hearn makes a compelling, well explained and proven argument? Then go run XT and fuck off from our camp. If you are right, then you will win.

Hey guys, He's talking about BitcoinXT. Mike Hearn's parasitic implementation of Bitcoin that threatened a contentious fork of the entire network if people didn't do thing's Hearn's way. 
He wants to say "I support censoring everything in Bitcoin that disagrees with my chosen implementation. Which, coincidentally is what Mike Hearn thinks it should be. I don't like having to learn or think about the issues so I prefer dictators to make the decisions for me. That is one alternative but it's failed to achieve adoption so all I have left is coming to this forum and moaning and complaining."
The "don't want to be censored" thing is the edgy high schooler way of showing how rebellious they are without actually rebelling. Kind of like those Occupy Wallstreet folks who just sat around destroying public parks and sexually assaulting each other instead of doing anything. Actually, what a great allegory to XT Occupy is/was.

That would great.
I think the misunderstanding is economics, not Bitcoin. 
Let me explain why. Just like during an emergency prices go up. Price gouging is good because it ensures people with the means to afford resources are able to use them. It rewards the business owners and it attracts future business to that area that drives down prices. Yes. That means if you can afford it you deserve to use it more than the person who cannot afford it.
But anyway, who says fees should be low? The market should decide the fee. If $20 is what the market decides that is fine. If we have anything with crypto its freedom. If someone is able to figure out a way to do it better they are free to do so and win all of that business. 
What we are not free to do, however, is dictate the cost of a service provided to us.

I kind of disagree with your last statement.
My point is that having to put any resources into worrying about arbitrary government BS is wasted. 
Here's a metaphor: "We just spent $X Million to develop a weapon of war that will replace a $X Billion system."
One could say that $X millions are saved switching to the new system. To me, it is more accurate to say less is being wasted as war is not a requirement for society.
Government is not a requirement for society. Society exists, and at times thrives, in spite of government. Even if the cost/benefit analysis shows that BitFury will profit from the venture that just means that BitFury may benefit from using the legal system against competition. I would prefer that competition determine the victor - not who has the best political ties.

Not even Socialism can make the kind of economics work that you want (sarcasm, Socialism can't even make Socialism work). No one has ever made a successful business run by simply paying competitors to do what they want and then stopping. 
It just burns through money and has little, if any, actual effect. That said, I would welcome Goldman Sachs to subsidize miners all day long to mine whatever Goldman wants them to mine. 
It would be a huge shift in power. Goldman would turn itself into a giant funnel siphoning power away from paper fiat directly into the crypto ecosystem.

You are free to spend your money on anything you want. Some people will spend it better than you. Its not our fault if you miss the bus or cannot create something as valuable as us, or if you lack the sense to join us when the door is wide open to you.
Regardless, in your fantasy dystopia, those rich people can only spend their currency once. I think the 'scary' future you paint is wonderful because folks like you can't force folks like me to stay at your level. I am free to succeed or fail based on my decisions - not your opinions.

China has a pie, a few other people have pies, there are a few cupcakes, and then a whole lot of sprinkles everywhere. 
If you create an environment that starves out China their pie goes away. Many of the cupcakes and sprinkles will disappear too.

The principle you are trying to argue is what is the definition of Bitcoin and what does that encompass. You don't even realize that and expect other people to have a round-about discussion with you based on your appeals to what other people have said.

Market = people with a direct interest. E.g. people who own Bitcoin.
People = anyone with the means to voice their opinion
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:02:54
In a way, yeah. I agree that every hard fork is a new coin. 
To answer your q, even though it's rhetorical - yes the Bitcoin we use now would be an altcoin held up to Bitcoin 7 years ago. To me, anyway. 
wRBF, I stand by hard forks being altcoins. 
I also don't care or believe if Bitcoin is the dominant virtual currency. It's just a brand. I think iterations are a part of the market and the faster the fail/repair cycle happens the better. 
Personally, so far Bitcoin has moved in a direction I agree with. Moreso than any other crypto. 
Edit: I don't believe that early adopters benefit from much competition, unfortunately. With how markets/network effects work it's just kind of an externality for us. It's a higher priority to me that Bitcoin remain relatively unchanged until crypto becomes more popular because of that reason. I would prefer competition decide issues instead of debate. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:36:11

I don't think I said a bank coin would be more attractive to people.
You are correct, though. My point that maybe I didn't articulate so well is thus:










And then the bankers wait. They let the infrastructure grow, like a farmer waits for a crop. Then, when that economy's value reaches an all time high the bank increases the money supply XXXX fold. They create so much currency the original coin supply is dwarfed by multiple powers of ten. 
XbankerX ::begins selling 3WSlaveCoins for their market value until every last drop of value is siphoned and no one wants them. 
For XbankerX that is extremely attractive. Effectively, it continues the model JP Morgan copied from the European central banks in 1907 when he began cashing out, literally, to the government for power. 
To the 1% of the world, me and, likely, you, we can spend a few bucks every other paycheck for some bitcoin. The other 99% (exaggerated) of the world may not get a choice.

I wouldn't consider any fiat currency or currency whose monetary policy is rooted in government deflationary - even the ones that were backed by something like gold in the past. 
Given the current state of US Dollar hegemony I don't think the, valid, point that some currencies were deflationary in the past has anything to add.

You'll see governments trying to kickstart new currencies to fund militaries and probably massive amounts of military action to try and grab up as much traditional wealth as possible to pay off the soldiers who are being paid in the new currency.
Large governments won't care / have other ways to maintain power and mitigate its affect. Smaller governments will panic.
This is obviously untenable. After a period of 'chaos' the currencies will fail and the gap we've seen closing between fiat and bitcoin will start to grow again. This time bitcoin and dollars are flipped with bitcoin growing farther away from dollars. Wars become very difficult. Private industry rises above nation states. Software like DACs and DAOs take over governance functions ordinarily provided by governments. People have more wealth to take home. More jobs because why would I work when my currency and savings are increasing in value? Let the younger generations cut their teeth while the older ones lead.

Oh so you're going with your gut here?
For starters, for tx fees to cover block reward subsidies the fees are much larger than your 'logic'. I [wrote an article about it a year ago](
Your math is off. 
Regardless, you're proposing that miners will intentionally stifle throughput by refusing to include txs into blocks until we see a 105,000% increase in fees? 


This would be one of those things you could prove/show instead of saying 'logic.' Given how poor your math was before... It would be nice if you could do that.

Yes, You'll have 10 BTC on a parasitic chain and 10 BTC on a chain that has proven it fails to negotiate parasitic hard forks. Effectively, those 20 BTC are worth less than having 10BTC on a reliable platform. The split would do damage to the reliability.

Essentially three essays for:




I won't disagree that time and risk are a part of any transaction. But I think you ascribe things that more specifically belong under the Marketing &amp; Branding of Bitcoin than to transaction cost. And my opinion is that when I look at it from an austere Economic perspective I see it just the same as you. But it's a broad stroke. Bitcoin doesn't have customer service. This is an externality. I would not attribute this as part of the cost of a transaction, but I could see it being considered part of the cost of onboarding new or retaining current customers. And that's a stronger argument to me. 
Still, I find it no different than a post telling OP to 'RTFM Newb.' Wsending email, getting online, etc. I don't have a long term scaling plan or solution for Bitcoin. I will without any proof state I believe the way we use Bitcoin today is in no way similar to how people will use Bitcoin if we reach some level of mass adoption. If we want to account for time and change, we have to add other things into your equation: Cost to train &amp; Retrain as Software changes. Cost to educate and stay relevant with the technology. Time investment in paying attention to the market. Cost of hardware to maintain wallet Software. Security and fund management of some form, Network subsidy in the form of a block reward... etc. 
Economically, those also make sense to me as being part of the 'cost'. But I still think it's easier to leave those things where they belong, under more-specific umbrellas. And wait to worry about Customer Service when Bitcoin is at a point where it's ready for customers. 
[I want you to read this]( The Nielson Norman Group can show us that only 5% of people in first world countries have the ability to intelligently search through their email. 
The people who come here with these problems are customers. I agree with you, Economically, that customer service is part of some cost. Probably not a transaction cost, though. There is nothing that can be fixed about this until Bitcoin reaches some point where it is ready for Customers. Those are the 99% of people in the world who look at all of us with empty stares when we explain Bitcoin to them. Then, maybe your equation will be more important because those very customer service-centric factors will be central to many factors of ten more people.
There's an opportunity cost in time. We should be spending time developing the technology as a Software platform with solid fundamentals before we ever begin worrying about acquiring new customers.

I disagree, adamantly.
There is a very small precedent for governments to interfere with hardware manufactures, especially across nation-state borders, and on the scale that would be required. It would take nationalization of the entire industry, not just in one nation.
It is even more difficult for world powers to coordinate together and pressure vassal nations to act in unison. There will always be a home for hardware manufacturers. 
Furthermore, the international banking system is already in place and achieved hegemony. If you want to move fiat currency electronically you don't have any options.

@_date: 2016-03-03 16:02:33
Those figures are directly from the Lightening Network white paper. Since you're obviously a very well-rounded and studious person who educates themselves before forming an opinion around emotions...
300 Bytes / Transaction
47,000 Transactions per second = VISA peak
47,000 * 300 bytes = 14,100,000 bytes per second
14,100,000 bytes per second = 14.1MB / second
600 seconds per block * 14.1MB = 8,460 MB
So 8.5 Gigabytes. 
It's so hard to do basic math before ranting on an Internet forum, isn't it?


Now explain to me why it's so critical for adoption to compete against processors like VISA to raise the cap from 3.5-7tps to 7-14tps. Your battle is to wrench control of the governance model and the block size is the trojan horse. What you say is complete bullshit

This would be true if the cost of filling those sized blocks with transactions scaled with the difficulty it takes to verify them.

@_date: 2016-03-03 18:42:20
I appreciate you trying to agree but I think you are just placating me.
My point covers usability. Blantantly: 
The work to confirm 1MB of transactions is O(N^2 ) 
1 MB / 300 bytes = ~3,333 tx 
N = 3,333
2 MB / 300 bytes = ~6,666 tx
N = 6,666
3,333^2 scaling to 6,666^2 (miner scaling) is not the same as scaling from 3,333 to 6,666 (tx scaling).
Effectively, my point includes the fact that whatever usability problems we have now will be amplified quadratically from a block size increase. 
E.g. Transactions will still be backlogged on larger blocks just like now, usability will be impacted even greater than now because miners will have to potentially square the amount of work they are already doing.

Everyone? I don't think we have a crowd. You can just say "I am wondering..." Instead of Fox Newsing it, akin to "Some people say..."
I'm not sure what part you are confused about. 
If Bitcoin suddenly skyrockets to a million gazillion a coin - it won't - its not like someone is going to come knocking on your door. Unless you made the mistake of outing yourself or you hold your coins on Coinbase.
It makes far more sense for a recently minted millionaire via Bitcoin to casually make their way to a country with low taxes, secure citizenship there, renounce US citizenship with the intention of never paying taxes, then convert your BTC to USD. 
Unless something crazy has happened wlegislation I believe the US gov doesn't even tax you until the point of conversion anyway. Alternatively, just live off bitcoin.
Yes. You caving to interrogation is a breakdown in security. It's YOUR breakdown in security, as in you are the point of failure. Not Bitcoin.

Because the "Raise it to 2MB" is arbitrary, circular logic. It is trivial to fill 1MB, 2MB, 8MB, shit it's trivial to fill 8GB blocks.

Sure. There was a study on Bitcoin over Tor a while back. IIRC they used Bitcoin's highly predictable traffic patterns to deanonymize it, too.


Yes. I heated my apartment with GPU miners. I only had 4-5 of them. That was 3-4 years ago. ASICs are many powers of ten more powerful and efficient. However, [Chinese miners submerge their equipment to help vent the heat](
There was a mining company that raised funds/IPO'd on Bitcointalk that proposed setting up a mine in the basement of a hotel/apartment building and using it for heating and saving thousands.

@_date: 2016-03-01 23:26:12
Sure, some transactions are more difficult to verify for the miners than others. 
For example, I can tell you "Go in that room and count everyone" It will take O(n) time where n = # of people. O() is a notation.
If I tell you "Go in that room and count each person and double check your work" it becomes O(2n) but the 2 doesn't matter. In a year or two processing speed makes it 1n.
But if I tell you "Go in that room and count each person then have each person count each person as well" it becomes O(n^2 ) 
Some transactions force a miner to run O(n^2 ) and no amount of processing increases will change that.
To fill a 2MB block is cheap. As cheap as a 1MB, to keep it simple and stay in powers of 10. But, the O(n^2 ) is not cheap. So what looks like a doubling is actually doubling squared, in some cases.
Edit: There is no block size that exists/is possible that will do the things people in the Classic camp want. In the Lightening Network white paper they show that for each person on the planet to do two transactions it's Terabytes in block size a day. That's why another layer is needed. Bitcoin cannot be everything the same way a Browser cannot be the entire Internet. Or. more aptly, why HTTP/TCP/insert any protocol here can be everything

It's much more difficult to make hardware illegal than it is to force exchanges into AMY/KYC laws.
The difference between the two is innovation. Exchanges are, and will always be, legacy systems. They have an end-life determined by the proliferation of cryptocurrency. Because you're right, a future where Bitcoin is so prevalent means there is no need for an exchange.

I know it is very sexy to want to rapid fire a response on Reddit but I do suggest you actually read the White Paper. 
Specially the section titled "Block Size and Consensus", but hey knowledge isn't as sexy as replying really fast on Reddit, yah?


7 billion people to make two transactions per day, it would require 24GB
blocks every ten minutes at best (presuming 250 bytes per transaction and
144 blocks per day). Conducting all global payment transactions on the
blockchain today implies miners will need to do an incredible amount of
computation, severely limiting bitcoin scalability and full nodes to a few
centralized processors.


micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.
So, the original point was "Smaller blocks = fewer tx" which is not true. A smaller block with the lightening network can handle many more txs than a 1MB block alone.
Quick Edit because I know you won't understand the context:


rules may also differ if the miners’ consensus rules are more restrictive.
Non-miners may accept blocks over 1MB, while miners may have different
soft-caps on block sizes. If a block size is above that cap, then that is viewed
as an invalid block by other miners, but not by non-miners. The miners will
only build the chain on blocks which are valid according to the agreed-upon
soft-cap. This permits miners to agree on raising the block size limit without
requiring frequent hard-forks from clients, so long as the amount raised
by miners does not go over the clients’ hard limit. This mitigates the risk
of mass expiry of transactions at once. All transactions which are not redeemed
via Exercise Settlement (ES) may have a very high fee attached, and
miners may use a consensus rule whereby those transactions are exempted
from the soft-cap, making it very likely the correct transactions will enter
the blockchain.

I get that the XT/Classic camp is slow and they need someone to think for them. That's why they advocate for dictators/one person being in charge of development. 
For an attacker the CPU/XBT cost is so neglibly small as to not matter one bit. Furthermore, you can broadcast a tx with no fee attached. Whether a miner chooses to include your tx or not is up to them.
You don't seem to understand that it may cost me $.05 a tx and it may take me, say 6,000 tx to fill a 2MB block. Holy shit!!! $300 dollars!
However, to be a miner and compete in this space and the effort/hardware that would go in to verifying all the txs is much, much greater. So much greater than your dinky little $300 (The difference between 1MB and 2MB is about $175 with your 4th grade math) as to be not matter at all.
It is so insignificant as to be multiple powers of ten off from the cost to miners. Just to put this in perspective. Astronomy considers within 2 powers of ten to be accurate. 
So there is an astronomical difference between the potential cost to an attacker to flood the network with txs between 1MB, 2MB, 10MB, etc block **that scales linearly** in terms of cost.
For miners, it scales quadratically.

Vanishingly is not a word and your 'basic economics' will not scale. In the next 15 years we will not see the 8GB block size we would need to transact as a competitive payment processor. Nor will the bandwidth exist.
To scale we need to innovate layer 2 solutions that specialize in transaction processing and settle large numbers of txs in as small a footprint as possible

@_date: 2016-03-03 18:16:39
Your argument is "1MB is arbitrary so that makes it just as good as any other arbitrary choice"
It's not true. 
1MB was arbitrary because Satoshi mentions he did not know the 'right' cap for the block size. Until someone can disprove the fact that filling a 2MB block scales just as cheap for an attacker as filling a 1MB block but for the miners/network that work scales quadratically you cannot say any block size over 1MB is a step in the correct direction.
The best counter is Andresen's latest post "Dollar for lulz" or whatever. 


Again, like I say above. For an attack filling a 2MB block is teh same as filling a 1MB block. Not matter what block size you propose we will be in the exact same situation we are in now. If you propose a higher block size you just put more work and stress on miners. You can't show anything to disprove that.

That's fine. We can push the goalpost back a little. I always assumed you were talking about Theymos reach, though.


I disagree with this on many levels. It's a bad metaphor for a couple reasons
* Theymos isn't providing any content. Content creators/marketers provide content here. At best, he is a curator or standard enforcer. 
* Those people decide to spread their information here because free individuals voluntarily choose to congregate here.
* Theymos doesn't owe Bitcoin anything. His responsibility is to this subreddit. E.g. the customers in the top two bullets.
A better metaphor is: Theymos runs a flea market where anyone may peddle their milk. He sets the standard on what milk may be sold and samples each before allowing it to be sold to consumers. Some customers think Theymos should allow unpasturized milk in the marketplace but Theymos disagrees. 
Theymos points out the unpasturized milk vendors are free to setup their own flea markets right next to his and sell their milk, but they continue to complain because their tinier markets interest a smaller portion of the total customers. They think that if they can force Theymos to go away that they'll win all his former customers - despite a clear majority of customers being content with the current marketplaces. 


No. 
At worst, in your metaphor, they are also walmart but lack the customers. Either because they do not provide what their customers need or they failed to recognize/act soon enough in the market.


It's easy to ask rhetorical questions when you set yourself up like it's [Tee Ball](


Hardly. This subreddit is mostly 14 - 26 year old lurkers who have yet to self-realize themselves as adults. Then there's a horde of angry people who argue for the sake of arguing (like us /wink), then there are marketers advertising services and attempting to drive traffic and a handful of individuals of note who have done significant things in this niche market.
This subreddit does not produce anything prolific. It is a forum. It peddles the interaction.

250 bytes * 7B = 1.75 TB a day
1.75TB / 144 blocks a day = 12GB blocks

Okay, then why can't addresses and keys be turned over publicly so people can trace the funds? 90% of funds were stored in BTC at some point. We should be able to see where they exchange for fiat.
It's like I said earlier in the post: Matonis is under record saying 90% of funds are stored in bitcoin ([Page 7, Last Paragraph, "We keep 90% of our assets in bitcoin"](
He later [says to me on Zapchain]( that $2.5M of that was lost to currency fluxuation.
You come in later and say ["That money was spent"](
If it was spent Matonis isn't being honest - I.e. it was not lost to price fluctuation. If it was lost to price fluctuation why did you say it was spent?
In either event, it was there when Matonis said "90% of our holdings are in bitcoin" - or he was lying. So turn over the keys and addresses so we can see where coins were transferred. Or if they stayed put while the price dropped.
If cash was paid we should be able to see where TBF exchanged for cash by matching up dates/times of TXs with historical prices.

Full Quote:
Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.
Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.
I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.

You're talking about collectivism as a replacement for entrepreneurs. The market is working just fine. You don't have any exceptionalism just because you've found a morality that gives you some peace and you certainly have no entitlement to push it onto others.

You should prove your claim to anyone you are trying to convince.
You said it was widely agreed upon and clearly not bandwidth straining.
Have you considered what it would take for a new miner to come online? 
Can you show how non-trivial it is to download the entire blockchain if you are a new miner? How about for each part of the world according to average bandwidth?
The considerations are immense and "Lol 2MB is nontrivial" is not an argument. You are doubling the current size but I believe the cost scales quadratically.

No. It is not. It's been shown time and again how innovation is going to lead to Bitcoin scaling. Increasing the block size is not innovation.

I think the transaction volume we currently support is just fine. I'm excited that we'll double that with Segwit and that the lightening network will make the block size irrelevant.

@_date: 2016-03-18 04:27:57
I agree with you. I don't necessarily think its a priority to anyone right now.
However, I draw a comparison with history. Politicians create and inflate a currency to pay their soldiers. Private industry has created private currency and paid labor and opened shops that sold goods in exchange for the private tender. 
To me, it at least sounds interesting that some company would do the same but with cryptocurrency. In so many ways, the pump and dump altcoins did the exact same thing with miners who mined their coins. 
So yeah, today maybe it's not so useful. But when we start mixing all these ideas together, maybe tomorrow that answer changes.
Not to keep theorycrafting on you but I really like the idea of the DACs Mike Hearn spoke toward getting their start this way. E.g. Some new DAC is going to sponsor a driverless car. It creates a new coin for itself and pays miners to mine it via block reward. The miners taking interest are essentially backing the DAC until the currency is recognized as having some value. Being able to trade coins across chains is the only way I see that crazy idea being possible
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:27:48
This is a little bit backwards.
The block reward was meant to subsidize the network until the fee market emerged. Bitcoin is unsustainable until the fees can support the network.

Why? Or maybe better, why energy? Okay, bitcoin are created using energy but so is everything else in the universe. To my limited understanding there isn't any price that maps to the energy required to create something...
A better example is: The price of commodities in a heavily competitive marketplace always approach the cost of production.
E.g. Competition drives the profit margin as low as possible and a commodity will not be produced if it sells at market for lower than it costs to produce.
Then, at least, you have a starting point before figuring out the value of bitcoin utility and how it affects the price.

It's over sensationalized. Some folks think that we'll attract new users faster than we can support them and that will leave a market gap for a competitor to take over.
XT and Classic are attempts to subvert users away from Bitcoin. The goal probably isn't to outright steal the entire userbase but just enough to have a following and undermine primary development while banks and/or government can catch up.
The premise is outright ridiculous. No responsible project manager would ever justify taking risks to accommodate new users that put the entire system at risk.

I don't think you really understand PoW...
Bitcoin PoW is two rounds of SHA256 Hashing. The output from the first goes directly into the next. 
Script PoW takes the first output, requires a memory operation and then that goes as output into the next round. Roughly...
The memory requirement adds complexity and makes ASIC design more difficult and the ASIC much slower. Obviously bus speed, memory allocation/deallocation, etc is also taking place. 
Protocols like X11 that were used in Quark are even more difficult because of the nature of that protocol.
It's a really bad idea to say 'All it takes is someone to fab a line of ASICs' because all it does is reveal your own knowledge gap

But mining farms aren't just set and forget. 
They have their own software that prioritizes their mempool. If a miner wanted it could ignore fee transactions and only serve no-fee or no txs at all.
The economic incentive is there for them to want the highest fees. Nothing prevents them from forming their own agreements with private parties to determine which txs they mine.

I think we are seeing a possibility of a trade off but it is a rare edge case. 
Jihan Wu clearly has the power to coerce miners who are stuck purchasing equipment from him. The solution to this is free trade but... China. 
How do we get around that? That's another topic. But Miners mine the coins because the protocol is valuable. Miners are important, but ultimately not the heart of Bitcoin. They are arbiters and enforcers.
IIRC they don't really mine gold now. They still sell ownership of it, though. It's still in the Earth but why bother getting at it if we're just going to put it in a vault? Effectively it is in a vault. I heard a story of a shipment of gold sinking in a ship but people still trade that gold. We can't get to it cheaply for now but some day we will. It's still gold.
I agree, for bitcoin to exist there must be mining. Mining must facilitate transfers, etc. That doesn't mean we are stuck with the current equipment if that equipment proves to no longer be useful.

I can see it going both ways. An increase in costs and a need for more resources to gain a level of insight and alertness. Maybe the savings in a post-nation state society from freeing up tax dollars could afford business these positions. 
Or would organizations cut corners to cut costs and edge out competition by taking on greater risk, not being engaged in Bitcoin and perhaps being left behind or suffering from a tech emergency due to a hard fork. 
I believe that if we moved the world over to Bitcoin tomorrow, just humor me, that a hard fork would be akin to being hit by Cryptolocker for most people. Obviously the technology is completely different. The business case of "I have a technology problem I don't know how to solve or who to contact" is similar, though.

Ok I'm tracking there - but why does it need to be part of a tx with coinbase coins? That's where I'm hung up. I understand how it would spread afterwards, i.e. contamination.
Here's my head check:
Post-fork coins are valid on both chains (OldChain becomes ChainA &amp; ChainB). I can spend them on either chain or both. **foggy area from here wthis concept** But if I spend them on either chain and the tx includes an output that traces back to a coinbase of any post-fork block that tx output from OldChain then becomes invalid on the opposing chain?
So say I spend an OldChain output on ChainA and in that ChainA tx I include an output from coins that only exist on ChainA. E.g. coins tracing back to a ChainA coinbase. Why would ChainB check ChainA? Wouldn't ChainB only be concerned with OldChain and be completely blind to ChainA?

@_date: 2016-03-03 18:56:46
You are correct but when we measure complexity of a system we do not care about the difference between 1N and 20N, for example.
Here's why. 
If I tell you "Go in that room and count every person" It takes you O(N) time. N = number of people.
If I tell you "Go in that room and count every person. Then check your work" It takes you O(2N) time.
Since we're dealing with computers, hardware doubles in power about every two years. So the O(2N) is only really valid for two years. E.g. 2N time today = N time in less than two years. The N is a constant. We only really care about that
We care more about the difference between O(N); O(log(N)); O(N^2 ), for example.
If I tell you "Go in that room and count every person. Then have every person count every person" The work is O(N^2 ). Regardless of hardware advancement the differences in the work will always be O(N), and O(N^2 )
So for an attack to broadcast 3,333 or 66,660 transactions there is really no difference.
But for a miner to validate 3,333^2 vs 66,660^2 there is a huge difference.
This is what we mean by scale.

I still think that if you plan to live your life on other peoples' money you are willfully ignorant and that's different from the type of ignorance that plays out unknowingly. 


Well, I guess it depends on whose definition of punishment we use. I would bet dollars to donuts that if I proposed that Baby Boomers are only entitled to what they've earned many of them would call that a punishment. I would call it fair. I'm not seeking reparations. I want to shutoff the valve that siphons wealth out of my pocket and into theirs. It'll never happen through the system. That's another reason I love Bitcoin.


See I diverge here. To me, that's idealistic. Education can change human behavior but there is no way we are going to get a generation of people to change their mind. Millenials are only going to be different from boomers because of hard economics. Otherwise they'd be just as happy to suckle the teet the exact same way - regardless of what kind of learning or education we attempt.
Ultimately, Bitcoin proliferation is what I want. If someone wants my money they need to convince me to give it to them voluntarily. I'm not for forgiveness or looking the other way because, like you say, there is education to be won. I just don't see that learning experience doing much to affect change.

I totally understand you asking this question since your account is only two months old and I *highly doubt* you're a paid shill who comes here to annoy people. 
So there's been this debate for the past, oh, year or so largely spearheaded by this guy, Mike Hearn, over the protocol. He works for this group of large banks, R3. 
They're interested in using the technology but also in making sure that only a few groups act as Gatekeepers. Namely, themselves. So, most of us originally took interest in Bitcoin years ago to get away from this sort of establishment. 
The big point that dissenters and Internet trolls don't seem to comprehend is that organizations like R3 don't have to directly benefit from the technology. All they have to do is convince the government they can use the technology and provide the service. Then government can go out and make it illegal for people like me, and you, to do things like run our own Bitcoin node. 
It's not a technological or practical battle. It has absolutely nothing to do with innovation or competition. It's a battle for control. And if an organization like R3 can saddle up to a government and say "Hey listen, the majority won't give a shit if you squash these cockroaches right now. Especially if we can present them our version of this thing and tell them we replaced the 'scary' parts like the decentralized bits with our own integrity. Plus, we can give you a big sloppy heaping of tax revenue."
Government gets wet in the pants for that. 
It's a race. Literally. Code that ships is the code that wins.

You are not censored if the newspaper refuses to print the "genius" essay you wrote by smearing your own excrement over a sheet of paper. The owners of the paper have a right to publish what they want, according to their own bias and preference. The same way the owners of a bank have a right to endorse the transactions they want. The same way a Bitcoin miner has a right to choose which transactions they include in a block.

Except if I spend on the main chain before I decide to con the merchant. Like I said first.


Or still be connected to nodes running on the old chain because merchants probably won't care and try to farm that part of the business out.

So this is one of the interesting memes, to me.
Yeah, of course. Dropbox proves that. 
But in a way, a decentralized, autonomous service - as we currently know it -
 does need a blockchain. 
I think there is room for an argument that a service like Storj needs a blockchain. I'm against companies like IBM or R3 claiming they can satisfy current business needs with blockchains because blockchains make current businesses obsolete. 
So, "You don't need a blockchain for X" where X = current business process. Sure, that's absolutely true. They are systems of trust. But if X = a public system that provides private services... Yeah, as far as I know the only way to do that is with a blockchain.
So if we want to replace current systems with decentralized systems we need blockchains.

I have never claimed that.


Pee after sex. Acquire assets instead of liabilities. Find what you love. Do it. Stay out of debt. Cool?


The appropriate fee is what someone is willing to pay. Each individual should be free to determine that for themselves and decide whether to participate or not. For me, I think $15 is reasonable to send any amount of money, to anyone, anywhere in the world, anonymously and without asking anyone else for permission while maintaining the integrity of the currency/monetary policy (I.e. safe from arbitrary inflation/quantitative easing/money printing). 
I don't think fees will ever be that high but that means I won't be concerned until fees increase 15,000%.

As an experiment a friend and I managed to get a cpu miner running on a power 770 frame. It was running AIX at the time, but I believe that line can handle Linux now since that's Watson's bag. 
Even with the entire frame mining it was poor. I mean, a corporation was technically subsidizing the costs of the $300,000 server and electricity, etc. But it was still only 90ish CPU. I believe a single mediocre video card had more return.

You aren't actually sending something like when you send a file.
You broadcast a transaction to a peer 2 peer network. With the Moon, Mars, spaceships, etc, you have very high latency. Mining would be impractical on Mars.

It's not a switch flip. 
You have many custom implementations and mining software that will need it's own work. Not every miner is a programmer. 
For example, Miner Mingus owns 500 TH of equipment. He paid a developer to lean out some custom mining software. He paid contractors to do the networking and a construction firm to build the data center. 
Mingus needs time to find a new developer - especially if the old one is unavailable. They need to run the business metrics on the change - cost metrics, etc. It takes time, that dev needs to learn the code and make a meaningful change.
Projects can fail, get delayed and depend on each other. It's not like desktop software, it's not just downloading and dbl clicking your windows exe.

2^64 is a really big number.
When you SHA256(somedata) and somedata = block data you get a 256 bit number.
When you take the first 64 bits from that 256 bit number you get some number in the range between 1 and 2^64.
The Bitcoin protocol defines a target. Some number below 2^64.
If the first 64 bits of that number is below the protocol target, congratulations, you just mined Bitcoin. 
somedata is unique because of something called a nonce. It's also unique in that each miner/pool's data is a little bit different. The first tx address usually differs. 
That's the highest overview I can give.

If you're familiar with how git does source control the idea is almost the same for the blockchain.
IIRC (someone correct me) you are sent the header which contains the merkle root of the transaction tree.  That merkle root has the mining pool's address as the coinbase tx. 
So you wouldn't be able to swap that address out for your own without changing the entire merkle root, thus mining solo.

There's zero reason to store a private key inside a BTC ATM.

'Rupel Devs forced at gunpoint to hard fork digital currency.
"We're working round the clock to make sure no one can move their assets off our blockchain." Commented Rupel lead developer, Mahesh Kumar Jain. "There are number of users with balances greater than 500 and 1,000 who are trying to split those amounts into smaller balances to avoid the effects of the hard fork. But we see them and we will catch them."
This surprise arrives on the coattails of Eurocoin announcing it would be generating additional units of Eurocoin, controlled by State wallets of course. It's speculated India is attempting to manipulate Rupelcoin by siphoning wealth away from higher balance holders and compete against the Eurocoin stimulus. 
"Of course we aren't worried." Replied Eurocoin Fiduciary Minister Mario Draghi. "The majority of users hold less than .0002 Eurocoins in their wallet at any given time. Our plan doubles the supply of Eurocoin. Pays each user below a .0001 balance as of the first of the year another .0001 EC. The leftover funds will remain under State control and be used to stimulate the economy when needed. It's estimated a move like this will only be necessary once in a lifetime."
"The beauty of it is," Draghi continues. 'We're making everybody equal again. Saver, Spender, it's all equal now."
When questioned about the users whose funds total more than .2 mEuks he was dismissive, saying 'There really aren't that many of them. And it's probably much safer for everyone that the government be in control of those funds.'
There you go. State-backed blockchains.

Yeah, Bitcoin is a parking lot. It has the same logistics.
It'd be a better metaphor if we said there was a queue and multiple parking lots and each parking lot could decide who gets to park there but only one of the parking lots will actually exist. Every ten minutes one new parking lots gets to exist. If someone pays more to park than you, they get to park first.
Wow, when you put a few seconds thought into it, parking lots are a really fuckin' dumb metaphor that have nothing in common with Bitcoin. Even the economics are impossibly different -&gt; other than the requirement that you have to pay to use the service ::gasp::

I think 25% in &lt; 3 weeks is astounding. With the amount of development that miners have to do that means near a quarter of the entire mining network was working on adopting Segwit before it was even certain it would move forward. 
That's incredible. When you're an adult, you won't find any industry that moves that fast. In fact, most don't move at all. That's assuming you get a job.
I would consider it a failure if, say, Segwit failed twice already under different names/brands and after a year had &lt; 5% support.

Great question, surprised it only comes up every so often.
Technically, your private key on Mycellium should work on any other wallet. Because Wallets should follow the same standards/protocol for creating keys. There are non-standard ways, like flipping a coin 256 times. But then you could always translate that number into the private key. Technically all numbers between 0 and 255 '1''s (11111111 11111111 ...) are all valid keys. They're all just really large numbers.
Essentially, your wallet just stores some really big numbers. As long as you have a way of accessing/creating those numbers you will always be able to control your funds. Even when you don't have access to the Internet/blockchain you still control those keys. 
You 12 wallet seed is named seed because it is used as a generator. For example, your computer is constantly collecting information to use for pseudo-random number generation. Each word is a token in a 12 character password. Instead of 26 letters + 10 numbers as tokens there are 7776 tokens. 
So if you're still with me, not only is that more secure but this is how we use it. (Note, this is not BIP39 exactly. Just an abstraction to help understanding)
Each word is converted into a very large number to prevent the chance of other words converting into the same number (a collision).
Then a formula uses those numbers to generate another, huge number. For example, "Replace each letter with its position in the alphabet and raise each number to a power equal to its position in the string. Then sum the numbers and modulate around some field."
So "cat bat rat sat"
1. "3120 2120 18120 19120"
2. "3120^1 + 2120^2 + 18120^3 + 19120^4 = 3120 + 4494400 + 5.949419328×10¹² ... etc". Field modulation just means 'mod some number.' E.g. 17 mod 10 = 7; 29 mod 10 = 9; 37 mod 10 = 7. It just keeps the numbers in some range. It introduces collisions but the range should be so high that it is astronomically small. 
Alright so what's the point? Since this is a math formula as long as each machine follows the same formula (BIP39) and has the same input (your 12 word passphrase) it will always compute the same output. So it's best to think of these things as machines that when given the proper materials they create something you need. You keep the materials a secret because anyone else can use the machine too. 
Just as 1 + 2 / 2 will always and forever equal "2" your BIP39 passphrase going through a BIP39 compatible wallet will always and forever equal your private key.

It's absolutely relevant. 
If the miner does nothing, the coins never effect the market. This is a subsidy. The same way when government prints money. If it prints $10T, the effect doesn't really take place until those funds hit the market. 
E.g. When the miner sells, he/she gets the value of those coins, pre-inflation. Once they are in circulation, the supply has increased. Not before.

I don't rate his vitriol above other peoples' interest in security, even if they are Statists or work for the government or however Ver trivializes their lives.

Opinions are not reports. At best, they are editorials. By definition, that is not journalism.

I'm sorry, you probably don't know how this works.
Alright. So you need money but you have no life skills or talent. So you decide you just want everyone else to pay for you to do something with your life.
You start an organization. Call it ~~'For the Children'~~ ~~Bitcoin Classic~~ Bitcoin Unlimited. You tell your politicians 'I want $1 from every tax payer.' You tell them to keep 60%. Give it back to your constituents as pork barrel spending. Use it to raise money for yourself and your parties. Say we have 100M tax payers to make it easy.
When you give a company or person a big tax cut or government subsidy it's easier to ask them to donate come election season. Sure you gave them $10M in tax dollars but now you get $1M yourself or for your party. 
Regardless, you just made $40M that you can spend to hire people, market/educate voters, buy more politicians or set on fire. 
The average voter who disagrees with you can spend $1 before they lose money trying to stop you.
Sure there's a lot more depth and the human social network you need to accomplish the task is much more difficult to join than I describe but this is your US Democracy 101.
102 version - Your legislation is never seen by politicians. It's stuffed in some other bill and passes or doesn't based on who decided to show up for work at Congress that day.

I don't think that's because people are actively planning investing strategies.
It's probably because the market has grown as a whole. In the case of Bitfinex, there were many other things going on. When Gox emptied almost the entire community was at least twice removed. 
The more the market grows, the more stability we will see. This is true of most markets. It's the Invisible Hand. Markets are naturally antifragile. That's why things like The Drug War fail.

In-so-far as public opinion goes, I think so. 
Roger Ver always has a masturbatory-vibe to his publicity stunts. I can't figure out how it serves Bitcoin. It's usually 'Look at me. I'm a rebel. See me rebel.'
Maybe it'll inspire someone to drop fiat. But I don't think the world needs more 'anarchists' like Roger Ver. Most of us are pretty decent people. We understand it's not our world right now. We're moving toward it how we can. We don't want to beat you over the head with our copies of Man, Economy and State. We're just looking for the similar respect, in kind.

Are you new to corporate functions?
You could have walked in front of those people and gave a presentation about how dog shit can reduce the size of their excel spreadsheets and you'd have people giving you overwhelmingly positive feedback.
They were networking with you. No one actually paid attention to your presentation other than to pick out buzz words to instigate and continue conversing with you.
Corporations are not a use case for Bitcoin. Corporations are a side affect of the legacy monetary system that Bitcoin will replace. The dinosaurs just don't see the comet coming. When it hits, these people are going to be asking you for a job. That's it. 
Big corporate types don't make changes like the kind it would take to convert to some fucked up, pseudo blockchain bullshit idea. That's risk. If it doesn't work, no bonus or they get fired. Way safer to keep doing the same thing. Fire a few people, reduce some costs. Get a bigger bonus.

It was for the irony.
Banks do a lot of things most people aren't aware of but this sub does a great job of highlighting how poor the system works if you are not one of the entitled elite who benefit from the system.
The irony is that thinks we're ignorant of the banking system. At the same time, he thinks he is pointing out obvious flaws in our system. 
We're literally founded upon a quote that requires the esoteric knowledge of the worldwide banking system and harm that it causes. The other exists because men who control other men with guns says so. 
But our system has obvious flaws and we're all ignorant. Everyone bailing on their Fiat currency in South Am, India, China, and trickling in from around the globe, we're wrong. Mr. Secker, hiding behind his keyboard, is right.

The argument against Segwit is that it may turn out to be a killer feature that provides another decentralized layer on the top of an already decentralized model.
Additionally, it abstracts the current Bitcoin bottleneck to a separate system - the second layer. This frees the protocol to focus on the protocol. While the second layer is free to focus on being a strong transaction layer. Burdening the protocol layer with the transaction logic was a bottleneck in the design.
From that platform we could see an explosion of innovation. It is much easier to develop for a transaction layer interface than having to write software to interface with Bitcoin directly. 
Why is this bad? Well some people stand to lose a lot of it Bitcoin is successful. Every attack against the technology has failed. So the best vector available to actors who stand to lose is Social Engineering. 
Chances are, in real life, if you are 'Too Big to Fail' This is terrible for you. But, if in real life, you are 'too small for anyone to care about you' This is wonderful.
Reddit is a breeding ground for SocEng because most of its user's don't care or don't know. They attach themselves to the best platitudes that make them feel good. Too Big convinces too small to act against their best interests this way.

I could probably pick apart each line of your reply but it's not something I'm interested in. Our definitions of voluntarism differ and it's extremely likely our perception of individual rights are so far apart that it's just not worth the time. 
The bottom line is you are letting the ends justify the means with respect to violence and being wanton with the people who disagree with you. You stretch the definition of voluntary to ease the cognitive dissonance to the point that it becomes a form of permission.

Point  is the only point the make use of quotation marks. This sentence also lacks punctuation.
Point  refers to bitcoin (sic) as the protocol. Lowercase 'B' is the currency. Uppercase is the protocol and payment network. Furthermore, Point  uses 'Bitcoin protocol' while two, ironically, uses 'bitcoin protocol'
Point  Is the longest point with 32 words and 205 characters.
Point  Has two commas, the others each have one.

No? Then don't fucking invent some bullshit just so you can respond.


This is dumb for so many reasons. How about you just go out and buy Block Erupters and give them away? You could probably get a few thousand people using those, and it wouldn't even matter. You'd have just wasted your money, but someone more intelligent would have it then. So that's good.

Bitcoin isn't at a user friendly stage. It's better than AOL was during the rise of the Internet, but it's not where Google Apps is, either.
Copying &amp; Pasting someone else's solution may work for you. It may lose all your coins.

He never forgave me over $100. Just be careful, some people are great but as soon as a few dollars get involved they change. 
I had to sit on that one from the last surge until this one when I could tell him to finally stfu and cash out. Then asshole says "I'm just gunna ride it out"

If I had one bit of optimism it was that Trump only goes for the wins. He doesn't like losing and he doesn't like ties. He wants to win and win big. Even when he loses, he tries to make it a win.
Bitcoin is not a battle he can win and trying to make the loss look like a win wouldn't work out. I don't see how he could attack Bitcoin if he wanted to, but it looks like BTC is too aligned with his agenda. I am hopeful, but this is politicing as usual.

It's still 80 satoshi per byte. 80*b. b Can go up without 80 changing. 
You don't understand tx because you quickly google searched 'standard tx fee' and have no idea what it means. Paying the standard fee, regardless of the size, is still the standard fee. 
E.g. you pay standard and I pay standard we both pay 80 satoshi per byte. If you want to be confirmed faster, you pay above that. It doesn't matter what your b size is.

It does matter.
You can broadcast and queue many transactions. Many more than fit in blocks. Confirmations matter.
Maybe someday zero confirmation txs aren't as dangerous. Then you only have to worry about bandwidth. Until then, it's throughput. Or rather, until throughput eclipses bandwidth, we're talking about throughput. If you can't tell the difference or you don't understand why the semantics matter at this juncture... well...

1. People don't, wallets do. This is managed by the wallets.
2. Yes, it's very simple.
3. Not exactly. 
You download a wallet. It gives you a list of addresses. You post one online, 1NRfn7ywthScL6QfWUBf6fBawihxi9PNrR
Anyone can send bitcoin to that address. Your wallet will keep track of those transactions. It will show you a total balance. You spend from that total and it manages which previous transactions are used to build the new ones. 
It also means anyone can take that address and goto a site like blockchain.info and look up how much has been sent to the address. It also shows them the transactions that have been sent from that address.

About three years back GPU mining was somewhat viable if you mined altcoins. A decent GPU could pull 800MH and you'd run 4+ of those 24/7. 
Mine heated my apartment at the time during a very cold winter. 
I've never heard of a CPU more than 1MH. Regardless, your competition is in the TH range now. 
You could lookup your CPU speed. It's probably documented somewhere on a wiki how fast it mines. Then use 
and see what you'd get.
Truths, the utility as a laptop is greater than the utility as a miner. Selling it and buying BTC is going to be most profitable.

No. I tend not to share information that I worked to obtain to people who won't help themselves enough to ask intelligent questions.
Typically, I put as much in as the other person. If they want to make multiple posts about how I should be helping them, then I'll make multiple posts about how they could help themselves. If they bitch I bitch back. 
If they ask engaging, thoughtful questions I engage and respond back. The whole 'I am helpless, have no intention of helping myself and will take a lot of knowledge from this community without giving any back' thing got old four years ago. 
There's nothing your post adds. It doesn't offer help to anyone in the future. It's clutter. It goes so far as to be detrimental. Because the Zerg of 'I'm helpless and can't use the search feature' posts really do drown out the useful, helpful, posts that have taken years to amass.

The gold curve is the cumulative %.
Blue is the relative %.
US is at ~87% Internet adoption.
World is at ~42% Internet adoption.
US BTC adoption if every unique wallet address belongs to a US citizen: ~.0015%
Edit: X Axis
The first 2.5% of users are labelled Innovators. 
The next 13.5% ""
Time does not matter. As time increases the % of adoption goes up or down. Like, people stop using the Internet for some reason. Bitcoin could fail, stagnate, etc.
The US reached 87% in ~30 years. It may take the rest of the world 100. Bitcoin may reach the entire world in 12 years. Who knows. It's irrelevant, though. 
Edit Edit: To help with time a bit more.
The Early Adopters for the US were AOL; Earthlink, Compuserve, Innovators were the 80's + early 90s.  Then with broadband and smart phones/3g/4g you saw the mass adoption. The luddites/laggards without smartphones are holding out. But relative to the entire world all of America is an early adopter and most of the current developers are still innovators.

I doubt it. I've been thinking heavily about this.
Technically, this is like a DOS attack on the IRS. They're going to have to calculate the market value relevant to the time of every single transaction for every single transaction. Ever.
Sure, they will probably target the dumb dumbs who were transferring stacks of coins first. But imagine how many small transactions go through. It's just not going to be worthwhile to go through the process. Or, they gamble on hiring someone to build custom software to do it.
 
I think this is an insane amount of work, and a brilliant move. The best part is that Armstrong err'd on the side of caution. 
"There was no guidance from government. So we treated them all like they were taxable. Here's 17,681,420,213 transers" 
For every user and merchant, Ethereum and Bitcoin, calculate the market value at the time of transfer and the running total with no way of knowing if the final amount is going to be negative, zero, or positive for every wallet. 
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  
Think about it - Track nothing you go to jail. Track some, you betray community. Track all, you aren't guilty and, technically, protect your customers as much as you can.

Just for kicks.
I think gold's difficulty to transport becomes more valuable as you own more gold. There are different use cases and it depends on the user. Ultimately, I tend to side with the most options. But there are no absolutes. If I had a large amount of gold I would want only a few options for it's transportation and want to control all of them.
E.g. it is built into a gold fountain or some elaborate mantel in my elaborate mansion (I own lots of gold, right?)
But if I own a small amount of gold I kind of want the opposite. I want to be able to take it with me where ever I go.

When you expose someone to risk without their knowledge some consider that a crime. 
It's not about what the Gov says is a crime. He gambled other peoples' liberty and property when he put their bodies at risk of harm. 
He may believe his grasp on economics is strong, but he has a really poor understanding of other people. Were the fireworks/explosives packed such that they wouldn't move during shipping? The friction can damage them and cause harm to their packaging. Static electricity creates sparks. That could happen in a shipping plane. Those things vibrate constantly. Even if no harm is caused, the time to report, analyze and recover from such an event is still a catastrophic risk.
Remember these bombs are used by farmers to scare away critters. The concussion must be fairly strong for the range / wide open spaces.
He had no guarantee those fireworks/explosives would be shipping away from ordinary people. HAZMAT has special rules for transportation about how close those materials get to where people live. E.g. a plane flying over a community having problems with the unmarked explosives going off vs shipped through the country on a train. 
So I highly, highly doubt that Ver cared about the safety/liberty of the individuals who literally put their hands on these packages who may have wanted an expert to examine them to ensure the safety of contents. 
But Hey, Ver only cares about his rights and freedoms - not yours or mine. And fuck both of us for pointing out he trampled over hundreds/thousands of other peoples'.

You can invent whatever interpretation you want. I am going with my original statement
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:51:49














would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 
This is a post about SPV wallets and allowing users to participate in the verification of individual transactions are they are broadcast over the network. This has absolutely nothing to do with the point and you would do well to read the posts before trying to use them as sources for your bullshit. This does not exempt miners from verifying all tx's. This is a post about bandwidth fucktard, we're talking about throughput. If you can't tell the difference no one should listen to you.
Go ahead, again, show us the math behind small miners verifying two HD movies worth of data for 1 block. Please. We've all been waiting for your side to do this. None of you can. It's just simple algebra.
Show us the economic incentive for larger miners not to just fill blocks with transactions that belong to them and push small miners out of verifying transactions or including txs in blocks. Please. Show us these things. You can't. That's why your side loses.

Unlocking an opcode vs re-architecting transactions into a new layer... Hopefully you can see the differences there.
At least make the apples to apples comparison. 
If I had to guess? I don't. And I don't care. Either way it's a win for me. If Segwit activates, wonderful. If not, then we've set the precedent that Bitcoin will remain difficult to change. Lightening Network can still move forward, scaling can still take place.
But we'll have won the battle against the children who think they can contort the message and distract us from the things that matter. That's what is really at stake here.

I don't think you understand my point at all.
Larger blocks make it easier to push smaller miners out of the game. A larger block size creates a perverse incentive. 
After the block reward falls off every miner will need to mine transactions to make any profit. If the block size is 1GB nothing stops large mining ops from flooding out small pools to the point where all their resources are spent validating transactions or block data instead of mining.

I think miners can, and do, vote with their hash power. They do it by switching between coins and in how they chose algorithms/ASIC devices to specialize their farms.
That's as much influence a miner should have - what's within reach of their labor or the fruit if that labor. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:41:15


You're correct but nothing prevents anyone from packaging up a block and putting in a counterfeit hash value and forcing everyone receiving the block to re-compute the work.
Validating a block involves computing the merkle root hash of the transactions. If you forward a fake 10M block the other nodes still have to computer that root before they can check your PoW hash is actually what you claim it is and under the difficulty.
So you are correct. If you check the PoW hash for a counterfeit block it *should* be trivial to see it does not satisfy the difficulty. Forcing other nodes to check the work by putting a fake value that does satisfy the difficulty is where the DOS attack comes in to play. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:37:20
Well, you are correct. Though technically that will be true the entire time. By entire time I mean the time where XT accepts a large block and core rejects it.
It's my understanding that XT Is just Core with a lot of the changes Hearn would like to see in Bitcoin. How that is less centralized than now I do not understand. 
Furthermore, I would not want to side with the miners on this debate. No one should assume they are altruistic or care about Bitcoin surviving as we currently know it. 
What I mean is that from the greediest possible standpoint it is in the miners best interest to do what is best for miners, not users. So it would not surprise me to see them 51% the chain that had the least to offer them. 
Miner interest =/= user/hodler interest.

Edit: For starters, it's a non-question. Regardless, though, I would rather see a significantly limited Bitcoin than a quixotic or cavalier Bitcoin. If it takes two or three years to discuss an issue, code it and push to production that is fine to me. If another coin surpasses Bitcoin, so be it. I have no emotional attachment to the brand. I believe in crypto so the 'network effect' really doesn't bother me.
This debate is about control. It has nothing to do with code. It sets precedent and I completely disagree with the precedent. I believe part of the role of altcoins in the ecosystem is to take risks. Change process should be one of those risks and the different ideals should compete at market. 
I disagree with the XT crowd because they are making a "No True Scotsman" argument. In part, that is what your question is designed to pull someone into. I support the process that has lead us here. I do not believe in perfection or permanency and under no circumstances should a minority with a loud voice have any authority simply for having a loud voice. Ever.

@_date: 2015-08-23 00:18:06
I gotcha. Definitely tracking, thanks for your replies.
Can we keep going? 
I'm a miner and I find a new block. Block size is 20MB. Instead of broadcasting I shuffle around all the transactions a few thousand times and start spamming those to the network?
Effectively, I mine a block and I have a new, valid header. The transactions in the block are all valid transactions, other miners would have them in their pools as well but shuffling the ordering would just clobber the Merkle hash. I don't see how the block could be validated without checking every transaction since you would have a valid header but the change in order makes the merkle hash incorrect for the transactions. 
Does something exist to prevent spamming disimilar blocks with the same header? If there is couldn't I use that to collide with a competitors block?
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:59:09
Hey doesn't that mirror Hearn's agenda?
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:50:46
I'm pretty sure Hearn has stated he wants regular soft and hard forks and that he welcomes working with legislators.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:28:31
I explained [here](
If the network grows to $3B in maintenance costs each year transaction fees would start at $21 without the block reward. That's before we start bidding against each other to get inside the next block. 
However, larger blocks greatly increase the ability of larger mining farms to DOS small farms with bad blocks/fake transactions. If they do that small miners would spend all of their time validating fake blocks. 
The current cost of a transaction is around $2. It's just masked by the block reward. That doesn't necessarily represent the true market cost. I expect the price would go down without the subsidy but users would notice a $1 fee much more than what we do (or don't?) pay now.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:58:41
This is not true.
The instant a large block is mined the fork occurs. All it takes is the miner transacting coins from before the fork in the large block to ensure the chains will not be reconciled. At that point it becomes a battle over which miners can 51% attack the other chain successfully or go along with the crowd.

@_date: 2015-08-24 12:46:19
Yes (and no).
When you create a wallet it generates ~100 keypairs. When you backup your wallet it's possible that you spend through them all and generate new pairs. If you receive bitcoin on any of these new pairs and restore your wallet the coins will not be there.
Deterministic wallets prevent against this and it's also the reason why you don't use the same wallet file on multiple computers.

@_date: 2015-08-26 19:36:33
Well, save the time typing out appeals to majority. Even if that is true, which it is certainly not, larger mining operations will always have extra resources that a small mining pool will not have without significant R&amp;D costs. 
Those extra resources will always be the advantage of a larger operation over a mining pool. It increases as we scale. 
Pooled mining in its current form does not scale with the block size. I don't know what it would take to future proof them.
But hey, I'm sure all these large mining pools that vote for the increase in block size are doing so because of altruism, not greed. You can have your Democracy/majority/what everyone else says. I would rather look at what people are doing.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:54:14
Not if they generate new keys for the key pool
Edit downvotes? Seriously? Hey Bitcoin Core used to create ~100 keys up front. You burn through them for change addresses, so even if you just spend bitcoin you burn them. Start receiving bitcoin on keys generated after your backup and they won't be there when you restore
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:47:27
Yes, if we had to use set notation I would say holding falls under their umbrella.
However, if only 3-5 large mining farms exist each providing 20-30% of the hash rate that is supremely in the interests of those miners and not holders. It makes sense a miner in a position to have that hash rate would choose their mining interests over holding interests.
Bitcoin gains value from independent mining.
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:52:08


Yeah but can we agree every moment spent talking to legislature is time lost that could go towards working on Bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-08-26 19:20:00
Pooled mining is actually at greater risk to large block sizes than independent miners...
It's extremely easy for large pools to generate bad shares and spam pools. That translates directly into increased costs. With large blocks it becomes trivially easy to spam mining pools with bad shares to the point where more resources are spent doing validation than the reward for mining.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:48:22

@_date: 2015-08-26 16:02:13
My question is why we defer to miners as authorities? Yeah, they want Bitcoin to succeed but the best scenario for that success is not the same as the best scenario for users or anyone else that wants to mine.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:52:23
Well, first I think the question is incorrect.
Bitcoin has been obscured with this debate. The idea of Bitcoin as the honey badger of money means it doesn't care about miners or users. It just does its thing and happens to be useful to us. I think it should be difficult for everyone and we should rely on building around a working, proven, Bitcoin. 
I think that would entrench Bitcoin as a protocol and that's what I want to see happen. I don't think Bitcoin is tool for buying coffee.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:39:29


I'm suggesting they are effectively the same thing.

@_date: 2015-08-25 19:58:08
Interesting idea but you do have a say with your wallet.
If miners would fork to a new chain - like in the instance of XT, you can stay on any chain you want. Coins are active on both. Until one dies XT (or Bitcoin depending on how you approach it) is an altcoin with a premine equivalent to Bitcoin's block chain.
If you chose never to join the hostile miners then those coins are dead on their chain.

Not exactly.


That's a bit of a stretch

@_date: 2015-08-23 20:43:32


This is unsustainable though. After the mining reward disappears and the network is funded by fees miners have no choice but to mine transactions. Right?

I don't think that's what I said, no. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:54:28
Yeah, I can cpu mine just like anyone else but there is a point at which mining is moot. Your defense of PoW is slightly airy. 
Everything has an entrance barrier equal to the economic resources expended to join in. The question is about significance. Large blocks favor large miners. Until that is proven otherwise, and it has not happened yet, there is no reason to call the hostile XT fork 'safe'

@_date: 2015-08-27 17:48:45


Right, I agree with you. By your logic it also follows that the fewer miners there are, the higher the reward for those that remain. That's great for miners, bad for holders. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:01:12
Nah, the flaw here is when the block reward disappears. Miners will have to mine transactions or they make no profit.
Also, hash rate has nothing to do with propagation or verifying transactions/the block itself.

I disagree. It is economics that every cent pools have to spend on bandwidth and resources that does not go towards mining is a loss of security for the network. 


I don't think you understand what that means. I'm not speaking to hash rate here.

When a block is broadcast for the first time peers still need to check the transactions and values in the block header. The PoW nonce saves them from checking every single hash. 
It still doesn't explain how they could skip validating the transactions and the merkle hash in the header

@_date: 2017-04-13 14:50:06
I think it's pretty relevant. Reducing the difficulty to adjust for the lowered hash rate after 40% of the network goes away just sounds like a playground for the other miners to return, mine until the difficulty goes back up, and then leave the network.

This is wildly inaccurate and immensely short-sighted, even for a hypothetical. [Entire industries are based around 0-conf transactions](
What you are supposing is more disingenuous than calling Mike Hearn a core developer. 
Regardless, this still has nothing to do with what I asked:






Prove it. 
"Supply and Demand" because you suppose a lack of tx space is less-than sophomoric. Show me how the Lightening network and Segwit and a 2MB block size is going to lead to less room for TXs and an increase in fees. Plot that alongside adoption and show me where the breaking point/point of no return is - You cannot.


This is mostly dribble and FUD. Which cryptocurrency do you propose they will switch to? Which has the network effect and adoption of Bitcoin so far? Which merchants care enough to support Bitcoin, let alone more than one crypto? Which payment processors give merchants the ability to do what you are proposing? 
The answer? There are none. You are full of shit and carrying a banner you don't understand to the detriment of our community.

It's a young market. The market share will continue to shrink even as Bitcoin grows due the fact the market always hedges its bets.

No. 
Segwit opens Bitcoin up to billions of transactions that would never exist / be possible in a block via LN. LN then uses the block space for a settlement, similar to how the block header holds a merkle root that summarizes the transactions inside the block.

I think a private investigator to go digging around would have been a great idea. Especially if you made all of the results public, since yah know all of TBF's funds come from other people and technically that would be their private investigator and any info they find would technically be info belonging to those people. 
To start, you should have burned the reputation of everyone involved. You should have dragged the information out in to the Sun for everyone to see. You should have publicly released all documentation, all exchanges, all transactions, all records, etc for people to review. It's wonderful that you are satisfied. That kind of privilege is the problem. The irony that the new regime doesn't get that is astounding. 
"The last group fucked you because trust. But you can trust me not to fuck you" amazing. Just amazing.
But you can't do that. You don't have the power to do that. Because that would compromise your ability to do exactly what the old TBF did. And it would bury the brand for good.

At first glance, folks think moving from 1MB -&gt; 2MB only means double work. It doesn't. It means quadruple work.
So moving from 1MB to 2MB requires 4 times the CPU and memory. 
If I say "Go in that room and count the people" = O(N)
"Go in that room and count the people then count again to check your work" O(2N)
"Go in that room and count the people, then have each person count to check one another" O(N^^2 )

The lack of appreciation for that is off-putting. If I know the largest hospital in a city I likely know which hospital all of the professional athletes are using. I shouldn't have to point out the value of information in that case. The US is also the home to hospitals where foreigners travel for surgeries, etc. 
Where is a big deal and trying to play toward emotions instead of accepting the reality of the situation isn't going to do any good. I blame the hospitals, really. They're the ones with an obligation to their customers.

I have a difficult time reconciling the math at something as high as even 200 satoshi per transaction. Especially with a business with startup costs as high as ATMs. I don't see how tens of thousands of dollars in start up costs would ever be covered by a business model that could be threatened for a $.50 or even $1.00 transaction fee. 
Especially since those costs are always passed off to the consumers and ATMs already mark up as high as 15%. At least that is the highest I have ever seen.
It would be interesting if you could get your friend to do an AMA on the Economics.
I mean, essentially the formula is something like:
T is the total bitcoin transacted at my ATMs
P is the average profit for markup per bitcoin purchase or the markdown per fiat deposit.
M is the months of operation
T*P*M &gt;= startup costs
Let's say I buy 1  ~$3000 ATM. If my profit on every exchange is 10% then I need 
T*1.1*M &gt;= 3000
T*M &gt;= 2727.272727273
I can break even in one month if 2727.3 BTC is transacted, but that is $3,185,404.58 American dollars. 
If the price of btc remains the same you can break even in ten years *if* there are 22.12BTC purchased every month (~$25,000).
But you're also gambling on the machine breaking down, maintenance, insurance, theft, risk, etc that include costs. 
Summarily, you could break even in 1 year if the price of BTC goes up x10. 
So I guess my question would be, since your business cannot possibly succeed without the price of BTC skyrocketing how is it that literal nickels and dimes from transaction fees - which there is no need for any more transactions than any other exchange - killing the business?
EDIT: Going to do the math for the fees affect profits because that's what I'm really interested in your friend explaining.
Going back to the first month, let's assume a flat rate 300 bytes per transaction. It's actually closer to 250 but I want to be liberal here. Let's do 200 bytes per Satoshi. So 250*200 = 50,000 Satoshis (0.00050000BTC).
Tx = total transactions
C = cost of transaction
T*P*M - (Tx*C) &gt;= 3000
But lets look at the individual transaction first. We have our profit margin of 10%. So at what point does that .0005 BTC &gt;= 10%?
10% of X = .0005
So 0.005 BTC would be the smallest possible transaction @ 10% markup/down and 300 Satoshi per byte which is $5.87. Essentially, what someone would pay for an expensive coffee.... Hmmmmmm. Non-trivial but given what we already know about the success of the business relying on a rise in bitcoin price by a power of ten I don't forsee it mattering unless we're relying on microtransactions. Which brings me right back to my first sentence.
That holds up to the status quo, I think. And supports what you're saying. I would still like them to comment because I'm drinking/smoking and this is basically the back of the napkin math. 
Also, I think I've heard ATMs can go up to 20% markup so I'd like to know that range since the conditions are obvious. And I doubt there would be any kind of need for 300 Satoshis.

Again... This is a property of the Mathematics.
It specifically explains how this applies to Bitcoin but this appears to be intrinsic to SHA2 or rather, the way hashing works:


incriminating[sic] a 32-bit nonce which is at the end of this header data. This
means that the processing of the header involves two runs of the compression
function run-- one that consumes the first 64 bytes of the header and a
second which processes the remaining 16 bytes and padding.
See the 'and padding' This is true for any data that fits these criteria. Because the hash function works in 64 byte chunks of data. The fact this is block header data only shows its relevancy to bitcoin - not that this is limited to bitcoin:


multiple distinct first 64-byte chunks but identical 16-byte
second chunks they can reuse the computation of the initial
expansion for multiple trials. This reduces power consumption.
Again, I am assuming, but feel free to show me the Math that proves me wrong. This does not have to be Bitcoin data. It does not have to block header data. You could reuse the initial, distinct, 64 byte expansions and number of identical for 1 bit to 64 bytes of data and achieve similar results. 
Edit: You're aware that hashing means SHA256(SHA256(block header)) right? Also, I haven't a clue where this would be practical or useful for anything outside of Bitcoin. Also, as far as SHA2 is concerned it does not care what the data actually represents. It's just Math.

Oh, what a great opportunity for educating the community!
9 of the 93 developers working on Core work for Blockstream. Most of them for longer than Blockstream has existed. 
2 developers - Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have been on the offensive for the better part of a year or so to persuade the community that they need 'charismatic dictators' to make important decisions for Bitcoin. Surprise! They think it should be one of them!
Even though no one is interested in that, outside of Mike and Gavin, really. One of them, Mike, got so frustrated that no one would listen to him he threw a giant tantrum, publicly, and effectively spiked his microphone and ran off to work with a national banking cartel to compete against Bitcoin.
Not sure what Andresen's motivation is to be honest. I would guess that it's probably related to his visit to the CIA some years back that caused Satoshi to leave the project
Absolutely nothing stops Mike or Gavin from starting their own coins according to their ideals. For whatever reason, they feel the need to hijack this project. Selfish egoism at its finest!

3 - Parties = Every convention TBF put on
4 - I think its done enough harm that it could be liable for damages in a civil case. But moreso because its evidence that TBF is anything but benign and as far from helpful as can be.
5 - When you have enough money you hit a ceiling. Converting cash into influence and power is the next step. NGOs are a vessel for making that happen. 
6 - Then ultimately that's like saying 'Bitcoin is fragile and laws made my NY legislators can harm it.' That's not true.
7 - No. I think the harm that comes from placing power in the hands of organizations that are nothing more than memes - lets face it, at this point TBF exists because it has a great name and that's it - is that it ultimately only benefits the people at the top. By name, that's you.
Because you'll adopt the users you want. The way you want and using the methods and education you want. The last incarnation of TBF gave us a glimpse of how much harm that can do when it goes awry. Why would we want to come anywhere near that again just because it's you driving the car now? Your brand isn't that strong. No ones is.
Ultimately, TBF is an idle hammer for millionaires inventing nails to crush. The best interest of Bitcoin users is keeping it as neutered as possible.

This is uninformed FUD.
It's cheap to fill the blocks, regardless of the blocksize. The expense that comes from full blocks comes from validation, particularly of non-standard transactions. Meaning, increasing the blocksize becomes more expensive in terms of CPU/Memory, which forces even more of the small miners off the network.
Blocks filling up is not a problem because we are still very far away from that. Even so, if you don't want to wait for a zero-fee transaction to confirm just include the $.10 to send any denomination of money anywhere in the world, to anyone.

If you want Democratic money the market provides you the opportunity to represent your ideals - even build them off the current Bitcoin source (forking the code), and compete against Bitcoin. Thousands of cryptos exist and millions more can exist. If someone claims that Bitcoin has to drastically change the only end game for them is to destroy Bitcoin.
If, for example, Gavin Andresen truly believed in the ideals he is representing through Bitcoin Classic then he could just spin up the coin and open it up to compete against Bitcoin. He doesn't.

Well, yes &amp; no I guess I agree. I mean part of the definition of The State is that it's the 'state' we've invented to keep us from the 'state' of Nature.
So in that sense, I agree The State would be benign, autonomous Software. 
I don't think ancap precludes the existence of The State. It's just not one that is controlled by individuals. Or maybe, it's one that immune to whatever amount of violence a person or group can muster. And I think that's a side effect of the times. 
Our current State is the one that beat back nature and is able to beat back other states. I'd argue we've passed the point where violence is a necessity and we're waiting to sunset these legacy systems - militaries &amp; politics.

Solipsism? Reality doesn't change based on group think. If the majority decides to change the fundamentals of Bitcoin then it's no longer Bitcoin. 
For example, if the majority decides to put controls in that make government a trusted third party, or write inflation into the protocol it is pure solipsism to still call it Bitcoin. 
Majority rule already exists. It's boring and it fails. Why taint Bitcoin's brand with Democracy? If popular opinion decides what Bitcoin is then it's failed.

@_date: 2016-02-07 22:07:29
Oh wow, OK. Sorry I thought I was making this too simple as to be insulting.
It's a math thing on your end. 
So when I say "scales quadratically" I'm telling you that when we increase N for a system that the amount of work required for it to run is quadratic. Big O notation is used to analyze how expensive a system/algorithm is. So O(N^^2 ) is Big O notation for "scales quadratically"
Quick explanation of Big O:
If I say "Go in that room and count how many people there are" That is O(N) Where N = number of people in the room. 
If I say "Go in that room and count the number of people twice to check your work" That is O(2N)
If I say "Go in that Room and count the number of people there are and have each person count the number of people to check your work" That is O(N^2)
So when we say the blocksize scales quadratically (explained by Maxwell in that post) it means that if you double the size from 1MB to 2MB it is wrong and naive to believe the amount of work is doubled. It is actually quadratic. The difference is' x2' vs '^ 2' and that is a huge difference.
I've answered you multiple times and I've shown you where you misunderstand.

@_date: 2017-04-06 02:25:38
Well that's a non-argument since you're asking the other side to prove something is not a problem anywhere else. 
This is Math. It's how the process works. It's like saying
f(x1) + f(y)
f(x2) + f(y)
f(x3) + f(y)
f(x4) + f(y)
BUT the last 16 bits of the x values are changing. This is how binary numbers work:
0000000000000000 || 0000000000000000
That's 32 bits separated by || to make it more readable. This would be your 32 bit nonce. The last 16 bits must always be the same. Great! That makes these nonces all applicable:
0000000000000001 || 0000000000000000
0000000000000010 || 0000000000000000
0000000000000011 || 0000000000000000
And so on. Once you count to 2^16 on the left side, increment the right by 1 bit and start over. Meanwhile, the other 48 bits remain the same, specifically the 32 bit merkle root, version (this is called out in the paper as well), difficulty, etc. So it is very very clever Math that happens to be exploitable in because of how headers are laid out.
Is this accurate at a high level?

I want you to know that I completely understand your point and that I'm just giving you questions that have already been asked of the people who have previously made your point.
All your mechanism does is reward temporary miners who will just bring their mining power back, raise the difficulty, and then leave. 
Your 'mechanism' creates a perverse environment for miners to put us right back where we were prior to implementation and then we need another solution. This is not a fix. It is not even a bandaid. It is a shortcut for rewarding the miners who would not want to participate on this chain and further hinder it by placing it right back in the same state from before your 'fix' but now those miners enjoyed a window of time where difficulty was low and they get nice returns that they will take to other coins/chains or use to harm miners who stick around.

You're basically reparsing what I just said but trying to represent it as the opposite. 
My point is that Bitcoin does a thing X way. There are Y, Z... etc ways to do the thing. But those other ways are mutually exclusive to X. 
Maybe I prefer something pursuing complete decentralization to federations? Maybe I don't think I'm omniscient enough to know what the future holds? Maybe I want more risk for the possibility of higher return?

There's this thing called paralysis analysis.

"Everyone has had the experience of being in a classroom and the teacher comes in and asks 'OK, yesterday we covered 2+2. Does everyone understand 2+2?' and everyone nods. Easy mode. Except for some asshole in the back who says 'No'
Ok, so the teacher goes into explaining 2+2 again because said asshole didn't pay attention, still isn't paying attention and there is some bullshit idea that you can't leave any child behind. Alright, so goes the day.
The next day, same thing. Teacher starts teaching 2+2 again for the same asshole. Everyone else stops paying attention or giving a shit."
The moral of the story - Some people are just not going to get it and you shouldn't waste your time on them. Shed the baggage, move on and do something productive instead.

My two bits is that I don't think the protocol should be concerned with micro-transactions. I am attracted to Bitcoin because it is a life boat for those opposed to fiat currency. It is not the end-all, be-all, currency that idealists dream of.

The merits of a Social Contract or not have been discussed and is largely a dead topic to me. The argument that "People don't know enough to choose for themselves. So elect people to choose for them." Is why I consider it a scam. So arguing society would collapse without it is hypocritical. Society exists in spite of Social Contracts.
The problem with most people, not ancaps, is that they think anyone who thinks differently from them need a government that does think like them so they can force everyone different into the same mold. 


The fantasy / logistical impossibility that this is...
Again, the merits have been discussed and it's largely a closed topic. The obvious question is "How is what you describe any different from what we have now?" If we were truly stateless everyone would be competing on the same playing field, instead of the State choosing who gets to play, which game, and which field it takes place and still reserving the power of fiat to cancel or create on their whims.

Hey, thank you for your hard work and efforts with all things wiki-related.
I agree with you and this is something I've thought about when I was churning articles. My idea was to adopt the assassination market model. Sorry for the course term.
I would rather see a marketplace that posts bounties for journalists to pursue. E.g. 'I want a daily story covering the progress of topic X. I am willing to pay $.50 BTC equivalent each day for that story." and then other users can contribute a matching amount.
Alternatively, I thought of a bid system where once the story reaches a certain amount or time has passed that it becomes free.
Ultimately I would like to see decentralized solutions and Software running these applications. Dunno if these ideas help but if someone else can implement them or do better more power to them

No, here is why:


No it does not. This argument relies on consistently convoluting the difference between throughput and capacity. We can handle many more than 7TPS but only commit 1MB at a time to record. There is a very big difference in nuance that you ignore. 


This is more of the same. A double in the capacity means potentially quadruple work. It's been discussed and explained many times why that is so bad already.


Zero relevance to Bitcoin, its protocol, or purpose


Again, no. It has and will have zero affect on adoption. You clowns have been calling for the sky falling since 2011 over this issue and we're perfectly fine.

You're math is pedantic and your data is wrong.
You would do well to read three additional lines in the [Bitcoin wiki]( 
Specifically: [56,000 tx/s max](
[Max Usage caps at 1/3 that](
~10MiB/s to satisfy 18667 tx/s @ 500bytes each
~10MiB/s * 600s = 6000MiB
But that's cool on paper. In practical application it could take two hours for a block to be mined. That's 72 gigs. Nice....
Yay, you can download fast. It's not, but I don't think you'll understand any other explanation - this is effectively a torrent. The data is redundant many times over. Hopefully you can figure out why your connection doesn't matter now.
Regardless, you still fail to distinguish bandwidth from throughput. And you fail to recognize that Bitcoin will increase the amount of commerce. E.g. Having greater diversity in payment networks will lead to greater adoption, new innovation and higher usage. So the VISA peak number that likely comes from Black Friday holiday shopping/Cyber Monday shopping will go up because more people will have a seat at the table due to technology reaching more people. 
So please, take your milquetoast bullshit back to the drawing board and at least use the search function once or twice before popping off half cocked and expecting people to read through what amounts to a waste of time just because you came late to the party and didn't do your own homework.

A lost key means lost coins because of the math.
We're ultimately talking about options. The state of the coins decidedly being destroyed by the protocol versus being uncontrolled means different options.
@_date: 2016-09-08 23:50:06
Because the level of security with private keys could, at any moment, be destroyed. If the coins were lost, that wouldn't matter. Since the key that controls their ownership is what is assumed lost, finding that key would mean someone could take control of those coins.
That's just one reason. It's also an important semantic with respect to the protocol.

A federated block chain is kind of like a white-listed group of miners. So only the hospitals would have miners on the network.

I think because Bitcoin can't be megalithic. 
It won't be everything. For example, I don't think everyone on the planet should be able to buy their morning coffee using Bitcoin. At least, not how you and I use it today. 
I want Bitcoin to resist social pressure, as well as technological pressure. I don't want regular hard forks because I would rather see Bitcoin cemented as the underlying protocol that ties everything together than, again, something I use to buy coffee.
I have no problem with innovation happening outside, on top of, around or near Bitcoin - so long as it relies on Bitcoin it increases the value of Bitcoin.

If you think the people who run the country are hapless buffoons and all of this happens by chance I have some news for you... Politicians are certainly fools but the banking model that controls most societies is a pretty sophisticated machine. 
I think it's reasonable to hold people accountable for their ignorance. They choose to participate in this world. They have no problem accepting the benefits without wondering about the effect beyond themselves. I certainly don't see any baby boomers stepping up to offer any millenials their financial freedom back. They're going to suckle on government welfare until the well runs dry. Not a single one of them will bat an eye towards their children - or worse, somehow they'll justify their blind selfishness as something they do for their children.
@_date: 2015-09-17 16:36:00
I think the only ones who take offense are the folks in favor of the incremental approach when those of us who aren't point out the flaws. 
When has power ever rescinded power before making every attempt at crushing the thing first? 
Obtaining a healthy view of Bitcoin from the state is going to be akin to getting them to backtrack on prohibition. If I recall the reason that happened was because there was no money leftover to pay Congress and they needed the tax revenue. 
Bitcoin will make it so there is no money to pay Congress. 
Regardless, the 'incremental' approach is nebulous, at best. No one has elicited the steps, milestones or metrics that will be used to measure success - or even what that definition is beyond "No more state." Which is hilarious.

It's not censorship if you're just loud, or complaining. 
How, well for starters there is no end to human demand. If you make the space available we will use it. It does not matter if you chose 1MB or 1TB if the resources are made available they will be used. I propose Bitcoin scale according to necessity and without sacrificing the smaller miners.
Indepedent hash power is how the network gains value, not through consolidation of hash power into an oligopoly. 
I support the block size being set by the market and the software scaling such that it functions in such a way that it does not provide a perverse incentive for large farms to attack pools or small miners.

"I have a device that innately communicates with other devices along a common protocol"
Every action in the universe is a transaction. Bitcoin is a ledger of transactions. I can put 40 Bytes of anything in an OP_RETURN value for any transactions.
One use is the internet of things. My dryer writes it's status to the block chain. My TV sees that my clothes are dry and knows I am watching TV. It tells me the dryer is finished. 
I go into the basement. My door opens and the pressure activated stairs communicate my movement and my TV turns itself off/pauses the show while I go to the dryer. After removing the clothes I go back upstairs, after the door reports opening/shutting the TV turns itself back on and I fold my laundry.

You're demonstrating a great trait of human nature - "They're able to do it. Someone is going to do it. Why shouldn't it be me?" It's called the tragedy of the commons and it's why governance and fees are required in Bitcoin.
Starbucks sells 4bn cups of coffee a year. I would rather a Starbucks chain exist and they keep their spammy transactions and mining costs to their own network but peg it to Bitcoin. 
E.g. I think Sidechains will further decentralize Bitcoin and once transactions fees incentivize mining keep me from having to subsidize or compete against transactions I have no interest in. So Bitcoin can be part of paying for your morning coffee. I just don't think that should be the focus, or end goal.

Again, that's not what the [UTXO](  is lol. The UTXO DB is what keeps a miner from having to look through the block chain for every single transaction to verify its inputs.
You are talking about unconfirmed transactions. As in, when too many transactions are queued in the unconfirmed transaction pool they will absolutely randomly drop transactions and their children to free space.
The UTXO database that I am talking about is completely different. Every transaction output that is not spent is also maintained in a pool in memory. That's why some people consider services like a Bitcoin faucet to be DDOS or an abuse or Bitcoin. 
I can send 1 transactions with 1,000 outputs for 1 satoshi. That one output will sit in the unconfirmed transaction pool until it is mined. It could possibly be dropped by miners if the network is flooded with transactions. 
However, once mined to a block those 1,000 outputs will never be dropped from the UTXO database. They are removed once they are included as an input in another transaction. 
So the actual attack is that large miners have an exorbitant amount of hardware resources lying around. There reaches a point where the block size gets so big that it creates a perverse incentive to force smaller miners to constantly verify large blocks. Larger blocks also means more utxo. Which means expensive memory costs.
[Peter Todd wrote about exactly what I am talking about 2 years ago](
[Jeff Grazik addresses it here in a recent Summit on Scaling Bitcoin](

How is a nation state's chosen governance civic similar to Bitcoin's governance or its community governance?
Why would something that is claimed to work for a nation state work for Bitcoin or an online community? 
I think just putting the same two things together in a sentence demonstrates an incredible lack of understanding of the point of Bitcoin and blockchain technology but I would love to learn something new.
I can understand how a majority would be pleased if it knew it could vote to force the minority into doing what it prescribes under the threat of violence but without having a military or police agents to enforce what the majority wants to force the minority of Bitcoin users to do how would you even begin to enforce this, let alone justify/reconcile it with the philosophy?

Thank you. Right now my situation is kind of like having each foot in a separate canoe. I have my 'normal' life that works 9-5 and pays bills in fiatland. I don't evangelize to people to accept Bitcoin. 
Then I have the work I do that is not vital to my standard of living. I work, write and use Bitcoin for this. It works out such that all my expenses are more or less a zero sum with my paychecks. Ironically, about half of my income goes directly to paying down debt. I'm one of those millenials that sold their future for a chance at a future (college degree). Any 'extra' in my life comes from Bitcoin (new clothes, eating out, home supplies - anything I can buy a gift card).


Eh, then I hope we can agree that if that is the goal the value gained from any recognition these organizations lend is moot.


Eh, armed men wearing halloween costumes and hiding behind the authority of a metal badge they pin on their chest 'bring you back to reality' when they beat, kidnap, coerce or otherwise intimidate you into acknowledging the state.
Without that the state is just a gang of thieves trying to make rules about how you live after they've robbed you. Take away the violence and it's just a room full of angry people throwing tantrums about how no one listens to them.


Eh, maybe. I see my beliefs as an ideal to work towards but never attain. I won't see my utopia because my utopia changes as I learn more about myself and the world. This leaves room for me to distinguish practicality and idealism. 
I don't believe there is an incremental approach to winding down an outdated system. Especially when that system is going to be hostile towards the new one. I see no reason for the Federal Reserve or current governments to accept a system that undermines their control. 
I see current governments like the church when the church was the dominant power. They will never go away fully, they will always have followers. Innovation has the ability to make their power benign. We should focus on making them more benign instead of begging them for their acknowledgement and acceptance.

I disagree with you here as well. You can live entirely on Bitcoin now, people do it. The only thing does this is move Bitcoin closer to Leviathan. No good comes out of this. 


I think the Fed is chomping at the bit to see regulation. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to keep Bitcoin as close to home as possible. 
I don't feel like anything you said contributed to answer my question. There is no value in state recognition of Bitcoin as a currency. The value comes from us recognizing Bitcoin as a monetary system, store of value, etc, and moving beyond the Federal Reserver

I agree and I don't.
To gain the full benefits, sure. I think there exists a use case for block chains without going decentralized. Banks could share a block chain between only themselves and gain the benefits between one another and still interface with normal humans the exact same way.

@_date: 2015-09-25 12:10:07


that using Bitcoin through Tor not only provides limited level
of anonymity but also exposes the user to man-in-the middle
attacks in which an attacker controls which Bitcoin blocks
and transactions the users is aware of. Moreover in collusion
with a powerful miner double-spending becomes possible and
a totally virtual Bitcoin reality may be created for such users
(at least for a brief period of time).


Bitcoin servers and an estimated number of 100,000 clients. By
default Bitcoin peers (both clients and servers) try to maintain
8 outgoing connections to other peers in the network. If any
of the 8 outgoing connections drop, a Bitcoin peer tries to
replace them with the new connections. Using our terminology,
a Bitcoin client can only establish a connection to a Bitcoin
server. We call servers to which a client established connection
entry nodes of this client. By default a server can accept up
to 117 incoming connections. If this limit is reached all new
connections are dropped.

Well, when I imagine a future and Bitcoin it's without the need for Hillary Clinton or people like her.


Yes, I posted my implementation a while back [here]( It still relies on centralization. 


The reason why 'receipts' aren't that big a deal is because the natural by-product of a block chain transaction is a receipt. Or rather, two halves of separate receipts. 
I don't think Tierion is providing a bridge so much as they are offering to charge for something trivial. Basically paying for the privilege to consume their api - anyone can do this themselves, even with some of the wallet software that's out there.

Right, that's been my conclusion over the Reddit userbase. It has little to do with CompSci and education and a lot to do with reputation and emotion - charisma.
It's like Reddit has a hard time separating their emotions toward the work someone has done with the work they will do. Intentions =/= effects. I don't like the sentiment that Hearn and Andresen have expressed when it comes to 'Bitcoin needing a benevolent dictator' or 'Bitcoin should be easily regulated by legislators' or their personal feelings on individual liberty. 
They aren't infallible and past performance is not an indicator of future returns. I do not think that just because they put their stamp of approval on something they automatically are correct. Reddit is making that mistake

Take all of the advantages of Bitcoin over a shared database.
Now only let you and six other people play in that sandbox. 
In the hospital example, there is no reason you or I should be entering patient data in that block chain. There is no reason for the hospitals to invite us to participate.
However, all the health systems can benefit from that block chain. Though, they are still competing. For example, someone moving from the East Coast US to China would have a hard time transferring medical records. 
Like Bitcoin gives access to your money anywhere in the world, you could have access to your health data anywhere in the world. The information could even be publicly read - if the times/dates were sufficiently obscured or hidden to protect VIP data privacy. 
Again, though, you or I should not be allowed to participate, or fees could be set very high. The mining network is effectively what would be federated. With each hospital system contributing to the hash rate. 
With a sidechain this is a great use case as it pegs itself to Bitcoin this way. Even by itself it has merits.

I think this is going over your head. At least, you don't seem able to project beyond Starbucks transactions. 
Regardless, I'm interested in Bitcoin being open to as many people as possible because I believe it gets its value from a decentralized hash rate. 
There's a part of me that would like to explore the idea that the hashing algorithm is a higher priority than block size. I would like to see the ASIC industry destroyed with respect to mining. I want mining bitcoin on a solar powered cell phone cluster in middle of the African desert to be competitive. I don't know how to achieve that and I understand the benefits of ASICs outweigh my personal disdain, though.
My point is that although you enjoy having access to cheap storage and experience abundance in hardware resources not everyone who benefits from Bitcoin does. There's a world outside of America and I would rather include them than make sure some kid in America can buy Starbucks using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:28:06
I see a couple points, but none of them really resonate with me in this context.


Right. It's an ideal to work towards but never attain. I hope you aren't trying to make this about semantics? 
Just because there are no free markets does not mean you ignore market actions that are available to you. It's not black or white. We have market options today that weren't available 20, 50, 100, 1000 years ago. Let's use them and keep moving towards freer markets.


I don't think so. Actually I think he's an asshole with borderline Asperger's. He has zero power to force or coerce anyone to do anything, though. Personally it just happens that I agree with Theymos on most things. Maybe that makes me an asshole with borderline Asperger's too but I recognize there is no benevolence in or required by him. 
By staying here people are saying they either agree with him or they value this board more than the 'inconvenience' he creates for them. Either way they have no argument other than "wah no one agrees with me. wah."


Is this hyperbole? I understand the parallel you are trying to make. I.e. 'Everyone is fine with a benevolent dictator that's for them.' Yeah - that's the point of freedom. You get to choose your own leaders, or not, and in what capacity. I don't think anyone is actually give Theymos power to dictate over anything other than what he created. That's like being mad at a child for destroying their sandcastle, though.
I can't change Theymos but I can affect how much influence he has in my life by my own actions. That does not include posting on board about how much I disagree with Unless I am crazy. 
I don't think anyone is defending Theymos, either. Not even himself. At least I'm not. If I'm not clear in my posts I can clarify. I'm pointing out the people who throw tantrums tend not to produce enough of substance to get their way - hence they throw tantrums.
At the end of the day I see Theymos as a constant that does not yield to popular demand. That trait alone is worth my loyalty/following to an extent. I don't believe he is the best, and far from ideal. It's not that he is so good (He does pretty good, though) but everyone else who could replace him is just that bad.

Brute forcing the private keyspace would take longer than there is energy in the Universe.
If you also compute the public keys and addresses you would have many collisions in the address space because a big number is compressed into a smaller number.

It's a communications tool. If the math is hard for you:
1 Input = ~ 180 bytes
1 output = ~ 34 bytes but you'll likely have two for the change
With overheard make it about 250 bytes for the smallest transaction (e.g. buying a coffee). 250 bytes * 4bn
That's 1 terabyte of storage every year for just Starbucks coffee. If you think you can scale that by just increasing the block size you have a fundamental misunderstanding of more than just Bitcoin. 
Oh, also, if you are justifying coffee you may as well justify use cases that aren't so trivial - insurance, contracts, etc. So if coffee - arguably the simplest transaction - takes up 1 terabyte a year how much would those cost?
There is something called separation of concerns. It's a nifty pattern. You could check it out and learn something new!
Edit: Your analogy is very poor. Reddit is redundant maybe once or twice over. The block chain is redundant thousands of times over. It also has to propagate that many times across the network. So, even if you justified the block size somehow (e.g. "storage is cheap") Bandwidth is not and storing the unspent transaction outputs in the memory pool is not.

Crypto is very similar to that. We need to voluntarily raise money, but can't loot. Instead of raising money to send an army out, we raise money to start a business. It's much more peaceful.

Eh, if you are fine with someone who is abusing the system to their advantage then OK. I imagine what would happen if, say, Peter Todd deleted a comment from Mike Hearn on one of his commits. 
I still think it's an abuse to censor opinions that disagree with you when they comment on your work. 
It's OK if you are willing to look past principles because of Gavin's reputation. You should just make your own, separate, coin for that.

There are a bunch of mistakes you could have figured out on your own searching the forums.
If you place an order, publicly, everyone knows. We compensate. You've just aligned the entire mining industry against you.
You need to make your own chips. Build your own factory. Do you own design. Not tell anyone. Produce more on your own than the entire world has produced and then, congratulations, we just patch the software and switch mining algorithms. Everything you just did is worthless.

I think this doesn't pass econ 101.
If the Lightning Network is able to increase the number of tx while using the Bitcoin network as a settlement/fee network then whatever the cost of a Bitcoin tx is, X, will only cost X/n on the lightning network where n is the number of tx's settled.
Correct me if I'm wrong. I haven't dug into LN as I should have but that is my understanding - effectively Bitcoin settles LN tx through clever tx chaining.
Edit: Or are you saying for 1 person to pay X to override the LN shadyness is too much? Eh... That's a real stretch buddy. "I'm not willing to pay a $25 fee to override the shady goings-on for the $.10 fee network on my $2.50 coffee tx." What's the use case on the LN side?

American is... like 1.25 years in debt, right? ~20 Trillion in Debt with ~15 Trillion GDP. So America has to devote ~1.25 years worth of taxable income -- every penny of it -- to be out of debt.
What if we just pushed it to the point where America is 100 years in debt? E.g. 1,500 Trillions in debt would be 100 years worth of the current GDP. 
Crazy math adjustments aside, I'm talking about pushing the debt snowball to a point where we cannot return. Thus, forcing changing?

@_date: 2015-11-10 18:00:58
Well, I don't think anything Todd says in that post is bad...
All he shows is, mathematically, how ~30% of the network hash is a cutoff for immediately publishing your mined blocks and using the extra time to achieve head starts on the next blocks.
And then using other miners' data based on which address they published in the coinbase to approximate how far along they are on their next blocks.
As for strawman... Well, the only far fetched thing in that post seems to be controlling network propagation. 
If I understand it correctly in my 5 minute skim it looks like the underlying message is how easy it would be to attack the network at the node-level and control which parts of the network see my blocks without giving away how far along I am in mining the next ones.
If you're a nation state with no regard for scarcity what's setting up 10,000 Bitcoin nodes and controlling network propagation mean? Basically nothing in terms of cost.
Maybe I misunderstand

I think this is your best post. There are tons of awesome people here who will answer questions. For some reason, folks seem to want to march in with their idea (opinion) and defend it from us. Thank you for asking a question.
You're asking me, so I will give you my answer. It is not the best. I know of betters. (You're going to have to find those.)[


As of today, 3LO (Three Letter Org) has completed their master plan. They've leveraged the might an unnamed government to seize control of multiple Industrialists around the global who contribute to the production of Bitcoin mining equipment. 
They immediately begin to siphon production, masking their entry into the marketplace. Immediately buying up miners would result in massive shortages and increases in price leading to a huge increase in entrepreneurial interest - possibly spurring growth in mining companies. Regardless, they funnel massive cash into these companies. Picking the winners in the marketplace. 
The Industrialists comply because the cash influx will increase fuel their R&amp;D and they will outpace their competitors. Even better if the unnamed government can pass law prohibiting or making it difficult for new producers to enter the market. Something like 'You need a permit we issue you to operate a Bitcoin business. We are grandfathering in these companies we recognize."
Remember, what you are proposing government do is essentially the same thing it does when it 'stimulates' the economy. It's creating an artificial bubble with artificial demand. It selects its favorites. Maybe they can support a global, covert, fascist regime that outpaces the entire market. I think this would be difficult since, again, they are essentially pumping money into the Bitcoin economy just to destroy the Bitcoin economy. They are trying to pay us to go away via brute force, in this scenario.
Next, we've added about 600,000 TH to the network in the past 6 months. You need to match current production as well as ramp yourself up to the growing hash rate. Out of the gate, you need to produce 100,000 TH a month of mining equipment just to avoid falling behind. Alright, you've taken the position that 3LO has near unlimited resources. Fine, fractional reserve banking makes this... possible.
Everything is a commodity and commodities' prices always drift toward the cost of production. I'm not going to look up prices. That's more effort than my opinion is worth. Essentially, take what the entire world spends on Bitcoin mining in a month. That is how much you have to spend to keep up. Plus, you need to overspend as much as possible to catch up to where the rest of the world is. 
So... logistically this is looking unsound. Economically, this is a poor idea. But that's OK, we are malicious and have the power to tax. 
We've done it. We picked a block and for the last six months we've mined a separate chain. Month after month, we outpaced the entire Bitcoin mining network. We now have the longest chain. The only transactions are our own coinbase transactions. With the press of this button, we erase the past six months of Bitcoin economic activity Moo Whoo haahahahahahahahahaha.
And we go full asshole. Fuck you Bitcoin. Open wide, here comes the rogue blockchain. We slam the network like a drunk teenager driving his friends home on prom night. 
Hodlers riot... Miners commit suicide. Satoshi Nakamoto reveals himself messaging from the one, true, private key that received the Genesis Block Coinbase... Andreas Antonopolous goes on Joe Rogan and apologizes. The Chair of the Federal Reserve masturbates into the american flag on live television...
Stepping back from sarcasm... The network is based on consensus. We have the power to fork the network. Publicly, this is like saying "We recognize this as an attack. We are not going to reward this behavior." It's as simple as a Software patch that says ignore that fork. Yes, this calls to question the immutability of the Blockchain. Yes, this strengthens the idea that Bitcoin is antifragile and a market implementation of Democracy. 
Essentially, it would be trivial to patch the clients/protocol to say 'ignore the chain branching from this block with this hash and choose this one.'  Of course that is nuclear. There would probably exist a group, and if there wasn't 3LO should probably fund the creation of one, that would argue the longest chain stands. OK, let's humor that. 
We're now block tyrants. As long as no one updates their Software. So long as no developer patches Proof of Work, to say, Proof of Stake, or X11 or even just another Proof of Work algorithm that, say, uses a variable thus making every Bitcoin mining in the world obsolete (and resetting us to GPU/Bot Net/Data Center levels of mining for a short time until new ASICs are produced - essentially this buys the network time to figure out a plan while ASICs ramp up again). And so long as the miners keep acting against their best interest - We. Rule. Bitcoin.
TLDR: It would be a short term confusion that would quickly fixed with a patch. Nakamoto Consensus would fork the bad actor out of the network and force them to start over, while reaping the benefit of their massive cash injections into our market.
This should be called the "Stop Hitting Yourself" attack. Because that's all attacker accomplishes.
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:43:03
I'm not disagreeing, so please help me understand. If someone pays you $300 in bitcoin you have to earn them more than just holding that bitcoin would earn them. If they invest fiat, even with the $40 fee, you just have to earn them more than $340. Minus however much the gov/banks devalue it in the mean time vs a &lt;1% savings account.
@_date: 2016-10-19 18:56:26
If they did something, like unlimited block size, they'd be DOS'd into the dirt in a few days.
The cost of the attack is inexpensive. Miners would have to constantly drop complex transactions from their pool. 
The bottom line is they don't fork because they will fail. They don't have developers because the developers who know the work recognize the feasibility does not align with expectations. 
Until they learn to trade their FUD for developers or gain skills themselves we just have to put up with their bullshit. 
I mean, after all, Roger Ver is who he is because he sold fireworks for Bitcoin. Not because he is a programmer. He spouts austrian/ancap ideology because it's nice to claim moral superiority 'hurr durr my money doesn't pay for war' but it doesn't make him an economist.

I agree its ridiculous to reduce the size. Like I originally said, it needs raised.

in-chip mining has nothing to do with mining for a profit. 
It has to do with using Bitcoin tx's to power device-to-device communications. Do you understand what that means?
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:11:13
I believe the original quote also included something along the lines of "We can handle micropayments when the bandwidth becomes available"
I still do not believe the bandwidth exists to allow for an increase of 20MB as has been proposed by some in the community. No cap at all is almost as big a joke as a 2000% increase.
Who in the community is arguing that we should never raise the blocksize? I have seen no one with a voice seriously say we should leave things at 1MB but I am not omniscient.

The average cell phone is wrapped in multiple layers of logic and tech that account for things like user experience. 
The average user doesn't say stupid things like "Eeee gads only 800ish cell phone frequencies for a single city? But there are millions of people! Increase that number or we're all doomed! DOOMED!"
Though, slap open source on it, put a former Google employee in front of people and watch the lemmings line up to repeat what they say.

Yes, exactly. Hundreds, or thousands of individuals can run a miner at a small loss and eat the cost no problem. Large mining farms cannot do that.
Have you read what 21 Mining is about?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:57:19
Yes, I have no user base and I do not care about people who refuse to take the time to go out and find their own answers. They don't ask questions. They posit facts that are wrong and use their emotions as their 'arguments'
Those people are entirely worthless. They do not improve or change. They cling. When others try to improve or change they do what they can to keep getting their way. 
The point still remains, none of these people can present compelling evidence - or even understand what compelling evidence means. 
They think "Hur dur, it's 1 Megabyte??? That's nothing we need to make it huge" and that's it. They have no idea why that might be bad. It would take them all of 5 minutes to read a relevant forum thread to become informed. Nope. The cognitive dissonance is too much for them.
Edit: the only thing about them I can respect is at least they are trying to innovate - i.e. making their own forum. However, the market has spoken. No one is interested in the circle jerk that is or whatever other fragmented slew of sewer subs they come up with

Alright, gotcha. 
Please consider making an issue post on  since this is a software problem that you are experiencing and clearly not something you are doing. 
(You're aware the tiny triangles pointing to the right mean you can click them and they open a dropdown of addresses... right. You aren't just going off half cocked about software that works for everyone else not working for you without actually testing).
I would bet a non-trivial amount of Bitcoin your address is under the Change/Used/HD addresses and you just have no idea what you are doing and are blaming software for your ignorance.

Ok, so because he does not elicit a 1:1 match up with legacy fiat being the model for Bitcoin that makes this statement:

Yeah, the problem I have is this has all been hashed out a million times already. Everyone thinks their opinion is valuable and original and it just isn't. The debate should have nothing to do with the public - their vote is their adoption. If they want to change code, start coding and attract the user base. That's as far as it should go.
Throwing tantrums and arguing over what is more important is old hat. Smarter people than us and those who visit Reddit have already worked through most of this. That's the point.

Reddit is not the only place for discussion. 
Plenty of other options exist. I don't understand how a single, or group of users, user experience in receiving the dialog affects the actual dialog.

No, there is nothing constructive about block size on Reddit. The discussion has been going on for 4.5 years and these kids think that just because they are part of it now their opinions matter.
Most of the folks qualified to intelligently discuss it have moved on because of people like who do nothing but parrot whatever the most charismatic person of the month is to them. They are a cancer in the community. 
The camp of people who take issue with the personal opinions of a forum mod in that mod's forums are the same people who are throwing tantrums because every time they try to leave said forum and do their thing no one else goes with them. So they rubber band back here, dump their anxiety on whichever target is closest.
It makes complete sense. Their leader throws tantrums because his 'peers' won't merge his code to core. So his followers throw tantrums. The best thing is that Bitcoin does not care about them. If this were Democracy politicians would be lining up to serve these people. This is a major reason why I love Bitcoin - these people can't get their way no matter how loud they yell.

Then everyone needs to put in as much skin as the miners and companies building Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-10-20 01:42:18
Yeah, it's an old argument that an organization like the NSA can operate its own chip facilities incognito. I remember a many page thread on Bitcointalk.org that you could research.
You should step back from trying to defend Bitcoin. Andreas Antonopolous has many talks available that pose and answer the ideas you have here. It's literally so frequent a discussion that for anyone whose been around longer than a year it's basically scripted.
The shortcut is this is a very weak attack that is expensive to implement, quick to mitigate, and easy to see. My off-the-cuff, skeptical, gut-shot opinion is the best possible outcome for an attacker is reseting mining back to GPU speeds for a short time at the cost of tranfering enormous amounts of wealth into the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:10:04
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Don't use your holdings, this needs to be in addition to regular buys/investments.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:36:10
That's ridiculous. The organization - government - is corrupt enough as is without conspiracy. If you think corporations run government then why do they need to lobby at all? It's such a painfully backwards misunderstanding of how the world works it hurts.
Just because it's blatantly obvious in effect that manipulation is occuring does not substantiate every bloviating conspriacy theorist. 
You may as well say "Lizards that live behind the moon are manipulating the dollar because they drink the tears of bankers."

I'm actually not anonymous. 
Again, I don't owe you or anyone else anything other than non-violence. When people surge to this forum just to agress against mods personal opinions it's harmful. I'm not going to be polite to them. You can, that's fine. That's why they do what they do, though - they think they can get away with it. It breeds that entitlement mentality they have.
"I can keep yelling louder and louder and people will keep being polite. If I just keep yelling until they get sick of it they'll change to do what I want"
I reserve my kindness for kind people. I reserve my respect for people who are respectful because I value those things and I don't hand them out to anyone just because they breath and feel like they are entitled to it. It's all covered in the last chapter of Dale Carnegie's famous book. In short, dignity.

Bitcoin is microeconomics - enabling individuals.

You're just dumb.
1) You left the coins there. 
I intentional don't say 'your' coins. They aren't yours until you control them. You may have paid for them, but they are Coinbase coins until you take control of them.
2) Private Business doesn't give enough fucks about you to steal your money.
Coinbase makes a lot more than your pittance. The negative rep hit is a bigger loss. Are you seriously proposing that Coinbase has a business model of 'Let people buy our product. Never let them use it/just keep the product'
Then you're an idiot
3) Did you do a taint analysis? Did you tumble your coins? Nope. You left them on Coinbase. It takes ~5 seconds to send them to Shapeshift, get litecoin. The send litecoin to shapeshift and get brand new bitcoin back.
For whatever reason, nanny state USGov thinks you are a criminal. It's not like Coinbase put millions of dollars into analysis Software just to sell coins. They get an alert for your name. They flag your account. 
Coinbase can get shut down/go to jail if they don't comply - which means you still wouldn't have control over the coins you bought.
Finally... You introduced trust to a trustless system. You broke Bitcoin for yourself. That's on you.
Bottom Line: You are paying for your lack prior of education with contemporary discomfort, potentially prison time if you are a dumb criminal. Most criminals are dumb

This is kind of what I mean in my other post. There is so much shortsightedness because everything in this community has to be black or white.
What about a federated system that whitelists/blacklists and only allows nodes that belong to the top five banks in the world? There is no need for anonymity and no risk of a Sybil attack. There is no hashing arms race. They all instantly gain the ability to hide/transfer/store indiscriminate amounts of wealth from anyone to anyone at any time.

Seriously "Yeah, the majority of our member experience for your sub involves our camp chastising and deriding yours until notable, useful, effective, members of your community until they stop showing up. How dare you lump all of us in that group?"
No thank you. It's the Internet and this pattern happens time and again. "Don't lump everyone in the same bucket." Nah, you have repercussions for the company you keep. That's just a fact.

Exactly. It's just a fancy linked list without all the peer to peer network, protocol or proof of work.
It's a great way for the people who currently control entrance barriers - banks, medical corporations - to control the entrance further. 
Why should an oligopoly of banks or hospitals open up their data to the public? For them and their gains, they shouldn't. However, sharing that data, selectively, as customers move between them is a huge advantage. 
If you have ever tried to get your medical records across multiple providers you will understand the complexity.

In the US Fiat currency was backed by precious metal for about 40 years. Over the lifespan of fiat currency, 11th century(ish) that is a tiny, little blip on the radar. Even in the history of the US system, that gold backing was only a requirement of Germany after WW2 to keep American currency curators honest while everyone paid back their debts to the US - since that was a term of surrender, using US dollars. 
Still with me?
Backing is stupid. Without human beings to give something value nothing has value. So when you ask a stupid question like "What backs your currency" nothing stops the person being asked to question right back "What gives what-the-fuck-ever you posit as having value its value?" 
Utlimately, every path leads to "Some human(s) recognize it as having value." Whether that's being able to redeem it for a rock with uses in electronics or jewelery or not having a government beat the shit out of you if don't use it, ultimately what backs everything in terms of value is human perception.

Another way: The club waves the cost to get in the door but you still have to pay for drinks. Just because your drink costs $.95 now and the club fee is free doesn't mean the consumer is going to ignore the cost to get in the door when the price goes up.

Oh, I guess I am mistaken. I thought the purpose of a deal aggregate was the take all of the deals from the landing pages with the offers and organize them in one place.
When I goto  all I see is a signup. So I treat it like an email harvester. There is nothing on that page that would make me want to visit. 
Releasing the deal information early would be pointless for me, anyway, by now. It's too late. I've already budgeted for the holidays because 99% of retailers release circulars and information that detail the specifics of what they are offering for Black Friday.
Why would I wait until the day of to find out if a TV deal for bitcoin is going to beat Target's deal? That's a bad plan and a great way to miss out.

I refer you back to my initial comment on folks who won't take the time to learn for themselves. Commenting is fine, comment all day, comment until your heart is content. If that was all they were doing they would stay in their trivial subs. They don't do that. They harass and harangue from a position of entitlement. 
I have to pick through their garbage to get to the info I want. If I call out one or two of them along the way I really don't care about losing that 'commenter.'
Furthermore, it's standard for non-medical personal to comment about Cancer. It doesn't mean they march into their oncologists office and demand treatments switch from chemotherapy to acupuncture, meditation or apple seeds or what the hell ever new age crap they believe in.

Yeah, I guess if you approach it that way.
I think with a little innovation it would lead to the creation of a crypto ecosystem. A web of coins, intermingled with one another. Chaining transactions across chains. Conditional/Smart contracts firing off like dominoes. 
A new framework for corporations. I help startup Crypto Coffee with 1 bitcoin and get 1,000,000 CC coins. The value of CC coin creates a new market for traders. Even if Bitcoin fails, CC Coin will still be mining.
Billions of fractions of shares from hundreds of millions of companies make up your crypto stock portfolios. 
Autonomous software create hundreds of new corporations a day. Their average lifespan could be measured in minutes. 
We're literally talking about a framework limited by bandwidth and processing power. The most sophisticated financial system imagined couldn't compare.

Jon Matonis is a very high-end scammer. 
He founded and worked for the Bitcoin Foundation. Most of their members have been exposed as fraudsters, some are in jail. Matonis has never actually contributed anything to Bitcoin. During his tenure in TBF he grossly miss-spent funds on elaborate parties and conventions for his close friends in the name of 'growing Bitcoin' and paid himself and Gavin exorbitant salaries.
I've been following the guy a long time. He's not a good person despite presenting himself as a sort of bumbling, nice guy who only means to do well. Yet he keeps getting into these situations...
Here's a short history:

It's like using transaction volume on the network to gauge currency velocity (I'm probably mincing that definition)
It costs very little for me to send large sums of bitcoin back and forth between addresses I control all day long.

Meh, I don't find it argumentative to take someone at their word. 
When you make a mass appeal to 'the people' you're speaking about the majority or the masses. Mincing words is a political strategy. 
There are no discussions to be had with politicians because their words have no value. Their words can't have value because they need to be able to constantly redefine their meaning at a moment's notice to suit their audience.
Anyone who points out this strategy is subject to hyperbole. 
E.g. 'When I said 'the people' I didn't actually mean the masses. I meant the individuals. But you are argumentative because you won't accept my shifting framing of reality as it changes to suit my need.'

Computers can create fingerprints for data. 
Fingerprints are numbers computed from the file's binary (1's and 0's).
All data has a different fingerprint.
Bitcoin provides rules for Bitcoin's data.
If a miner can find a fingerprint that follows Bitcoin's rules and the fingerprint is a number within a target range (Also part of Bitcoin's rules) the miner is permitted to give themselves some Bitcoin using a specific transaction, a coinbase.

Why does he believe the payment network and settlement system are coupled?
Why can't the payment network be something else and leave Bitcoin entirely as it is? Doesn't it make more sense for, say, Starbucks to start their own chain and cryptocurrency and back their coin with Bitcoin? Thus keeping transactions where the interests align?
It's a bit of a hub-and-spoke model. I think it makes more sense. Bitcoin miners mine Bitcoin. Starbucks Miners mine Starbucks coin. Starbucks coin settles to the Bitcoin block chain.
Instead of making everyone's morning coffee purchase a Bitcoin purchase leave it a Starbucks problem. 
Otherwise we're going to continuously see this same argument.

You only need the info required to generate the private key. If you don't have that/can't replicate that you need the private key. 
From the private key the public key is created.
No. Having your privkey written on paper will not allow you to withdraw. You will need to get the key inside wallet software or otherwise use the key to craft the transaction. The piece of paper is, at best, a shitty backup.

Which is not an incentive for the banks to adopt it in that form. Which goes back to exactly what I keep saying - private chains offer a use case to some people. 
They are not as good for the masses as others but restricting the benefits of a blockchain to a small group of people who are at odds still provides benefits to them while keeping others out. 
Medical information, Banking information, etc. will have private chains long before a decentralized solution exists. In the least, this community needs to recognize that not every sector of the market is going to be moving at light speed. Indeed, many of them don't want to adopt this technology and will try to subvert it as much as possible.

I still disagree. 
Without a Bitcoin transaction you have nothing to charge a fee against.
Without a block reward the consumer has to pay the cost of the transaction. That ranges from $2 to $5 right now. 
It's like a bank saying "Free ATMs" but when you use a gas station ATM it charges it's own fee separate from your bank. The Bitcoin Network eats the cost of the transaction and you're able to provide a service on top of the network within the margin. 
If users had to pay the fee entirely themselves then it would still cost the $.9 or whatever it is for your service but they would still have to cover transaction fees.
Just because you consider yourself a separate line item doesn't exempt you from the total cost when you are coupled with what comes before your service.

If OP re-used the same address it is possible the thief obtained access while the balance was low and they were waiting for the tx to broadcast. 
That way more funds can be added but if OP tried to spend them they get stolen. It's a way to wait for more money.
If the thief is confident in their connection - E.g. they can propagate a tx faster than OP - they will win the race every time. Basically connect to more nodes, or nodes with a high number of connections. I think Bitpay disclosed that you can monitor something like 3-4 nodes and if a tx reaches them you have a 99.99999% chance of a zero conf tx not being double spent

Right now, the public ledger Bitcoin uses is still private. It's open to participate but nothing stops anyone else from running an invitation only network.

I am incredibly interested in blockchains and medical records. However, the hurdles are astounding. 
You would think that healthcare would be interested in technology, and on some fronts that is true. However, as an industry, it's largely behind.
A big part of this is Cerner and Epic. The health systems that are the dominant players in medical software/medical records. There is nothing fancy about either - they work poorly, actually. They are just entrenched. 
Good luck convincing a health system to switch medical records. Dozens of companies are trying to merge records, consolidate both companies data, etc, etc. 
Healthcare is an industry that will need to be reset entirely. It won't happen in the US - that country is already working hard at destroying healthcare anyway

I didn't read the entire thing - time - but it looks like he is describing a block withholding attack in the beginning - which we've seen happen up to five blocks. Or, at least, I can think of one pool that has released that many in within a minute of each other before.

If teenagers on Reddit have the power to affect Bitcoin development then maybe Bitcoin isn't as strong as we thought it was.
I don't think the childishness has done anything other than identify toxic actors, remove them and ostracize communities that contribute little to no good.
Yes, I'm saying there isn't much good to come out of this subreddit other than a news source and echo chamber. I would go so far as to say that more misinformation comes out of Reddit than actionable information.

And by 'us' I mean the spectrum of folks between libertarian and ancap.
That's still a tiny sliver of the pie. Most Americans would not understand why the destruction of oil refineries would lead to higher gasoline costs. Or that we may run out one day and that dwindling supply contributes to higher demand.
It's still an interesting correlation

Like I told you in the original post. Some people don't want to connect every single device they own to their Bitcoin wallet.
Seriously, are you daft? I send my toothbrush 500 bits. Fucking awesome! Now every transaction I've ever done in my wallet is linked to my toothbrush! The  change address from that tx gets linked to 20 other change tx's and future links my toothbrush to other transactions in my wallet.
Great. Now all someone has to do is lift one of my smart devices and see where large sums of Bitcoin are coming from and there's a giant target right in the blockchain that says "This address is controlled by the owner"
21 inc devices should be completely separate from spending bitcoin.

Electrum is written in Python. So you lucked out on cross platform support - just like how the QT framework is platform independent you lucked out on CORE. 
I believe MultiBit relies or did rely on BitcoinJ. Oh hey, look at that, Windows user's luck out again because the language is cross platform. 
Regardless, My point is that Windows 'programmers' are mostly just drag and drop artists. It would be interesting to hear how someone interested in Bitcoin could justify using Windows other than their own ignorance. /shrug. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:06:39
Exactly. 
The supply decreases as they buy the coins. That drives the price of the remaining coins upward - it's not like the economy just stops using them. There are just fewer. 
Like when you try to buy out all the homes in an area to build a road. The last person to sell gets the highest value.
And the nice thing about Bitcoin - you can only spend bitcoin once before you have to earn them or buy them again

I don't think OP or I are referring to teaching the intricate specifics of the back end to anyone in this post. Or the economics.
The education gap will be closed with appropriate metaphor. Email is a great example - the name is the metaphor. Bitcoin is similar. Wallets, to Mailboxes. Etc. 
Something I identify is that email is simpler to explain because the laymen "computers can copy what I type and send it really fast" understanding of a computers capability hurts Bitcoin education. It's a story even a lot of early adopters admit to having - thinking it's impossible to prevent double spends without a central authority.
So your listener will be with you up to that point then think they have outsmarted you. "But I know a computer can just copy my bitcoin file and I can send the same ones to many different people." When you try to explain why that's not possible you hit the education problem.
That's the precipice. The rest is uncharted territory where ordinary people and education is concerned.
Conspiracy theory labels isn't really a problem when the government is $20T in debt. It's cognitive dissonance that's the true hurdle. That's why I say people will have to change - either they accept a simplified explanation via metaphor (And I identified one key problem) or they get over their public schoole brainwashing.
