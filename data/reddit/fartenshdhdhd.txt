I recently stopped trading on localbitcoins and moved to  Paxful just before LocalBitcoins forced ALL users to KYC...even for cash in person) 
I did a bank transfer trade ( sold BTC for SEPA bank transfer) The guy had perfect stats and longtime LBC vendor whom I have had many successful trades with so when he wanted to buy 1 BTC for 15'000 I had no reason to be cautious (Usually he buys about 1'000USD once a month and never had a problem in two years) 
Anyway it turns out the guy had a gambling problem (or just a scumbag fraudster) and after I got payment and releasing his BTC he claims his account was hacked and the bank took his side and refunded the money since I had no proof I sold him good and LBC wouldn't even give me a statement showing the other guy made a transaction with me. 
Their support took weeks to answer (this was in November 2017) and essentially they cut me off saying they couldn't help and I needed to talk with the bank but of course the bank had already closed the case in the three weeks it took LBC to even reply and I was out of pocket 15K. 
Bank stopped replying to me and closed my account, LBC stopped replying and I lost all the money I ever made in crypto
Since then I have had a much better experience selling on paxful (their support answers in hours and not weeks) and if they have vendor live chat where I can get support if someone is trying to scam me instantly, they even allowed me to move over some of my reviews and stats from LBC once they verified they were legit. (if anyone wants me to put them in contact with their onboarding manager let me know) 


I wonder can we make a class action lawsuit as your case seems very similar to mine. Will PM you regarding it
 LocalBitcoins has been circling the drain ever since they forced all users to KYC and as a result, their volume is moving to paxful where the support at least try to help stop scams, have live chat and answer in hours instead of weeks

The Peer to Peer aspect will become more and more clear in the following years. Why use banks when you can give power to the people!
