But SegWit solves almost nothing. Even if everyone uses it helps to increase the capacity about 50%-60%? How is that better than let’s say increasing the block size to 8MB. My point is Bitcoin is so heavily used that SegWit alone is not sufficient and LN is to complicated + needs you to have channels almost everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:48:26
So tell me what happens if everyone is using SegWit. It’s like the block size would be 2MB?
With 1MB we have 7tps so 2 means 14. So how does it solve anything? 
SegWit can help just as a start layer for off chain solution like LN but noone knows when it’s going to be adopted. 
Increasing blocksize won’t help on long run but will give us time.  I’m not for BCH I hold BTC but current situation is unacceptable, it’s only a matter of time when markets find out and money move either completely out of crypto or to another tokens
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:01:57
It’s not, your private keys never leave the device. 
But update anyway it could be used to spoof destination address and if you don’t check what’s on hw wallet display you are in trouble
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:05:06
My view is that SegWit alone solves nothing as it is similar like block size increase to 2MB so the very next day the mempool is full anyway. 
I’m saying let’s increase blocksize to some reasonable number majority agrees and in the meantime people can focus on implementation of LN and other possible solutions for scalability?
You were originally saying SegWit solves the problem but never replied to me how. So please tell me.

maybe you have not noticed, but ADA is tanking more than Bitcoin today
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:47:26
I don't participate in BTC/BCH fights but it's clear BCH is not Bitcoin (BTC) and as such any related BCH link should not be on CMC Bitcoin page.
It's not propaganda nor anything else, it's just simple truth and reality.
I don't get why BCH people are still trying to convince everyone that BCH is actually BTC. That's nonsense and it's hurting all the crypto community.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:41:15
even tech - it's matter of opinion. ADA is PoS and majority held by few individuals who you have to trust.

@_date: 2017-12-26 08:17:51
Yes, unfortunately. I would wait for a good time when the mempool is not flooded and do it. That happens usually on weekends but even now it doesn’t seem to be really bad. 
I think it’s better not to wait with it for months as then, this “migration” transaction might cost you a fortune.

how do you connect Ledger Nano to Bitcoin Core?
I was trying to have this setup just few days ago and found it's not supported.
Closest thing you can do is to use Electrum Personal Server which connects to your Bitcoin Core node and then you can plug your Ledger Nano to Electrum wallet which is connecting thru the Personal Server to your Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2018-09-15 15:21:22
I was running Lightning for some time but then I quit. It was not helping the network. To do so you would need to fund it quite a lot to open as many channels as possible 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:13:44
I was following this thread in the past and it seems it’s still not resolved. I think it’s absolutely unacceptable and cannot recommend Trezor to anyone.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:37:56
No need for insults. Why they would not allow different tiers for withdrawal fees depending how quickly people need their tx to complete? Isn’t that a whole point of tx fees to distinguish between important and less important txs?

I think all you named were affected by a hack in past
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:13:20
You need to create a SegWit wallet on your Nano if you don’t have it yet. Transfer all your coins to it and you are done. Anytime you send a tx it’ll be SegWit. 
Following article can help you.

@_date: 2018-09-15 16:07:26
Kind of :) Normally I would just let it sit. But with my small amount I had a feeling I lost few mBTC because some of my channels were closed/reopened by autopilot and the fee to propagate it onchain could not be covered from what I would ever make on routing fees. If I could afford to put there few BTC I guess it would be fine. But I’m not so lucky :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:21:46
Yea that’s understandable. I bought cryptosteel anyway as for me the important feature is I can change the seed easily. Punching was too much hassle for me. One must be at least a bit handy and it takes quite a lot of time. Sometimes you also need to start over again if you punch the letter with insufficient force and when you want to “repunch” it’s not always readable 
@_date: 2018-09-22 07:36:43
Well how is it different from buying plates made of titanium and stamper set from shops like aliexpress or ebay?
I did it some weeks ago and I think titanium is much better than steel. Not to mention I payed like 20 USD shipping included
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:11:44
Well 80K USD is not so much. Even for some BTC haters. Just saying....
@_date: 2018-09-15 15:55:19
I put in like 0.2 BTC to start with and opened few channels manually which I consider to be used by people: satoshi.place, lightningspin bittrefil for the rest I let autopilot to do the work. I ended up with about 20 channels. But when i was checking how my lnd node is used it was something about 20 routed tx a month so not really worth running. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:48:49
I’m happy with Bitcoin. You can be using what you want and how you want. But majority decided what is Bitcoin and what is not. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 09:57:19
but if they fork they can also activate a new difficulty rules or am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:36:48
But they were saying no censorship right?
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:29:53
Hmm matbe I need to learn more about this. I’m afraid I don’t get it and how it is related to difficulty .
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:29:15
Like no change to EDA?

Thank you. This one looks good
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:25:32
thanks, but I'd like to send also payments via my node
@_date: 2018-08-16 09:20:34
But that’s my point. If the difficulty is adjusted sooner it’s better to avoid peeks when there is either very high or very low hash power. Just imagine miners would turn now to mine some other sha256 coin like it happened in the past for bcash. You could be waiting for new blocks forever. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:25:55
it's not for iOS if I'm not mistaken
@_date: 2018-08-10 19:17:38
Only problem with this is you cannot make any real amount. TX fees are so low and there are many nodes with even lowered fee rate and high capacity. With 0.2 he can make just few satoshi a month. And then you need to also count with onchain tx fee when closing a channel
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:44:54
If I recall well there were some posts in past it’s a dead project
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:33:31
So what. Change is change. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:39:31
This discussion goes on forever. You cannot increase blocksize indefinitely. But if you think that’s right approach that’s fine. You have your BCASH altcoin
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:33:14
but it's some random tweet. I hope it's true but come on, where is the source which can be validated?

I guess more effective would be just to DDoS their site
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:52:37
I sold mine as soon as I got it from fork, I never trusted in BCH
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:43:56
Thanks, can you recommend anything?
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:15:03
How come everyone is so sure about security when it's not opensource. I mean what is the guarantee there's not a backdoor in the firmware waiting for activation? From what I can see it also communicates with pc thru web browser addons like Trezor does with Chrome. If there's a malicious code inside the device I guess it would be very easy to sent your private keys to anyone. I'm really not sure if hw wallet is more secure than your laptop with opensource linux/bsd distro used as offline wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-14 06:36:57
But it could also turn very bad. It’s unsure how markets would react. Just imagine that massive propaganda from shitcoiners how BCASH is better as it’s price is 500$ and Bitcoin price only 7$. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:28:42
Well but attacker would still need a seed, no? So the only problem is, if I'm selling forked coins with lower value I'm losing also same amount of my high value original coin
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:10:31
Can anyone help me to understand what's going to happen with my BTC? I don't like FIAT so I put in some money into BTC to save something for the future.
I see there are now 2 groups one wants SegWit2x and the other does not. When I take a look on Coin.Dance it shows SegWit2x intention on 90.3%. Does it mean that in such a situation SegWit2x wins and becomes a main BTC coin and the other will be vanish in the future?

they are definitely capable to design their own asics much better than Bitmains. Do you really think doing the space program, designing and building weapons is easier than design an ASIC?

For the full node I was following 
And for solo mining 
Later on I replaced cgminer with bfgminer though. It seems there's a bug in USB drivers on RPi so it crashes whole pi every few hours.
BFGMINER runs just fine. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:06:16
nothing really special. I did general recommendations for RPi, adding swapfile to external disk and decreased dbcache to 100MB. I guess it was "speedy" because I'm on a fast link.

when you do solo mining because your hw is not powerful enough to participate in the pool
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:51:47
It's a solo mining. When you have a device capable of BTC mining but with a really small hash power so it's not worth to mine in a pool, you can try your luck. Chances are almost 0, but you never know :)

@_date: 2018-06-30 13:22:43
But miners can also run their own nodes. I guess they do it anyway so what stops them to modify consensus rules if they decide to do so and have majority of full nodes? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:52:33
I get that. Maybe I’m completely wrong but if we have like about 10k nodes miners can definitely create more than this. It’s much cheaper to create a node than to start mining. 
If the miners do this + run majority of nodes then it means their chain is BTC isn’t it? And all other nodes following the original rules would be left behind. The big question is what would exchanges do. But if they’d switch to miners’ nodes as well then the original chain ends. 
The difficulty gets lowered after 2 weeks time so there would be probably noone able to even produce new blocks. 
Don’t get me wrong I don’t like BCH and I prefer BTC. I just don’t understand how the concept of full nodes help to harden the network. 
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:19:53
thanks, that's definitely good to know. However standard usage is you send the coins and rest goes to a new change address anyway. So this might be only an issue if you keep using same address even after you did some tx out.
And speaking of quantum computing, I'm not sure hash would be any problem
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:03:22
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:33:10
you're definitely right. My problem is I have only a laptop which I need to use at work and I cannot install any applications not approved by my company. Of course I could probably do it some other way like booting from external drive etc. but t's too much hassle. My rpi was just doing nothing anyway so at least it has something to do now :)
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:36:08
I was also sending my BTC yesterday bech32 to bech32, it was for 23 cents and I was in the next block. Cannot complain.
Edit: and another one 48 minutes only 4 cents in fees
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:06:00
That is a good question and I have a feeling lots of people are simply ignoring it pointing do difficulty readjustments but there are two things to this:
1. difficulty change occurs only after 2016 block or so, so if everyone leaves the chain will be in limbo and can stay like this forever
2. if the difficulty is really low and only few miners are then mining, still there will be somewhere stockpile of old asics able to run 51% anytime
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:57:51
I run in from the hub. But was trying directly from pi and it was working fine.  It’s model RPi 3B+
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:50:31
And validating doesn’t mean verifying a hash? So  to verify it you need to compute it?
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:14:09
everyone relying on Trezor's physical security has to believe the vulnerability Ledger has found stays with them and that no-one was able to secretly reproduce it. 
That is not enough for me. I consider Trezor as unsafe device.
To protect my wallet against remote attacks I can use airgapped RPI for much smaller price tag.
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:19:08
Well from my understanding they are not. They are here to verify the blockchain - That everyone follows consensus rules. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:43:54
which means difficulty gets lower = less miners are needed to mine a block.
However the less miners = less hashing power = easier to attack the blockchain
It will be definitely interesting to see how that's going to work or what changes will be done to cope with this.
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:48:48
it's part of the fact but was always claimed by Satoshi Labs that Trezor is safe even against physical attacks. And it turned out quite quickly it's not. If it cannot do that where's the difference between Trezor and airgapped Rpi with special sw and full sd encryption?
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:22:00
yes but I think it's not known publicly. There are many services reusing address, well even Coinbase asks you to save the address after you send the BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:52:29
But people don’t send transactions thru miners. They do it thru nodes, right? Meaning if that happens miners are mining on a different chain not on Bitcoin

More miners will join only if it’s profitable for them. That’s why you have so many altcoins with a very low hashrate. 
When almost all new BTC are mined to keep the hashrate the TX fees would have to be super high - but who wants it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:19:19

When SegWit happened I stayed on legacy as I was afraid something can go wrong - perhaps it was a mistake. Now I'm basically waiting when the mempool is more empty so I can migrate all my legacy coins to SegWit address for a reasonable price. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:19:55
I don't think the price follow the block rate or mining difficulty as you may think. Most people on exchanges do not even care and know anything about it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:39:15
True, but isn't EDA good for miners? At least for a short run. They could get block rewards pretty quickly and when difficulty bumped up they would simply switch to mine BTC and repeat. Hence I would expect few miners fighting against this change 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:32:50

@_date: 2017-11-07 10:45:36
come on, noone knows what really happens in next few weeks and which chain wins. If you want to risk your money, feel free to do it. Luckily Ledger is thinking right way and lets its customers to decide what's best for them. 
If I would be reading this sub or r/btc only it would be very easy to make a wrong step. Both subs are full of nonsense and delusional statements advertised as the only true.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:20:43
In my case I don't use segwit on my Ledger because in case I lost it or is simply broken there is no easy sw solution I can put in my seed and access my funds. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:03:56
The sw including FW is open source on Ledger too. The only hidden thing is the secure element chip.
If there would be a backdoor inside the chip that would be end of the chip manufacturing company. 
They make it for enterprise area and have audited it with trusted parties. It’s highly unlikely there would be a problem. 
On the other hand Trezor device was hacked in past which was doable by not using secure element. They had to fix it in fw but still it’s a bad indicator of their security. 
Ledger was never hacked the problem now is not related to device and can be easily avoided by the user
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:43:27
but that's not fault of HW wallet. HW wallet is here to simply ensure you send the tx to an address displayed on its display. It cannot know if the address you give it to send the tokens to is created by malware or not. It's your task to verify you use correct address by whatever method you need.

@_date: 2019-01-04 13:51:44
the other problem on Pi I read somewhere is, that is sharing Ethernet with USB on the same bus, so the throughput is quite limited. I originally my node on Pi as well but migrated it to Odroid XU4. It was much better.
But now I'm using old Thinkpad, it runs nicely + when there's a power outage I don't end up with corrupted blockchain data and doing the reindex again.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:25:00
You can but you can also overlook or forget. What Trezor has it’s a good feature but can make you feel protected when you are not. The point of HW wallet is that device itself is secure and processes requests as expected. The SW layer (crypto client wallets) can be hacked/scammed by many ways. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:50:36
yea, so you see? It's the same problem. People just need to be aware of importance to verify the address that's all.
Even worse situation is for outgoing TX, then you have very limited way to verify the displayed address you want to send tokens is correct. So how do you want to solve it on Trezor?
The issue described by OP is nonsense, this kind of attack is very well known and cannot be completely mitigated by HW wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:48:55
that's strange. I did the same few month ago and it took almost a month
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:18:47

Device Trezor - was hacked
Device Ledger - no hack so far
Everything else is meaningless standing on guesses and assumptions

People can decide who is right
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:48:11
Just one more addition. How does it help me if I copy the address to my clipboard after verification and the malware changes it inside?It's not a real protection, it's better than nothing but not bulletproof and still prone to many possible attacks
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:08:51
I agree. It's like to try to save the user from himself. It can be done to some extent by wanting confirmation, verification ... but at the end of the day it's still user's responsibility to be sure what's doing.
After all, for some use cases you have almost no way to "save" the user. Let's say I want to send my tokens to an exchange and I have malware on my PC changing the displayed deposit address.
I do the verification on HW wallet display, it' same like the one in browser so happily sign the tx and bang, tokens are gone. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:32:18
you don't know that, let's stick to the facts:
Ledger device - no hack so far
Trezor device - already hacked
Everything else is only guessing 
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:24:41


So you are saying before the hack the Trezor was not open source? Because now we are in a same situation. Trezor is open source since forever and yet you see hack has happened. You cannot claim there are no more problems.


Sorry don't have links now, but I believe you'll find it easily. There was a guy claiming to lost some BCH, then few other cases I saw. Hard to say if it was user error or not


I disagree, this sub is very pro-bitcoin and rejecting anything else. The ledger was trying to protect their customers and that's their business. If s2x would win they could not afford to keep their customers without support. That's actually one more fact I prefer Ledger more. Trezor has its clear political view what's good and what's not. It does not matter if I agree to it or not, because I can be mistaken and you too. So I'm more happy if the company supports all possibilities.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:32:59
good luck in your life, you must be very sad guy
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:06:01
I’m not talking about remote exploit. You wanted a practical example. I gave it to you. 
After all this I simply cannot trust the Trezor enough to keep my tokens on it and have it home. 
And again your assumptions about Ledger are only assumptions. Show me one evidence Ledger was hacked in the past. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:24:51
Read this: 
And it’s only one documented case. We don’t know how many other users were or will be affected. Not everyone updated fw. 
And important message is, that vulnerability was existing in Trezor for many months and we don’t know if it was not exploited before. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:22:28
I was waiting for it. I'm a shill but gave you all the fact while you are talking stuff without giving any evidence. When you have no arguments you just simply repeat all over again your statements but that does not make them true.
It's probably hard to imagine for you, but I have no agenda beside to have my tokens secure a to make money in crypto.
It seems to me you ignore any fact which goes slightly again Trezor as you are strong proponent of Bitcoin.
This discussion does not have anything in common with Bitcoin it's about hw wallet so the only shill here is you.

I can verify the address on the Ledger too. Probably not for all coins but to be honest Ledger supports much more tokens then Trezor does. (where it is not supported I can still do it with help of xpub)
As I said before, Ledger should update its SW to ask for the verification by default, but the described issue is not an issue of HW wallet at all. I have a feeling it's just posted to harm Ledger reputation.
After all you can do the verification for receiving address belonging to your wallet but you cannot do it on outgoing tx when you are sending tokens to an exchange etc. And this is absolutely same problem.
It's the responsibility of user to always verify where he is receiving/sending money.

Well thinking about it, still typing ip directly won't help in every case. When you open the website by using ip, you get the right destination. However any link you click on it is using dns in url and not the ip. So if you have some malware spoofing dns records you still have a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:50:14
just a question. Why are you wasting your time here instead of trying to recover them?
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:25:13
It doesn’t matter where you locked your Ledger, important is where is your seed :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:33:27
how about 3rd party sw? MEW etc? Do you need to do the same in order to continue? Anyways my point is, HW wallet is safe Even with Trezor verification if you just skip it not really checking it or overlooking you have same trouble.
I agree Ledger SW should be more clear about it, but OP does not give anything new, these kind of attacks are known forever and doable everywhere
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:41:16
Source? AFAIK developers PINs are not on production devices
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:58:47
It's also worth to have a look here: 
I think the hack matters even though no-one lost money. (we don't know) But it shows the device was not hack-proof. So it does not matter if you believe in fully open sourced product or with some "hidden" parts. 
As for 8char bug, that's bad but I saw similar reports on Trezor too. In my case I bought Ledger because I needed the support for more altcoins and I like the form factory better.
I put the political views like if they prepared support for s2x etc aside. I just want a secure device giving me as much functionality as possible. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:02:12
I was thinking about using hosts file specifying IP addresses for those services directly. Then securing the file to be writable only by the new admin user id I'll create (speaking of win). On Linux chattr +i or so.
I guess on Linux also resolv.conf has to be secured not sure if there's anything similar on win to take care of. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:09:07
yes, I would go with PiTrezor as well, seems to be quite easy to setup and work with
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:57:28
Yes I get that. I mean as LN is basically pure p2p happening off chain no one can easily tell how much was transacted 
@_date: 2018-07-08 13:12:09
To whoever is running LN node. Did you see some transactions routed thru you?
I brought up my node only few days ago with 20mBTC capacity and opened 4 channels like to satoshi.place, bitrefill etc. so far noone used my node. 
I know I don’t get any money on fee from it as they are too tiny. But I was hoping I’ll be able to help LN network. It looks like similar nodes like mine are for nothing. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:26:48
Just generate an invoice and put it to withdrawal form.  Assuming you run something lnd:
lncli addinvoice —amt 50000
If you are withdrawing 50k satoshi 
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:32:53
Maybe there’s no need depending if your wallet can generate an invoice. I do have iOS so cannot help much but looking at the one I have there (LND Thin Wallet) it supports it
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:59:44
thanks. I'll keep it running for a while maybe the CPU usage drops after some time. Looking at LND log still receives a lot of "channel discovered"
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:13:44
ok instead of 5 minutes you need 30, so what?
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:30:03
It works for me with no problems. I already collected like about 180k satoshi:)
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:20:55
you mean you can opt-in for passhphrase? Because if so you can do this on rpi too and if someone takes the sdcard it's useless for him. 
My point is, that currently I don't see any added value by Trezor for physical security than what you can have on rpi or Odroid or whatever other smallish device.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:12:59
Again Trezor was hacked, Ledger was not. And regarding closed secure element. Tell all the banks around the world to stop using HSMs. 
8char you talking about is just ui glitch and could be always avoided by user. You have many ways to verify the address. 
On the other hand you could not avoid trezor hack
It’s really funny home some people can ignore facts and live in the bubble. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:09:40
yes, I'm not saying otherwise. But is does not matter. Trezor does not protect you against physical attacks
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:36:58
1. , 2) are you really serious? iOS is much more secure does not matter he was using old iphone most likely it was still updated (it is still getting newest OS and patches). Can you say that about Android phones? Definitely not. They are absolute no-go for any secure operations
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:35:07
I have everything synced at this point and was also trying to reboot.
As of memory I think it should not be the biggest problem.
odroid free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1994         963          43           2         987         972
Swap:          4095          64        4031
Without the fan the temperature gets to 85C.
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:19:31
Thank you
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:31:45
This is not a specific vector attack on Ledger. Trezor and all other hw wallets can be scammed this way too.
There are malware out there changing address in the clipboard etc. 
The important thing is the device itself does not have a flaw and you should always check what is the address displayed on the Ledger.
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:44:33
Trezor has same problem as it does not have a secure element, it can relay only on an encryption and you can achieve the same on rpi
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:31:12
Thanks that could be it. Although I see most nodes use default 1000 mSAT fee so I decreased it to 900. How did you select nodes where to connect? When I kept it on an autopilot it opened just one channel with all my balance which I think is not the best thing to do
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:37:40
But it can also mean there is no volume. Only channels opened with that capacity. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:18:01
I do a bit. But to me there is either a security or there isn't. Trezor currently cannot protect you against physical attacks unless you decide to enter strong enough  passphrase everytime you wish to operate with it.
It's important people know this fact. Even when you have Trezor it's not secure enough to have it simple just "somewhere."
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:50:36
Yes. It works. Just be prepared that initial blockchain sync can take between 14-30 days. Once it’s done it runs smoothly. 
I was running it on rpi3b+ myself but recently migrated to Odroid XU4 as it has more RAM and much powerful CPU
(To speed up the sync you can do it on your workstation and then just upload all the data to your pi drive)
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:42:39
I think you made everything clear by saying Trezor is safe (now) even though it was hacked in the past while you consider Ledger unsecure (even though there was no hack) just based on your assumptions
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:36:06
Maybe a little addition regarding port forwarding. You need only TCP protocol, UDP is not used.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:12:08
can someone explain what happens with transactions sent to 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi 
In other words, who's getting these free coins?
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:10:31
Thanks for info. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:46:12
Can someone do a similar thing in relation to Sun eruptions?
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:43:26
thanks. So if I have my seed I can feel safe.
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:04:17
Thx. That was it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:50:30
It doesn’t make sense. They can transfer USDT to other exchange and buy BTC there for a lower price
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:26:18
If you would be confident there wouldn’t be this post
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:37:12
It’s been hacked similar as Trezor. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:44:11
Do I need to setup my own lighting node to use it?
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:53:57
wondering the same too
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:50:48
Strange to wish bad luck to people you don’t even know. 
Anyway the price is almost at the level where I originally bought so I will not either lose anything or if the momentum turns and there will be a bullrun I might get a bit less depending on the timing. For me there is no point sitting on my bag and taking loses just because of my ideology or emotions 
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:59:03
Because it’s not a good idea to generate your wallet on an internet exposed machine? Plus having on it lots of network sw potentially having security issues?
I guess better is to generate a wallet on a completely airgapped machine (if you have some spare one) if you don’t want to invest into a hw wallet
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:27:30
I just sold as I’m seeing constant downtrend. Ready to rebuy
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:54:42
But that’s not what was said originally. Statement was: IT HAS NEVER BEEN HACKED 
And now you’re adding another condition. . .
If someone lost coins that’s another question we cannot know the answer. We just know nothing like this has been announced publicly. You could say same for the Trezor as well
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:35:35
I’m just wondering why they would not better trade in some of the stable coins instead of “standard” crypto which is very volatile
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:10:39
what is veriblock spam? sorry I was not watching this topic
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:48:53
Nope. The second attack allowed to install an app breaking the apps isolation and access the sensitive data. If I remember well there were some fights between Ledger and the vulnerability discoverer but at end of the day he received the bounty
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:15:45
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:36:12
If you want to advise people then don’t spread partial information. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:43:03
Interesting concept thanks. I think something like this Komodo was (is) doing too?
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:02:41
Thank you, Viabtc accepted my transaction. Now I'll wait and see.
Just to clarify the thing as I'm quite new to BTC... there's no timeout for unconfirmed transactions after which they would be cancelled automatically? Googling did not give me a good answer. Some say that cancel is done after 72 hours but others it's never done.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:32:44
It may happen because readjustment doesn’t happen after two weeks but rather after 2016 mined blocks or so. Considering vast majority of miners shuts down you maybe waiting for a new difficulty level looong time or in theory even thousands of years
