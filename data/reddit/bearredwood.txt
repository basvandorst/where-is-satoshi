Yeah, it is impossible to tell but it is fun to discuss.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:36:27
unless you put in a buy order at 267 and mtgox wasn't able to fill it I don't see how this is any different from any other exchange... If there is only sell orders on APPL their stock is gonna tank until there are buy orders to recover the price.

but it is a volatile asset, which is his point; probably more volatile than stocks.
frankly, as long as investors make up more than a fraction of purchasers of bitcoin it will stay that way.
Bitcoin used to be a currency, in it's current state I'd rather use goats.
-edit- businesses accepting bitcoins IS still great for bitcoins, but yes, it isn't a real currency anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:09:42
And yeah, technically they've prob increased 9-10m in value since they claim to have purchased in single digits.

The only 2 things in your comment that add to the value of USD are the economic growth that uses the USD as it's currency and the burning the paper. Land does help with economic growth but land =/= valuable currency intrinsically.
The idea is that if people start using BTC as currency for their "economy" it will gain value due to the demand to interact with those economies.
Ease and anonymity are the main reasons why people would choose to adopt bitcoins as part of their economy.
In theory the "price" of bitcoins shouldn't matter, the problem is there are too few bitcoins in "circulation" (I mean not being horded for 'investment' reasons) that those investing are the only ones driving the price of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:04:17
I think the only thing holding the price at 50-60 (bitcoin charts has it at 65) is the ability to spend it on sites that peg to mtgox. I wouldn't be surprised if it tanked tomorrow.
Now long term btcs had previously found a marginally stable price near 30. It lingered around there for at least a couple of months. For bitcoins to grow in price for any reason besides speculation there has to be more proficient trading of bitcoins for goods and services.
Then again, I'm completely speculating and speculation got us into this in the first place.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:24:01
There is a good point, I would hate to try to buy something and in the time it takes me to buy(I'm assuming they have btc prices) the value of my bitcoins goes up 30% (or down for that matter).
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:02:29
I'm not saying Cypriots are buying bitcoins... Cyprus just flat out closed their 2nd largest bank, it does cause distrust in the banking system.
[NY Times March 16th](
From their BTC price saw significant (at the time) increase compared to the slow increase it saw leading up to march 16th.
It is my theory that the banking industry failing the country of Cyprus encouraged individuals (not necessarily in Cyprus) to look into alternate ways to store wealth. While I do agree, it may just be coincidence, I don't think the idea itself is dismissable as merely a myth without some examination.
-edit- clarification
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:58
I seriously hope they don't, completely defeats the idea of bitcoins. Though I suppose all the speculative buying engorging the price did that already.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:45:07
makes sense, lets hope you're right!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:30:32
The thing is everyone thinks that because btc went to 266 they made x*266 dollars. Just reading the language of this sub for the past week, it's pretty easy to tell that the price is only supported by people buying on speculation. Btc isn't widely accepted enough to support a $2b market cap on purchasing power alone, hopefully it will someday.
For any price someone sells at above what bitcoins stabilizes at, someone is losing money. That's just the nature of the game. The only way everyone makes money is if bitcoins consumes the global market.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:14:28
The fact is, without the ability to shortsale bitcoins (you can't borrow bitcoins and no insurer or brokerage has instigated a short sale program afaik; the only people to 'benefit' from bitcoin market crashing are those heavily invested in a fiat system and are delusional enough to think that this current bitcoin rise is more than just a bubble.
A) you can't loan or shortsale bitcoins
B) someone has to be willing to buy the bitcoins for you at 250 if you want to actually turn your 1k btc into 250k; and crashing the exchange doesn't profit anyone.
while you could come up with conspiracy theories, there are millions of bitcoins out there; how many requests do you think the exchanges have had?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:25:20
It is disappointing that bitcoins is treated as an investment and not a commodity. Though as a commodity it only has very limited use at this time, I hope that will change in the future.
Maybe someday there will be enough value in people spending/accepting bitcoins that it will be taken seriously.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:46:15
There's not millions of dollars in buy orders; there's no way they could get millions out of the market without a slow trickle sale.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:37:55
Hopefully not, I want bitcoin to get to the point where people are using it as currency, that requires a stable price point. Idc if it's 30 cents or 300 dollars, but there has to be enough bitcoin use that there's a continuous buying/selling that can support that price point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:20:37
if its not a bubble; it won't matter.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:16:45
everyone with bitcoins right now should be doing everything they can to encourage people to buy. bc if no one is buying, you can't sell to anyone.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:33:30
There is potential for it to get pretty low, I'm speculating that a large part of the bitcoin adopters after Cyprus pushed it to 100 aren't planning on actually spending bitcoins as currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:45:02
There is no evidence available, but having people distrust the banking system due to the events in Cyprus could have easily pushed the price of BTC from 50~ to 100... And frankly that's a valid non-speculative use. It takes btc out of the system, and as long as all of those people don't try to sell btc back at the same time; there really isn't an issue.
I could be trying to force causation because the price hit 100 at the same time.
Either way, I heard my local radio station talking about bitcoins right after it hit 100, I can guarantee that there are a lot of speculative buyers that didn't know about bitcoins as an investment until then.
Obviously most of the Cypriots money was stolen by the banks (well anything over 100k).
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:23:33
The amount of $ you are considering someone is going to try to make, you'd want to short thousands of btc... lending someone 500k that is pretty untraceable is pretty big stretch.
it would make more sense to buy off the bounce, but its hard to do without killing the golden goose. Frankly it only matters if this is all a big bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:07
This is the best way (and probably the only way) to build actual non-speculative value of bitcoins as a whole.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:37:32
hopefully people will stop looking at bitcoin as an investment and it will stabilize enough to actually be used as currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:40:25
does anyone want to buy my beanie babies? I have all the super rare ones...
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:34:57
Complete speculation but go down farther, I think that stores pegging the frozen mtgox price is keeping some (if modest) demand for btcs.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:28:09
I'm interested in why you say it clearly isn't a bubble.
I wish there were numbers on how much of the btc is being spent on goods. It's pretty hard to tell if its speculation or not that's pushing the price (coincidentally, it is easy to speculate if that's the case or not).
As long as someone's buying when I'm ready to sell that's all I really care about; in either goods or $. It does concern me because the volume isn't anywhere near as high as stocks or other currencies.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:45:10
I just want btc to level off so I can actually use them as currency
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:52
someone with 60k seems to have gotten it started.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:51
there may not be any lag on the buying end (not that I'm willing to try it, but maybe someone can confirm)
exchanges have to find someone to buy your bitcoins from you. If everyone is selling and no one is buying it **will** take forever to sell your bitcoins.
on the other hand, it could be just so many people sitting there refreshing it constantly and there are tons of buyers out there unable to buy bitcoins because of lag...
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:09:38
If you thought the price was going to jump up, wouldn't you buy all the bitcoins you could at $ &lt;80 from bitstamp/bitfloor/bitce?
It seems the market is sitting pretty around 80-90 for now.
From my understanding, you can game the system right now and buy btc to spend on other websites that are pegged to mtgox. If this is true, I think this ability to get 120~ dollars of purchasing power for 80-90 bucks is the only thing keeping the price steady.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:53:21
how were you able to short? you can't really "borrow" btc because you could just walk off with them. And as far as I know there aren't any exchanges that are willing to hold them in escrow for you yet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:33:27
That's not a brokerage, you still have to find people with thousands of btc who trust bitfinex.com
If you loan them your btc and they go under there's no way to get your btc back; being an unsecured asset, not to mention they are based in hong kong.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:21:01
I would like to see the source as well, bitcoincharts.com mtgoxUSD's 30d volume was only like 3m last week...
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:39:35
I would argue that mtgox shutting down is holding up the price higher than its value because you can actually get something out of buying bitcoins and then spending those bitcoins on stores pegged to mtgox.
I wouldn't be surprised to see the price bottom out once you aren't able to take advantage of these stores and websites (like silk road).
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:17:03
I want to play devil's advocate. 
Even though btc has market cap of 2b, there's not $2b out there. According to bitcoincharts, mtgox only had 2.4m in volume for the last 30 days.
In its current state its highly unlikely that the super wealthy will put their wealth into a system where they would no longer have access to their money. There's just not enough people buying btc for someone like Mark Cuban to buy a gulfstream over the internet. In my opinon, before the wealthy hide their money in bitcoins, bitcoins need to be able to accommodate the volume they will need(or just be able to buy jets/mansions/companies in bitcoins).
I feel that btc will either become widely accepted or it will see a crash; I do think it will survive the "bubble" popping though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:34:23
you can't order match if no1 is buying.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:34:07
It is inherently valuable for investors to trade where there is the most volume (out side of a few circumstances). If you are selling you want the access to the most buy orders, and visa versa. So there will always be vulnerabilities with exchanges/markets.
Tbh this is a flaw of speculating on bitcoins rather than a flaw of bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:21:43
Free doesn't mean "at no cost" in this context; it means people can do w/e they want. If someone wants to set up an exchange w/ flat fees/percent fees/fees for signing up/fees for picking your nose/no fees they are more than able to. And as a bitcoin user/trader/speculator you are free to trade there or not.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:14:56
Imo we need more goods and services to buy to promote non speculative buying and selling.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:04:25
They haven't made anything unless they have sold either. But yes, I agree selling 1% of all the btc right now would be a stupid move.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:17:30
according to  (bitcoincharts is down bc of traffic) 24 hours was only 160k... and nvm, I just realized you put a $ in front...
my apology, I was like... wow only like 15m ish bitcoins out there and they traded 30m (back and forth)
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:28:11
Personally I think getting merchants to accept bitcoin is easier than getting people to actually spend bitcoins The bubble has been encouraging people to hold/sell to other people looking to hold, there is very little economy growing around bitcoins.
I can see your point though, it would be wonderful for bitcoins if instead of selling your btcs on mtg, investors that wished to get the value out of bitcoins purchased goods with them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:18:19
I can guarantee that's counted in the GDP... I'm just saying the vatican is rich but they don't have hardly any land. 
It is the economy that supports the currency. *shrug* I feel like we are saying the same thing, I just wanted to consolidate it; a large part of the economy comes from land, but things don't have to be fiat or be tied to land to have value.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:42:56
Mtgox didn't invent market freezes... Dow/Nasdaq/SP all have built in freeze rules. While 12 hour freeze is a tad crazy, unlike stocks currency is open 24/7.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:47:15
Everyone throws around bitcoins market share being 1b (or 700m right now I suppose) but the issue is that probably 500m of won't be used for currency. Even for a "small market" the fluctuations are ridiculous.
The % being spent compared to the % being held for investment purposes makes using bitcoins as currency ridiculous. For use as currency the price of bitcoins doesn't really matter, its more the stability of the value. Idc if 10,000 btc = $1 or if $10,000 = 1 btc as long as it doesn't change by more than a couple % (a couple % is ridiculous for fiat currencies).
edit: Obviously if its 10000 btc per dollar the value would probably fluctuate drastically, but I suppose what really needs to happen is bitcoin demand needs to be driven by spending not investing. Frankly I'd rather think of it like 1 btc = X commodities.
