Scam, how? You buy some, your wallet now shows it. Come time to sell, you can transfer to buyer and their wallet shows it and they pay you. That's all Bitcoin claims to do.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:40:28
Huh? The guy is selling empty paper wallets, ready for *your* Bitcoin to be stored on them (and the seller to then empty them).
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:50:44
Or 5% in crypto, 95% in gold, and in a few years you'd have 95%/5%.

If OP believes this then OP needs to short BTC ASAP.

I want to re-generate my cold storage wallet, because I trusted the wallet's generation of a private key.
At the very least, I want to use diceware to select the passphrase (and have it be 24 words, not 12, so it gives a full 256 bits of entropy). But I also need some verifiable mapping of this to the master key that generates the private keys. This seems like an important part of wallet software, a standard way to do this so one can get multiple implementations of this and verify that they all match. Otherwise, even a diceware recovery phrase is useless if the wallet uses a rigged transformation which throws away most of the entropy in conversion to private keys.

Not for the seller. Looks like he's selling them for almost a dozen cryptos. He's sold many so far. This angers me because it's taking advantage of likely people new to crypto.

I couldn't find any prohibition for it. Anyone know what category to report this under?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:41:38


But these are *empty* wallets. They're for the buyer to store Bitcoin "in" for a long time.

If something is a bubble then it eventually pops, returning to its "true" value. If something isn't a bubble, then its value can climb rapidly and then stay there, never to come down. Only time will tell, the rest is people theorizing.

This. I wish I'd read the Bitcoin whitepaper back in 2012 or so when I was first hearing about it. I was focused on stable storage of value back then, having read a lot of Mises, and wasn't ready to consider investments with risk vs. possible payoff. Having now read it and absorbed more information, I'm impressed with how Bitcoin solves so many trust and decision-making issues without any central authority, so that things are decided by the market.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:13:58
Yeah, you definitely need to keep some cash reserves aside from investments so you aren't forced to liquidate at a market bottom.

It's ironic how collectors have done what the Zimbabwe government couldn't do: make their funny-money actually worth something on the free market. I wish I'd snagged some Zimbabwe toilet paper back then when it was dirt-cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:15:12


Oh, definitely. I bet when it hit $1000 then crashed way down I would have sold. It sat there in the low hundreds for many months as I recall.

From what I understand the basic, obvious logic is that if you invest more than you can afford to lose, you're putting yourself (and family, if you have one) at risk without justification, like a gambler with an addiction. These are the aspects I see discussed around this advice.
I hadn't seen people discussing the way the amount you invest affects your mindset, and hence your ability to make good decisions and paradoxically make better choices when you're prepared to lose it all than if you want to avoid any loss.
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:52:47


My point is that there's a psychological aspect, where there's some amount that you're willing to throw into Bitcoin and ride with it patiently, even if it's going to hell. Above this amount, and you personally consider it a risky gamble that you do not want to lose no matter what. These two lead to different sorts of decisions, the former more cool-headed and likely more effective at bringing a higher return.
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:59:39
Bitcoin ATM. I recently entered with a similar amount and am happy with the experience: enter phone number, receive text, type code, insert cash, receipt with new wallet printed, done. 8% fee, but so what, it's already worth 50% more than what I paid a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:29:14
If you don't hodl it, you don't own it. It's interesting that parent is both risking the money in Bitcoin, then risking *that* in Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:17:31
Because I didn't invest a few hundred years ago when I was looking into Bitcoin, I feel very much pain now thinking about what it could have been.
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:49:11
Excellent! This forces a clarification that it's referring to investments you make that *you* consider considerably risky, as compared to other options you have (even if *they* are risky as well, e.g. fiat).

Was almost me. I finally decided to get a little a few weeks ago and forgot to stop by the BTC ATM on Jul 17 overnight. The next day it started climbing and I stuck to getting it anyway despite the 10% rise already. Glad I did.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:57:54
And as far as I know wallets with their **12-word** recovery phrases only generate 128 bits of entropy for the private key.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:41:33
It was when I was looking into the Electrum wallet and found that it generates 128 bits of entropy then hashes it (or something) to get the 256 bits to feed the SHA256 function.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:00:25
A wallet is just a construct in Bitcoin software, collecting multiple addresses together that the user controls. The blockchain deals in addresses only.

Great, I literally won't be able to afford any Bitcoin.

There is no such thing as creation of an address from what I understand. If you send to an address you don't have the key for, then you can't ever retrieve the funds. If nobody else has the key, they they're probably forever lost.

Could OP have basically entered a wrong destination address for which they lack the key? That would suck.

Glad I used an ATM for my first purchase a few days ago. Five minutes, wallet printout receipt in hand walking away.
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:48:43
And send me to buy a little more BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:15:14
This is why people suggest cost averaging, buying a small amount at regular time intervals, so that you effectively get the average price. If you try to buy the dip but you don't have a good sense of it, you could end up regularly selling the dip and buying the peak. Hence the *hodl* wisdom.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:26:27


Yes, they do. I bought my first (fraction of a) Bitcoin recently at one and I researched the options. Websites wanted my first born and tissue sample just to create an account. The ATM just wanted my phone number and some cash and five minutes of my time. I didn't mind paying an $8 premium for $92 of Bitcoin. I plan on hodling long-term and either making many times that, or losing it all, and being satisfied regardless of the outcome.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:13:13
Isn't the fundamental problem that you actually only hold an IOU for however many Bitcoin your account shows you have, redeemable on demand? The exchange doesn't necessarily even hold this many, so there is no 1:1 correspondence between account balances and Bitcoin in the exchange's wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:51:52
I've just started following Bitcoin and it's absurd how much of it is gossip/drama.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:16:22
Isn't it easy enough to check that your new addresses haven't ever been used (and if so, just generate new ones)?
