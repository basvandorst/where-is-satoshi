So, how does this work?

All your objections are about Dell, not Coinbase. Maybe you should direct your anger toward them? 


Offering refunds in Bitcoin would makes no sense. If this were the policy, it would be a really easy game to continually buy things from merchants, and if the price rises simply demand a refund and then repurchase it for less BTC. Bam. Magic money. Merchants **have** to peg their refunds to USD or else *they* bear all the opportunity costs.

You still have not explained how refunding in Bitcoin would work. 
It's trivially easy for people to continually buy products and only return them when the price goes up. Bam, easy profit and guaranteed money. 
What you're asking for is literally for the merchant to assume *all* volatility risk. This is **not** feasible.

Hold up, let me make sure I understand this correctly. 
(1) Your son exchanged Bitcoin for goods from Dell. 
(2) *DELL* screwed up the order and a month later you wanted a refund. 
(3) Dell refunded the exact purchase amount. 
I'm sorry, but I fail to see how this is at all Coinbase's fault? You seem to think they should refund Bitcoin, because after all, your son "would never exchange bitcoin for dollars!" Yet that is **exactly** what your son did when he purchased something from Dell! 
If he was really concerned about losing his stake in bitcoin, he should have immediately repurchased the bitcoin he just spent. Instead, you're unreasonably demanding Coinbase and Dell bears all opportunity costs, because we all know your son would have demanded dollars if the bitcoin price dropped instead of rose!
Please. Get a grip. This is not Coinbase's fault and you're being irrational about what's happening.
