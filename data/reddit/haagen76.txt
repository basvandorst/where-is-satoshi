True, but don't forget:
Joe Kennedy got out of  the stock market just in time 1929 after a shoeshine boy gave him stock tips, because he felt that if a shoeshine boy has tips the market was too popular and easy to get into, so it was full of people not knowing what they were doing.

IMO simple because it was the 1st and is now the most recognized.  Is i the best?  Absolutely not.

So are we just going to ignore 1 of the world's largest bank is getting into bitcoins?  
Doesn't that kind of defeat the entire thing!?

IMO they're both overrated.  
If the desktop wallet is not enough security and you need paper or hardware then you're doing something wrong.

Yeah I'm think there was a problem with Coinbase that cause an artificial demand spike and drove the price up.  This scares me not only from their app side, but possible law suits that may get opened against them; valid or not people will open them.

I think it will be replaced.
Most people don't understand crypto currencies.  They don't see bitcoin for what it was originally created for. Hell, even if they did it's no longer practical for that anymore in ANY way.  They just see bitcoin it as a ~~gambling~~ ~~investment~~ get rich quick opportunity.
Lot's of people I know are talking about bitcoin, but they have no idea how it works, where to get them, net network, fees, etc. Once the public become more aware of how this all works different crypto's will start to be more attractive, not only individuals, but mainly major brokers and possibly exchanges.  
Once that happens I think bitcoin will be replaced by something else more practical.
However I don't see this happening for at least another 5 or so years at best.

Because you're only trading with locally on "that" exchange.  
For example the NASDAQ, LSE, Nagoya are stack exchanges.  Etrade is not an exchange it's a broker, so Etrade goes to the NASDAQ to trade.  
GDAX is an exchange and afaik on the GDAX gui goes to that exchange.  Technically I can set myself up as a broker and collect from other people and trade on the GDAX exchange.

It already is.  
Look at all the regulations this week alone and more economists starting to call for the downfall.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:11:46
No, because people will need to sell to take tax hits against 2017.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:28:06
How many people and how much would have to go in to the market for that to happen?  Just think about this for a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:33:18
People/companies don't just own BTC, it's a shifting and timing thing for next year's taxes.  This always happens at the EOY.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:23
I wonder how much of the price climb was due to actual problems with Coinbase?  Look at them price in other places there are some huge discrepancies.

It's happening on the crypto currency exchanges like Coinbase.  You can have an account there with a bitcoin wallet, so say you send your coins to that wallet then sell them.  They sell it on the market, collect that money from the people who bought and put it into your fiat money account like USD.
Problem is they are NOT like or anywhere close to an online trading platform like E-trade, Fidelity, etc.  They (and most other crypto exchanges) have a hard time handling just a few thousand dollars.  How can they handle a bunch of people doing multi millions?

I expect a massive selloff around last 2 weeks of the year.
I see this falling to ~300$; that's when it'll be temping to me.

Really considering I have lost anything in crypto, in fact I've made money.  The point, the original sentence, is about the reckless advice people give.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:00:26
This not only shows a serious lack of not only investment understanding but economics.

Ikr! I don't like to gamble, but I play mega millions and power ball too when it gets high enough.

2K$ by end of January and hover between 1-2K for the rest of the year.

The original cell (car) phone intention and technology is nothing in comparison to what cell phones are today.  In fact how much do you even use it for "calls" vs an online computer?
By your logic in the future we will not have crypto to replace fiat, but something else.

You people need to stop with this bullshit Kool-Aid pumping.
The adaptation is not taking off for BTC.  With the price volatility alone it's simply not practical for its intended use, so in the end why are you putting your money into this (or any crypto)?  If not for a currency then you expect new money will come in to inflate the price at which point you can get out.  This is why people call crypto (and rightfully so **in this case**) a Ponzi scheme.
Fear of the "Alt" coin.  There are so many alt coins out there, some are in fact better, while other are plain shit or scams (look at the crap from last week).  This is like the Beta/Vhs, Blueray/HDDVD wars; which one do you pick so you don't get screwed.
Government regulation.  Yes the main touting point is it's decentralized and untraceable.  This is true **only** IF used as a currency, but going back to my 1st point it's not and it's directly related to why the price previously climbed so fast.  Once you try converting back to fiat you will be hit with government regulation up to the point of confiscation plain and simple.  Look at what it even takes to open and maintain an account on an exchange.
So with all that said why would anyone "new" want to get into crypto right now?  If there is no new money then at best things will move sideways, but generally they will go down.
All this while other idiots sit around with their dick in their hand making "HODL" memes.  "I could have sold at 19K$, 15K$, 10K$, but I'm gonna sit right here (DIH) until it bottoms at 300$ and wait for it to go back up."  Ignoring anything else I said HTF does that even make sense!?
