I keep all of my btc in "BUTTCOINS_INSIDE.txt"  on a Windows ME machine and nobody has stolen that.

I have horrendous hand writing though (not as bad as a doctors luckily).  I'm sure the going rate for an older version is not to high if you can pick one up used.

My cursive will rape your's.  One again "because computers".    Also I have excellent handwriting I often write to small for most to read easily... I was just bringing up a point about lost keys due to shitty handwriting....

Thank the DEA for auctioning off BTC... and also EVO admins Verto and Kimble selling off BTC for whatever they can get...

That would be epic.  Larry Wilmore is great.   Andreas on the roundtable talk would be hilarious.  Especially since nobody there probably knows what bitcoins are.

He wont have time to explain anything in depth.  Great idea but I dont think it would work.

Newegg had a nice sale a few months ago.  $75 off purchases up to $350 when paid with Bitcoin and $150 off $500 orders when paid with Bitcoin.
