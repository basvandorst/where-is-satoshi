This is normal.... it's a deposit into your bank account from another country, no? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:23:45
Your fee was so small .... 15.115 sat/B

We have a prophet here

CAUTION: I just bought, prepare for dip! Buy during this dip and then let me know and I'll buy again so it dips further if you'd like! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:31:47
 is a good one, honestly. I am in the USA and they do not allow registrations from USA but I got in before they disabled the registrations for USA.
.. but explain more as to why you say Coinbase is a scam? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:30:52
elaborate further on this spam attack? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:23:40
This is ... ridiculous.... how are we expected to even make a transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:29:04

And to think I just learned you can simply 
* Buy small amount of BTC from Coinbase
* Go to Gdax.com and it should sign in using your Coinbase info 
* Deposit the BTC from Coinbase to GDAX using GDAX (its easy)
* If you choose, you can now withdrawal the BTC from GDAX with zero fees to your own wallet. 
* You paid no transaction fees
It is sad that it took me this long to figure this out after so many people here told me and it just didn't hit my brain cells right until tonight. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:40
 is useful apparently but it seems to not be so accurate as in it does not seem to update frequently enough. 
otherwise, I have the same question. I just checked by attempting a transaction on blockchain and the fee went down from $14usd to $10 since an hour ago but wow... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:41:57
It's rising ever since I began to mine it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:31:26
When is this damn mempool going to clear up? This is absurd
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:53
I'm not sure, but dude I'm flipping out not trying to pay $14 for a transaction. Let alone I already lost profits due to fees during purchasing on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:26
Yea and on GDAX just click "Deposit" then it'll have your coinbase account funds right there, just type the amount in exactly in BTC. 
Took me 5 mins and I regret not doing this for so many transactions especially most recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:11:25
Coinbase is having issues right now. r/Coinbase ... I just made a small buy and am waiting as well; but it'll go through just relax
**edit** buy &amp; withdrawal, withdrawal is in pending for well over 2 hours now 
**THIS IS COINBASE SAYING TO HODL**
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:58:31
Question is, when should it end? Like possibly any time this evening?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:22:24
Isn't there a minimum btc amount to withdrawal through? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:32
Sir, I am doing business with it. Not day trading or anything like that, you must be mistaken.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:36:18
ooooo shi
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:40:15
It can be worth it, but then it may not be worth it at all.
Transaction fees, delays in the actual buy at the exact value, and massive fluctuations in BTC value will all be major factors in doing so.
With that said, I would say it is possible to do this, but mind you selling back to the market using an exchange such as GDAX or Coinbase you will usually be waiting about 5 business days to receive that USD you wanted really fast.
So, in order to trade like this you'd need the money in advance to even throw money back in when you see it drop, because if you sold high expecting a drop (and you happen to get lucky) you wont even have your USD to spend on the new cheap coin yet because of the 5 business days. 
I hope I helped somewhat, 
My opinion is you should hold onto the coin and try to buy as low as you can in small amounts and be patient. Also do not panic when you see the value drop dramatically because more than likely it is to bounce back to where it was within a pretty short period of time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:13:56
I apologize, yes I do understand now that the USD/Other is stored on the website so the user could easily use that USD that is in his account, I was thinking of the person needed to be credited via bank account which would take many days usually. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:02
I think I can I think I can
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:28:20
I think so, but there's a minimum withdrawal fee of 0.1 btc on GDAX I believe...
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:04:34
Need blind person to chime in here
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:52:36
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:53:33
Someone else needs to chime in here, I am just a bitcoin consumer of like 5 years now and only have so much knowledge in the field.
But AFAIK no matter what when you sell the bitcoin to the exchange it is a bank transfer which in turn takes roughly 5 business days to go through. So you'd have to wait for the coin to be sold into your bank account, then buy low if you can at that point (5 days later). 
I could be wrong on this, so please someone correct me if I am wrong but I believe this is how it works on all exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:29:33
What is going on with confirmations? I sent a transaction 3 hours ago with adequate fees (well over adequate) and we're looking at 22k unconfirmed now when it was only 6k unconfirmed 3 hours ago
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:12:21
Well, I guess coinbase decided to send my transaction with inadequate fees then :( so stupid
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:38:45
Yep idk, not sure what is going on this is really insane though I for sure will never expect BTC to handle my transactions in a timely manner again.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:33:36
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:35:16
That would have sucked! Lol ended up confirming in like idk 5 hours or so.. crazy can't put up with that when I'm using btc for conducting business. (Legitimate business, guys)
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:30:10
Not sure, same shit here going on 3 hours; the unconfirmed was at 6k when I sent it in now were looking at over 22k unconfirmed
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:47:20
So what happens to my transaction? How is it that I sent it hours ago and its just sitting around not getting confirmed when it should have been long ago with the fees on it
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:27:47
Yea coinbase. Will never again, final straw was this. Still unconfirmed, 4 hours or longer now 
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:56:47
See whats messed up is this is most likely (I'm pretty positive) a GDAX transaction.
And I'm in the same boat, I withdrew from GDAX this morning around 10:30AM and mine is set to 3.65 sats/byte automatically.
It's really annoying, I use cex.io to avoid this but I tried gdax today and I very much so am regretting it right now; really frustrating when its not even up to us on setting the fee.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:39:15
lol is OP a prophet
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:37:32
Weird right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:37:49
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:58:25
Ugh, these posts. 
No dip really occurred, unless you mean in a few days. 
We don't really know what's going to happen other than the drama rumors going on.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:28:07
Ugh nooo to the moon right now 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:29:21
We both can only hope
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:32:29
That guy in the back of your head ain't the one whos gonna be cashing out now is he !!! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:47:25
It's actually even more weird that I happened to buy in at same value as OP and read the post &amp; it dropped to like 7700 real quick. Was depressing since I couldn't spend any during the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:49:29
Hey-- Yea my coinbase limit decreased too, it happened right after the crash on GDAX &amp; Coinbase like 24 hours ago. Crazy. Went down to like the beginning teir 1 or whatever told me I only could spend $80 USD. Like wtf? My limits were set really high, I can't remember the limit amount but it was at least 700 a week.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:03:53
Lol story of my life tho.
I've had that happen with fees, it was like a few weeks ago when fees went up to like  $17.00usd for a 2hr confirmation and I accidentally sent with a legit below $2 fee via blockchain  (It glitched?) It didn't set the sat/byte correctly like it should have. 
Was furious had my btc returned back to me after over a day of waiting 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:34:30
Dude I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, like I would pay you if I could. But not enough BTC in this world would even be enough for that laugh. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:10
remindme when makes a move
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:31:35
God don't say that 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:55:53
Fucck, things are gonna be REAL TENSE :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:54:29
I agree with this after some time really looking into how cryptos have been working in the past and present. 
I have realized now after 6 years of investing in bitcoin, I might as well jump in on eth and ltc as well. I hear monero is going to be so big but it's hard to acquire as you can't go straight buying monero you have to go btc to monero or another crypto to monero. If anything, my ltc will be worth a few hundred a piece in the coming months and depending on where ltc goes I'll trade it for another crypto! (Probably to btc!)
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:25:07
Now from my understanding the only downside to using GDAX vs Coinbase is that with GDAX it is a ACH bank transfer which takes 5-7 business days for you to receive your coin; where as with coinbase there is an instant buy but miner fees are extremely high (IMO).
I am correct though about the downside to GDAX vs Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:31:12


How the fuck does this work? That's crazy
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:29:35
Why eth?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:11:18
You forgot to mention
* Lack of sleep 
* Disorientation
* Stomach cramps
* Random euphoria 
* Random letdowns and depression 
* Random high influx of cash
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:40:25
I just woke up to "MEEP MEEP!" from bitcoinity.org sound systems, once BTC just hit 6400; I knew it would by the morning! Was up nearly all night watching this go on too. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:58:15
lol come on now not true I had a hefty transaction clear in 2 hours w/ a fee of ~$2.00 usd
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:25:51
Why do you say that? I don't doubt it though
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:40:21
7777/usd @ bitfinex 10:40PM EST
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:45:43
I was the first transaction, it was literally 8 years ago almost 9 I'd say. 
Welcome to my world, noobs. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:15:31
Im sorry I actually did this guys. I made a buy for 500 usd worth and that was it, tanked. Sorry.. will give warning next time ;) and you're welcome for the flash sale.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:31:19
Exactly dude I know its crazy I changed it all but things will be back up. 
Actually I don't have a job, at all btw.
@_date: 2018-07-03 04:54:10
I can just imagine that now when I get older and I have grandchildren I'll be telling them stories about how in my day we used to have to take a picture of the QR code now you guys just walk by it and it picks it up.
Did I just invent something?
