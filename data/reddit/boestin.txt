I totally forgot about craptsy.  Now when I try to log in this message appears:

In case of transaction speed you could also choose to use Worldcoin..

So they are comparing btc to fiat and basically say that they are both digital. But what about the fact that these fiat currencies can be duplicated infinitely and that bitcoins are unique and limited? 
Mmhh, I expected more from this.

damn...  I'm so screwed... Lost the private key.

thanks m8! Thought he was only on twitter and didn't know he had his own website. Anyway, just filled in the contact form.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:04:16
Why? Because he is Bitcoin. I could copy his presentations but I can't tell it with so much passion. Besides I have these panic attacks, no fun bro. 
lip sync xD

Blockstream, with the whole hong kong deal etc, not a corporate takeover? ��
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:33:43
pardon me for asking a dumb question, but who receives the transaction fee anyway at this version of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:51:25
whats your address, I'll help you get there!
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:47:29

@_date: 2015-07-12 20:20:27

@_date: 2015-07-12 18:48:28
whats your address, I'll help you get there!
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:38:34
btc sent, have fun!
@_date: 2016-02-26 11:05:48
Not sure if this is the case.
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:10:52
Yeah it is!  Besides paying with Bitcoin, I had a nice couple of chat's with the cashiers from BK and Spar...  They also seem to enjoy it. 
The only thing that could speed up is the integration with Cashflow systems.  For example, the cashier at BK had to type the transaction id from the paper receipt into the BitKassa iPad app manually. After that I could scan the QR. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:46:56
Maybe in a couple of years they don't look so surprised.  I like it though when the cashiers look happy and whisper to their colleagues while you walk away from the counter. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:19:03
The Burger King in Arnhem uses the Bitkassa app, which doesn't require confirmations.  It took me maybe less then 3 seconds, in the Spar same story. 
Maybe Bitkassa guarantees loss of btc in case a double spend happens?  Then again, it's only a couple of Euro's

Wow thank you Sir!!

@_date: 2015-11-29 16:12:28
What does RBF stands for actually?
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:22:19
Thanks m8!!!  You have made my worries go away for the evening.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:32:38
I got 0.7% as well from btc-b to btc.  It's still not possible to withdraw btc though.
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:37:39
thanks Sir. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:21:03
I hope my 2 btc still is there. I know thats wishful thinking, but i had a nxt buy order, maybe the buy orders weren't  affected.
 With the nxt i was planning to buy some NEM on the asset exchange.
Ah, stupid me, my own fault.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:02:45
