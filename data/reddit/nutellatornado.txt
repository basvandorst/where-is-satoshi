I don't know how it is in Greece or other countries, but I know in the US taxes are mainly used for healthcare, social security, and—wait for it—the **military**.

Well words on teh street is accurate, my friend. It **sucks** here. Save yourself and anyone you can from the trouble of living here.
Of course, there are always exceptions. For me, I have [Medicaid]( and my plan is actually pretty damn good; covers pretty much everything I can think of. Although that's probably just because I'm poor as fuck, which considering the way the US is is kind of ironic...
I don't know. I just usually tend to assume I'm the massively rare exception to the rule... I'm grateful for what I have, that's for sure... (Although it's kinda fucked-up that I apparently don't qualify for [food stamps]( (not actual stamps nowadays lol) considering I live on my own, am in college, have no job (nor can I handle a typical one b/c of mental disorders I deal with), and only survive because of my uni's [food pantry]( and my grandmother's leftovers and her own (dare I say, infinite) generosity since I can only afford a monthly food budget of about 12 USD...)
 
*(Sorry for the rant there... Kinda had to get that out...* ☹*)*

I... (*chokes up*) Honestly, I'm in shock... Not only did you give me money for a soda (thank you SO much)...but you opened my eyes a bit about career possibilities...
I want to say I wasn't saying what I said to just get stuff... I honestly just needed to let that frustration out a bit. I guess it kinda says something about my situation that being given 0.75 USD brought me to tears...
Just... I don't even know. ***THANK*** you... :'(

That's right. *You're* right. 
...I'm gonna go do that. I'm gonna go do the two things I've been wanting to get myself to do for a long time now: ***programming*** and ***journalistic writing styles***.  &gt;:D
(I'm ❤ computing and want to have my own tech startup someday possibly, and I'm also a writer but need to improve on journalism styles of writing if I want to get job assignments for that field. These two things are pretty much some of the only things I'm good at... Not sure if I should be proud or ashamed...)

Perhaps this is a stupid question, as I'm still pretty new to bitcoin, but how can bitcoin be said to not be controlled by any institution period? I mean, sure, it can be said that it's not controlled by any *one* institution, but it's definitely regulated by certain national gov'ts, the USA for one...
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:25:05
But...wait, how do I *use* Bitcoin? x'D

Oh. my goddesses... 0.0
Thank you...so much. T_T

Rectangles are the shit.

What's FUD? 
@_date: 2015-10-25 02:57:31
They'd probably even mess up that. Buy it for twice the market value of the avg vacuum cleaner, open it up, and you find out it blows. Literally and figuratively. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:05:27
Or "Fuck U Dickheads", amirite?
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:37:42
That's some pretty fantastic shit...

RemindMe! 6 months "Unicode Bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:31:04
How come the symbol isn't rendered properly? I'm running Ubuntu 15.04, so it's a pretty modern OS, and thus I would hope it would have sufficient Unicode capability. Or am I just an idiot? O.o
**EDIT**: [Ohhhh °o°](

Why can't you just use a regular keyboard, put the symbol on the key (using paint/marker/printer/stickers/whatever you want), and then reassign that particular key to that character with keymapping software?
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:58:48
That's true. Plus with custom keycaps, it'd be probably look more professional, anyway.
