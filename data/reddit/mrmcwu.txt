The moving parts are the same for watch / timepiece designs.

With that, there was an article of someone doing a similar set up, but removed the last 2 digits from the key, for himself to remember in his brain, then engraved onto a ring. Rendering the key useless unless he discloses the last 2 digits.
You could of done the same with the password, remove a few digits.

Non powered flash drives are generally fine with water. But it's not s107 waterproofed.

You could still use a cable, USB extensions cables are available. Thing is about sockets is you have to carry one or borrow a cable every time.
As efficient lifestyle was one of the main points of the design, just having a ring to carry around is pretty simple. Plus a slot for a detachable flash drive, you'd end up forgetting the detached part.

So what you envisage is kinda like the 'chip and pin' that banks already use. Even though there isn't really a password system implemented with bc (aside from 3rd party tools / remembering the random 2 digits of your key that's missing).
Wouldn't that lessen the security for more convenience. Also investment to implement it. 
Just thought, a flash drive that you wouldn't be likely to lose, would be an advantage over standard market drives. Since you would be wearing it, instead of it being placed somewhere, example, the secret pouch in your bag.

At one lecture I had, a prof demonstrated that every single microchip is prone to malware and viruses that reprograms the behaviour or creates backdoors. 
Unless you have a off the grid, single use, nothing untrusted goes in or out, computer then you have a slightly more secure system.
That said, it's kinda troubling area
