Don't worry guys, i was told the whole point of bitcoin is that government can't hugely influence it, like say the USD. /s

This is not really accurate, China has purposely devalued its currency for a long time now so that its exports and relative cost of doing business give it an edge vs western competition. The main way it devalues its chinese currency is to print/sell it into the market and then buy dollars. Which has the reverse effect of increasing the relative strength of the USD. US business leaders and politicians have complained about this for a while now.

Typical goldbug nonsense.

Not true at all, a unfortunate high percentage of people throughout history have pushed and supported war. I think because they are fundamentally ok with bullying and tribalism. War is the main thing correlated to all great political leaders, essentially. Seriously, think about any great historically appreciated political leader, and then read about them and it is always related to war.

What newly strengthening yuan? it has appreciated like 1.5cents in the last 5 years, they are still doing everything in their power to keep it artificially low. The idea that a relatively strong appreciating currency is a plus in the global economy is total goldbug nonsense.

This is another way to devalue yuan, print yuan, buy gold, flood market, even foreign markets with yuan. 


Eventually they would prefer their paper fiat currency to be a major currency around the world. 


Cite? This is goldbug style nonsense. China even banned bitcoins.

Worse then that, they could scare away all legitimate businesses operating in a country from accepting it as a form of payment relatively easy. Businesses in the US aren't going to risk being indicted by the DOJ in order to accept btc.

If history tells us anything it shows us that had it not been the US it would have been some other world power warring. In fact, the US has presided over one of the most peaceful times in human history.

You're not forced to use USD, you could barter with chickens or try to buy all your goods with silver and gold at swaps meets and flee markets, sure most people with think you're a nutter, but that is just reality messing with fantasy bullshit.

I'm interested in the part where you do the goldbug thing as assert vaguely:


You pulled this part out of your ass. 


Not really, been huge swings on these prices. 


This is absurd, you wingnuts don't understand the global economy at all. Most countries try to make sure their currency doesn't appreciate too much as to make their cost of doing business and exports uncompetitive. 


Wrong, the military is but one aspect of modern society and the global economy. We also have most high end labor capital, some of the most valuable land and stable government, lots of natural resources, ect. 


Goldbugs have been making these collapse just over the horizon predictions since before all of us were born. And they never stop. It is always just over the horizon. 


Who cares, nobody uses gold to buy oil, it would be to much of a pain in the ass. Gold is just a bad investment for the lazy in the long term.

War was far more common before modern fiat currency. If you look at your chance of dying from war now vs any other time in history, it is lower today.

Aren't unregulated free markets awesome? You can almost understand why people accepted central banks and increased regulations decades ago, they were tired of dealing with crooks running off with their deposits.
