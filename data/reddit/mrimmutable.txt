First of all, sorry for your loss. This is quite unfortunate to hear, but that said, I do not believe most people should base their decision to do business with Coinbase solely on this anecdotal account. There are plenty of Coinbase horror stories, that is for sure, but the same could be said with every other major company (banks, software, technology, you name it).
Ultimately it is a loud and vocal minority that have experienced issues. The vast majority have had no issues whatsoever, otherwise we would see more lawsuits and eventually SEC action or even closure.

There was a time when Coinbase was essentially the only reputable exchange in the community (in the aftermath of Mt. Gox). I would argue that they haven’t lost of sight of their origins, rather, they were the beneficiary of rapid expansion, which has caused them to fight many fires as they learn and grow. It would not be a good look for the community if the largest exchange went under, it just wouldn’t.

Is Coinbase perfect? Far from it. But, I am surprised at all of the animosity considering the immense contribution Coinbase makes in providing liquidity to the average Joe/Jane.
If a non-technical user asks how to purchase/store Bitcoin, where do you send them to? Coinbase is a natural choice. A decentralized exchange like BISQ is notably more difficult (downloading software, dealing with wire transfers, no support, etc.). With Coinbase, you simply click "Buy". Granted, there are more and more competing services (i.e. Cash app, etc.), but Coinbase is likely the market leader.
I vehemently dislike Coinbase's decision to offer Bitcoin Cash, and other altcoins, but in my opinion, this isn't a factor that leads to not using their services. To each their own.
I think it is great that people hold Coinbase accountable - and viral campaigns like  certainly help to hold their feet to the fire. But if Coinbase ceases to exist entirely, I think there would be a void. At the end of the day, Coinbase is just a successful startup trying to find its way. They are going to make a ton of mistakes along the way, as did Apple, Google, Facebook etc. It doesn't mean that they are inherently evil or do not contribute positively to the community.
tl;dr Coinbase is an entry-point into the community. It's far from perfect, but it does serve a purpose. It's also important that the community continues to hold Coinbase accountable. Discourse is more desirable than pitchforks.

There is the transaction fee as you mentioned, but there is also the variations amongst market prices. Coinbase may quote BTC at say $6200, but then Trezor will say BTC is $6195. It is it the combination of both that you are experiencing. What matters is the destination market price. It doesn't really matter if Trezor thinks you sent $99, so long as your receiver priced so that it appears as $100. (Conversely Trezor may say you sent $100, but the receiver thinks it is $101).

I am 100% sure Bitcoin will exist in 5 years! It's already been around for 10 years, and quantum computing isn't about to break SHA-256. No 51% attack threats imminent. Node numbers are fine.  Governments are moving slower than a turtle. I think we're fine.

As cheesy as it sounds, the life-changing opportunity Bitcoin provides starts within. What I mean is that the most transformative aspect of Bitcoin isn't the wealth it generates for the holder, but rather it's the perspective shift about controlling your own financial independence and not trusting in any certain government or institution. When you buy and hold Bitcoin, you've already won. The price fluctuations are merely the icing on the cake. Don't worry too much about the future price or cycle, just enjoy the ride and integrate Bitcoin into your life in the way that you see fit.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:49:03

\-Speaking of the right side of the road, you can notice a repeating pattern that seems like a spot brush tool.
\- The right foot of the adult looks odd. So does the angle of the car.
\- The shadows don't add up.
\-Quality of photo is inconsistent across different areas.

Yeah agreed...5 years 100%...now say 30-50 years, definitely less certain. That said, I am quite optimistic. The technology may evolve but it's going to exist in some fashion now that it has been created. As long as it has some utility in society there will be a place for it.

lol did it really go down like this? That is hilarious bro. Feels like a real conversation. It's great that your parents are open to it. Still, most don't grasp Bitcoin's potential. It's not just another asset like a stock etc where the end goal is simply to make money. It's much more transformative than that. Yes Bitcoin is at 11k and you made money from it, that's great, but more importantly, 11k is a recognition of Bitcoin's continued resilience despite all odds. It's different.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:58:26
\+1. I've felt the same as OP before, but eventually you realize that nobody cares / nobody listens, especially when it comes to Bitcoin. They are going to do what they want. They are going to miss out, and that's perfectly fine.

Yes, put another away: Affluent individuals have more liquidity and can take proportionally more risk to invest. As a result, they own more Bitcoin, and that in turns provides them more protection in economic downturns. Rinse and repeat. Playing that game through to the end is very dystopian. 
It is why it is important that every day individuals educate themselves about Bitcoin. If possible, invest directly. If means do not allow for this, then accept payment in Bitcoin for goods and services that you can offer. In order for the ecosystem to thrive, we need Bitcoin in as many different hands as possible.

Now all you need is a cliché license plate (HODLON etc.) and perhaps some tacky Bitcoin stickers on the sides/front/back and you'll be set! lol and I say that having had a BTC license plate at one point. Thankfully, those days are long gone, and BTC has grown past that (now it is akin to flashing dollar signs on a car etc...just not necessary).
@_date: 2019-04-21 18:20:48
Hindsight is 20/20 though. You could have sold at "the top" only to realize that it wasn't. And after paying taxes and buying back in, you then decrease your purchasing power and are left with a fraction of what you started with. That is the thing about taxes - in the U.S. with capital gains, you basically need something like 30% price correction of Bitcoin in order to justify selling/buying back - For example, if BTC would only correct 20% and you had to pay 30% taxes, then you just lost purchasing power and won't have as many BTC at the end of the day.
For me, it is all about collecting as much BTC as possible. There is a risk in selling and rebuying due to the possibility of quick spikes in price as we've seen time and time again. HODL is the easiest and most effective strategy - a long-term investment that is betting on transformative power of the industry, not merely day to day whims of speculators.

You lack an understanding of Bitcoin's history if you believe it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It was one reason for Satoshi's departure. Assange and Satoshi shared the same cypherpunk mailing list. It is conceivable that they knew each other. Bitcoin  enabled Wikileaks to accept payments given that all major credit cards and banks cut ties with the organization. As other's have said, it illuminates the power and importance of decentralization in an age of tyranny.

@_date: 2019-04-19 04:02:21
You have the right attitude by investing what you can afford to lose and having a long time-horizon on your investment. If Bitcoin succeeds, there is little doubt that the price will be higher than it is today, but ultimately Bitcoin is so much more than the returns it can possibly generate. Even if it fails, you can tell your grandchildren, or just know in your heart, that you contributed to the financial revolution that is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-19 03:55:42
Pure speculation, you have no idea or basis to say those days are long gone. No one knows. Bitcoin could be worth $1M+ easily...or it could be worth $0. Time can be a very powerful thing for things with fixed supply and increasing demand, so as long as that continues to be the case and other developments increase utility, then I think the community is in fine shape.

That’s certainly possible too. I guess I was speaking from a customer’s perspective. The main thing is the potential privacy implications (probably wasn’t the best to begin with, to be fair). Either way though, Shift is dead in the water without Coinbase. Maybe they could use Gemini or another major exchange/holder, but that would affect all existing cardholders (do they have a second account etc).
It’s definitely no coincidence that these events both happen on the same day! Wish Shift would have provided more information. I reached out even but they would simply not provide any more information.
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:09:12
I would not recommend OpenDime for anything but short term transfers due to the fact there is no backup seed / protection against being lost or damaged. Don't get me wrong, they are great, but I think unfortunately there are probably some people out there that are not realizing that if the OpenDime malfunctions for any reason, they may very well lose that BTC.

Tax implications do make it difficult for everyday purchases, but up until today there was already a solution called Shift Card that attached to your Coinbase account and let you spend to a debit card in the U.S./worldwide. 
Since Shift closed today and Coinbase Card was debuted, my guess is that Coinbase Card bought Shift and will be coming to the U.S. very soon. Probably just awaiting some approvals.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:11:11
Why does it have to go down to a certain level? I guess just to shake off weak hands / speculators? Personally, I try not to focus on the price because it really is the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin. The speculators that fuel price movements only distract from the greater goals - and they do nothing to contribute to the network, like developers and enthusiasts do.

It mentions that they partnered with Coinbase, so the best bet would be to start there. With all of the large retailers, there is typically a processor in the middle because these companies need to convert at minimum a portion of the transaction back into USD to cover taxes, costs, etc.

I’d recommend purchasing 4.2 BTC actually. You see 2.1 gets you in the “1 in 10 million club” (in other words you own 1/10,000,000 of the bitcoin economy).
Might as well get 4.2 instead of 4, so you are “1 in 5 million”.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:55:06
Storing a small amount of BTC on a REPUTABLE exchange makes sense for liquidity purposes. Consider it a “hot wallet” - accessible via your mobile device. You don’t necessarily want to take your hardware wallet with you everywhere. Sure, there are mobile apps like Bread that are both accessible and key-controlled - but that also entails storing another set of 24 words etc. whereas with an exchange app, if you lose your phone, doesn’t really matter. 
Ultimately, you just need to take an active role in managing your investments, whatever way you do it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:42:06
You invested when Bitcoin was in the can, coming off the first major bubble pop, held through the Halvening, and presumably saw the long term potential of Bitcoin....yet you choose to sell before the 2020 halvening? Lightning is not even launched yet. It's like dismissing the internet because it's not fast enough in 1990. It's absolutely absurd. Farewell my compadre. I don't get it.
Everyone else, go watch some Friends of Satoshi videos on youtube and buckle up buttercups.
P.S. You never had $2.2m because you didn't sell. You had x amount of Bitcoin. Now, when Bitcoin inevitably goes up, you WILL have lost opportunity cost. By holding all you had was gains.

A few possibilities:
1) The sender did a double spend - I.e they sent you BTC and Coinbase sent an email but before the tx confirmed , they did an RBF and sent it elsewhere.
2) Your Coinbase account is compromised.
3) The BTC is actually in your Coinbase account and following the blockchain records are misleading because when you transfer BTC to Coinbase, it doesn’t stay on that address - they have a complicated system and so it could look like it was transferred out but really Coinbase is just doing their job and managing it (moving to a different section of their hot wallet etc)

Coinbase is a great and natural starting place. Make sure that you have a very strong, unique password for your account, and also 2FA enabled. Also ensure that 2FA is required for ALL transactions. OK, now that your Coinbase account is generally secure, you now have an opportunity to do some research. Look into hardware wallets such as Trezor. Look into fire-proof backups for these devices such as Cryptosteel. Learn the advantages of controlling your own keys, but also learn the risks. In most cases, you will likely determine that using a hardware wallet w/ multiple fire-proof backup seeds is in many ways more secure than the convenience of keeping on an exchange. But your mileage may vary (are you a day trader? do you need access to quick liquidity? do you have little trust in yourself in maintaining your own devices/backups? etc.).
Welcome to the club, glad you're here. Just in time for quite a ride my friend. Enjoy it. Pretty soon you'll be giving advice to family &amp; friends &amp; others and helping them on their new journey as well.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:41:22
It sounds like keeping on Coinbase may make sense in your case. If there is any doubt in the ability of maintenance, you don't want to take that risk. I believe plenty of people are over confident when it comes to that - have they taken into consideration fires or natural disasters etc etc? Some have, some haven't. Anyways, when you do decide to sell, I recommend using "Coinbase Pro" which is essentially just a trader-focused version of the vanilla Coinbase. Your one account will work with both, but the Pro version has cheaper fees. I believe at one time you could place limit orders with no fees, but I am not sure if this is still the case or not. All of this said, if BTC rises tremendously in value, such that you have say over $100k worth that you need to sell, then you need to consider an OTC provider such as Genesis or Cumberland Mining. There are very high minimums for OTC trades, but it is an even better deal than Coinbase Pro. Finally, if you do decide to keep your coins on Coinbase, then consider utilizing the "Vault" feature. This acts as an extra layer of security because it requires confirmation email/texts and a delay of 24-48 hours. The main threat that exists when keeping your coins on an exchange, be it in regular wallets or even the vault is that Coinbase could potentially be a victim of a catastrophic hack which makes them go bankrupt. That could tie up your funds in proceedings for years, and you may never get them back. Research Mt.Gox if you are not familiar. The other threat is a hacker that targets you specifically via phishing or other similar means.
