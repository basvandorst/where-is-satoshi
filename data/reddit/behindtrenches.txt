Ok we’re in agreement then. Saying “I think it will go down” is cool too. 
I’m talking about the original top comment that said “I can’t wait for everyone to think this is the floor and then lose all their cash. How amusing.” 
Consider me new to the subreddit, but that is not characteristic of a good community.

Agree. I visited this subreddit to gauge market sentiment and maybe look at some dank memes but all I’ve seen is a bunch of people who’ve made bad trades and are out of the market throwing tomatoes.

B-b-but exchanges aren’t allowed to have assets either right?

Alright! It takes a minute to get the live data and compare the arrays, but you can navigate with ease afterwards. 
Let me know if you have any suggestions!

I was lucky enough to start watching BTC at the floor before the rally to 10k. Water seems fine to me

I don’t understand, so why are you still an active member of the community?
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:52:26
I know you’re not responsible for what others say, but in response to me and bitcoinalways complaints about those people you said “I wish there were more of those people.” Which is how we ended up down here talking about it.
Also how can you reference the 70% drop as if that 70% was natural to begin with? Might as well include the 70% increase before then as something that’s statistically relevant at that point.

As long as new buyers are entering the market and not getting scared by the profit seeking quick buys and sells, it should not affect the trend.

To the top comment a few daily discussions ago which read "I can't wait for you all to yell 'bart' and then lose everything"....:  I pray that you're out of the market right now!!! Go home and don't come back!

Seriously. I understand the average crypto enthusiast is young but and many other communities for established coins are completely rancid. Bad market or not.

Healthy debates are good. I don’t think what I’m talking about is “healthy” or a “debate” to begin with. Just people throwing tomatoes

BNB at $12, has been getting real friendly with $17 lately and had almost surpassed its November peak

I’d like to see some of the applications they plan to launch that utilize smart contracts. It would put the fundamental analysis for these coins in a good light for the first time ever.
To my girlfriend the other day I said “Bitcoin is super low right now but think about the branding, even Grandma knows the word ‘Bitcoin,’ it took companies like Q-Tip decades to achieve that level of awareness.” The volume speaks for itself, and in our society branding is everything.
I was one of those buyers who didn’t even know about BTC’s bull run to 20k when it was happening. Yet here I am.
In short, “the eyes of the world are watching now”

Do you ever use TA? I’m actually pretty confident that we are due for another rally if we hold 6k for another few days. Consider this renko chart I threw together with 9 hour units. Stochastic about to crown, and TTM squeeze showing decreasing bear momentum.
This rally, if I’m being conservative, isn’t supposed to go much higher than 8k, but you never know. The whole sell triangle from 20k to 6k to 12k to 6k to 10k to 6k is coming to a close.

You took the time to step down from your high chair just to type this comment? How amusing.
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:27:23
Look, everyone would agree with you if you were just commenting “BTC is doing poorly.” But you’re equating that with talking about the future: “BTC will do poorly.” Sure it would have been nice if this entire community ragged on bitcoin when it was at 20k, but how is that even relevant? Those people will be correct half the time, it’s mostly up to chance and it’s not like anybody is referencing any good TA to back themselves up. I think your defense of the people smack talking potential investors is a little unreasonable.
