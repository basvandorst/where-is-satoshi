You mean a collision of the hash? In that case, you mean that it could exist two blocks with the sabe /same identification? Could happen and would break it unless there was kind of name space. On the other hand, collisions would be easy to check beforehand

Uncharted waters, I know. 
In this case, I would say that both blockchains would agree that on block XXXXXXX, it would be a special Genesis 2 block with the previous blocks hard coded. Genesis block, if I remember, is hard coded. 
The Merkel tree would be possible to built and check but it could take 2X the space and time. 
What do you think It would be completely impossible?

The UTXO would be both available because the blocks where they are stored are both accessible .

The obvious explanation : someone very rich, a lunch with oisters in bad shape and no toilet paper in the bathroom. The result : using the notes in your wallet. Don't tell me it never happened to you...
