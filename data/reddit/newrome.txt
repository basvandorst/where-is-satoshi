well, there are technical reports that show a jump up to 4MB right now wouldn't hurt decentralization of miners more than 10%

I disagree, SN never used his PGP key. So the use of it would only show that *someone* had the key, the same is said for signing blocks 1-11 or other known blocks (you can't actually spend the genesis block if you wanted to).

No one wants to scale btc at all costs, that is a silly thing to say. We just the system we all agreed to to work the way it was presented originally.
We *can* safely scale, I see no actual evidence to the contrary. The devs didn't want to agree to a block size increase once because they said then they would have to do it again in the future.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:57:22


perhaps you can shed some light on whatever you are talking about, as it doesn't seem to be this conversation or article. I looked at the article and I see them saying bitcoin can survive a small block size increase with little problem

Since the mod removed my facts showing your opinion has no basis in reality  I will ask you again for anything to back up what you said.

@_date: 2016-04-12 23:37:56
Not everyone should be able to run a full node, after years of reasoning I have come to that conclusion.
Satoshi never envisioned it that way, such an idea has only taken ahold in recent years but it was never a part of the original plan.
Bitcoin can survive and work just fine if not better by doing everything it does now with more users
@_date: 2016-04-13 01:50:58
I am curious what you are talking about.
ransomware encrypts data, sometimes even waiting months to get backups; could blockchains prevent this?
I think so, as long as the blockchains are backed up properly; but that would only help the record of those records, The data presumabliy hashed that goes into the BC to be stamped is likely stored on the network.
So it allowed proof of something happening even if that somethng is gone but adequete backups are still needed.
2. I don't really know what you are talking about but in theory a blockchain could host voter registration or other records; if you can verify that your vote went where you want and others can see that votes went places and no one can see (except the person who did it) who is doing what then yes I would say so, but only as a happenstance of helping voting/records

@_date: 2016-04-12 01:33:35
This is the whole problem with the block size debate; the fact remains Satoshi said something, so thousands of users accepted that method of future action. Now when it is time for that action that we were all in agreeance would happen a few developers don't want to perform that action. Then we have many original bitcoiners who thought one thing would happen and aren't happy that another unexpected action is being taken. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:53:40
ack @_date: 2016-04-12 23:46:27
Isn't that exactly the opposite of the truth though? Bitcoin for the first few years loved to tell people that,
"we can fork the codebase if the developers don't act" or
"we can fork the chain if something happens"
and yet here is that situation playing out and *suddenly* some people flip flop
@_date: 2016-04-12 23:57:23
This is simply not true, you are a liar for state such things. Forever will the internet hold record of your sin.

@_date: 2016-04-14 23:48:48
I find this completely dishonest. For the first few years of Bitcoin the idea was very clear that full blocks would never be an issue.
The plan the community accepted was to raise blocks when they got full. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:00:04
Well, that's kind of what the point of open source is.
And also this is how Satoshi seemed to have imagined forking going, if some people wanted something that others didn't they could take the previous code, fix it up, and release it as something new or different. 
It's open source just doing fine

It happens often with the main exchanges like Coinbase or what used to be circle, previously it was 2 or 3 hops and if the coins ended at a known illegal address they would shut down your account. The services they use to follow your coins are not always fooled by tumbling or mixing.

Rather most of the troll comments by the same trolls that are often downvotes are done so because they are changing the subject, persoanl attacks, offer no evidence and only a viewpoint that is often rude, and other classic 'troll' moves.

The idea that blocks should always be often full is not one that I ever gained years ago.
Can you point to anything Satoshi ever said that indicated he wanted blocks to be often full? The result of my research has been the opposite, and so the idea that we have now changed the fundamental operations of Bitcoin are unsettling to me.  I think working with Moore's 'law' we can not be forced to be wimpy or change the fundamentals of the design and system.

You have a good point but others have had this point for many years and the consensus is is that there will be periods of high volatility (and some periods of stability) for a long time until btc *does* become stable.
The take away message from that likely reality is that btc will be a poor 'currency' and a better 'e-gold' until it becomes stable and can function fully as e-cash or a currency.

But isn't removing non QC resistant coins destroying those coins? And if those coins were mined by SN isn't that destroying SN's coins?


So basically destroy SN's coins since we are all pretty sure SN won't move them.
I mean it isn't saying it directly but for all intents and purposes that is what it appears to say.

well that 1MB limits was a temporay addition that most people feel should be changed by this point. It is indeed the cove devs plan to maximize txs wihtin a 1MB block and with 20K txs, but these limits are artificial and although hardcoded into the protocol they can be un-hard coded so btc can work like it was intended, and like everything thought it would be before all this business

PMs at Yelp do a lot. In an 'average' day you might be immersed in A/B testing a new relevance algorithm, QAing new data driven features, spec-ing out ideas, and always, always using the site to think of ways we can improve it. We need a Product Manager who can develop and prioritize signals to find that next hot taco joint, iterate on these signals quickly and think creatively about how to make Yelp a more useful and fun place to be. 
As a Product Manager for Search, you'll work with an incredible team of engineers and an incredible depth of user generated content. You’ll find ways to leverage that content to ensure that search relevance and ranking are the best in the space, and you’ll design new data-driven features to help people navigate their city.
What You Will Do:
Make the search experience an intuitive and elegant part of the way 150+ million unique visitors connect with great local businesses.
Work with our all-star engineering team to hone and iterate on your ideas.
Identify, analyze and prioritize new site features.
Manage the design/build/test/release process end-to-end.
Strive for product perfection but love to release and iterate.
We Are Looking For:
Search Experience: Experience with local search or large-scale search systems, or experience with Machine Learning, NLP, Data science or similar areas. Experience in a quantitative role or science (Astrophysicist, Economist, Astroeconomist, etc.) a plus.
Techie Cred: CS or similar degree so you can talk to our enginerds about Python, map reduce jobs, and naive Bayesian algorithms without a translator.
Design Chops: While Yelp PMs hold technical degrees, and search is a technical space, we're also excited about design so experience with and passion for building beautiful tools is a plus.
Passion about the Space: You love the world of social networking, local search and consumer websites.
Non-Nerd Empathy: You pay attention to Bitcoin exchange rates and drone delivery services as much as the next nerd, but you also recognize that you're building for a non-techie audience.
A Conditional Love for Yelp: Like a BFF or a tee ball coach, you should love us but also be able to tell us what we're doing wrong. You'll need to be able to dish out the criticism here and take it, too.
A Need for Speed: Daily release cycle? Bring it!
Send us a note sharing why you fit the requirements above and ideas on how you would improve Yelp!

Ask yourself, should the rest of the world not try for VR porn just because a few people can't currently use it?
IF we shoudl all suffer to keep a few people comfortable then you probably think we should keep blocks static, if however you think that some people will get left behind and have to catch up but the pace of innoivation shouldn't be stradled because of those few people then you probably can see that btc must grow and we should stop bneing such pussies about it.

 The pattern shows block 12 was likely the first block mined by different computer than SN’s original one. Of the coins mined with this pattern only 100 have been moved.

Just so everyone is aware, Bitcoin was designed originally to have big data center like nodes, the idea being that many companies in many countries will host full nodes.
I have had extensive discussion on this subject and I have yet to see anything that leads me to believe Bitcoin should not have data-center nodes.
The idea that every joe with a 52k connection should be able to run a full node is a new idea pushed by those with different ideas on what Bitcoin should be than the scheme presented in the whitepaper.
Do not trust anyone who says that all people big or small should be able to run a full node, it simply won't work out and is not Bitcoin but instead some new abomination based loosely on the ideas of Bitcoin.

Actually take some time and think about it on your own, don't just internalize other people'e opinions.  Re-read the whitepaper and satoshi's writings satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org
and I think you will come to understand that Bitcoin, as designed, must grow
