well, autumn is coming ;) Don't want to wait for a blocks before Xmas &amp; autumn dirt here in Russia. If companies would not react, that would be too much of a pain &amp; disappointment along with a disfunctional Bitcoin network by itself, because 90% of Bitcoin transactions in Russia is LocalBitcoins. (3 million dollars per week: 
But thank God, they're at LB PM'd me and told that this is a high priority. Finally!
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:25:18


Exactly half a day.
I don't care how much I'm going to pay for the fee. Bitcoin network is all about making transaction without listening to anyone's opinion about what kind of payment this should be big or small, important or not important. This is my money and I should decide how important my transaction is.
I am not using localbitcoins as a hot wallet, but its annoying when I can't move my own money anyway, especially when I can lose bigger bill, just because of inefficiency of this form of payment. As a customer this even further makes me more looking for a other better services outside of Bitcoin ecosystem.
I do know some alternative P2P web-sites in my region (competitors of LBC), and I do use them, they are perfect, but not crowded with traders yet as an LBC. But our exchanges are gaining popularity along with permanent LBC's failures of service. But sometimes I have to fragment several financial sources: several smartphones (because there's no normal iOS support), a lots of money in several SPV-wallets, several exchanges (just in case some traders are freeze funds or CloudFlare error on LBC again). And very often all of my Bitcoin wallets are not providing any damn service FOR HOURS for a very various reasons (and leaving me without a dinner, without a hotel, and providing me a lots of discomfort and putting me into hazardous situations). This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-08-25 05:27:55
For average amounts you could meet people who are ready to trade for fee. For larger amounts exchange in person for gold bars.
Or use Western Union or other wire-transfers or Internet-banking from person to person, peer to peer
In both cases LocalBitcoins could help you
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:06:36


No its not the only point of LocalBitcoins system, that just the tip of the iceberg. Person-to-person deals in Russia is just 1% of all online deals which is happening on LocalBitcoins platform in online mode without meeting.
In Russia [population: 150million] LocalBitcoins is used as an escrow for online wire transfers, because Russian financial system is quite convenient because it provides irreversibility for any payment made from person to person in online mode (unlike PayPal/Visa/MasterCard) which becomes a groundbreaking way to purchase and sell Bitcoins in Russia and former USSR-countries [population: 170million who mostly need BTC as a remittance way to send money home from Moscow] with the same ease as "sending email". Our volume is  around 3 million dollars per week and all of this money moved in parrallels between regular users of Russian banks into more reliable LocalBitcoins wallets. Regular traders receive on average 3% fee from trades which is incentifize our Russian traders to support and open more Russian banking accounts and feed their families. 
Also that is why I personally believe the biggest LocalBitcoins' competitor in Russia is a P2P escrow platform in Telegram  ( community) which has the most probability of replacing LocalBitcoins by UI convenience in Russian payments industry, which offers the same LocalBitcoins functionality (because building financial apps for Telegram lets you achieve more security &amp; mobility and unification over regular web-apps in both computer/mobile platform), except for the downside that its centralized too.

You over complicating stuff. The fact that I'm reselling $1.5 with extra added $0.29 all my command line efforts over Ubuntu just fascinates your criticism. Most of OpenBazaar setups costs at least $10 (HostedBazaar.com). After all this is just one dollar to pay - which should sounds to you like "free".
Your distrust is understandable but I'm encouraging my users to change all the passwords for those VPS, and moreover I am not the VPS company and have not even a single server in my custody. 
Normal software engineer would charge you minimum $20 per hour for that kind of service.

When I spoke to some of poor people, they unknowingly responded "Why should I pay $1.79, when any other e-commerce web-site can do the same?" :) Lol. 
So basically poor people with understanding the value of OpenBazaar could enjoy such price, because I saw many barriers at accepting $5 price for VPS, because its too expensive when you represent those expenses in their local currencies + they don't know how to work in Linux command line to make OpenBazaar work properly and 24/7.
In future such things should be completely free or significantly cheaper than even $1.79

@_date: 2016-04-18 03:22:15
its perfectly safe technically, your funds are okay as long as you're not going to issue returns to Amazon, because that's where's the problems begin.
@_date: 2016-04-09 23:04:37
Are you shopping on OpenBazaar?
@_date: 2016-04-19 04:25:12
You are describing a store with Swiss bank security and $100,000 income. 99% of newbies in OpenBazaar won't even manage to get their first $1, because attracting sales might not be easy task even with all right tools.
Having cheap VPS in unknown jurisdiction at least better than storing your Server on your own computer. And of course we can't replace AWS quality if we are talking about stores with 10000 customers where 1 day inaccessibility might cost you a fortune. But hey, its pretty stable right now! And this is $1.79 dollar service, not $5 which most people in poor countries won't afford $5, while they could want to have permanent OpenBazaar store.
I am not offering VPS service here. I am offering my technical skills to install OpenBazaar Server for you. Currently most listings I see on OpenBazaar aren't available when seller goes offline. Its time to fix this.
And talking about average selling OpenBazaar stores - most of them rarely serve even 10 customers per day - because out of 170000 users only 4000 is subscribed on which can give you representation, on why you would want offers like $1.79 (or even cheaper) as a setup price. Just because right now we need as much stores as possible. If you're going to pick among perfect locations you can't even expect prices lower than $10 because average VPS service begin from $10.
And with this service we are covering the needs of users who might need to try OpenBazaar for the first time, or set up additional backup server, this cheap offer might be exactly awesome for testing those.
I understand your concern if you would order $15 or $35 vps which is offered plenty by EU or in US businesses. But Russia is awesome for dirty cheap &amp; pretty reliable service. Even if you pick $35 VPS server, it doesn't guarantees that installation is going to be easy, because we tested 5 vps services 4 of which didn't supported OpenBazaar. Trust me, its not easy for a newbie to setup a reliable Linux server at all! While on my end I am installing not only OpenBazaar-Server, but also a maintenance script to keep it alive and plan to provide extensive support in terms of backups and other technical issues. So with $1.79 you receive full OpenBazaar setup without necessity to do anything in Linux SSH yourself.
I also plan to manage backups for OpenBazaar for free and do all sorts of maintenance and technical support necessary to make your OpenBazaar experience flawless.
@_date: 2016-04-20 05:05:00


I can't steal your bitcoins, because OpenBazaar is trading platform its not intended to keep your Bitcoins. OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin wallet.
Moreover, when you're renting your VPS service, to some degree you're also trust to all employees who are working in that company, because they all have access to your server.
I am myself not associated with that VPS servers which you're going to use. Moreover you can change billing password &amp; vps server root password, and I will have no way of entering your marketplace.
@_date: 2016-04-30 21:57:43
In my subjective opinion having OpenBazaar Server on your local computer is harder &amp; slower because it takes some skills to know how to configure it. Once you configure VPS all you need to know is username/password/domain to connect from any computer in the world :) Sure every VPS has its own root password, but once you or someone trusted had setup your OB, its not required to know how to handle SSH, root, Linux.
Yes VPS is better. I can help you with both local issues and setting up your VPS.

OpenBazaar is not a wallet to have all that security. Currently there is among all 4000 people in OpenBazaar community, only maybe 100, most experienced of them tried any thing with VPS related. VPS itself a very complicated topic for beginners, most often they run it on Windows.
I am here only to help. If you afraid any data leak, don't store anything with me, but why not give people ability to try running OpenBazaar VPS for one dollar even for testing purposes.
Your PSA sound pretty hostile &amp; with 0 efforts to explain what is your technical problem. Are you treatening customers with FBI around all lemonade stands in your neighborhoods?

Oh I got it, maybe you are offering to install Linux node for everybody to check different Bitcoin balances, right?
@_date: 2016-04-30 22:12:05
Most Linux experts highly recommend to be careful with providing server SSH (root) access to anyone (including me or someone who are setting up server for you), because potentially curious "experts" might be able to install a backdoor without your notice (even after changing main SSH root password) to monitor your OpenBazaar contracts happening in your shop, and maliciously use your Bitcoin private keys to steal funds, which is used within OpenBazaar software, especially if you sell something expensive.

* I would explain users, that main misconception about mining is thinking that they centrally control transactions, while its not
* I would explain users, that transaction is bitcoin payment. That there is a limit in Bitcoin payments.
* I would explain if we need more payments, why we can't just raise those limits.
* I would explain why it is so easy to increase limit of traditional systems like Visa, MasterCard, etc
* I would explain what is going to happen to Bitcoin in worst scenario. 
* I would explain what challenges are, in case if users would want to switch to other cryptocurrency in case if there's no other choice for solving blocksize issue.

\- That I will lose a lots of privileges for getting new ID and its BLOODY EXPENSIVE to do in my country.
\- Also consider for a moment that there's a WAR in our country.
\- Also stop using argument that "What if Hacker trying to access that"  - because I willingly opened an account in this exchange - and I DIDN'T LOST MY PASSWORD - they can SEE that not a single time PASSWORD WASN'T CHANGED. Also THIS IS MY CHOICE to have BINANCE account without documents - which means that I had never had my verification - and verification isn't proving and isn't protecting me in any ways, since I did not had verification in a first place
\- You also should know the motivation of BINANCE for sure - is that BINANCE WANTS as much money to get stuck for as many days as possible. This is 'evil corporation' which keeps money of POOR people to reinvest that money for their exchange.
\- THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET RID OF MY OLD PASSPORT - that would mean a lot more expenses than 0.11 BTC
\- THERE IS NO WAY MY PASSPORT is related to security of my account. Just ask yourself: How selfie can help identify me as a true owner if they didn't know how do I look \*before my email change request\*?

What does this means? Who's gonna fix that?
There is a saying "If you don't have your private keys, you don't have your Bitcoins". But it seems like you have something eqvivalent to private key.

I have enough money to buy any insurance. I even ready to pay the same amount U.S. citizens pay for their insurance monthly if that would guarantee my access to medicare anywhere abroad. But everything is corrupted here - that makes it impossible. Does using blockchain-style transparency can potentially offer better cost  &amp; audit efficience and better future insurance for 5 billion uninsured?

Someone included "Arc Bit" as an advertising (initially author of this sheet didn't mentioned that), I don't think their wallet is scam, but their UI is horrible so I added my "design scores" section according to my opinion, might be useful for the review as well

How potentially hype around Etherium can help Bitcoin?

I believe any closed source shit shouldn't be reviewed or considered somehow **anywhere** as a fraudulent attempt to fool people (except for exchanges and other non-wallet services of course, but very carefully). Oops now I'm confused myself. :) Just imo.

go to blockchain.info insert your Bitcoin address into "search" field on the main page and you will see TXID for that transaction which is not confirmed
Or give us your destination Bitcoin address where we could see your unconfirmed transaction
