I'm not going to repost whatever I hear to reddit.

OK thank you for the warning.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:41:00
Can you not get it out?
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:38:35
Indeed. I have been reporting on Gox for awhile now (  but most companies employ people who want to do the right thing.

Thank you.

We don't know who wrote it, though. Or how much of what's inside it is accurate.

How are they doing this?

Hey, that was my boss, Cade Metz. How long did it take you to get Yen out of your Gox account? I'd heard that this was speedier than $US or Euro.

We don't pay sources for stories.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:01:29
That's an interesting point. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:53:25
That's helpful. Thanks.

Why don't you ask Erik what he thinks of me?
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:52:08
Thanks.  You're right that it won't be easy. But there are a lot of people with a right to know what happened here.

Created by my colleague here at Wired, Kevin Poulsen. :-)

It doesn't seem unreasonable to want to know who is running a business such as BTC-e, does it?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:08:00
Thank you for submitting this. Much appreciated.
