can anyone compare an old PGP key to the current one?

it's a complicated form of a DDOS attack specific to TOR (the browser you need to access Dream).  Theyve been getting extorted for years and finally had enough.  In my dumb speak- they implied the DDOS-ish attack was incredibly cheap and couldn't be fixed without reworking TOR
Edited to include this plagiarized paragraph i forgot to grab the author off
This is a single developer attacking DREAM, he developed a simple yet effective tool that exploits how Tor works and exhausts resources by building multiple connections until the site become unavailable. This is a basic overview of the current method he is using to take down Dream, however initially he was attacking via authority relays and overloading the Tor process itself. He attacked Dread in this way and after following the connection logs I was able to prevent the attack. He hasn't attempted to attack Dread since as far as I am aware. Dream prevented the attack in the same way as I did, which gave them around an hour of uptime before he switched up how to attack worked and he has continued to keep Dream offline almost permanently across all mirrors he comes across.

if people are allowed to DDOS tor sites on a whim we may need a few people smarter than us to create a new browser if we want to accomplish the privacy were reaching for.

Dream is already stopped accepting orders.  You can still sign on and get your coins however.  Just cleaned my account last night.  Get your BTC into a private wallet asap and then re integrate into the new site after its established and looks legit.

china just inherited 1.5 billion in crypto as well from an online casino bust.  As hypocritical as it would be for them to sell it...
