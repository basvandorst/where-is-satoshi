Good point. The crypto that replaces it probably doesn’t even exist yet.

Classic loss aversion. Cut your losses, mate.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:02:36
Oh yeah owning the USD is totally like gambling /s

So I'm guessing you equate resilience to being able to top previous price highs. So in the long term, it will certainly bounce back above 19,000? I don't see it. It's already lost over $100 billion in market cap since its high. That's a lot of money that needs to flow back into an asset that has no transaction value, no earnings/dividends, and no scarcity - given that there are thousands of these "scarce" cryptos. If resilience is all Bitcoin has to offer, it's really no better than tulips.

Korea represented 25% of the volume before facing potential regulation and the speculative mania that struck Bitcoin in December has largely worn off = trade volumes down.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:42:04
Yeah, if you want you own an asset that's actually backed by something, pays interest, and doesn't fluctuate 5-10% every day, you're an idiot!
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:24:42
Dude get real. Owning USD is one of the safest things you could own and has been for over 100 years as it’s the world’s reserve currency. Would you please name a safer asset class? If holding USD is gambling, I guess everything is.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:30:02
It may never come back. Driven up by speculative mania, crashes by FUD,  replaced by a better crypto. Bye bye BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:04:57
He’s been right all along. Maybe early, but still correct. Bitcoin is hardly revolutionary just the latest get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:08:53
You realize technical analysis is useless right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:33:24
I think we're at fear. The run up to 16k was the "return to normal". It'll be at the mean price of 1-2k by year-end at best.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:31:42
Fine, I misspoke when I said "flow" - but $100 billion in perceived value must be gained/lost either way. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:00:11
Lol you don’t have to short it to think it’s a bubble. Lesson: never short into irrational exuberance
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:05:52
Anyone who invested in Bitcoin after it hit 19k is a total sap lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:58:16
The amount of denial in this thread is mind blowing. If you believed in the tech, you'd be invested in other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:03:18
I mean that’s if it can climb back to its current valuation after a big market scare. It may never come back if it experiences an 80% correction. People move onto other cryptos with better tech at that point.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:26:56
Man if this thread doesn't reek of irrational exuberance. Putting most of your savings into bitcoin which can swing 10% up/down in a given day? If bitcoin's surge is really driven by these types of retail investors, it has a long way down. Also if there's a huge selloff, who is to say it will rebound if there are plenty of other alternative crypto-currencies to choose from? This is really awful advice.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:41:55
I’ll take this bet. Hits $5k before it hits $18k. You’re on, $20k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:07:19
How many cryptos are there now? Over 1000? Yes, they can be created overnight, Bitcoin was just the first.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:32:14
Sell right now dude. There are much better investments out there that pay interest and dividends. No sense in tying up all your savings in something intrinsically useless.
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:09:39
The fact that making a transaction like this is is so difficult doesn’t not spell well for bitcoin m
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:19:00
Amazon has had free cash flow for years, SNAP and Tesla on the other hand are burning mountains of cash and do not have a visible path to profitability. If there are no future earnings or dividends on the horizon, what am I investing for? I guess just that some greater fool will pay me a higher price than what I bought it for. Still not as bad as bitcoin though, at least they have assets that can be liquidated.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:56:36
Now would be a good time to short
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:28:07
You’re right. But over the long run, the sum of discounted future cash flows might be a good indicator for stocks, bonds, real estate. For most currency and commodities, it’s about liquidity, utility and rarity.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:28:35
I’m interested in shorting as well, saved.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:47:43
Why? It’s just as likely, if not more likely, to fall to 3k. It was driven up by one thing - speculative mania. The mania has passed and the first wave of investors that drove this up is gone.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:34:22
The noobs are the reason it went up in the first place. If it were just techies like before, it’d be trading in the hundreds. This thing is headed for the bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:57:17
Please, you probably don’t make $20k a year..
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:11
Don’t buy the fixed supply argument as it’s now competing with several other cryptos. It’s not like gold, oil or other commodities in that regard. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:06:56
Now is probably a good time to sell futures. XBT to 6k by next week
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:40:09
You can short ETF’s too. It’s not price manipulation at all, the greater volume as a result of futures is creating greater price efficiency
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:16:50
It’s Wall Street playing tricks again. Traders have sell orders waiting at 10k
