The only point in maintaining a hardware wallet is having an easy way to send bitcoins from your wallet (not hardware, but what is derived from the 24 words) to another address and generating additional addresses if you're still accumulating bitcoin. All you need to recover your private keys are the 24 seed words (and passphrase, if any) and the correct derivation path (bech32, legacy, segwit, etc.), and you can use [ offline to do that.

If bitcoin doesn't go down from here on out, will you regret not having bought now? That's the question you need to answer. My answer to that is always "yes", which is why I buy as much as I can as often as I can.

You're right, but Bitcoin Billionaires is a fun and quick, nontechnical read.  I'll put it this way, I wouldn't be surprised if people who didn't know anything about bitcoin prior to reading the book became bitcoiners after reading the book.  There are two chapters that, if one is paying attention and digests what's being said, really drive home the "Why bitcoin?" argument. The chapter with Voorhees and Shrem dialoguing when the Winklevoss twins first visit the BitInstant office, and the chapter on Cyprus.

Seriously, are you that dense to think that anyone can know the price in advance? You’ve now asked multiple people about this. Sell if you don’t have conviction or don’t do your own research. Stop buying stuff just because other people told you to. Stop being a sheep.

You can gift your stock to your brother, and if it's a bona fide gift, then there is no capital gains tax on that transaction.  If he sells the stock you gave him, he would have capital gains tax on the difference in the sale price and his basis (which is your cost basis - the recipient receives the same basis as the donor).

Not sure if you’re trolling or not, but you’re wrong. There is no realization event on a gift. Source: I’m a tax attorney. Also, a simple google search debunks your comment.

The article I would highly recommend to address your altcoin questions is Parker Lewis' ["Bitcoin, Not Blockchain"](

Do you not control your private keys? Can you not send your bitcoin to anyone without that transaction getting censored? Then what are you going on about? 
To your main post, anyone can exchange their fiat/services/goods for bitcoin right now for an agreed upon rate. As long as fiat money exists, who cares what that rate is? The difference between bitcoin and fiat systems is that when someone exchanges their time for bitcoin, they are exchanging their time (the scarcest asset in the universe) for the second scarcest asset in the universe (bitcoin). That exchange ensures the person has a piece of a fixed supply asset that cannot be depreciated over time. Bitcoin is for everyone!

This response is why you don't take tax advice from strangers on the internet. This is false. A gift that appreciates in value at the time of the transfer has no capital gains tax - the recipient acquires the same basis as the donor. 
The question that needs to be answered to address the OP's main question is whether the gift is complete on mailing or when the recipient receives the gift. Without doing more research, I'm not sure the mailbox rule applies to transfers of gifts or not.

I have no desire to "cash out" and don't plan on ever doing so. "Cashing out" means going back to fiat, which is worthless in the long run. When you really understand where bitcoin can go, you lose that desire to "cash out" and at the same time lower your time preference.

You're right, so let's rule out gold as sound money as well. 
Look at the long term trend and bitcoin is a phenomenal store of value.  You can deny it all you want and make straw man arguments, but more people are coming on board every day, which is all that matters in the long run.

Except that a religion's truth/falsity doesn't depend on the believers. Most truths or falsities are true or false independent of belief, including religion. However, money and value are, in part, dependent on the beliefs of the participants.  Network effects don't matter in evaluating whether a religion is true/false, but they matter in determining what is good money or what has value.

You're missing my point, so let me make it a little clearer.  People selling trading strategies are charlatans without skin in the game.  If the strategy really works, then there is no need to sell it to others - you should be able to make more than enough doing the trading yourself with \*your own product\*.

The point is that bitcoin acts like cash - transactions are irreversible - and if people know you're walking around with $100,000 cash (15+ bitcoins), you're more of a target for *physical* attacks.

Having other people front you money is selling your system - it’s their capital at risk, not yours. Let me guess, you take a small percentage fee if the account grows, but what’s your downside if the system fails? If the answer is that they are SOL, then you are selling your system.
