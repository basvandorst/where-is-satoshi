Yeah I read it wrong and got excited. This is just an image of an ATM...
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:08:46
What a first world problem.

Late to the party :(
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:02:42
No fucking way...

Scrypt is good for small miners. Evened the playing field a bit when litecoin was made. I think Dogecoin is doing the same thing.
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:17:22
Yeah. Fuck changetip.

Why does every generic Bitcoin article have a picture of a casacius coin or alternative.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:49:48
Haha that's amazing.

@_date: 2014-03-23 14:58:25
Cool! Remember that it's spelt 'Bitcoins' though :)

Most polite bot ever.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:03:28
Oh good, I found a nice one near France.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:55:39
Do we even have a chance of reaching a million/btc?
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:09:15
Like Dogecoin!
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:06:13
A... hairdryer made of... bacon?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:11:17
That still makes it a good hub for selling bitcoin though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:41:30
That's insane.

Today OP was a good guy.

It better not be the same one I picked out.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:18:41
Is there a GPU miner for USDs?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:29:33
When you have $26,000 you don't need to prove yourself to anyone.

Yeah, there are a lot of viruses that can be easily transmitted over Skype.

There's always one per thread who makes a prediction based on no tangible information.

Theory: OP Primarily uses Reddit on their phone and also is lazy.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:23:22
Oh the problems of a rich person :P
Remember to support the bitcoin community now that you are a high roller! After all, it sure helped you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:30:47
So if I buy a bitcoin and wait ten years or so I could have A THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:56:56
See, the issue I have with this is that the actual technology of the internet is certainly not a fad, but there's no denying that the .com bubble was in fact a bubble. Maybe Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, but Bitcoin is just one big bubble?
