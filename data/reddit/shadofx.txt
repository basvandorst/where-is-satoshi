I don't see how it differs from setting up a recurring deposit for your monthly pay through coinbase, unless you're using this to escape income tax.

Miner pools are highly centralized and vulnerable to DDoS and SWAT.

Coinbase allows you to purchase bitcoin immediately from your bank account. GDAX requires your money transfer to clear and enter your USD wallet on the exchange before you can trade.
Phrased differently : If the price suddenly dips but you have no USD in the exchange but plenty in bank, you can use Coinbase to essentially *loan you that money* until your money transfer completes, so you can buy the dip immediately. 
Coinbase knows that most people want to keep most of their money in bank for daily use, not stuck in USD wallets in the exchange, so this basically helps bridge the gap.
More importantly, 4% guaranteed return on a 5-7 business day loan is an insanely profitable investment.

Mining will be paid primarily through transaction fees. Hash rate may start falling through but then the difficulty will adjust to compensate.

The rest of the world would move on to quantum-resistant encryption.

If a quantum-resistant encryption does not present itself, then the rest of the world will migrate back to traditional pen and paper for tasks that need security. Things like SHA2 and SHA3 are already supposed to be quantum resistant, so even if there is an attack, it will still take a time and be expensive to perpetrate.

[Powerful forces boycotted Segwit2X]( because it was incompatible with their ASICBOOST mining hardware. If it passes, they'd need to rebuy their money machines.
So they invented Bitcoin Cash, which is [compatible with ASICBOOST]( That way they can keep on making money without having to upgrade.
