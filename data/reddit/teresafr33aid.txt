We received the majority of our bitcoin when it was about $100. We are a relatively small team still (~70) and this is a volunteer hobby for most of us, including me. We had planned to hold most of this bitcoin for our next disaster relief project. (See this post for our last one:   Many of our volunteers like being reimbursed in bitcoin when they buy supplies for Fr33 Aid. And we recently received a generous donation from  which allows anyone to order and send us supplies we need and receive bitcoin in return.  
Despite this experience, we are committed to continuing to operate in bitcoin.

When you place an order to spend bitcoins, they tell you to include shipping costs. There have been more people buying bitcoins than spending them though, so maybe not everyone is including shipping.

See update at  (scroll down to Update  We have a new address, but we understand if folks want to give us some time and check our comments and plans before donating.

Many thanks to you and whitslack for the donation to Fr33 Aid!

Yes, I've used it to order a lot of stuff for Fr33 Aid. It works great, and they've been very responsive to our enhancement suggestions, etc. I haven't used it to buy bitcoins yet, but I like the fact that I don't need to link my bank account to do so.

Yes, I agree with the cold storage plan. The timing of our transfers will depend on the amount we receive. Occasionally we receive multi-bitcoin donations, but most of the time we receive smaller amounts spread out over time.

New update on our investigation and plans going forward (scroll down to UPDATE

Yup, there were orders available last time I checked. I think this is why they're offering a 7% premium for orders - maybe it needs to be higher so more people will order stuff?

Our website is hosted for free through Freedom Blogs:   It appears our tagline about that was removed. We'll fix shortly. We are committed to transparency, as you'll see in our updates and other posts.
