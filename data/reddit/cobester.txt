Install “Coinbase” on your phone. Then you have access to buy bitcoin and two other major coins. You use your card/bank account to purchase.

Bitcoin is grandfathered in at this point

Get back to work...

They’re both the same company, so you can definitely just deal on Coinbase if you wanna keep small amounts. Keep in mind GDAX has benefits of lower fees

It’s okay. I bought at $17500 prematurely. Now I’m more careful

One of the craziest situations. The people probably weren’t even expecting it

Tough to time the market. It’s more secure. Sure the price looks like it’s going to keep going up, but you don’t know for sure. I learned that lesson the hard way back at the hype of late 2017

Anyone sell at $10500? I almost did lmao

Been holding since I bought most of my coins in December 2017-January 2018. Not breaking even yet but hoping we get there! Who’s in the same boat?

Definitely DCA in my opinion. I wish I did that
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:29:47
Don’t wait for a dip, just buy back in

Daily threads are boutta be poppin again

I’m just gonna hold my shit cause trying to call the market is not worth it. I bought around the hype of bitcoin (late 2017) and a lil more around this time last year
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:02:21
I think people are gonna take profits at these benchmarks and fomo after they see the price holding up
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:03:22
Not too late at all
