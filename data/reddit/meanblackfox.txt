XBT is on Kraken for Bitcoin. Its more about that 1 year ago, i didn`t know anything about it and now a bit more advanced. thats all
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:58:09
its shopify and gocoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:05:56
once the application is done booting, i´ll let you know. but it might take couple of hours/days. doens´t run smoothly at all
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:03:08
yup. bin ich. berlin :) selbst?
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:08:16
salta twins are actually one of my favorites :)
super smooth and nice are these ones:
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:57:46
yeah. got one. not so much going on there.
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:57:19
hey. thanks for checking out.
i think i know your order. It will be the first time i ship there :)
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:10:14
i like these ones:
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:26:56
Awesome! Will it be available for OS X users? Want to open a store to sell licorice. Got already here one 
edit: why don´t you guys edit a newsletter subscription? would be great to stay up to date,.
@_date: 2015-05-05 09:12:02
Just found the post. Did you manage to order? 
Never seen such a screen.
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:52:20
was thinking the same. it would be one option to go if i had another product. but licorice is not the product everyone loves. and from those who love it, only 1% might have some coins. 
but you are right about "paradox of choice."
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:48:00
hmm. i think you visited the shop when we were still setting it up? the shipping cost were high in the beginning. now we did some adjustments and charge 4$ for international shipping of 1lb pack. have a look.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:44:21
thanks for the tipp. need first figure out how to :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:12:52
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:19:19
Thank you. I am sure it will be a bumpy ride with a lot of up and downs, but i am looking forward to it :)
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:50:27
haha. did you ever try black licorice?
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:16:03
salty or sweet? or did you go for something special like salty fish xD
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:18:23
Def! Thank you for the order. Your first experience with candy that contains real licorice?
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:16:18
looks good
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:45:59
grabo.bg ? u sure about it?
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:09:52
Need to check out Mycelium. Would you suggest to use it as a mobile wallet?
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:18:25
happy to help :) let me know if you have any further questions. i´ll be around.
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:23:22
I checked your abandoned cart. It has only the high shipping cost cause of the weight. If you stay bellow 1lb (2 x packs of 1/2lb) the shipping cost will be $4 USD. Please let me know if it worked out. You can contact me here or directly here: 
I´ll look into it.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:54:04
thank you. really happy about the positive response of the community :) trying my best. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:47:47
totally on your side. frogs, fish and penguins - my limits.
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:51:17
hmm. if you don´t have any experience, i would suggest to start slow. sweet mix is perfect for that. it will blow your mind how different they all taste. once you get ready for the salty one, let me know. i´ll put a nice mix together. the salty one will be your decision maker. either love or absolute hate :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:49:10
thank you for your kind word! how old is your grandfather? 
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:12:24
Had few problems with the store getaway. Used CoinBase. Switched to GoCoin and it seems to work just fine now. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:17:20
Hahaha. Yeah. I was also surprised. A big order of only mean candy (salty &amp; salmiak). The customer knows what he/she is doing :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:53:17
The "Pure Italian Licorice" is made of pure licorice roots extract.
The "Bears" have a sweetener (Maltitol). 
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:43:38
Usually sweet pack contains only sweet licorice. Its a good way to get to know the candies. Sweet one is also more smooth licorice. Salmiak will be included into the salty pack. Personally i do not like salmiak candies since they are very powerful and simply disgusting :) But its the question of the taste. I know people who love salmiak.
Licorice candies are made of licorice root that comes from the plant called Glycyrrhiza Glabra. Sometimes the soil the plant is grown on might contain high levels of lead.
Prop 65 contains about 900 chemicals in its list. It does not ban any products; it simply requires warnings. Prop 65 requires products sold in California to bear warnings about potential exposure to any of the substances listed by the state of California. In this case its "Lead". rop 65's warning provision is required for any product (food or non-food) that exposes an individual in California to any detectable amount of a listed substance "known to the state" to cause cancer and/or reproductive harm.
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:20:19
Thank you! Thats exactly what i meant in my blog post. I really loved the experience of paying. Smooth and easy. Hello internet!
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:05:07
Licorice i sell is produced in European Union (Germany, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands - depends on the candy) and we have very strict regulations when it comes to consumer goods, especially food products. If any European manufacturer would have a lead problem, we would know about it. Personally i eat licorice without thinking about Prop65. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:57:30
Curious how you like it. Which one did you get?
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:45:54
wow! thats is so amazing guys. just found this post by accident. i´ll screenshot the comments, print and frame them. fu*** awesome. thank you for the support. drop me a message (use the email on the website) if you, your family or your friends need a code. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:24:18
Wow! That was my first one. I guess i just lost the Bitcoin virginity. I´ll toss another 1/2 lb. licorice of your choice in your order. Let me know which one. Thanks robtmil
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:08:32
let me know who it goes. i guess the knots will be the trigger.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:48:00
haha. the sidewalks licking. i assume you read the description :) i´ll send to order right after easter weekend.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:38:47
niiiice. i think i already packed it. will be shipped tomorrow. btw. let me know how you like. really curious about it.
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:07:21
thank you :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:45:36
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:15:03
thank you for letting me know. had a problem on the getaway side. was a disaster eve :) please try now, should work. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:46:53
thank you. trying hard :) are you a licorice-lover or licorice-hater?
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:54:30
Yup. Sende es am Dienstag raus. Kann es mit Sendeverfolgung raus schicken. Sag Bescheid ;)
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:32:39
i do imagine. and i like what i see. no cash in your pockets. no creditcard fees. no login, logoff, press this, press that.
i think if we want to see bitcoin being establish and accepted as a regular payment method or maybe even as a currency (the concept of esperanto) and not as an "experiment", we have to imagine it. imagine it in places like "you local bakery" or so.
@_date: 2015-04-24 07:51:11
got t :) will go out tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:49:32
its my first bitcoin experience and i am also simply surprised how easy it is. don´t understand why i waited for so long to get in touch with the currency :) lovin it
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:46:47
Thank you for letting me know. Contacted Coinbase. I hope they will be able to solve it soon.
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:48:39
Daaaaaamn. Thats not nice. So basically they are forcing you to sign up? wtf. I´ll get back to you asap. Contacted the support. Sorry for the trouble.
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:45:31
i am surprised how easy that was! :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:36:29
Uff, difficult question. my first experience with licorice was hard. i went for salty fishes. that is indeed disgusting stuff. can´t explain myself why people would call it a candy. funny thing is, that you get used to it. as for now i an enjoy sweet and salty licorice. double salty or salmiak is still quite of a fight :) i´ll put some surprise for your in the pack. have a look. you might find what you like :)
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:15:13
Do you mean Twizzlers and stuff?
@_date: 2015-04-24 09:07:24
i wish i still would be there. nice one
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:06:47
thank you ) working on a bigger selection. hopefully will have some new products by the end of may.
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:22:57
i guess it counts for almost any type of food. too much is aways a bad idea. moderation is everything.
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:10:57
unfortunately not yet. still working on the supplier chain. as for now only 20 products :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:50:46
aaa. u got the sweet ones. very nice mix. i assume you did not meet the penguins, the fishes and the frogs :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:14:44
why would you want to create a physical one?
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:14:16
Thats interesting. Its like a tip "tip", right? I am really astonished!
Thank you 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:13:42
what trading broker are you using?
@_date: 2015-10-05 09:00:18
Thank you. Trying my best :)
@_date: 2015-10-03 16:20:41
I already shipped to Japan several times :)
Thanks to German Post (with DHL coop) the shipping is cheap and fast. Shipping cost for a parcel with total weight of 1lb costs 7 USD, 2lb costs 11USD and 4lb costs 19USD. Takes around 1,5 weeks to arrive. Good shipping deal.
@_date: 2015-10-05 08:59:28
Thank you for the support :)
@_date: 2015-10-03 16:47:04
Yeah. We are Berlin based. For now we are having only the international version of the store. It has something to do with out store engine. Shopify simply does not allow to have multilingual stores. Means if i want to run a German version, with a new domain. Thats why we decided to go with the international version.
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:56:25
Best would be to try out the Try&amp;Cry. Either salty or salmiak.
You are right, its almost the same. I just feel that the "salmiak" ones have a stronger Ammonium Chloride taste. The "salty" ones are simply salty or extra salty. But yes, the "salt" as an ingredient is the same. Are you into the Ammonium Chloride taste? Personally, i do not like it.
@_date: 2015-10-03 16:47:44
Got it. On it. Will be shipping on Monday. Public holiday today :)
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:17:58
Thank you! I´ll try to keep a nice selection.
@_date: 2015-10-05 08:59:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:18:31
Thank you for the compliments!
@_date: 2015-10-05 08:57:47
Hmm. Never heard of licorice cigars before. Just checked it out. I asume they belong to the "mild &amp; sweet" section.
You could check out this little ones here: 
The classic licorice wheels. Good in texture and rich in licorice flavor.
@_date: 2015-10-05 09:09:46
The salmiak licorice has the Ammonium Chloride as the salt. So do "Salty" ones too. But for some reason the manufacturer manage keep the salty ones just salty. And the "Salmiak" ones salty and very strange Ammoniac flavor. Some people love it.
If you want to try Salmiak ones you could go for Salmiak variety pack: 
Got 2 packs left. The Sweet and Salty are already sold out.
But if you just want to try the range from all 3 flavors i would recommend to go for: 
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:17:15
:) yeah.
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:35:16
Got it. I´ll put some Pure Italian in. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 14:24:43
Hold on guys. Checking the GoCoin getaway. F**ck! :)
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:34:38
Perfect! Pure Italian is the one. Glad you like it. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:27:12
Hi. 
I would recommend to start with more mild ones. 
In example with: 
I´ll put some sample of the 100% pure licorice into the pack. Thats some serious taste experience :) Just drop me a line in the "note" window. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:17:24
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:30:06
Do you think i should change the discount code into something simpler?
@_date: 2015-10-05 08:58:11
Good point :)
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:26:03
Thanks for getting in touch.
Unfortunately it will take while until i get the wheels back in.
In general i would recommend to try both sides and then to decide what kind of licorice type you are.
Why don´t you try this options:
Sweet: 
Salty: 
Best from Berlin.
