Guardian is one of the most socialist, pro-gig government, newspapers in the UK. Hardly surprises me.

If it's more expensive then people should stop doing it if they're rational... this will make it profitable again for existing miners who will start up again. Alternatively people can behave irrationally and mine at a loss but then that's good for consumers so carry on imo

Thanks a lot man I appreciate your clear responses, really helpful :)

One dude doesn't represent all libertarians :/ You know the mafia doesn't go crying to the cops right? And ghetto street gangs? Well those guys aren't libertarians.
Personally I think going to the feds is stupid but it doesn't mean anything about libertarianism as a philosophy.

I agree they are within their rights to charge what they want but I don't understand how this place has place to be if it has such a high cost of trading. It sounds small but when you consider that tens of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin are trading back and forth every day then the owners will be making a hell of a lot more profit than what is needed for the cost of maintaining the site.
Just my opinion. Maybe somebody from mtgox could come and explain the policy.

This is a good idea. Adam has had Stefan Molyneux and several Austrian Economists (who never usually get much TV time) on his show several times now.

The part where they say it's more expensive to mine than the cost is a bit misleading though. If that's true then miners will stop mining... as they stop mining the difficulty will get lower and it will be profitable again. In this way equilibrium will be met like it always is.

He deserved it? Really? That's pretty cold.

Eh? Law makers don't have to "persuade" the general public. All they have to do is come up with some kind of vague justification and then they just go ahead and do what they want. Thousands of pages of legislation is passed every year, at no point do the people have a say in any of it. Sure they vote for the congressmen now and then, but they're all the same.
Never buy into the lie that it's the public who are meaningfully affecting regulations and legislation.

If bitcoin is every to become a useable currency then this is certainly not what it should look like long term. Overtime we should expect/want the price to stabilise significantly... like the price of bread, or milk.
@_date: 2011-08-07 04:21:22
Again, this is a mark against hackers being dicks and people trusting too much in third parties and the fact it's a currency in its infancy. Banks are being hacked all the time and people are having identity theft happen to them in the millions every year... would you say this shows how regular money is not a good idea?
Each scam and each site going down or whatever is teaching people through experience to be more careful with their bitcoin and for people providing services to be more transparent about who they are where they're run and make sure they don't have the same security flaws. The market will evolve and regulate itself, just like all new things do over time.

The recovering addict is quite possibly the WORST kind of person in the world. HE abuses drugs, fucks up his life and eventually quits and now he wants to act outraged that other people can access drugs who might well NOT be abusing them. Furthermore he agitates for the STATE to shut down the site, essentially advocating VIOLENCE upon a group of people doing something that HE HIMSELF did for a long time.
Cannot STAND cunt hypocrites like him. I'd probably be happy if he died.

I've used your site before, is it really easy to correlate (whatever that means)??
@_date: 2011-06-04 17:01:21
Awesome, I thought it strange when I heard they store IP address TBH.
@_date: 2011-06-08 02:11:51
I asked this question a few days ago. When a person sends somebody else some BTC is the IP address really stored? If so why? I thought one of the major selling points of Bitcoin is its anonymity?
@_date: 2011-08-07 02:56:06
Unregulated money is a very good idea, what's not a good idea is giving all your unregulated money to an anonymous website and hoping they look after it.

But he won't and it could easily go down again.

OP likely owns Tradehill
@_date: 2011-07-29 12:00:48
I can't really answer the question myself because I'm not very smart / geeky when it comes to these things, but the service is advertised as a bitcoin launderer and I know you have a decent reputation on the bitcoin forums etc. so I assumed the service launders bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-08-01 02:39:15
I recall somebody saying that transactions are stored with your IP address when you make them but I guess I got the technicalities confused. My only conern is being as anonymous as possible... don't want my ip address linked to my transactions, if you say that's not an issue then I will believe you and start using my desktop wallet.
@_date: 2011-05-22 19:17:51
I think this is actually by far the best decision (and not what I thought of when making my OP). Thanks for responding to my post!

After Paypal I think Facebook is the least trustworthy Internet powerhouse out there. I really dislike them... I'm rooting for G+ to take off for sure. Google has a vast reach and yet has rarely pissed me off in its long history. I think it's earned some trust. FB on the other hand constantly fucks around with privacy.

Read Taleb's "The Black Swan" guys... seriously.
@_date: 2011-06-08 02:09:30
And the Mafia aren't doing anything to combat extortion by themselves in their communities. Weird that...
@_date: 2011-07-12 02:56:14
By being on .Tor as I understand it, your IP is anonymous which is why you cannot access the site without using it.
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:10:28
if you'd gain little by selling but lose a lot when bitcoins go down then something is wrong... if you sell you can buy MORE when it goes even lower :/
@_date: 2011-06-08 02:06:26
You're insane! Bitcoin isn't the new underground band you found that you love because they're not mainstream! Bitcoin will grow in value and usefulness exponentially *as more people adopt it* and as the vast majority of people are not tech geeks, making it accessible for regular people will make it vastly more useful as a currency!
@_date: 2011-06-16 09:47:39
Bitcoins are far more fringe than Ron Paul.
@_date: 2011-07-31 22:40:25
Do you know of any good guides to how to run your wallet locally through tor so my ip address is anonymous?
