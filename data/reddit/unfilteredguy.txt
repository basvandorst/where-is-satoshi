I have a question.  Is anyone actually monitoring all of these stolen coins?  Do the exchanges/miners know to black list these transactions?
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:23:49
I'm pretty sure bitgo lost that insurance a while ago
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:46:00
not everyone.  I'm still waiting to see what bitfinex the company, and bitfinex founders are actually losing here.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:56:59
bitfinex was hacked before, how did that work out?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:44:13
that's why I'm starting to think that maybe the hacker got their username and password for bitgo and used that to create a new api key without any limits
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:47:32
as a matter of fact, that is all you need to get bitgo to cosign a tx for you. just checkout their api docs
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:16:25
I personally have had 0btc, $0, 0ETC, and 0ETH on bitfinex for more than 2 years now.  First, I don't understand how bitfinex expects to just stay open after this.  Second, I don't think it would be fair to want to stay open, and ask all of their customers to lose 36.06% without bitfinex itself/founders put up 100% of their money first.  And finally, how is it even legal to take usd from customer A to cover their loss of customer B's bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:44:46
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:41:23
what are you trying to say exactly?  My understanding is that once the plan is announced, and the system is back up people would be free to withdraw/deposit/trade like before.  No?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:27:38
better question is would said user be able to **withdraw** the btc?  because where the hell will they get btc if they were all stolen
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:54:13
it would have to be transferable though
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:13:44
are they trying to be the TransferWise of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:33:24
that's not really legal though. they either declare bk or limit the losses to the affected asset class. why r they using my cash/eth to make a btc holder whole?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:32:46
that's not really legal though. you either declare bk or limit the losses to the affected asset class. why r you using my cash/eth to make a btc holder whole?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:03:54
so? they're still responsible for their own security. I gave them my btc and they gave me an iou. if they get hacked and want me to lose 36% that's fine, but they need to pay up first if they want the privilege of not filing for bankruptcy
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:23:17
I don't know exactly when. but when I was approached by their sales rep that was one of the questions I asked and he said they don't have that anymore.  this was several months ago
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:45:42
let me guess, you would've lost more under the original plan, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:12:01
ok but that's actually a normal fee given how many inputs you had to use
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:26:48
that's the law. same reason bitfinex and all the exchanges that didn't file for bitlicense had to stop accepting ny customers when though they were not domiciled in ny
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:03:15
bottom line is: are you responsible for the btc or not?
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:34:57
I don't think it's C. iirc when you ask bitgo to spend btc, it creates a tx that spends btc just like you tell it to.  however, it also inserts their own address in the tx to receive the "bitgo fee".  
Since it doesn't seem like bitgo got their fees in those tx, I suspect that the hacker created their own tx and just asked bitgo to co-sign it.  Does that make sense?
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:22:14
bitgo lost that insurance a while ago
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:15:08
Good question.  My first time speaking with them was back when they first launched.  Back then they were selling a dream of: "and soon we will add more security features like: limit withdrawals, triggering manual approvals, hierarchy of access keys, heuristic analysis of outgoin transactions... and of course **insurance**"  Then fast forward 18 months later and they don't have any of that.  The only security they were offering were: 1- optional IP whitelisting, and 2- optional withdrawal limits per api key.  
To top it all off, they were offering me all of this for the *amazing* price of 0.10% of every single outgoing transaction.  I told the guy he's on crack if he thinks anyone would pay that.  They don't offer value that's worth even a fraction of that. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:04:49
if this is true, though, that means that the hacker probably got hold of bitfinex's username/password for bitgo and used that to create an api key without any of the limits.  just a hunch 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:53:14
obviously you haven't used bitgo. they don't do any of that stuff.  The only thing they have is IP whitelisting, and api token withdrawal limits.  but those are user defined, and who knows what bitfinex chose for those values
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:13:59
if you accept u.s. customers you have to abide by U.S. laws
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:33:56
and what did he mean when he said that **some** clients were offered shares in the company. I thought everyone got the same haircut
@_date: 2016-08-10 04:27:25
excuse my ignorance, but how is BCoin your wallet infrastructure?  this is a pretty advanced node but it's not exactly an infrastructure. if bitfinex had been using that they would've still been hacked, no?
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:34:56
I think that's open to debate
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:19:50
after people withdraw what they can, they'll litigate to see if they can recover what they lost. just human nature.  
my main beef is that they want to remain open while making everyone pay for them staying open.  when bitstamp lost 20k bitcoins they didn't come back and say  


that's my main beef with bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:01:01
you can't use the api to remove the api limit.  has it been confirmed that this is what the hacker did?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:00:22
my guess is, the hacker(s) were able to get to bitfinex's (BitGo) api key
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:32:10
if they wanted to exit, plenty of people would've paid well over $100M for their exchange. hell, they could've just sold a fraction of their company and cashed out millions free and clear
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:08:39
how this is excluded through api is incredible.  this should strictly be through the website with 2fa and email confirmation required at a min 
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:07:09
dude, it was less than $50k.  that's pocket change for them
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:50:55
at first I was thinking that this is impossible because once an api key is created the limits cannot be changed. but a plausible attack vector is where the hacker gains access to the user name and password of the bitgo account and then he can create his own so key without limits.  
does anyone know if 2fa is mandatory on bitgo?
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:34:03
the more egregious thing about bitgo is that they thought their service is worth 0.10% of any tx they cosign
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:46:37
That's not a bitfinex setting. bitgo has settings for spending limits which is what I think is referring to.  
afaik bitgo doesn't let you change those limits once an API key has been created. so I'd be very curious to know how they were bypassed
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:55:56
I think the simple act of giving them to US customers is illegal.  this is the definition of issuing securities.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:16:37
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:28:41
BitGo's *SDK* is open source, but the sdk is just a standard signing code no secrets there.  
I agree with what you said, to compromise bitfinex at this scale would require a long term snooping around.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:02:20
I wouldn't be too certain about that.  bfx would have to be created as a crypto coin first and I bet you 100bfx that it won't be

its a business, when you give a business your money and that get robbed they don't email you saying "oops, we lost half your money so we're only going to ship half of what you ordered".  its like I'm talking to 10 year olds here

This is an important question. if you accept bitcoin payments how do you make sure you're not accepting dirty coins?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:10:56
getting sued is a forgone conclusion at this point.  Making usd depositors lose money is the most dangerous outcome for them and would guarantee they lose those lawsuits.  They would be going against their agreement with the cftc, and run roughshod all relevant US regs.  They need better legal counsel.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:41:21
that must've been awkward :)  
EDIT: What's up with antonopolis' popped up collar?  what year does he think it is
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:44:52
and that makes it my fault that they got hacked?  Coinbase has never been hacked, NYSE never lost people's money, neither did NASDAQ, AMEX, BATS... etc.  Even Bitstamp, when they got hacked they didn't try to make me pay for their loss.
There's a diff between a business losing money due to gross negligence vs me losing due to a bad trade.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:51:19
bitgo showed you the adjusted fee before submitting, so why did you accept?
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:49:25
you don't really understand the point here. fubgibility on  the protocol level is what you mean to advocate.  what I choose to do (blacklist for example) has no bearing on bitcoin's fungibility.  the same is true with cash, receiving stolen cash is a crime for example but cash is still fungible.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:44:58
that's pretty dumb tbh.  people send money to exchanges, broker deals, investment banks all the time.  It is one thing to lose money due to bad trading/investing but it is wholly different to lose it because the business that was responsible for it did not do enough to protect it
@_date: 2016-08-12 09:42:50
that's what I was wondering.  is the a website that's tracking all of these coins to see if any of them have moved?

it was subtle, but I didn't actually offer them *my* counsel.  Plus, they'd fall under US jurisdiction (for US lawsuits) having accepted US customers.
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:16:58
I'm looking at you, Bitstamp
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:32:58
did he vouch for this?
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:15:27
not sure if you know how spending works in bitcoin, so this might be repetitive for you.  Bitcoin does not have account structures like banks do.  Instead, you have transactions that you are authorized to spend.  basically every time you receive bitcoin that's a separate transaction that you now control.  When you spend bitcoin you have to choose which transactions you will use as *inputs* for that transaction.  In your case, you wanted to send 0.02296355btc to "someone".  Bitgo had to search through your own transaction to find ones that'll add up to that amount.  Those transactions are the *inputs* that you need to use to spend that many bitcoins.  
In bitcoin, the fees have nothing to do with how much you are spending.  the fees are charged by the size of your transaction in bytes. that's because the limiting factor here is the blocksize and not the value of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:37:22

@_date: 2016-04-13 20:11:32
I'd argue that it is bad news for the ecosystem for a couple of reasons:  
* none of the other bitcoin companies bought them.  Either bitcoin companies like Circle and Coinbase don't have/make enough to buy spend on m&amp;a, or everyone's in a holding pattern  
* yet another high profile bitcoin company flames out and has a bad outcome.  This will just give VCs even more reason not to invest in bitcoin companies

smart take, bro
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:59:17
my 2 cents?  I don't think they got the VC money because of this PoS device.  They raised money because of their massive mining operation.  By my rough estimates, they're making 10s of millions a year from mining; that's enough to raise $100M in VC money.  
  
The 21 pc is a toy, probably the brainchild of Balaji.  Balaji is smart, but this thing is dumb.  The investors don't really care about the vision that much.  They probably know it is a pie-in-the-sky-probably-will-never-happen vision; if it actually takes off then great, and if it doesn't then no-big-deal. it is an easy gamble because of the massive mining revenue 21 is generating
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:55:34
LN is centralized. even the founders acknowledge this. I used to have links to YouTube vids where they plainly said that you'll will need to have a LOT of bitcoin to run a LN node.  
  
you and I won't be able to run a LN node if all we've got is a few btc and we need to open channels with a lot of other nodes. even if we could, in theory, do that, in practice no end user will use you b/c of your lower tx amount limits.  
  
let's not kid ourselves, LN is a centralized solution
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:43:34
you're absolutely right. because nothing is more compatible with bitcoin and is decentralized better than being compared to Apple.  Once my 21 pc generates enough satoshis I'm going to reward you with a reddit gold for this gem.  Should only be a year or so
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:04:38
wouldn't that defeat the purpose of having the LN in the first place?  
  
Think about it.  everyone is a small node with 1btc, that means if each one wants to connect to just 2 other nodes then they'll open 2 channels with 0.5btc each.  Assume that the user is ok with this small amounts for a while. if they want to send more than 0.5 btc at a time then they can't use you, which will force them to close their channel with you, put it on the blockchain, **pay the tx fee**, and then go looking for a bigger node.  
  
Another problem is that if LN becomes successful then Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Circle and all the big players will become nodes.  Once that happens no one else will be a node except for the big guys.  Coinbase won't accept me as a LN node with just 0.5btc channel (wastes resources for them).  Also, users will not be doing business with me since Coinbase is just there and it's easy.  
  
the entire system heavily favors big nodes whether you like it or not

you want to argue hearsay? then you can't use a dictionary and you have to specify whose rules of evidence you want to use. witness testimony is admissible, certain statements are inadmissible as hearsay according to rules of evidence.  
  
[Wikipedia is a better source for this](  here's a snippet to help u out:  
  


  
like I said, stop pretending you're living an episode of law &amp; order. no one cares about hearsay. this is not a court. it doesn't matter what anyone here thinks. it doesn't matter what 90% of people on Reddit think of the block size debate. this is only going to be decided by the core-devs (our unelected federal reserve) regardless. and here we all thought Bitcoin was decentralized

that's the problem with this whole thing: one side **WILL** get what they want by not doing anything which doesn't render this a fair fight.  specially since they can pretend they're just worried for the safety of the economy and choose to go after SW which is an incredibly complicated proposition to develop and deploy. than simply increase the block size.  what a shame 
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:58:29
Not only that, but it wholly unrealistic.  the coffee shop NEEDS the money. it won't just let all of these channels open ad infinitum. retailers will close the channels right away, making them useless in the first place - i.e. might as well just do a regular tx.

So, Mr. McCoy, you're arguing that no one can be a witness to anything anyone else has said?  Because that's a pretty dumb thing to argue.  Here is the legal definition of Hearsay:  
  


  
Quit being simultaneously confident and ignorant.  
  
Sounds like the tone of a desperate loser. I cited you the dictionary, but instead of accepting your error you choose to argue against the dictionary and resort to petulance.  
  
What a joke!  
  
You're a nincompoops.  You've lost in our little game. You didn't know what hearsay is until I corrected you after you confidently, ignorantly, petulantly, and wrongly tried to correct me. That makes you a loser. The insults make you a **butthurt loser. Go put some cream on that anus loser.**

I'm afraid there's little we can do to prevent centralization.  even if we find POW that cannot be done with ASICs, then rich miners will simply buy a ton of computers instead.  
  
the only reason things were decentralized in the past is that the only people interested were the hobbyists and bitcoin was too cheap to attract attention.
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:15:29
exactly. so all the "cool" apps being written don't need the hw. *people* need the hardware so that they can have bitcoins to spend using those cool apps.  I am just not convinced **AT ALL** that the 21 hw is necessary, and all the excitement seems to be about their api rather than their overpriced miner
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:21:00
I don't think that's true, otherwise they wouldn't even need bitcoin. they could just make up a new 21coin and use that.  As I understand it, the only purpose of the hw is to mine bitcoin so that you don't need to buy it
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:56:26
you don't really know what hearsay means, do you?  **Hearsay** is when the information is 2nd hand knowledge, not firsthand knowledge.  
  
The insult you are looking for is *lying*, that's what it is should it not be true that the people quoted never said what this post claims they said.
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:04:19
dude, you truly are a dumbass. and apparently with a very poor comprehension skills to boot.  
  
just think about it for a second, just think about how dumb what u said is. according to you there can be no witnesses to anything spoken whatsoever since according to u it'll be hearsay.  
  
I don't even know why I'm arguing with you, I don't care if it's hearsay this is not a court. hearsay doesn't mean "lies" it just means that you can't use it to convict but it could still be true. so like I said before, no one gives a shit if it is hearsay, what you should be accusing him of is *lying* if that's what you think is happening here.  
  
so there, you can keep on pretending to be on an episode of law &amp; order if it makes you feel good. be my guest

I can't name names if that's what you're asking, but the writing is on the walls so to speak.
Just take a look at the [transaction volume chart](  This is not the chart of a currency that's being increasingly adopted.  Right now bitcoin value is nothing more than what the "next guy" is willing to pay for it.  It is no longer a currency at this point, just an asset with no intrinsic value.

Whales are very bearish on bitcoin.  they bought and held bitcoin because they saw it being used as a currency, but it never got there.

I am yet to understand the appeal of these cards. I'm still not paying for anything with bitcoin.  all they do is preload the debit cards with cash, and sell my btc on an exchange as I spend their cash.  I'm never spending btc really.
The cards don't even use btc as their base currency. If xapo's card is issued by a US bank and I try to use it in mexico I'll still pay fx fees to go from usd to pesos.  they're really not bitcoin credit cards

@_date: 2016-01-17 04:16:55
so let me get this straight. b/c you don't know how POW will be funded 24 years from now, you want to force the entire bitcoin economy into something new right now?  why not increase the blocksize to 2MB, think about this for another 4 years (god knows you guys like to take your time) and then come up with something better.  
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:46:24
it's opt-in on the behalf of the sender not the receiver. you can refuse to upgrade all you want, but if the sender sends in an rbf tx and screws you, it doesn't matter than your node won't accept it if the rest of the network does.  That's not **opt-in**  
  
The main point is: who the hell wants this? it is a solution in search for a problem.  It is only needed in a fee market, which and co - being the trained central bankers they are - are intent on forcing us into
@_date: 2016-01-17 05:06:25
why would I want this?
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:12:38


  
I never understood this argument; "this solution will not scale in 16 years, therefore we should not do anything right now".  How does that make sense.  Increasing the blocksize to a modest 2MB will not make centralization that much worse that it is today.  What it does do is give us plenty of time to work out a long term solution to the problem.  
  
But if your ultimate goal is to change bitcoin wholesale to a settlement only network where it costs $10+ per tx, then we want different things and one of us will be greatly disappointed anyway.

your point was that bitcoin backed credit cards improve adoption and I disputed that fact.  showing that process to newbies will not convince them to abandon fiat for btc.  
for  there is literally zero added benefit of a btc backed cc vs a regular cc.  you can use your regular credit card, and every month sell some btc to pay for your cc bill.  there, I just saved you 1% with the same, if not better, convenience.

Do you even lawyer bro?  This is not how shit is done.

First of all, at least we seem to agree on one thing: Core (pro-small blocks crowd) is the one who's trying to change bitcoin from what it is to something different.  Your argument, though, is that *this is where we're going to end up anyway*.  Is that a fair characterization?  
  
Here is where I think your side loses me.  blocksize increase is always attacked as an anti-decentralization measure.  However, if you guys are right, bitcoin centralization is basically guaranteed and our only savior is LN.  I mean who is going to run a full node for free if the blockchain is several hundred gigabytes or more?  If LN is successful people will just run a LN hub, at least then they stand to gain money.  Anyway, if your vision ends up with a massively centralized bitcoin, what are we doing here exactly?  
  
I obviously disagree with the notion that a modest increase of the **limit** to 2MB will drastically reduce decentralization.  The only thing the blocksize increase will do is reduce the fee pressure and the backlog, but the overall blockchain size will end up being the same.

dude, what the hell r u talking about?  the merchants will still pay the same fees regardless.  these credit cards are indistinguishable from regular credit cards for the merchant.  


hold the front door.  have you been arguing from the point of view of the merchant this whole time?  Did you actually think that it was the merchant who was paying the 1% fee?  holy shit.  dude, go read up on these bitcoin credit cards.  the merchants have no clue that they use btc in the background.  in fact, these cards are identical in every way, shape and form to your good old credit cards.  in fact, you can still dispute payments, and everything.  and to top it all of the merchant will still pay the usual 3% fee b/c that has nothing to do with the card but is tied to the visa/MC/amex/... networks.

I didn't realize you have bad reading comprehension.  You obviously didn't read what I wrote.  I said: I'm *pro* SegWit and *against* BU.  But you go ahead and tell me how I'm being led by the nose to be against Bitcoin  


Quite literally the definition of "appealing to authority".  your experience means shit bro.  I have more experience than you do, and no I won't prove it and I don't care to.  Bitcoin Core is not a clean codebase, that's my opinion and couldn't really give 2 shits if you don't agree.  I can point to 100s better code than core's.  Also, to answer your other question, no I'm not saying that core devs are bad, or that I'm better.   
I know what it's like to work on a legacy codebase.  There's no way core devs' would "cleanup" the code b/c that's too risky.  But that doesn't mean I should pretend that Bitcoin Core's code is pretty or a guide to how to write good code.  


You should read past the first paragraph.  Basing your entire argument on "I'm right b/c I'm an authority and I said so" is a clear example of that fallacy.  see this as another example:

at $0.05/kwh cost:  
s9=  $307/month
Avalon = $144.43/month  
so the profit is more than 2x.  also, it is not 1/3 of the cost.  The Avalon is not sold with the psu, they recommend a $300 psu.  which means that it is more than 1/2 the cost of the s9

@_date: 2017-08-09 07:41:08
[antpool has *always* mined empty blocks](  the empty blocks are a mining optimization. when a miner gets a new block they need to stop everything they're doing, verify the new block, then build a new block on top of it.  that verification takes time away from mining and wastes resources.  so instead, antpool assumes the block is valid and goes to work trying to find a new block.  but doing so safely means they can't include any transactions because they haven't verified the tx in the most recent block by then
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:45:32






Sick burn dude.  whatever that meant, anyway.  
i didn't think I need to draw you a picture, but apparently I do.  You can't say that it doesn't make sense for anyone to not use core b/c of need of 100% compatiblity, and then say nothing is stopping me from using something else.  


the reason it makes no sense to you is the reason why no one can or should have their own implementation.  B/c there is no `libconsensus` it would be suicidal to deploy custom node implementation in production.  


All the snark/jabs aside, it sounds like we're on the same page.  Assuming you think libconsensus is a good idea.  b/c that's basically what I'm saying:  core should've been (or should become) libconsensus with separate reference wallet, and reference rpc server projects built on top.

@_date: 2016-11-10 19:35:47
There is a lot that is wrong here, not even sure where to start.  But lets start with your own self contradiction here:  


...  


I lol'ed.  You started your answer saying that it doesn't make sense to have separate implementations b/c it reduces security.  then you end your answer by calling BS and telling me nothing is stopping me from having my own implementation.  Because who cares about security in bitcoin anyway, right?  


Nobody has ever said we should split them up, and it will never happen anyway.  All current core devs are going to stay with core (that's my guess anyway).  The issue is with non-core devs, and people that just want to experiment on their own for educational purposes... etc.  


That's just not true.  No one should implement their own crypto, that's for sure. but there's nothing about bitcoin - apart from the low level crypto stuff - that says we can't/shouldn't have other implementations.  The bitcoin rules themselves are easily portable to other languages/implementations
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:18:42
I realize that, but you're literally suggesting that to scale bitcoin we have to not use bitcoin and instead move offchain. or did I misunderstand you?  
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:40:39
this is simply unrealistic though. even with LN people still need to do small tx onchain.  think about the people who get into bitcoin for the first time. they want their first $500 in btc. are they not allowed to even control their keys? or is that going to be a privilege in the future?
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:51:12


everything else aside, I take issue with this statement.  this has to rank pretty high up in the list of problems with bitcoin-core.  the issue is not that we need multiple implementations in and of itself to attract more devs.  The problem is there is no damn standard for how the consensus logic should work.  every implementation has to be bugward compatible with core otherwise it'll be at risk of forking or losing money.  This limits everyone's choice and forces everyone to only work with core.  
I mean you do see the irony, no?  You are literally limiting people's choice and centralizing development in core.  Our goal shouldn't be limited to the decentralization of rule enforcement, but also in our choice of implementation.  I should be free to develop my own node and as long as I follow the standards everything should work fine.  Sadly that's not the case

@_date: 2015-08-17 18:35:14
1.  his tweet is what triggered that question for me. he's certainly not the only one saying LN might/should be the answer.  Maybe instead of core-devs I should've said "Bitcoin Expert" flare people?
2.  Maybe not in theory but it will be in practice, guaranteed.  Same with bitcoin itself.  it won't be decentralized forever, in fact it is already showing decline: 
3.  Sorry for having an opinion different than yours.  Will try to do better next time.
@_date: 2015-08-21 18:47:16
Not even close.  Transactions that go on LN will have to be recorded outside of the blockchain.  if NASDAQ is the hub in this case, then NASDAQ will have to record those quotes on their db and not use the blockchain.  Which means that they'll end up doing what they're currently doing
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:19:00


Very much agree, but do you consider the current situation centralized or not at all?  Because to me, I consider both centralized.  Full nodes are down to around 6500 nodes, which is a ~7% decline yoy.  ~70% of the nodes are in 5 countries (all western - goes to 82% for top 10 countries).    
    
Mining is even worse, you mostly see the same 10 mining pools over and over.  [Those top 10 miners discovered 94% of all the blocks in the last 4 days](  But I think this is inevitable anyway. as mining gets more expensive and harder to achieve it will be concentrated in the few who can afford to keep upgrading their hw.    
    


    
While that is true, they control a lot more than just money.  Listen to the developers talk about how [LN hubs will **know everything**](    
    
@_date: 2015-08-28 04:05:36


Am I the only one that reads the papers and watch the talks?  I thought everyone knew that Lightning Network is a centralized solution.  Don't believe me, just listen to the developers [describe how a LN Hub **has** to be *rich*](  i.e. there won't be that many of them, i.e. it will be centralized in practice.    


This is not just speculation, both sides agree on this point.  Here is what thinks:    
[In the long-term, Bitcoin cannot compete with centralised systems on costs. It's a nice feature short-term, but stressing it too much may be harmful when the alternatives get cheaper.](    
So, yeah both sides agree that bitcoin cannot compete with visa, paypal or any of the current centralized systems if we allow this to become a fee based market instead of a reward based market as it is currently.

I'm more than happy to be wrong here, but my understanding is that the utxos that I spend on LN are not the same utxos that the person I am sending to actually receives.  So, in fact, LN does touch my money.  It is "low-trust" at the moment and not "no-trust".  There is also the problem with hostage situations until the maleability problem is fixed.


I guess it depends on how you define centralized.  If by centralized you mean a single entity, then you're right.  But to me, centralized means an oligopoly and not a monopoly.  I consider mining and bitcoin-to-fiat to be centralized at the moment.  A large % of the total is controlled by a few players.    
This is what I fear think will end up happening in LN.  [Here is Poon and Dryja discussing how rich the hubs have to be](    


I probably misspoke here.  To me payment channels are primarily for micropayments; think streamium for example.  But I realize payment channels could be for high value services as well.  So what I should've said is that "micropayments will be gone"
@_date: 2015-08-26 05:00:48
you're exactly right. Bitcoin allows both of the buyer/seller to exchange service and payment in a trust less way. once you stick faradam in the middle you MUST trust them (to refund the extra money). and in that case faradam is no better than elance and PayPal.

You're right, I was glib with my use of "don't implement your own crypto".  I was just trying to make a quick point.

On the other hand, it would be insane for openssl to decide that openssl has to have curl features
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:30:24
That's not what I'm saying.  What I am saying is that LN will not be more decentralized than the blockchain.  And I'm arguing that in practice LN will be as centralized as mining pools, and wallet clients if not more so.  This is because people will tend to just gravitate towards the market leaders.
This will happen regardless of whether bitcoin will be centralized or not.
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:34:19


A couple of things.  This has **ALWAYS** been the claim, that bitcoin is safer and cheaper payment method than credit cards.  In fact, "low fees" has always been a part of the talking points when selling the idea to new users.  Lets not pretend otherwise.
Second, and even more importantly, **every single bitcoin service provider** (except miners) will benefit from the larger blocks.  Only the miners care, benefit, and/or collect these fees.  So miners obviously want the blocks to: a) be as small as possible for as long as possible, and b) not grow too big too fast.  That's why you saw all the big companies go out in support for bip101 and all the miners go for a more conservative approach.
Third, higher fees will kill *a lot* of bitcoin businesses.  payment channels will be gone (bye-bye micro-payments and hello paypal like bitcoin). bitpay and all the other bitcoin payment processors will be gone (they won't be able to compete for business against visa). and almost every single bitcoin business will have to readjust their business model for the new reality
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:07:28
I don't understand why they start by changing the bitcoin protocol to mimick the [relay network]( instead.  There is absolutely no reason why every tx has to be received twice by each node - once when it is first announced, and a 2nd time when it is first added to a block and the block is propagating.    
Makes no sense.  with a protocol like the relay network a 1MB block can be transferred in under 6KB
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:47:52

you're actually making my point for me.  op said SW fends off centralization, which isn't true.  centralization is on the rise as is and SW is not trying to fight it.  
simply *allowing* for bigger blocks will not all of a sudden make bitcoin centralized.  that's just a myth.  the underlying claim is that the more popular bitcoin becomes the more centralized it gets

Nice post, liked it alot.  I'll quote your own words from the post.  


I don't think it'll be more decentralized.  I think the same big players we have today will be the same big hubs we have with LN. *maybe* slightly less centralized. but definitely not by any big margins.  LN has a huge network effect that will make users open channels with well connected and funded hubs than small "mom &amp; pop" hubs
@_date: 2016-02-13 07:40:40

Then no one can say when we will hit size xMB b/c it depends on outside factors, which is my point. SW *allows* for more (SW) transactions, but not bigger blocks.  


No it doesn't,  regardless of how much you guys wanna spin it that way.  It makes SW transactions smaller but it doesn't make blocks bigger.  Which is why no one, including you here, can tell when we will see bigger blocks after SW or how big those blocks *will* be.  B/c it'll all be on wallets to start creating smaller transactions
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:21:53
you guys really believe that centralization line don't you?  Blockchain.info has 11M users, coinbase has what, 8M? what % are running their own node?  there's never been more than 8k nodes. and I'll bet the vast majority of them are owned by miners and companies.  
hate to break it to you but not SegWit nor anything else will fix that.  in fact, I'm willing to bet money that LN will increase and not reduce centralization
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:58:49
That has nothing to do with what's going on here.  Obviously the miners saw Adam as the representative of the core devs. otherwise F2Pool wouldn't have freaked out that he changed his signature to "Individual" instead of "President of Blockstream".  
Do you honestly think the miners would've all gathered around to listen to Adam, the Individual, pitch a core roadmap when Adam is not even a core developer?
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:09:00
of course it is a huge issue.  The miners assumed that they're talking to the representative of Core team not just to Adam, the person.  Otherwise, they would've insisted on getting a majority of the core devs to sign on to the roadmap

dude.  SegWit is not a blocksize increase.  It *allows* for smaller transactions.  If you want proof, just answer me this: if SW is activated on Block  at what block height will we start seeing 2-4mb blocks?  Please be specific
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:26:25
thanks, this is super helpful. but correct me if I'm wrong, but this sounds like a hard fork. is it?
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:32:20
i don't understand, how will this change miners vote from where they are currently? what would make this more successful than SegWit?
@_date: 2017-04-04 06:38:08
I'll be honest. I don't know enough to argue for or against the effects of a block size increase.  I'll leave that to the experts.  *but* I laugh at those that pretend that SegWit will lead to more decentralization.  
I laugh even harder at people who claim that SW was core's compromise in the block size ordeal.  
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:52:34
sure he can. why else is Adam, a person who is not even a core dev, presenting and negotiating with the miners on core's roadmap?  
this is not unheard of, Linus represents Linux even though it has more volunteers than Bitcoin. same thing with perl, ruby and so many much bigger projects that are led by a single person although they have many volunteers.  
the curious case of Adam is why do all the core devs defer to him even though he's not even a contributor. makes you think doesn't it?
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:48:02
simple. they soon will fully control the best private blockchain in the world: Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-13 07:19:59
it does require a third party otherwise it is a simple payment channel.  I think what was trying to say is that it doesn't require a centralized 3rd party.  But it most definitely require a third party, otherwise it is a very inefficient system.  
  
The idea is that with a 3rd party (a hub) your 1btc channel can be used to spend with all the other people connected to this hub without having to open a channel with each one (like 21's solution)
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:19:29
I don't think you're friend (and everyone like him) would bother with a LN channel.  people are just lazy (no offense to your friend)

I thought the proposal requires SW to be activated first?  
In either case, Jihan says he's ok with "tothemoon" copying those lines.  Which negatives your assertion that this was the only conceivable reason why he would be against SW
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:12:39
how is it BS?  SW creates a new tx class that is smaller than current transactions, it doesn't make blocks bigger.  Which is why I asked the "when will blocks be bigger" question.  Because neither you, nor anyone else can answer it.  If this was a "legit blocksize increase" it would've been an easy question to answer.

@_date: 2016-09-27 18:56:29
but they don't.  any serious security/bitcoin person will tell you to always stick with bitcoin-core b/c you not only have to be fully compatible, but you also have to be "bug-wards" compatible.  If you run any other node you run some risk (might be extremely low, but it's &gt; 0).  
Until core cleans up the code, and moves the consensus out of the wallet and really modularize the code we're going to be stuck with a single implementation for a long time.  
that's just my opinion

@_date: 2016-09-14 15:44:53
dude, educate yourself being getting on your high horse.  do you seriously believe that ofac matches in palestine (or any arabic country) is only 2x what it is in the US for example?  And especially palestine with active, known, popular and sizeable terror cells.
only 0.5% of US population is of arabic descent, and x% of them will trigger ofac because ofac is a shitty list.  in arabic countries 100% of the population is arabic (no UAE doesn't count) and y% of them will trigger ofac.  now guess how much more y is than x.  
since you obviously don't know anything about ofac, you should know that once a person has triggered ofac you have 2 choices: 1- just automatically turn them off, or 2- do a manual review.  which means a ton of work for the company for little gain.  
yeah, be done with this thread and go read up on the subject
@_date: 2016-09-20 19:59:44
so how do prices work in that case? do they guarantee the price when you make the deposit or is it on a best case basis?
@_date: 2016-09-14 22:23:10
that's not generous, that's extremely conservative... I think you don't know how ofac works, so let me explain.  all ofac does is a name check.  They compare your name against a list of names, if there's a match you're flagged.  It is as shitty of a system as that sounds.  
In palestine, kyc is an even bigger problem than just ofac though for several reasons: it is a conflict area, part of it is governed by a terror organization, and a lot of money is going to activities the US gov doesn't quite like.  
Keep in mind that I'm not the one calling them terrorists or anything, but the US gov is and they're the governing authority that US fintech companies must follow whether they like/agree with it or not

OTC is irrelevant here.  we are talking about an exchange, the exact opposite of OTC.

exactly.  if you have 30 shares and a company does 4:1 reverse split you'll end up with fractional ownership but that's purely out of necessity.  you can't ever buy a fractional share.  which is why btc -&gt; share is the wrong comparison. you have to do share -&gt; satoshi
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:11:00
no you can't. Gemini and coinbase are basically signaling to the miners that they're on their side and support their effort to mine SegWit2x.  they won't bestow the moniker on some random fork they don't support.  
also, like it or not, in a proof of work system miners dictate the rules.  this new found rallying cry of "full nodes dictate the rules" is just fud.  not even the devs believe that when they say it.  if they did they would prefer hard forks over soft forks.  because in soft forks a non-upgraded full node is dragged along for the upgrade against it's will.

dude, you dropped your tin foil hat.  
those same people you are claiming are trying to take over bitcoin have been consistently advocating for bigger blocks and have been shunned for years.  
go back to the list of Bitcoin Classic supporters and see how similar they are.  the only difference between classic and current situation is that the core group is so incompetent at community relations that they screwed up their rock solid relationship with the miners.  the miners killed classic for core. then core turned around and treated the miners like shit.  so the miners switched sides and joined non-core.  that's what happened, no takeover attempts. just poor thinking by core.

he might not have intended it but sure as hell he should've predicted it.  you act like this was inconceivable when it has been happening throughout history.  you don't need to be Nostradamus to see this one coming.  people will invest in any money making venture until it's no longer profitable.    


there's no law that btc is reserved to *your* idea of bitcoin.  like I mentioned before, bitcoin was hard forked twice, and the market picked the winning chain and that one got the btc symbol.  if you don't want to designate an exchange as your proxy, then you need to move your coins out of there exchange.  
people need to stop bitching and vote with their money.  move your coins out of s2x exchanges and stop telling them what they need to do.  
the fact that coinbase, Gemini, blockchain.info add 100k customers per month tells you that the market will actually call the s2x chain bitcoin.  people don't care that much besides the regular circle jerks

unfortunately, I did read it. you obviously don't know what an msb is. an msb is someone who takes money from entity A and sends it to entity B. 21 selling u bitcoin with no 3rd party involved.  
  
you can argue that this makes them fall into reg X, Y, or Z which could be right. but that doesn't make them an msb. and even if they had to be an msb, we're not talking about a bootstrapped business here. 21 raised north of $100M. that's as much if not more than [all the money coinbase has ever raised]( and coinbase started selling well before raising all that money. So arguing that 21 just HAD to do it that way doesn't pass the smell test

they're not *your* bitcoin blocks.  you're almost there.  all you have to recognize is that bitcoin is what you choose to run.  if the core ruleset is what you choose to run then that's bitcoin for you.  but OTOH the same applies for coinbase, Gemini, blockchain and all the s2x supporters.  they also have the same right as you to call whatever they wish, bitcoin.   
and their customers have basically given them the right to vote on their behalf by depositing they're coins there.
at the end of the day the market will decide what's a valid block and what's not.  not you and not me.  we just get to vote

The problem is that, most of the time whenever a traditional fintech company says "we like the blockchain, but not bitcoin" what they really mean is "we like public-key crypto".  
  
  
My bet is that Chain will work with NASDAQ and other fintech companies on a closed loop blockchain where the miners are the firms.  ie all they'll be doing is using good old public-key crypto to communicate/transact with one another while pretending they're using a blockchain
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:38:14
so? I think price averaging, weighted or not is a pretty dumb idea anyway.  but the value of bitcoin is how much you can buy/sell it for at any given moment. if they're lagging then that's just awesome for traders looking for arb.
If coinbase has offers on the orderbook to buy bitcoin for $1000 it doesn't matter than the other exchanges are only offering $500.

@_date: 2015-09-27 03:46:57


  
don't forget 21 has to first create 1,000,000 tx to give each each user their share. and that's assuming they'll wait a year to get it. if they distribute each block that's 400 blocks or 400,000,000 transactions to distribute 10,000 bitcoins or 0.00004btc/tx (dust level). this is so very inefficient. again, why not a Rpi2 with 1btc preloaded?  it'll still be cheaper and more useful than this crap

@_date: 2015-09-18 01:35:50
it is not a mischaracterization. you obviously didn't get my point.  The only thing I was referring to is how "hot" bitcoin is.  2013 and early 2014 companies were trying their best to show how they're a bitcoin company.  investors were also tripping over themselves to invest in any bitcoin company.  the fact that Allaire (CEO of fucking Circle) didn't jump and say "we are one of the biggest bitcoin companies out there" is telling.  
  
The talk and demo were awesome and it shows how great bitcoin is.  but the fact that Circle is not touting that it is Bitcoin first, coupled with ChageTip's post about how people don't like bitcoin proves my point.  A point that has nothing to do with how great bitcoin is, or how wonderful circle and changetip's products are.  
  
EDIT:  Did you seriously just link me to 5 months old videos from Allaire.  If anything this just proves my point even more.

I'm surprised you didn't throw in that other fledgling startup - google I think it's called - as another example. iirc fb is one of (if not the only) co that had this unusual gov structure from the start. even google didn't have this until pre-ipo. but fb was capturing 60%+ of every single fucking campus it would launch in, and would do so in 2-weeks or less. fb's hockey stick monthly growth chart had a hockey stick rate of growth chart. if bitpay had tried that they'd have been laughed out of the room. if anything, there is some pretty favorable liquidation preference for the investors

bitcoin is a shitty payment method. focusing just on that won't get them anywhere.  you don't see coinbase focusing 100% on merchants, do you?  Just look at Coinbase's homepage, it's all about consumer and merchants are but a footnote.

It doesn't really matter who u r talking to; smart ass teenage who's never had a job, a pro-trader with 20+ years of experience, or some simpleton.  Bottom line is if the logic makes sense, it makes sense.  Yours doesn't, mine does.  
  
  
go to [Bitcoin Charts]( and add up the total traded volume across the exchanges in the last 30-days.  I got lazy and only added up the top 10, and I got 5,691,000 bitcoins.  In the last 30-days.  Now tell me, are you seriously trying to argue that a whopping 40% of ALL bitcoins in existence were bought up in just the last 30 days, on only 10 exchanges?  I wish that was the case, because the price would've been either $10,000/bitcoin or $1/bitcoin.  See, it's pure logic, even if it's coming from a jobless teenager

That's not actually how it works.  Control is a very simple formula.  Your control = # shares owned / total # of shares.  There's not much to it.  If you want to be able to tell whether a VC is exerting control is when you see the CEO "leaves" abruptly.

Changetip will definitely fold, I'll bet you anything their monthly bitcoin volume on coinbase is less than $20k.  
  
  
However, OP might be onto something with coinbase.  if you look at their exchange volume, they're barely doing 7k btc/day. that's around $1.2M/year (@ $240/btc * 0.2% fees). or if it is all from their consumer then $6M/year.  Not really worth $400M in valuation with this kind of revenue.  Also, their exchange volume is down 20% MoM

this is people buying and selling bitcoin. if u buy my bitcoin, then you sell that bitcoin that counts as 2 bitcoins in exchange volume.  exchange volume is driven mostly by arbitrage, market making and speculation. so people reading a lot. not just "selling" 
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:54:14
how do you figure?  Their daily bitcoin volume on their exchange is always less than 8k/day.  @ $240/btc and 0.2% in fees that's around $3,840/day in revenue or $1.4M/year.  That's peanuts for a company that's supposed to be worth $400M.  
  
Even if one were to assume that a whopping 50% of that volume is coming from their wallet business (a huge stretch).  That's still only $4.1M.  I'm not saying they're going to fold, necessarily.  just that the bitcoin space sucks right now, when the biggest company in the space is only making so little.  I don't envy anyone who needs to raise right now.  Maybe Buttercoin was on to something - j/k those chumps are a joke.

you don't really understanding the difference between TRADING on an exchange, and people buying and selling stuff on circle or regular coinbase.  Here, let me explain trading by pick something easy: Apple Stock.  
  
1. [AAPL]( has about 5.7B shares outstanding
2. [62.10%]( is held by institutions.  Institutions usually buy and hold for a very long time and their shares are not actively traded day-to-day.
3. This leaves us with 2,160,300,000 shares floating around
4. Avg daily volume over the last 3mos (60 days) is [58M/day](
5. 60 * 58M/day = 3,480,000,000 shares traded over the course of 3 months
6. 3,480,000,000 is a lot more than 2,160,300,000
7. I just blew your mind right now

what a strange metric for a company that doesn't make money off of transactions.  Also, don't they handle Bitstamp's deposits/withdrawals?

So the 1btc just counted as at least 3btc "transacted".

Source for this?  From my experience, Boost always had trouble fill up the tribe with quality companies.  
  


  
I guess I should've made it clearer.  I was talking about the supply/demand from the perspective of money.  people are buying/selling equity for cash.  The demand in this statement is referring to founders looking for money.  the more of them the cheaper they have to sell their shares.  supply is investors looking for opportunities.  the more investors you have the higher the equity price (i.e. valuations), the more startups there are the more you have to lower your valuations to get money  
  
Your whole thesis about SF prices and how that affects valuations is completely wrong.  Any seed company that is hiring engineers at $200k/year should be shutdown immediately.  There is simply unheard of and very laughable.  Even series A and above companies will not hire that many engineers at $200k a popup.  what world do you live in.
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:38:07

Edit: not trolling, but I am curious about the decision process that got them here.
@_date: 2015-10-05 02:31:34


  
It is not apples and oranges, in fact boost is nothing more than a more specialized version of YC focusing only on Bitcoin. Boost's performance is a function of both boost's management and Bitcoin's VC appeal.  
  


  
This is simply laughable.  Go tell any VC, angel investor that stat and watch them fall out of their chair laughing.  
  


  
It seems unrealistic to you because you've never been through a YC Demo Day.  Here is an analogy: graduating from YC is like graduating from Harvard with an MBA or a Law Degree.  Saying that 90-95% of those Harvard grads land a job right after graduation might seem *"super unrealistic"* but it is reality nevertheless.  but who knows, maybe you know better than the guy who answered the quora question - who invested in ~60 YC company.  
  


  
So did Airbnb.  I never said VCs are the smartest bunch.  I just said that when only 3 companies in a 25 company batch raise $500k+, that's a bad sign for Boost and bitcoin.  
  


  
This doesn't really say much, does it?  I'm not saying that everyone who wants to raise money **will** raise money.  Just that it is easy now. both in terms of raise size and valuation.  Also, the whole point of joining an accelerator like Boost and YC is that it sets you apart from the noise - just like joining Harvard vs a state school.  The same person, with same resume, will have a completely different career should he graduate from Harvard as compared to a state school.  
  


  
The thing is, the demographics have changed dramatically in the seed stage.  We have an explosion of "angel" investors, Angel List Syndicates, and many more.  Just search twitter and you will see many angels complaining about the lack of deal flow and the explosion in seed company valuations.  Things are tightening up this year though.
@_date: 2015-10-05 23:05:19
I hear lots of talks about institutional investing in bitcoin, but no one ever explains what that is.  Are you basically an investment fund that does arb/market making on bitcoin exchanges or are we talking funds taking long positions in bitcoin? maybe a family office or something
@_date: 2015-10-06 06:06:31
Ha! I just looked at your name and noticed who you are.  it does explain things though.  Don't get too defensive, man.  Money was definitely easy, but you came out of boost at the worst time possible.  VC had already turned on bitcoin.  I mean, how sad is it that the press covering your demo day would start the article by saying "[20 bitcoin startups might have been too many given the current state of the industry](  Even YC had just 1 bitcoin company in the last batch and from what I hear their raise is not going all that great.  So I feel for you, man.  
  
that being said, don't fool yourself.  Raising seed money is easier than it used to historically - even if it's already getting tighter.  Just dig up some of mattermark's charts.  Things are tightening again in the seed stage due to the lack of liquidation events.  but they were easy when boost was around until the 2015 tribes.  
  


  
  
Contradict yourself much?   
  


  
I can only assume that you mean dollar cost is $200k, i.e. base, benefits, taxes... etc.  There's no way you're counting equity otherwise that doesn't factor into your "SF companies need to raise more because SF is expensive" equation.  So, if you are talking $$$ cost, you're still wrong. Just call your Boost buddies that stayed in SF if you don't believe me.  
  
Good luck with your raise.

the demand for this would dwarf anything you can imagine
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:53:32


  
This is not speculation.  Anyone with any knowledge whatsoever in the startup space will tell you the same thing.  Here are a few examples:  
  
1. [Keith Raboi - Khosla Ventures, Paypal, and Square](
2. [YC acceptance rate is even lower than Harvards](
3. [First YC batch of 2015, graduated in 03/2015, raised $227M my August](  
  


  
Sadly that's not how it works.  Your first job out of B/Law School sets you up for life.  You don't see McKenzie/Bain/BCG/GS hiring state school grads.  And then the big jobs will prefer people from those companies.  
  


  
Of course it does.  Price is a function of supply and demand.  Demand is increasing, which usually lowers the price. so what do you think is causing the price to still go up  
  
Take what Sam said about the W15 batch companies.  There were around 100 companies in that batch and in 5 months they raised $227M.  You tell me who's right: your 35-40% of the companies raise after demo day, or that guy's 90-95% number?  Neither one makes Boost look good in comparison

that miner/chip was a flop.  it was obsolete before it was even released.  mining bitcoin on anything like that would take a really long time to even earn you a single Satoshi (0.00000001btc).  
I think when 21 raised that money it was to mine bitcoin just like everyone else.  they even had a respective mining pool.  but now they don't know what they're doing.  I think they'd be better off turning themselves into an incubator for crypto companies.
@_date: 2016-05-11 03:49:23
sorry, but that's bull. everything you just described is actually easier done with anything other than the blockchain.  
insurance companies don't need anything that bitcoin offers to do that; it's easier for them to do the same with an API. and unless you've invented a way for kids to mine blocks by cleaning their room then that family idea is pretty damn dumb

this is just plain wrong. if the funds r only locked until tx takes place then there is no point for the LN to exist, in fact it would be worse than the current system. because after the tx takes place the funds (AB) now must go on the blockchain (it's not locked anymore, right?). then on the EF side a tx is released to F which creates 2 txs just to move money from A to F.   
  
in LN the funds are locked for a long time in a channel to account for funds going back and forth. the hope being that instead of sending/receiving multiple transactions a day or a month, you just net out once.

its ridiculous to think that going from 1mb =&gt; 2mb will change bitcoin _that_ much.  also businesses don't care to centralize it.  give me 1 good reason to do that through the block size.  it would be much easier for them to gain control by each company hiring 10 devs and dedicating them to working on core full time.  right now they don't contribute anything, which tells u how much they care about control.  they only care about making money through their businesses

See, we can actually agree.  I don't consider an algorithmic optimization to the PoW as a more severe security threat than the introduction of GPU/ASIC mining.  I think ASIC mining is several orders of magnitude worse to the bitcoin network than asicboost.  


I'm sure they did, they would be stupid not to.  I bet all the miners assume all the other miners are running asicboost as well.
the reason they allowed SegWit is because they're running a business not trolls on reddit.  They don't care to lose that 20% edge because everyone else loses it too, so it evens out.  
The only ones getting screwed here is the small mom-n-pop asic-at-home miners.  but those guys have been getting screwed for a long time.  I have no doubt that AntMiner is 1 to 2 generations ahead of what they're selling the public.  If they're not, then they're more cypherpunk thank Mr. Adam Back himself.  I wouldn't have done it, I would only sell my old used and abused hardware and only so that I can invest in the new hardware.  Or do like BitFury and don't sell shit to the public.  Why would I want to help my competition anyway
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:47:15

it's not  


I don't think you understand what we're talking about here.  there is SegWit signaling, which 100% of the blocks are signaling according to op, and there's SegWit commitment which not all blocks have.  in this thread someone said that this could mean that miners are fake signaling.  I was showing that they're not, and this is just how their pool software works.

@_date: 2017-07-19 13:57:31


it depends how you look at. bottom line is you're running old software and the network is now running newer software.  your bitcoins are safe but you probably should find out whether you need to upgrade.  that's what this message is trying to tell you.  


that software is publicly available:   
remember, this is just the lock in period.  once SegWit is locked in, it'll be activated 2 weeks later, which is now than enough time to go from RC =&gt; final release
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:36:10


it takes an expert to notice a catastrophe in bitcoin?  


this is... retarded.  asicboost or not you still have to do the work, you just do it more efficiently with asicboost.  its like mining on a 28nm chip vs 16nm.  the 16nm is alot more efficient, does that mean it's cheating?   
asicboost does allow you to skip a few steps but that's nothing more than the software version of going from 28 =&gt; 16nm.

Paypal went through the same thing.  I used to work for an e-commerce company that did around $200M in sales.  We a/b tested paypal.  Simply having paypal as a payment option (next to visa, mastercard, and amex) **reduced** our sales by 5%.  and we ended up dropping it as an option.

aml/kyc is involved whenever you go from fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto. so even though you're not doing it, you're just shifting the point at which the person has to do it. in this case the receiver will have to do it, then he will have to use the banking system to get the cash out. so you're not really fixing anything since they have to use the banking system anyway.

no they don't.  they can drive the price down at will by attacking the network, yes that's easy.  but they can't force the price up at will except maybe a handful of times and that's at the extreme.  plus there's a huge risk in that if they spook the price one too many times the price would never recover.  since they don't have a reliable control on getting the price to recover after their attacks it would be counter productive to rely on it rather than honest mining and helping/praying for the price to keep going up

and that's why no rational miner would rather short bitcoin than simply mine it and work on increasing the price

I disagree. LN is not just a new tech that wallets need to support and that's it.  LN is a complete change in behavior and expectations.  customers need to change for this to take hold and that's a very tall order

the coinbase and blockchain.com nodes might count in the single digits but they represent millions of users.  so they're the equivalent of millions of nodes.  your node only represents you, i.e. a lot less significant than their nodes.  either way, you are free to not upgrade but I'll stick with the economic/hashing majority

is there a way to deposit bitcoin into your circle account?
@_date: 2016-07-29 05:44:38
that's a little hyperbolic don't you think? even if etc overtakes eth as the longest chain they don't have to support it. the worst that could happen to them is they get stuck supporting a dead currency in eth

I'm not referring to her being confused.  you're claiming that the UX (user experience) will be the same, which is not true and I was trying to show you that not being true.  
for Alice to send the LN 5btc to bob who doesn't use LN, she has to close the LN channel, then send them to bob.  the definition of a different UX

I don't think you understand what we're taking about here.  what you're saying only makes sense for someone who wants to make a one time profit.  they most definitely need the market to recover and be able to repeat that cycle several times for this to be more profitable than honest mining.  
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:17:07
you keep telling yourself that. lets see what the exchanges and people outside of the reddit circlejerk call them

swift is same day. if your wire took longer its probably due to aml/kyc reasons which would be an issue even with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:31:51
those customers don't care bruh. that just want to trade and make money
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:14:02


the definition depends on what helps the current argument the best ;).  but here is the unbiased, obviously objective, and true meaning of "economic majority" /s.
to some, the economic stakeholders are those full nodes enforcing the rules of the network.  which is true, however it doesn't make any sense to assign that a 1-to-1 vote.  my 1 full nodes is in no way equal to one of the exchanges'/wallets' full node.  blockchain.com has over 11 wallets and probably runs only a handful of nodes.   
so, in my opinion, economic majority should be measured by polling the service providers and weighing them by the number of users using them.  blockchain.com = 11M votes for example.  and by that measure SegWit2x, and hardforks in general, have overwhelming support

this is not good advice.  Edward Snowden needs libreboot, 99% of the people here are fine on Intel and amd

you're dreaming if you think it'll only take 3 months to test/deploy LN
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:22:01
isn't the antminer more energy efficient or am I reading this wrong?
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:27:11
that's not a unique advantage of the blockchain; you get the same exact features today without the blockchain.  you will not sell businesses on a brand new platform by saying "change your entire process, spend millions to redo all your software to get exactly what you're getting now"
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:10:37
what makes you think it will not happen?  its not just miners that agreed to it, an overwhelming economic majority is also onboard
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:10:37
excuse my ignorance, but I don't get this about eth.  I thought outgoing txs have to be in order, but why do incoming txs (bittrex deposits) have to be in order?
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:46:11
but that aside, the antminer _is_ more energy efficient, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:55:28
all the exchanges and major wallets will
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:56:40
 the economic majority will
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:57:57
no i haven't. so is it now possible for me to send Alice 5btc on LN and then she'll be able to send those btc to someone else who doesn't use LN? because that's the only way you'd be right about the UX not changing
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:35:50
it matters a great deal. larger number of customers means more liquidity, higher demand, higher price and all that means miners will be more inclined to mine that coin.  which means small btc will be stuck for years trying to get through the difficulty adjustment
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:18:43
dude, stick with the discussion topic.  the original point was that LN will easy to deploy ("it started showing up in litecoin within hours"), I said you were dreaming and it'll take more than 3 months for companies to deploy it.  I wasn't  arguing about how good or bad LN is.  I didn't make a single statement about that
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:19:51
just between coinbase and blockchain.com they have more users than all the bitcoin nodes combined. including the fake nodes
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:05:09
it'll happen
