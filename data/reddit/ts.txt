Is Korea supporting BCH or BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:09:04
What's the question?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:18:07
Because I read that bch was mainly pumped by Koreans.

I lost €154,- to a scammer because of PayPal. They told me it was insured... but not BTCs.

In the meanwhile, while we are waiting for the moon.... ;-)
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:36:40
But but, why is it going up again?
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:05:06
Yesterday I paid more than €10 for 4 transactions, with Mycelium! 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:24:00
Thanks for the tip, I will try it!
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:36:34
It would, if the fees weren't so damn high. ;-(

And even some more bad taste: the price was €17,50 and when I convert the price I paid to bitcoin I paid €20,47.

Because we probably will be installing an app to scan the code to see what I'm giving him.

Nothing free here:

Don't trust, verificate...
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:01:25
Hmmm, I thought so but I guess not.
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:50:19
Maybe we can print some extra bitcoin? ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:02:03
So much thank you! :D
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:50:32
Wauw thanks, my first tip!
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:49:23
RemindMe! 1 year "Does ₿ look like a bitcoin symbol yet?"
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:31:45
Unable to withdraw the 0,01716 btc to my local wallet, have to deposit first... lol

PayPal does not have buyer protection for virtual stuff, like bitcoin, only fysical objects.
I had them on the phone, there was nothing they could do for me... end.
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:06:08
Totally agree! This way i'm not even going to try to read it....
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:25:36
Because I don't know to do / use that... ;(
@_date: 2015-10-23 20:51:31
I hope you never will.
@_date: 2015-11-01 19:04:10
Is there a way to prevent this from happening in the future? Anyone?
