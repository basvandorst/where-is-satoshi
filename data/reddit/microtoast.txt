I am amazed by your hate towards Bitcoin Cash. It is literally the original Bitcoin vision that a lot of people want to keep alive - this project certainly doesn't deserve the hate it is getting.
Also offers the opportunity of free and censorshipless Bitcoin discussion. (In fact I'm expecting this comment to get deleted soon)

Please don't compare BCH with 'those' coins.
The legitimacy for BCH comes from the major split in the community when the coin was reaching the blocksize limit of 1mb. With both solutions being chosen by the very same community I fail to comprehend how BCH would be less of a Bitcoin.

It is full-fledged Bitcoin just like BTC. I once again would like to take the opportunity to point towards the fact that blocksize limits of this kind were not part of the original Bitcoin philosophy.
In fact while appreciating the way BTC is trying to go (finding different ways than besides an increased blocksize to deal with issues that come up with rising adoption), I fail to comprehend any possible rational (and benevolently) reasoning behind the refusal to increase the blocksize when obviously problems would start to show up on the midterm. This 'civil war' and the fork wouldn't need to exist if Bitcoin kept true to its own philosophy.
That and the bad feeling that comes along with the Lightning Network (off-chain security issues, centralisation and a possible monopoly position) is why I was forced switched sides. Not because of any con artist leading me on that path.

He had a good reason for adding small blocks at the time but it's not like you said:

This is called dumb money and is going to be the downfall of this enormous bubble.
To everyone in here new to crypto (which seem to be a lot): Don't play their 'Buy the dip' and 'HODL TO THE MOON' games - think for yourself. It's your money on the stake, not theirs.

You do know this was the original vision back in the days we all loved to follow dearly when we all went on the train?
What makes you so sure that this is a straight up stupid idea? I think that if that'd be the case then the community wouldn't be so deeply divided over this.
