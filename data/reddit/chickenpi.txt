Dude this is lame.    
So just because someone can't plough a bunch of money into a very speculative 'investment' they can't be part of the debate?    
Sounds like a bit of gatekeeping to me, which is pretty rich for someone with a 2mth old account and who probably bought in less than a year ago.

First heard of bitcoin ~2010 and did a bit of research, but I was 16 and had basically no money so didn't end up buying any.     
Fast forward to 2013 when the first "bubble" happened and, whilst I still had basically no money as a university student, I knew something was afoot. I bought around £20 worth almost entirely for the purpose of not being this guy... the x30 profit is something of a bonus.

I bought my ticket for $30 back in 2013.    
Best. Rollercoaster. Ever. See you at $0 or $1,000,000.

They aren't all that great really. Yeah you feel like you're in the actual matrix every now and then and you get a cool keyboard but the interface is crap, it's actually kind of buggy and costs the bank something ridiculous like £20k per terminal and even then most of your data is delayed. 
Most useful thing is bloomberg chat - the only reason anyone still uses it.

I'm an equities trader at a bank so I'm on the berg all day! I have a little btc ticker on my launchpad to soothe my constant price paranoia haha
Btc is a hot topic on the desk... Mostly thanks to me! (small) Hodler since '13 :)

This kind of short term speculation is an absolutely awful idea. Even if somebody did it and made a profit, it was still an awful idea at the time.
If you're speculating on credit, it's a spectacularly awfully awful idea.

Would love to but I'm London based.. If I ever get shipped across the pond after the brexit financial catastrophe I'll give you a shout!

Only invest what you can comfortably lose, even if it's only £/$20 or so! It's all about the journey and sleeping easy :)

What's wrong with that my dude?

quoting bloomberg here.. looks like a crappy auto translation or something:     
"Chinese regulators have decided to close domestic trading platforms of cryptocurrency, Caixin reports, citing unidentified people close to the nation’s Internet financial risk prevention team.
Document has been issued for local regulators’ implementation."

Literally just the headline right now

I go to [IG]( (the platform advertised here) every morning to check index futures and they've been pushing Bitcoin CFDs for a while now.    
However, they're not really advertising Bitcoin, more products for Bitcoin speculation.

excuse me?
