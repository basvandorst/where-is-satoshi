don't panic it's simply Lunar New Year (christmas equivalent). all asians are taking their money back to buy presents. and since most of the cryptomoney is in Asia it droped... check last year :
it went from 385 to 270 : get his calculator out : 270/385 * 100 = 70%
It lost 30% in one day last year same day.
Now let's say it went down from 14 000 to 9000 in a short period of time ( i take for granted the fact some people knew and sold some before the dip) :
9000 / 14 000 * 100 = 64%
it lost 35%
if you add the fact that with the huge buy in december it was way too high compared to what it should have. ofc it went down that much. logic.
same pattern as last year. some people are in a buying spree and will earn a lot!
whatever you do, Be brave Cryptomancers ! HODL !
