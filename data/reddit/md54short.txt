The Chinese demand for Bitcoin has gone up leading to a price increase in Bitcoin. The demand for the currency has gone up BC theirs is depreciating. Likewise many Chinese may to use the virtual currency to migrate to another country. If their money is no longer tired up in a national currency it makes migration easier.

That's a dick thing to say.

I'm not a Bitcoin newb. I'm someone with an idea how to make Bitcoin better.

Logic as to why you think it will explode?
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:34:31
I mean does it matter thought if over 50% of the nodes accept the change? Let's say China, Russia and S Korea ban together. Seems plausable.

If the government installed their own programmers they would have them update the source code to do whatever they wanted. It could still be open source, what it did would just vary. I also don't think they need to do it will infiltration. They just need Github to make them the main admins. 


The government could just create a bunch of their own nodes. They just need 51%. I mean if we're talking about  a few major countries working together here this is totally possible.

I mean they really don't have too. They can just say to their people take this shit down, figure it out, and boom you have a ton of smart people working on it.

I suppose the real question here is what happens if a couple really powerful countries unite and they take over the majority of the network w/ Bitcoin source that has their changes whatever those changes are. If those countries are China, Russia and S Korea where there already a lot of nodes and they start putting guns to miners heads forcing them to change it seem possible to me.

Finally someone who admits it's not immune! This is the point I'm trying to make.

I feel like your not being creative. Some right now Bitcoin is essentially governed by a group of programmers. There are a ton of pull requests and they pick what gets in and what does not. They have a ton of power at their disposal. Eventually the government is going to want to have a say of who ends up on that group.
Now currently this group is always updating the Bitcoin source, and they release versions, and minors upgrade. It could start with small changes that everyone agrees to but eventually they could run the show. Plus a bunch of world governments could create enough nodes to overthrow the current system. I mean given this shit might be the next currency of the world none of this sounds that far fetched to me.

Dude I work in the technology industry as a software engineer doing web work. Trust me you will have no problem finding a job after college. New CS grads can easily make 50k in the US, more if you're on one of the coasts. Don't get screwed into working for nothing. You're worth way more than you think.

Dude what's stopping the government from eventually controlling the core team. If this thing actually becomes our default currency I can guarantee you who are the core devs on the project are gong to change.

If you can update the program to spit out more coins how is it immune? Right now the source code is on Github, hosted by Microsoft. What happens if the government just takes it over.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:05:45
Good for you man. Every jack ass thinks they know best, fuck em.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:35:13
What your talking about is a fork. I'm not talking about a fork. I'm talking updates to the Bitcoin source code.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:30:17
Most of the miners are in China. If they put a gun to the miners heads I'm willing to bet they upgrade.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:27:19
the project is on github which is owned by microsoft. They could basically tell microsoft to give them the keys and make them admins of the repository. From there you could assign devs as the NSA to work on it.

The bitcoin prayer loving it!!!

It's about moving things forward. This is great for promoting Bitcoin and bringing in new converts. Think politics, it's all about tiny wins and **moving** in the right direction.
