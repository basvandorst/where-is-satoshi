Hardware wallet only.

and I would add manipulation .. I think btc (crypto) is heavily!x2 manipulated ..
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:41:05
as far as i know .. there is a limit on amount secured ..
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:33:16
buy it on exchange .. send it to your hardware wallet like trezor.io
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:44:38
maybe is not .. now .. maybe btc never will be .. but something based on blockchain will .. it is just too good solution for many aplications not to be used ..

100% true

If I see correctly you run RP node. Is there torrent image available, so we all can have faster start?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:24:15
A lot! Didn’t know that. 6 mbit is 15% of my 100/40 mbit fiber. But well worth it :)

There is cfg file where you set “prune=10000”
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:39:12
Mine is working and connected, automagicaly, dont know why yours is not. Maybe a router thing. Clicked yes to allow all when installing.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:43:38
I guess you are running BCH node :)) thats fine .. we all should show support for what we .. hmm .. support :)

I have blockchain on this old laptop .. but its prunned .. I guess I can use it when I get RPi3 ..

I knew it was pump and dump when they started to pump BCH price. I was greedy and wanted to ride the wave so I have exited BTC and went all BCH. All was good until it was not :). I was using Kraken, tried to sell as price started to go down but no way. Clicked 500 times and opened sell orders refreshed and what not until system accepted order and I sold that shit. Went back to BTC with 20k eur less assets. Paid my schooling. Now I am rock like HODLer :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:46:36
true .. ppl are saying .. hodl .. i am gonna hodl .. no way I will sell .. who givz a fuck about price .. this thing to the moon etc .. and THEN when it goes bellow purchase price .. they sell :)

its not for long term keeping .. I have few copies
ppl are not used to be 100% responsible for their money .. many of my friends do not understand that there is zero chance to retrieve BTC if they lose seed or keys .. 
99,9% of the services you use, you can go to someone and verify with your ID or email or phone number to get access again .. that is what are ppl used to .. they just don't comprehend there is no one they can turn to if they lose BTC data .. 
others that keep data .. large portion keep it on cloud .. like note app .. or screenshots cloud uploaded etc .. 
my point is .. ppl are really not used to care so serious .. and it is too much work for them ..  
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:08:26
it is easy to get 24th word .. but 25th passphrase is not from word pool .. could be anything so its really hard to brute force .. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:52:45
yes .. I LOVE .. that BTC is mine .. totally in mine hands only .. this is 1st time in history that you have such control over you assets .. there was always someone else that also had access to it this way or another .. 
but as you said .. and me being tech savvy .. I still am super concentrated when dealing with trezor device .. receiving/sending btc .. so for average joe this dealing with crypto is really too much .. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:40:30
I hope this is not your only way of keeping private keys?
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:28:43
dont know .. i just know no one tested that ink for 300 years .. its a calculated estimate .. they said cd dvds will last decades .. none of mine was readable after few years ..
i would not trust ink paper for long time storage ..
not to set it and forget it ..
I keep my seed (not keys) .. writen down .. 24th word and 25th passphrase i keep in my mind and my wifes
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:39:10
aaaaaaaa .. cant correct it :)) got them all good in post but not in title !!
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:00:55
can you imagine the resposibility to keep safe wallet with 66.000 btc .. whatever you do it is not enough :)
