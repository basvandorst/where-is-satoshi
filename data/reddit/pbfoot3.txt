Wow, this is why I had avoided reddit for years.  I didn't do anything nasty or illegal, which is why I was confused about the notice.  I don't think I even violated their terms of use / service, but as I mentioned it is neither here nor there since my real concern is the idea that they are sniffing the origins / destinations of my transactions.  I barely use Circle, mostly for buying small amounts of BTC as a hedge on small-time personal investment strategy.  Which is why I'm not as familiar with the machinations of how BTC moves between parties. 
But even accepting the idea that my use of Circle violated their TOU/TOS, I am not comfortable with the idea of what is effectively a bank monitoring my transactions to that extent.  mootinator: it's not like a merchant being able to monitor your transactions from other merchants, it's more like Bank of America being able to track what you do with money once you withdrawal it from an ATM.
I get the FINRA AML regs, and online wallets' need to comply, but I guess I didn't expect it to be this pervasive since I certainly haven't done anything illegal, or any action that would even trigger any sort of "deeper look."  I've had maybe $2k in transactions on Circle total.  On one hand I guess kudos to Circle for really trying to be a good guy in what can devolve into a shady world, but on the other it's pretty worrying that they are doing that large-scale level of monitoring of user transactions without any real suspicion, warning, or motivation.
EDIT: also your account is 9 days old.  I literally have kiwis sitting on my counter that are older than your account.  I don't work for anyone in the financial world, or anything that would impute any sort of conflict or motivation to "slander" Circle.  I get what they're doing, and I'm sure everyone else does it too. But I don't like it.
