They won't though because btrash refuses to adopt Segwit etc. So they won't be able to use the offchain solutions created for bitcoin.
Making the roads wider isn't elegant it's bruteforce.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:56:34
A much better way to do it. Processing and storing every single users contract onchain is just insane. Probably more insane than bcash moving to unlimited blocks.

Bit Bitcoin already has Segwit, flextrans obviously isn't here yet, and why oppose Segwit if btrash is only going to implement something similar? Does flextrans allow the miners to cheat with Asicboost or something?

Cash also doesn't have segwit, so don't expect to have access to lightning networks ,instant offchain transactions or smart contracts soon.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:46:41
The only argument against Segwit is that the miners are annoyed about collecting less, that's why they created bcash, because they don't want reduced fees and offchain transactions. 
There was also the fact that Segwit breaks Asicboost which some miners were using to unfairly game Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:25:28
There are issues with tangle and POS. Would we really want to switch to those?

Bitcoin with lightning network is like having your house in an estate/town with other homes sitting off the main road and some other small roads to the shop.
Bitcoin Cash is like have all of those things sitting along one long road and thinking the solution to traffic is making that one long road wider and faster(making it unsafe).

The opening line about never being hacked is wrong. Ethereum dapps have been. Many times.
Holycrap though that is one very detailed and knowledgeable doc. They did their homework.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:22:05
Well they refuse to implement segwit etc so they would have to implement their own version of lightning network and without Segwit it will have issues. 
They won't be able just copy paste it like they copy paste security patches from core right now.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:18:00
It was for making transactions where you don't have to trust the other parties involved in processing them and know that inflation is locked by consensus.
It was never instant. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:23:00
But miners get more from big blocks as they can collect more fees at once at the expense of  bandwidth and security.

They're going slow because they're working with people's money and trying to keep it stupid simple (KISS).
More complexity adds more points of failure that need to be tested. So they don't end up with incidents like ether is prone to having see DAO.

Presumably. By then there should be a lot more people on the network.  If fees are too low for some other miners will pick it up .
If blocks slow down people will pay more to get transactions on a block.

But Bitcoin core only changes it's difficulty every 2016 blocks. So it's incredibly hard to game in the same way Bitcoin cash is being gamed.

Ok but there seems to be two contradicting beliefs in  the Bitcoin community now. 
A lot of people seem to want Bitcoin to become officially accepted so that it can be traded etc.
Others seem to view it as some sort of anarcho capiatlist way of living outside the system.

Someone was already caught out this way a few years ago, he got on TV they asked him to prove it and he could not.
There are cheaper ways satoshi can prove he is himself. Satoshi has a pgp key .
If he sends a message via that key it would be no more or less valid than a transaction from his btc addresses. It would also be cheaper for him.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:58:20
I've heard of a few few people doing similar.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:54:59


I don't think the writer even knows that Bitcoin and ethereum have their discrete  own chains...
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:31:35
Which is what bitmain etc are trying force us into so they can collect more in fees and increase centralization. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:14:21
I think fees would have to come down to adopt mBtc as the main unit 
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:58:34
When the difficulty changes won't that cause a price spike?
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:52:17

Try it via adb. The amount you have might not be worth as much as the cost to repair the screen.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:12:00


Because people are complaining about transaction costs being too high on Bitcoin core but you don't seem to care if transactions are even processed..
Segwit allows for lightning network transactions to alleviate fees but 2xers don't want to wait. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:01:19
I think Bitcoins public ledger will actually be an asset in the future. Consider the AML issues that will come with Monero etc.

Bcash has a kind of emergency dynamic adjustment for encouraging miners to devote resources to them.
But it wasn't well thought out . So miners tens to mine it a lot and then abandon it when the difficulty is adjusted up. They then wait for it to drop and repeat this.

Well it's concerning a coin designed to attack it and steal it's branding.

Didn't he attempt to have people killed?
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:03:32
Does it stop there?

Pulling this from my arse but...
World wealth is $241,000,000,000,000 (according to Google)
1% of that is $2,410,000,000,000
Divided 21 million( This is how many there would be if coins were never lost and all mined) times is about $114761.9 ish
From this is should be clear I have no idea what I'm  talking about

High since he  mentioned buying some in the past, months back.
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:11:53
Sounds like they're just making the roads wider to accommodate spam transactions, only it didn't work, so they're doing it again.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:22:30
I think Bitcoin transactions are too slow to make this feasible
Nevermind he covers this
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:29:31
Yeah, this really  looked more like he was trying to push it all higher before he cashed out.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:32:07
Wouldn't the best thing be to just sell in increasingly small quantities? 
So people get used to holding Satoshis instead of a full coin.
Also Segwit needs to happen.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:59:20
If.. it's  always better to not be in debt!
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:21:44
Won't transaction times be a huge issue? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:02:48
Stop trying to get with X , Y  &amp; Z they're not interested...also bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:55:01
Afaik most tech companies and banks looking at this are interested in trading Altcoins or the use of blockchain technology for record keeping etc.
I don't  think many intend to start their own alt coin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:37:03
It would be treated like you went out and bought any other asset . 
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:03:39
Will the others survive? Ltc seems to be climbing gradually.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:18:24
So he already has Bitcoin and is trying to pump it up to make more himself ?
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:24:31
Plus nobody is having their PC taken to ransom with a demand that they send the attackers gold coins to remove the encryption.

Buy Bitcoin move it from one wallet to another..
There you go. Plausible deniability

JP Morgan and GS look a bit more sustainable.
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:28:42
Probably but if I ever get trapped for eternity somewhere I'll have something to do.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:51:12
It's bullshit. The Banks love the technology. And If it wasn't for all the AML(quite rightly) stuff they would throwing barrels of money at acquiring coins themselves. They would also be mining.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:35:43


If i go to the shop with my euros the transaction is instantly confirmed.
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:26:16
It's  really funny
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:23:17
Right , and that's why all the mining


Mining is becoming more centralized at the moment in China, because it's cheaper. One of the reasons it's cheaper is because they're getting power from a dam.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:36:42


Sorry could you explain how that would work ?  I can't see how they could push down the price enough to benefit themselves.
Not only that but they would lose money in fees  selling any buying more.

Just logged back into slushpool after 2 years away. They have a poll running on this.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:38:57
I guess if it's  long haul they have plenty if time to confirm the transactions :)

Why would he hide this vulnerability if these aren't being  implemented yet?
This isn't  a zero day. It's  a -30 day

Not US either. TBH that probably should have triggered some automated system.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:24:46
Imho it's inflated unbelievably fast. People are using excuses such as Russia or company X is interested in it when really those companies are more interested in the technology.
Also running code in a giant distributed virtual machine is the wild west. E.g DAO

Ok I have to ask what's in your charts that is copyrighted?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:00:07
You only have to guess one word. Maybe it could be brute forced.
You could reduce thr number if guesses if you have an idea if what size the word should be.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:22:18
Someone probably just registered the name in the hopes of selling it later on.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:59:27
The whole forum is full of people pumping up the price with moon threads and you're worried someone doing arbitrage will destroy it?

A bondage rope that nobody uses to exchange love and services must be a lonely and heartbreaking existence.

Will try the export. Fees are obscene now.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:04:04
Not Bitcoin specifically but he might be a little off. Banks actually love the blockchain technology . It's going to revolutionise sorting out payments between banks for them.
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:40:22
How has that been doing? I hope it's dying.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:55:39


i get the feeling that isn't just a drag and a click.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:21:01
I'm not planing to evade taxes so i'm not worried.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:53:01
You're absolutely wrong. Plenty of corporate banks can. Also banks don't only deal with dollars , there are other currencies in the world that aren't crypto.
Loosen your tinfoil hat.
Citi even anticipated our current situation. 
"Since the network incurs substantial energy-related costs due to proof-of-work, we believe that these costs will eventually be borne by the users through high transaction fees, which will make it more expensive than centralized networks," the report contends."

Does the client not distribute/collect blocks in this manner already?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:38:14
A bitlong? Or a bytelong?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:47:02
It would be very basic of course.. Ah smartphones will probably filter down soon enough anyway.. maybe one day the waller will be a default app.

J2me mislets mostly I think.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:07:41
Do they charge money on empty account s that haven't been used in years? I know their fees only came in recently
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:56:25
Not to mention they're popular with people who hate smartphones
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:53:36
I know but if i was in your position i wouldn't be attracting attention to my big pot of money. Just because it's 1s and 0s doesn't mean it can't be stolen.

All these "libertarian paradise" appear to be nothing more than souped up gated communities built in poverty stricken countries known to be lax in regulation due to corruption.

Couldnt it just be changed on the client?
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:19:39
Are the're any mining applications that work out of the box out there? I recall using a gpu miner a few years ago but it was agony to set up. I understand now of course using a home pc to mine would be about as easy as winning a lottery.

Normal people learn from their mistakes.
Stupid people don't learn from their mistakes.
Smart people learn from the mistakes of others.

Is that QT version attempting to mine coins for me while it runs?  I know that's probably pointless at its current difficulty , just curious.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:56:25
But are people going to use it for trade?  Or just speculate?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:39:29
Would that work on feature phones?  And older device s?

@_date: 2013-11-25 14:45:30
