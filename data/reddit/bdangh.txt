When people say disk space is cheap, they are wrong. Even if you want to setup full node for your business, all standard VM coming with small disks, up to 100 GB, and you need to attach additional disk to run full node. I run full node on Digital Ocean and I have to attach 250 GB disk to my $10/month VM to run Bitcoin full node, which cost me additional $25/month. I imagine if I had to attach 1 TB disk, I wouldn’t run that node for $110 mo.

I'm not one of 0 confirmation supporters, but what "accidentally sent a transaction" means?
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:20:04
Yes, problem in the wallet software which shouldn't allow you to send transactions with low/no fees (unless you are very technical users and want to use super configurable wallet). At the moment you can send transaction like that because of lack of user experience in existing wallets at all (only centralized wallets like Circle, Coinbase, Uphold have somewhat UX), with RBF - UX will become even worse... 
I have a gambling website, and I have a lot of feedback from non technical users, and most trending support requests because of bad wallets which includes not enough fees and transaction stuck unconfirmed for few days.
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:12:01

When I'm first time have heard about Bitcoin I thought it's bubble too, even I was too lazy to open and read about it, because after regular "E-Money" systems it's not easy to understand what it exactly is. We really need some killer app. Whatsapp and instagram are killer apps in that sectors, this is why they costs too much. Now imagine app in most expensive financial sector. How much it will costs?

They have very talented huge development teams who work with Node.js, and using bitcoinjs-lib to write something like internal BitPay not that hard for them (probably they have few developers who is expert in Bitcoin), but let's see future developments!
@_date: 2014-09-11 01:37:56
No, it's not that hard at the moment, and it will become more easier by time. I have paid only few times with Bitcoin mobile wallet and I can say it's 1000 times cool than any credit card or NFC payment.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:23:59
I'm not big fan of Coinbase nor Ruby, but this even not subject to discuss, there is many programming languages, and EVERYONE in community should be HAPPY that there is many other open-source implementations, so developers can use them without being familiar with C++. If there is small bug in implementation it can be fixed quickly. Bitcoin Core is useless in many and many of cases in modern development processes.

As long you keep small amounts, Circle is best choose at the moment, good mobile apps, 2FA. I do not think someone will freeze/block my account for some $400-$600. For big amounts ONLY hardware wallet and/or cold multisig-BIP 38 storage (though if you know how to do that).
Edit - About browser based Javascript cryptography, how many times people have said it's not secure!!! Browser have no such good random number generator to generate right private keys, signatures and etc... I will not use any browser based wallet that generating private key in client side and will not suggest it to others.

Apple Pay is something like SDK, you still need to use card processing like Stripe (so nothing new for merchant, still 2.9%+0.3$, banks, waiting days for payment, chargebacks and etc...), Apple just verifies card and adding it to Passbook, after that all processing is between payment processor and your phone.
I think this is good for Bitcoin. Mobile payments and Bitcoin made for each other, so when people starts use one will be easy to implement other.
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:05:23
No! Easier to bring cash with you (max allowed $10K), because you may have difficulties to exchange more than $1000 in Bitcoins in one day. Mostly in Localbitcoins trades between 2000-5000 pesos. You may need Bitcoin when your out of cash so you can buy with US account and change them here, near blue rate, but you always will get better rate with cash dollar (though it less safe to exchange).

I can't understand how serious financial company can give full access to user funds with API, without or even with authorizing app and developer...

Yes, it's cool for payment, but it also have many other advantages. For example, I live in Argentina and Bitcoin is most easiest way for me to receive money from outside of country and not loose 40% of my money.

AWS is more secure than any datacenter built by company with $10M investment. It's not enough to complain any security certification and standards. Also they are using multisig so cloud is best option for them. Owning your hardware is thing from 90s and it have many and many security issues as phisical and virtual as well scaling issues.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:48:10
It can be hybrid solution, in case of multisig, they may keep one key on AWS servers, one key on local server, one key in safe deposit box, one key in BitGo servers and one key on Nejc Kodričs smartphone.

It's complicated process and can't be explained in few words, but I think it's explained more clearly here 
Idea is that you can do payment without trusting receiver, and if they do not provide service you can receive refund. For example you are using Wi-Fi and paying for it per minute with deposit for one hour, but if Wi-Fi broken after first 10 minutes, you can receive your money back (for remaining 50 minutes), or if it does not work at all you will lose only network transaction fee and receive full automatic refund after some time (usually one day)
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:47:46

They done redeployment with help of Pantera Capital and very good startups they founded yet (They know best practice and I'm sure they use dedicated servers)




Certification is proof of security


Do you know how multisig works? They may have second signing key hosted in different environment, BitGo servers in this case, so even if someone, somehow hack AWS servers second key will not be compromised.

Yes, it's OK, for me, for you and few other guys from this subreddit, but we still have no any minestream wallet. I have used/tested mostly all bitcoin wallets, and non of them as good as they should be. One is good but you have no control over keys, second is ugly but you control keys...

Very good suggestion, I thought about this all time for Argentina, and even if you have no revenue, it is best way to convert useless pesos to something what can be sold abroad. But problem is import control on miners and anything else.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:31:30
Thanks for the answer, theymos, so if address is P2PKH sender should send regular transaction, and if address is P2SH sender can assume receiver will able to receive SegWit transaction. What if it's just multisig P2SH address and wallet still do not support SegWit, will that wallet still receive SegWit transaction?
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:04:38
My point is that $10M (probably $5M or less after hack) investment they have is not enough to build secure datacenter as secure as AWS, I did not said that if you have your own world class secure datacenter it's bad.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:19:27
I read SegWit BIP and there is no word about receiving transaction from upgraded nodes in Backward compatibility section, I will wait for more technical answer.
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:32:44
Thanks! I think I understand now, so as an merchant I can use P2SH SegWit address to receive payments, then sign and send to any address, as my service support SegWit so I know how to sign (and my transactions will be smaller). Only problem at receiver side, they will not available to validate input signatures I used and asume it's valid.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:47:20
it is better to hurt few mainstream users now than thousands of users in the future, this will force developers to increase block size. I think enough talks already, we need actions...
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:40:50
I understand that, so I have unupgraded node and receiving transaction which marked by anyone can spend, should I trust that transaction, and if so, how should sign and spend that output?
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:32:17
Yes, block structure remains same, but segwit changes how transaction should be validated as signatures will be moved to other structure outside of block, and old clients will not aware signatures exists to validate, for them, they just dummy valid transactions transfering money from somewhere to nowhere. Changes like segwit 100% should be done as hardfork, it's more dangerous change than just increase of block size. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:31:40
Because they are dummy and incompetent?
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:42:23
Total Bitcoins in circulation costs only $4.5B at the moment.
that 0.0002% users together had 255 Bitcoins, so all 100% of users have ~1M coins 7% of total Bitcoins
(Edit - added right calculation)
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:04:54
So you worry about VPS and not updating nodes, which can happen but very unlikely, but it is OK to change transaction structure fully with segwit and make that same old version nodes useless for the network as they will not validate signatures anymore and will accept any block miners push them.

They raised $100,000,000 and probably can buy good hardware to verify any size of blocks in a second, so miner-block-validation should not be a part of the block size problem. And how verification of others blocks related to size of their blocks?

Why are all these wallets still using blockchain.info after the previous software failures?
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:17:41
Agreed abour payment experience, most of the time, here in BA it's paper with printed qr address or qr with url redirecting to BitPay checkout page. Best will be if merchants use some specalized device which can show QR code with request or print it on the bill paper so you can scan and pay without calculating or entering amount.

Another "bitcoin business" owner here, based on our data, we've paid 225 bits in average for the last 2200 transactions, and we use 2-of-3 P2SH, which is more expensive than regular transactions. 
Most of our transactions were confirmed in the next 2 blocks, we use custom logic for input selection to optimize fees...

Just wondering, if they have 83% of mining power, can't they just start signaling segwit and orphan all blocks from other 17% miners, until they reach 95% and activate segwit? Is it dangerous?
I mean why do they need other deployment so on?

You can choose to not store data in the iCloud. iMessages working by state-of-the-art technology (I never trusted them until read how it works, and it's not an whatsapp which until recent days transferred all messages in plain text), Apple have no private keys to read your communications, when you send someone message, your device encrypting message with public key(s) of recipient(s), private key of which generated on recipients device and never transfered to Apple.

So, will you add some changes in Open Assets protocol to use it for example with Stealth Addresses in one atomic transaction? (I know this is possible at the moment with another output but I guess it's not best way)
how Stealth Addresses will work if we had Ephem key and another protocol metadata in same OP_RETURN?

Yes, majority of miners use relay network, so this won't happen. But it's not recommended that other nodes who do not use relay network to run btc1 until this fixed.
* anyway no one was going to run btc1 node, only miners to activate SegWit.

I never pay with BTC when I see Bitpay. Once I tried to decode that payment protocol invoice (which they use instead of normal address) to send BTC from my wallet which do not support invoices protocol. So I googled bitpay invoice decode online and site from the first link stole my BTC by giving me incorrect address. It was only $10 but good lesson learned.
