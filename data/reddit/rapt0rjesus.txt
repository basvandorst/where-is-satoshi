Technically speaking having some number stored in a foreing online business is not the same as having a hard asset of equal nominal value under your matress or buried on your backyard.
Losing hundreds or thousands of bitcoins, dogcoins, or litecoins is not he same as losing the "dollar value" of said amount of cryptocurrency.

You don't say faggot we have been all seeing it for hours. Do you think you are the first one to notice? Seriously, to add insult to injury you add an obnoxious meme like some oxygen deprived fetus that somehow grew and eventually managed to escape from whatever institution you were in. Then you got a hold of a computer and use it to state the obvious failing to comprehend that the 8000+ readers of are not on the mental level you are in. I hope entropy somehow manages to remove every molecule of O2 from a radius of 10 meters around your head for at least 10 minutes.

YOU SHOULD BE FREAKING OUT! THE PRICE IS PLUMMETING!, SELL SELL SELL! LIKE YOUR LIFE'S SAVINGS DEPEND ON IT. 
Bitcoin is dead, we had a good run. This day shall be remembered as the day that an idea came to  at an abrupt end, destroyed as it came in contact with harsh reality.
But do not give into despair permanently. New protocols, crypgraphic programs, security software will rise from the ashes of Satoshis creation. New currencies will emerge. They will be safer, faster, stronger, more resilient to outside attacks and internal incontinences.

The mentality of letting others intrude on your personal life because you have nothing for hide is really skewed.
