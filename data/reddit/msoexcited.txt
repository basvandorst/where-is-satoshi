If you look back at history, the Internet didn't exist. E-mails, online forums like this, social media, e-commerce didn't exist. But that doesn't mean they have no inherent value and all there is to its worth is mere speculation. While some parts may be driven by speculators and maybe its current price is inflated, I believe bitcoin has enough of a fan-base/believers/advocates/true-users that will not let its market price go down to zero. Even if everyone decides to liquidate their bitcoin holdings there will be this group of people that will take up the 'unwanted' bitcoins and use it for whatever purpose/potential bitcoin holds. It's like a reverse auction.

Thanks for the suggestion! I was looking into HK exchanges and found that there's a new exchange called Gatecoin. Seems like they've got lower trading fees than ANX... their maximum rate is 0.35% ( while ANX's max charge is 0.6% (

I tried to keep it simple... If I use a US passport, I keep all transactions US-based. With ID verification process and stuff, I worry they'd have more questions about me using a US passport opening an overseas account...I wonder if I can still open a HK account if my ID is all US-based.

Exactly what I went through from a purchase two weeks ago... But they didn't offer to get my bitcoins back at the original rate I locked in. Just a simple note one week after they cancelled my purchase:
"I’ve completed a manual review and removed any holds on your account – your transactions should no longer be flagged or cancelled on our end."
Here's what I wrote to them after they lifted the flag:
"Thanks for your help. It is a frustrating experience. How come there was no advance notice given to me to request clarification on my account. It was just simply cancelled. I had no chance or any way to keep the cancellation from happening. It kind of makes for a bad experience for new Coinbase users. It's like we're guilty of mal-intent from the get-go, until proven innocent.
I understand that it's for security precaution that this guilty till proven otherwise principle is adopted. But once proven innocent, shouldn't Coinbase do the right thing by honoring the BTC purchase order for the price I got it for in the first place? I think this will make up for the customer's trouble and increase loyalty to Coinbase. Otherwise, people will just know you guys as the bitcoin business that cancels new users' orders out of paranoia and screw customers' trading plans in the process.
PS: I'll be sharing my experience on Reddit and other forums."
After this reply, they wrote back:
"Thanks for getting back to us on this. At this point I’ve re-created your purchase at the original market rate, so you should have those bitcoins soon."
If I didn't ask them to fix their screw-up, they probably would never have given me the bitcoin at the original rate. 
At this point, I've lost more than two weeks worth of trading thanks to over-rated Coinbase. And I still don't have my bitcoins. This experience is crappy enough to have me looking elsewhere!

Seems like they are... Coindesk &amp; Tech in Asia wrote an article about their launch  Looks legit to me. What do you think?

Good to know this is not happening to just me... but there's no need for the snarky comment at the end, yeah? Or are you just trolling?

Snail-banking is the reason why I'm leaning towards bitcoins... But in this case, the one to blame isn't snail-banking. Coinbase cancelled new users' order out of sheer paranoia. I'm not the only one:
