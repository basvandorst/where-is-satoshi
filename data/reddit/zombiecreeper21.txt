The issue I have is that Coinbase currently has about $5 worth of bitcoin on my account, I cannot interact with it and I cannot send it anywhere without first confirming my ID and sharing my Bank details. I've looked into Hardware wallets in the past however they are far to much for me to afford while only being able to mine with a tiny USB Miner or a singular 1070.  
I have adopted 'Bitcoin Core' as my wallet for now.

Ah that’s my second big mistake then... I thought I did control it.

Well I have a spare Samsung S3 mini and S4 android phone, the S4 I use for app testing and such though so these might not be the best options. The Ledger Nano S or X are fairly expensive and my balance totals about £2.45 so I can't really buy anything without going bankrupt... My coinbase Account is currently restricted despite having confirmed my identity and account.

Needless to say I need to do more research since I don’t really know what I’m doing

Oh, I had no idea.. kinda explains why the tiny bits of data I’m mining doesn’t seem to go anywhere and I’m permanently stuck at 0.00001378BTC despite Nice-hash saying I’m getting more. 
Keep in mind I do own a Nano fury miner but it’s only a tiny USB thing that only works with old versions of BFG miner (my pc wont let me use the software and the slush pool gains nothing from me helping)

Thing is I had more.... but I used coinbase

At least you have a Bitcoin now
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:08:58
Shame I’ve only managed to earn 0.00001378 BTC
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:56:04
Well the amount he has is more than me since I’ve only ever mined it in my spare time, accumulating 0.00001378 BTC

How’d I do this? I verified my Id with Coinbase and they gave me nothing but regret.
