Instead of repeating myself again and again, you can just read through the thread here where I've been repeatedly downvoted despite the fact that no one can provide a single instance of a case where anyone has been prosecuted for destroying legal tender (without fraudulent intent):  
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:16:41
That's absolutely incorrect.
Aside from this being art and thus protected under the first amendment, there is no law that makes destruction of currency illegal in general unless it is with intent to commit fraud.
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:23:21
I said that.  But even if you wanted to destroy money for no reason at all, you could do that in front of the police, or FBI, or Secret Service, and they would have no reason to intervene.  Note in your link the key word "fraudulently".  As I said, money is only protected in that you can't use it to defraud anyone.  Also, that link you posted only applies to coins.  Someone else posted the relevant statute regarding paper money below.

If I'm so bad at it, then where are your google links to prove your statement?


That's an absolutely ignorant thing to say.  Imagine if we applied that reasoning to all "crimes".
He hit the pedestrian who ran out in the street at night, killing him with his car.  Intent is proved by hitting him, which renders the action a clear murder.
While you are googling, check out the concept of *mens rea*.

Your comment makes it obvious that you are not really informed about how law works, and yet you're trying to interpret law.
That's not an insult, as that's pretty much true of everyone - that's why we have lawyers.
What's confusing you is what lawyers term as "general intent" vs. "specific intent".  This is a law requiring specific intent, where the requisite intent is clearly stated.  The action itself is not illegal *unless you can prove the specific intent*.  His intent was to make art, not to make the currency unfit.
That's why this particular law is useless.  I could rip up money in front of a judge and it wouldn't matter - I could just claim that my intent was to make a statement, to release anger, or to make compost.  It would be impossible to prove otherwise unless I specifically stated my intent was to render it unfit.
Some random links from a google search:

Nah.  I get a reply notification, I click it.  I read the response.  It refers to a thread I read hours earlier.  The new reddit layout makes it a pain to easily work your way up the comment chain and check who is who.  I'm busy.  The post is making a counter-claim, in the face of my many posts explaining how the law works, without any corroborating source.  People continue to spout misinformation and myths without a source.  They're confronting me and I'm definitely going to confront them back regarding that misinformation.
There is a difference between being confrontational and being rude.  Misinformation demands confrontation.

Wow.  You've got one example?
Wait, where's the link?  Still zero.
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:38:57
Only if your intent is fraudulent or your intent is to make the money unusable (impossible to prove).
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:16:14
A lot of people are being confrontational in this thread, in the face of clear reasoning, and without providing any sources or contradicting facts.  Sorry if I can't keep track of who is whom.
So, you got a source?
P.S. I apologize if my post came off as undeservingly rude to you.
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:42:05
Again, wrong.  I burned it because
1. I was angry
2. I needed light
3. I was cold
4. I was happy
5. I was making a statement about the danger of money

I don't think you know what an "edge lord" is, because it has no relevance to this conversation.
I think you also have a fundamental lack of understanding between the difference in arrest (by the police) and prosecution, trial, and conviction (by the judiciary).  No one has ever been convicted under this statute, because no one can prove the requisite specific intent.
If I have no idea about the law in this regard, and you are so knowledgeable about case law, then why can't you provide me of any evidence of prosecution and conviction under the "intent to render unfit statute" that doesn't involve counterfeiting or forgery?
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:39:12
Only if your intent is fraudulent or your intent is to make the money unusable (impossible to prove).
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:54:56
I apologized if it came across as rude.  I'm demanding a source, not calling people names.
Note, I have been called names in this thread - worse than "rude" - and haven't gotten any apology.  
Furthermore, no one seems to want to admit they're wrong, even though no one can provide a single example of a case where anyone has been prosecuted for defacing currency without fraudulent intent.  More people keep piling on, again, without sources and the downvotes keep coming.
Forgive me if I seem a little short.
And to top it off you're here criticizing me for brusquely demanding a source, instead of keeping to the topic at hand.  I assume it is a distraction from the fact that, for some reason, people can't handle the world-changing paradigm where it *isn't* illegal to destroy money, so they're attacking the messenger instead?
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:38:25
This is a myth and completely untrue.
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:13:06
Which is essentially unprovable.  It is a toothless law.  Unless you specifically state that your intent was to render it unfit to be reissued, no one will ever be convicted under this law.  Intent to commit fraud is much easier to prove.
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:15:23
You think that a criminal statute has more weight than the Constitution?  Hm, who was the idiot again?
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:59:00
It doesn't matter if the bill is unusable as a consequence of his actions.  It matters *what his intent was*.  
Please read about "general intent" vs. "specific intent".  If the law is "general intent" then the consequence or effect of the action matters.  If the law is "specific intent" then the consequence of the action doesn't matter - *only the intent*.
So again, whether the bill is fit or unfit doesn't matter.  It only matters whether his *specific intent* was to make the bill unfit, and this is impossible to prove.  In fact, the law is likely unconstitutional as is, but has never been tested, because no one has ever been convicted under this law.  The US only cares about forgeries and counterfeits.
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:05:47
So your argument is that people are being charged and convicted for a crime of defacing money without regard to the specific intent defined in the law?
Dude, show your sources.  Go ahead and link me to an instance of anyone ever being convicted under this statute that wasn't engaged in fraudulent / counterfeiting operations.

Make sure you read the whole thing before posting this.  Have you studied law?  *Every word matters* in a statute like this.
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:53:46
Yes, many crimes require the action of the crime itself *and* a "thoughtcrime".  It has a technical term: *mens rea*.  Look it up.  We definitely charge and convict people for many crimes based on the idea that we can prove what they were thinking before or during the commission of the act.
But let's talk more about proof, and introduce another legal term: reasonable doubt.  Proof in the legal system is almost never a 100% thing.  Proof that an event occurred can get close to 100% with a preponderance of evidence.  Proof of intent, or mens rea, can also get close but takes *a lot* more evidence, and can *never* be 100%.  That's why we have the idea of proving something, not beyond *any* doubt, but beyond a *reasonable* doubt.
So the thing about proving specific intent in a case of fraud, for example, is that it often requires a chain of illegal events, at with each step of the chain it becomes less likely that the accused was not knowingly acting with a criminal intent.  If someone wants to pass off counterfeit money, first they have to deface (or alter) the currency, or buy it from somewhere, *then* they have to actually attempt to exchange the counterfeit currency for goods or services.
The chain of events establishes intent because in most cases the evidence does't allow a juror to have reasonable doubt about the accused and *mens rea*.  If you find tools for altering bank notes in their home, and then you have proof that they used those same bank notes to buy something at an electronics store, who is going to reasonably believe that this person had some other intent than to defraud the store?
Counterfeiters also often work in teams, so this adds *conspiracy* to commit fraud to the list and makes intent easier to "prove", as a group of people will often be in communication with each other and spell out their intent in words, written or spoken.
But let's be clear, *even in cases of suspected fraud*, disputing the facts of *mens rea* is still a valid defense.  If I am caught buying something at one store with a fake bill, even if it is $1,000, I'm not likely to face charges.  Unless they also find the equipment and/or evidence of the process that I used to acquire those fake bills, I can easily claim that I was the unknowing recipient of fake bills *from someone else*.
*I'm not in trouble as long as I can create a reasonable doubt that I was not intending to commit fraud*.  Now, if they catch me again and again, at various stores, using the same fake bills, then they can start to produce a narrative of intent based on the pattern of my actions.
Now let's bring this back to the specific intent in the case of defacing money.  The problem is that there are *so many reasonable explanations* of why someone would deface money that a jury would definitely buy.  Unlike fraud, where there is no real good defense for why you tried to use fake money to buy real goods aside from "I didn't know it was fake", there are plenty of legitimate thought processes that can end at defacing money that don't require *malicious* intent.
That's why no prosecutor would ever take up a case under this statute, because they know it would be nearly impossible to convince a jury of specific intent, or the facts of *mens rea*, *unless* the accused incriminated themselves with direct evidence from their mind, like an admission of guilt.
All of this is why the defacing of money is effectively legally in the US, except for the case of fraudulent intent, and that's *before* we even get to the overlap of first amendment issues.  Because no one has ever been prosecuted under this statute, the law has never been constitutionally test, *but it would likely fail* for the same reason that flag burning is constitutionally protected.
*Even if* I was stupid enough, or brave enough, to admit that I destroyed money simply because I hated money and didn't want anyone else to be able to use it, though I *might* get charged then (depending on how much of a dick the prosecutor is, and probably also depending on how much money was involved), the case would likely get thrown out on constitutional grounds as a violation of my freedom of expression - assuming I had the time and money to fight it through the court system.
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:14:37
It's right there in the statute.  You have to prove intent.
If you don't understand that, and are unwilling to, then there's nothing more I can say to you.
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:13:42
You made the claim that people are being charged and convicted of violating this statute related to currency without regard to specific intent.  You can't show a single instance of that being the case.

people will be willing to spend once the value becomes stable.
which makes sense, really.
we are still trying to figure out the real-world value of digital currency.
once that "question" is answered, then it can begin to be used for real in the real world.
there is no real, useful, physical currency that has significant swings or jumps in value.  bitcoin must reach the same plateau before people feel "safe" enough to start using it as a real concern.  both safe that it won't drop and they'll lose all their money, and safe that it won't jump and they'll lose out on that future profit.

Serious question:
1. Is it wise to "daytrade" with BitCoin?  Say I bought at $1000.  Should I sell at $5000, keep all the money (don't spend it), wait for it to dip down to $3000 or $4000, then buy again?  Technically this wouldn't be "day" trading as I would probably have to hold the money for days or weeks or months before seeing a dip, but the point is, would it be stupid or smart to play the fluctuations of BTC?
2. Can I do this with Coin Base?
