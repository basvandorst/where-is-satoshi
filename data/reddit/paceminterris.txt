This is just pure victim blaming. "The thing that allows rapists to rape is the existence of pretty girls" - see how that sounds?

Have YOU not even gone to school? This is a classic "tragedy of the commons" situation, in which an individual stands to profit by sacrificing the community's well-being. ASIC miners don't necessarily care about the future of BTC, they just want to make a buck now. And as we've already seen by the statistic that some 300 wallets own 94% of all Bitcoin, centralization doesn't seem to be a problem.

BCH is the technologically superior version of BTC. By all rights and purposes it SHOULD be considered the "best" version of Bitcoin. All of you defending the archaic BTC technology are baghodlers desperately trying to keep the price up.

So you tip them a full tip in fiat, then match that tip with a BTC tip? Because that's the only way you can avoid looking like an asshole

Why do you care about the ATH? Why do you even care about the price if you're supposedly in it for the technology?

Ding ding ding! This is why Bitcoin is not a good store of value, and why it is classified as a SECURITY, rather than a CURRENCY.

It did. The fault inherent in BTC is that it has no utility beyond speculation, pump-n-dump and criminal activity.

You've obviously never met a teacher before. "Corporate trainer" is a completely different skillset than school teaching, and there's no market for freelance education in the fields school teachers are qualified to teach. 
Furthermore, you obviously don't realize that teachers are putting in 10-20 hours of unpaid overtime a week grading and developing lesson plans. There's no time for them to be running a side hustle like you so flippantly recommend.

Most people performing retail transactions *DONT GIVE A CRAP AT ALL* about your first two reasons.

You've never worked retail, have you? This will likely just get you annoyed cashiers. They MIGHT mention it to their manager, but moreso as a complaint. And I guarantee you it will go nowhere from there, unless the request volume is truly massive (it won't be).
You're better off trying to influence someone from corporate directly. Good luck with that.

I don't think one casino accepting BTC counts as "mainstream."

This was probably written by a male, who hired this girl (with fiat) to sing it for him.

I see you're a baghodlr desperately trying to break even so he can cash out
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:51:45
Just cause you keep insisting something doesn't mean it's true.

You can disagree with any assertion you want. Whether you are right is another story entirely.
