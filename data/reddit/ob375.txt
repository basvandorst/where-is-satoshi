Lol. It doesn’t make any sense to update multiple copies of a ledger everytime someone buys a latte at Starbucks.

Explain to me how a ledger that can only process 5 transactions a second for high fees is better than the Visa network that can process 65,000 a second for low fees.

It’s obviously a scam and a bubble. Perhaps this is the catalyst to take it down. You could be right.

This is a very good point. You are effed. Happened to so many people during the dot.com bubble.

Blockchain is more than the Darknet markets. 
But Darknet markets are pretty much the only use for crypto currencies. Moving money anonymously.

The problem is that crypto-currencies ARE scams, but blockchain technology has promise for use in many applications. So there really is no comeback.

How is it not. Buy some ETH give it to some ICO for shitcoin. ICO sells the ETH to another person looking to buy some other shitcoin. Everybody passing the Ether around at higher and higher prices until it collapses.  Only works because new money is coming in to buy ETH higher and play the next ICO.

ETH is 100% a Ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:07:23
ETH is the the ultimate Ponzi. Every new ICO requires funding in ETH. To play an ICO, you buy ETH and give is to some crook in exchange for some shitcoin. The crook sells it to someone else to play a someother ICO etc etc 
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:10:59
Lol. You forgot: start an ICO. Raise millions. Disappear. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:17:09
 I said the ICOs are shitcoin. The issue is you have to buy them with ETH. Hence the massive bubble. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:27:50
No. Because they are totally ponzi schemes.
"BTC and ETC are supply constrained and too expensive!"
"No problem, we can create unlimited supply via ICOs"
But the real problem is the ICO only accepts funding via ETH and BTC.
So you buy some ETH and give it to some crook to buy his shitcoin. 
He sells the ETH to some other idiot looking to buy some other ICO. Who sells it to another idiot looking to buy another scam ICO.
You can see where this goes. ICOs create unlimited supply, but bid ETH and BTC to do it, sending ETH and BTC to the moon.
Eventually, demand for ICOs dries up and the market crashes because the bid is GONE. Not to mention all the ETH and BTC the ICO sponsors have to sell to buy their lambos.
Now you are left with shitcoin, and the ICOs have your fiat and new lambos.
