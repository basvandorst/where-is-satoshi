Hi reactor and everyone else reading,
I'd like to chime in here for a moment. I'm the CMO and am the one who takes care of things like newsletters and social media and a lot of other stuff like credits for price drops which we promised our customers because we felt they were wronged (just as we were by Gridseed).
Here is the newsletter sent to ALL our customers' emails:
Stats of this email:
Here are the newsletters sent to ALL customers who signed up for the Gridseed Blade Price Drop Compensation Form and got compensated by CREDIT to their accounts instead of the actual product giving them the flexibility to put the credit either toward the same product we promised or toward any other purchase. I hope this is not considered a "lie" because we didn't give the actual product.
Stats of these emails:
I apologize that you probably didn't receive either email because you were not a customer until a few days ago or were due a compensation credit/miner. This is not mine or Josh's fault whatsoever.


This is completely incorrect considering our SHIP BY date guarantee means if you receive it and the shipped date which is STAMPED on the box by the courier is after the 26th, we will compensate you for every day after the 26th that it was SHIPPED. This does not mean it has to arrive by the 26th, nor does it mean we have HAD to provide tracking.

Thank you and have a wonderful day!
Edit: Change in formatting for the quote from reactor as it was copied from bitcointalk.org and that doesn't format well here :/
