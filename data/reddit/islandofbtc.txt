If it scales back to 5k then so be it.  Stop loss ftw
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:34:20
The prices of BTC and alts are pretty much tied behaviorwise, rn  I believe a sell off of any coins  means certain sell offs of the other coins.  Bitcoins price moves, alts price move similarly.

We arent talking about the Litecoin halvening that occurs in a few days.  When Litecoins comes to bat it always bats in Bitcoin.  No?  The HALVENING....
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:39:53

@_date: 2019-08-15 03:58:10
Recession = lowering interest rates and QE.  Hedge against inflation one may seek in bitcoin as a store of value not tied to an infinite money supply.  Check ya head.
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:31:47
Its all marketing.  Its just gonna be points on a gift card ultimately.
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:51:55
Lets all buy an island that only takes bitcoins.  All commerce would be done in crypto.  Does this exist in the future?
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:36:59
The best answer
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:16:26
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:04:06

@_date: 2019-06-29 23:17:14
Where is your store
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:24:29
That huge drop from 13.5 to 11.7 was scary.  It was very very scary.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:41:41
Yea whal3 droppings for sure
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:05:12
I feel like denominations can be important.  Satoshis would be an obvious one.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:37:58
For the tech, right?
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:37:54
How do u know
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:45:13
Poor nuggets
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:14:43
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:22:09
Tis true.  BTC has a sexy side and a nerdy side.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:08:39
I got 99 problemz but a bitcoin aint one
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:04:27
Nooooo.  This would be devastating!!!
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:36:47
BTC misses 12k like the desert misses the rain. ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:54:08
It did not goto 3500 overnight.  It took a period of time.  I do believe the top is no where near the final goal where 1 satoshi = 1 USD.
What do I know Im in love with a stripper.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:15:03
When you check it and it has moved from 12.4 to 12.2...all afternoon
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:36:26
That small drop will not even be on the 1yr charts.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:15:49
Just convinced mt owner to accept BTC?  Pleae tell me our business will double.  (Pizza too)
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:19:07

@_date: 2019-06-28 23:25:05
Chart noobs like me live for this shit.  Enjoy the voyage.
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:22:58
I feel as though crypto prices move relative to interest rates.  Does anyone feel this to be true?
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:33:35
Are we talking to technology now?
