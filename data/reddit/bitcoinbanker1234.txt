Are most of these sellers than just risking it or do they have front like businesses?  Many of the bigger sellers have been around multiple years and have thousands of transactions

So you would have to avoid those states if you didn't want to get the licenses.  Other than the Florida case does anyone know of someone getting arrested for selling bitcoins without a money transmitter license?

What about these large LBC sellers that have thousands of transaction over multiple years?  Do you think they are just risking it, since after doing more reading it is extremely unrealistic they have a money transmitter license?

Do all these companies have some special business licenses like liberty x and bitquick.co?  I don't sell drugs this is strictly a plan to try and make money

That actually isn't true, you can ship and even insure cash through USPS

It looks like you don't need a license in Illinois as well "Notice Regarding Virtual Currency Licensure
The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) has not yet made a determination as to the requirement of licensure of virtual currency (also known as crypto currency) providers, converters and/or exchangers, or dispensing machines (ATMs) but continues to review the matter. IDFPR is not accepting applications for virtual currency licensure at this time.
IDFPR recommends that all parties interested in virtual currency issues regularly monitor IDFPR's website for further updates. IDFPR will not penalize Applicants/Licensees for any virtual currency activity conducted in the State of Illinois during the deliberative process should it be determined that licensure is required."
