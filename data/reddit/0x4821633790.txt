I care..  I think it's a good idea and was thought provoking

You are talking about Mars, take your Cryptocurrency to Mars :)

Sounds like the citadel, I'm sold

What a cunt
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:17:46
Ok wanker (not you, op btw)
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:03:49


Made me smile
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:00:03
On the bright side, at least nothing of value was lost when you didn't get your BCH.
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:03:04
I thought my phone had 2% battery
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:06:56
Why is it called redeem Bitcoin? Is it a legal thing?
@_date: 2019-11-03 05:52:21
Satoshi Nakamoto, is that you?
@_date: 2019-08-28 03:00:41
I have no idea what I'm reading, is this random words stringed together?
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:40:26
I actually disagree with this, I think to repair a hard drive requires an expert a lot of the time. Unless you're trained and do it as a job you'll probably fail to repair a faulty drive
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:34:49
Umm excuse me that is a BCH logo. /s
Please feel free to downvote this shit post :( I hate BCH so much
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:43:30
Probably fake, "Founder of Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings" is not the same as "founder of bitcoin"

Looks like this photo was taken without their consent. That's the exact face and gesture I would make if someone came up to me and tried to sneak a photo on my day off.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:10:53
This probably sounds crazy but I'm only buying crypto  if it falls to $6000.
That's because I earn a small percentage of income in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:42:13
I can't wait for bitcoin to go on sale.
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:06:59
There's a crack in my phone's screen that intersects the golden cross, this is going to be a good month for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:20:07
More like Shitoshi Fuckamoto
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:29:40
Holy shit, why would they call you to tell you that? Imo they're your Bitcoins and you should be free to do whatever you like with them without answering questions. That's really annoying, sorry to hear you had that call
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:08:46
I didn't know this was @_date: 2019-10-11 03:26:27
I mean, there's the prophet and we all screenshot the prediction for proof.
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:43:28
I love this, I don't mind that it's silver. Definitely very smart to make the S resemble chains.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:52:46
Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto chose a name beginning with S on purpose because it will be the next evolutionary step to simply use the $ to represent 'S'atoshi. Considering it looks the same.
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:11:20
Well, I hate to say this but I bought the dip and it just happened to work out for me.
In general thought, the whale can get fucked.
@_date: 2019-10-08 10:41:43
This +1
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:17:07
Shitoshi Fuckamoto

We should build the citadel on either Mars or the moon
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:09:27
Update: I took the BTC
@_date: 2019-08-02 07:43:05
It should be possible to remove the ss stigma from this symbol, given enough time.
So far this is my favourite suggestion
@_date: 2019-08-31 04:42:08
My number is $6000, if it falls that low I'm buying a whole bitcoin.
But I'll never sell

When I read this the first thing that flashed into my mind was grumpy cat

Don't show this to r/btc, they still think it's not possible to buy coffee with Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:27:56
Uhhh what just happened?
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:25:59
This is amazing thanks for sharing. What does non-custodial wallet mean? I have learnt that I use a closed source, non-custodial wallet, feels like I should change that.
@_date: 2019-12-27 07:59:24
That is interesting. How come you're saving money anyway?
Im not attacking the idea of saving money, I can see that people need to do it if they want to buy a house for example.
@_date: 2019-12-26 08:43:49
So what are the pros for using traditional money that you can think of?
@_date: 2019-12-01 13:56:19
Can confirm, this is definitely him
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:35:17
Only proves BTC is not yet ready for small business adoption, BTC is still not possible to double spend if configured properly
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:32:33
The prophet lives!
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:23:02
I leave my Shitcoin Cash coins on the exchange for very long periods of time.
Someone pointed out we call  this a Canary Coin.
When my worthless BCH gets stolen, I know that my Exchange's account is successfully compromised
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:53:38
This is normal for BTC, no need to get excited now.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:35:17
I prefer to simply roll the dice to figure out how BTC is performing
@_date: 2019-12-28 10:06:01
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:45:58
Why do you believe in traditional money when you can see that it only devalues so much over time. Every year your dollar buys less and less.
I'm not saying BTC is better because every year 1 BTC buys you more and more. This isn't the goal or point of BTC and this trend may stop eventually.
Just please realise that the banks are not looking after you.
Please consider that the banks are a criminal organisation that is only going to keep you poor.
 Don't interpret that to mean BTC will make you rich either, it's possible that those days are gone. 
The point of BTC is to form a way that any two people can transfer wealth without the need to use a bank.
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:25:05
I wonder if 21mm is a nod to the number of Bitcoin in circulation.
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:00:14
You have a fantastic idea here, I would definitely use the feature, hands down.
@_date: 2019-09-01 07:35:41
I personally like that Bitcoin is currently wasting electricity, it is a good incentive for us to find a cheap (and hopefully clean) source of electricity. When that happens everyone will benefit.
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:33:33
I actually work 2 jobs.
One is entirely fiat, the other is entirely BTC
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:34:31
Is very nice.
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:14:57
I would not call this a crash, the fact is no one will be surprised when it suddenly jumps to $50k over night.
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:25:25
Just Google 'bitcoin' and thank me later.
@_date: 2019-09-10 06:30:48
Who typically sends gold on anyway? is it a pro Bitcoin person saying "keep up the good work" or a pro Shitcoin person saying "fuck you"?
@_date: 2019-09-08 13:29:45
Isn't America a shit hole now-a-days? I'd be moving to the Citadel if I were everyone.
@_date: 2019-09-04 08:40:29

No I don't think a token is necessary for what I have planned. It will be all ether.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:16:30
I have not spent a Sat, only stacking
@_date: 2019-09-11 10:37:57
"freeze" and "Bitcoin" shouldn't be able to be used in the same sentence, this is completely fucked who would use a central authority in this ecosystem.

I read the title as "Satoshis per cunt"
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:31:19
I even plan to report the earnings to the ATO
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:06:30
Oh well maybe I'll just sit on ETH for a bit longer, maybe have some fun with the dapps and call it my loss for not buying more BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:18:23
Yep those fees are too high, looks like BCH was correct all along, BTC is dead we can all go home.
Fuck off BCH
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:26:57
Dumb question, who does the US owe all this money to?
@_date: 2019-09-04 08:39:21
I think I'm sick, buying more bitcoin is my only option.
@_date: 2019-09-07 23:26:33
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:07:22
This is definitely a sign
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:55:48
I love guessing these for a bit of fun. My answer is a steady $15,000
@_date: 2019-09-11 08:28:07
So I think there are two ways forward, but I haven't seen an accountant yet to know for sure.
My understanding is that if this were classed as CGT, then I would only pay tax on it when it's sold.
But since this is really income then I assume I'll be paying tax on the AUD value that comes into my BTC wallet each week?
Personally I don't see the difference between earning Bitcoin and buying $x00 of BTC each week.
Also the plan moving forward is to never sell this BTC for at least another 30 years/ when the value becomes life changing.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:38:50
Ok I just tried to google the answer and it seems so complicated I double I'll even understand your answers haha.
Please ignore my question
@_date: 2019-09-21 00:30:56
My favorite piece of advice someone on Reddit once gave is: Don't ask if a vendor accepts Bitcoin, ask if they still accept USD and act relieved when they say they haven't transitioned to Bitcoin".
I wish I could find the source of who said this, I think it was meant as a joke but I take it literally.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:07:28
It's fiat converted to BTC at the time of payment.
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:11:32
You thought wrong
