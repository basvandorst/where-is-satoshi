if your in the money/banking business today you like regulation. you need regulation.  its the way to force the fees out of people.

been in bitcoin a long time and this has got to be the most bizarre thing ive seen.  clear market confidence, just chipping away at this thing, other exchanges sitting a few dollars above.. cant figure this one out....
edit: a few hours later ...aaaand here we go. :)

thats what we'd expect right? he got it to drop the first few times he put it up, seemed like typical manipulation...  but manipulate then just sell?  this is why im confused.  if u want to get rid of some coin this doesnt seem like the best strategy, especially with all this buying pressure.  maybe its satoshi being nice?  someone trying really hard to keep the price down i guess.

centralized power attracts and usually ends in corruption. they're squeezing the system and citizens are starting to get a bit annoyed hopefully. unfortunately it seems this fight is just escalating. good thing we don't have to fight with the use of force anymore. 
read this in someones post the other day, love it.

hard to think of another explanation right? did u see vorhees' comment earlier today? you only put up a wall like that if you want to scare ppl.. definitely seemed like it at the time, but this guy is not scaring/manipulating, he's cashing out. pretty stoked on the response to this wall.  okcoin, huobi, bifinex, theyre all 10 - 15 dollars over stamp right now..   wall is under 14k already, wonder how many buyers are trying to get funds to stamp? is this not a clear sign that there is demand for bitcoin? 
.... and because of all this... still so confused as to why this guy keeps the order up. who knows..

i appreciate all the people who like this. i went to bed tonight a little drunk and as usual staring at the charts.. i just drew this up quick, couldn't stop looking at it after though. its hilarious, but its also got some interesting things in it. maybe it has to do with my whole experience with bitcoin...
i was living in my friends parents attic when i first discovered bitcoin. was around $10 at the time. i remember i was so excited about it. i also remember the cliche everyone else around me saying ponzi, scam, who cares... few day later it was $20 dollars. this is when i first bought bitcoin. i remember telling my friend just put a 100 bucks in see what happens. the potential upside is so big its worth it. she liked the idea but never bought.  a few days after that bitcoin was at 35 and i did what everyone online was telling me what not to do. don't invest more than u can afford to lose. i sold my car, i sold everything basically. all into bitcoin.  i remember one night i was walking to a bar leaving the house the price was around 90. i get there and meet my friends and show them and its at 115. and a few minutes later its 135. very exciting stuff. 260 thing happens. i had no idea what i was doing at the time and watched it crash. held. hodl. 
fast forward. i made some more money that summer and put it all into coin right after that little silk road crash. had 120 coins then i think. then boom. holy shit. going out with friends and casually checking the phone under the table and seeing my balance.. 60k.  80k.  all the sudden i have over 120 thousand dollars in my front left pocket. i mean space. inter web.  
i remember two things very well from that peak. one was seeing the 120k value of my coins. the other was the comment made by this trader i was following, in a chat room with, who said something about a double top and if this isn't a obvious sell idk what is.... 
i didn't sell. i liked coin more than fiat. after a run like that it had to be better right? were going to 10k right? so crash. I'm like ehh we'll be fine. 80k is sweet. partied a lot during this time. bought a car. life was good but i knew it was withering. and i knew i was doing the hopium thing. i was cocky and traded alt i mean shit coins. had 100k blackcoins at one time. woke up one morning as saw them worth a shitload. why didn't i just sell?  anyway those coins were kept at that exchange cryptorush.. those r gone, unfortunately. never bought doge. made a few good moves here and there. mostly luck tho. 
u wanna hear luck? i had 40 bitcoins in gox. heard some ppl saying get out.. so i withdrew. one day goes by. then two. usually when i do this i see the thing processing within a half hour. I'm so fuckkkkdd. day three or four coinbase emails me saying i just received coin. gox went down a few days later. that was nice. sorry to all those who lost money there.
that whole mentality of not wanting to sell at a loss really fucked me.  buy when theres blood in the streets they said. i guess i was so sure things would turn around i just decided id hold and things would work out. like they always do.....
well fuck. here i am. my 100k party days are no more. no more renting astons. no more white horses. however. i have learned so much over the last couple years. man do i wish i was the me now back then when i saw that 120k number just sitting there on my little 4s screen. but honestly id rather take the knowledge/wisdom I've gained than the money.  i think of it as an expensive learning lesson. bargain compared to the college thing i suppose. 
been a fun few years. i love bitcoin. i love what it can do to this world. and i like the community that supports it. 
i think ill buy some more bitcoins now. bbands tight af.
