I love change tip and sending a few cents around. Seems to get some people thinking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:21:08
I agree 100%!
Edit: the agreement is for not being assholes to the VP but we still need to express our concerns.

I use Coinbase and have everything set up there since it is the easiest way to buy BTC right now (for me at least). That being said; the second my BTC can be transferred out I do so. I even stay logged in until I can take out the BTC. (I have it set up to allow "instant buy" so I normally get my BTC in about 20-30 minutes).

Just got myself a Ledger Wallet; I like it a lot. I keep the bulk of my coins there for now since paper wallets always seemed like one mistake way from losing the mass of my stash. Ledger Wallet has a retrieval process in case you lose the hardware wallet.

That's awesome! I started with Ubuntu back in the summer of 2011 and have not had windows on my rig since then.

Thanks for pointing this out. I'll check it out and update the averages ASAP.

This document uses the equation for annual growth rate percentage over multiple years.  
The equations is: P = [(f/s)^(1/y)] - 1 (see cell E2 in the main sheet)  
--- "P' is price, "f" is current BTC price, "s" is the BTC price from 2 years ago, "y" is the number of years (2 in our case)  
"Close" - the price at the end of the day exactly two years ago (this is automated by Google Sheets)  
"Actual" - the price on December 31st of each year as displayed by "BTCUSD" (fetched by Google Sheets)  
"Projection" - the price after each calculation, year over year.  
Averages have been calculated ahead of time; but do to lag in Drive I have chose to only keep the newest average tab.

1. When I say refine I mean that as time goes on we will have more years that we can use to get a better picture of the annual growth rate. The growth rates you see is the correct growth rate per year over the past two years. (It would be much higher i used the past 3 or 4 years) 
  
2. The growth equations is correct and i am sure of that; what I am not sure of is people and their opinion of bitcoin. Bitcoin could easily go back to $1,000 tomorrow for any number of reason or be at $100.  
  
3. The chart is a prediction of what bitcoin could be in the future. I by no means know for sure the exact price that bitcoin will be in 2020 but as the chart shows if the growth continues at it's current pace it will be as stated.  
  
edit: typos

The BTC info is coming from Google, not 100% sure of their source but doing a simple search for "btcusd" will give several options.  
  
I'll be sure to reply to you once I figure out a way to implement the yearly average.  
  
Thanks for all your support and ideas!
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:13:51
For sure! Looking forward to that day :)

"Actual" is the price at the end of the day on December 31st of that year. (i'm not sure what timezone it is since I am letting Google get the prices for the automation part)  
  
"Projection" is simply the current growth over the past 'x' number of years added to the previous year.  
[the growth equation: =((A2/C2)^(1/D2))-1]  
  
Let me know if you have any ideas to make this chart better or any other questions.

The price is down today (August 25, 2015) and the chart has updated nicely to reflect the new 2 year average.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:22:38
I like that idea! I'll see what I can do
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:30:09
1. 2015 projection is an estimate at what it could be at the end of the year.  
2. Yes, you saw correctly. If the growth is 50% then the projected price will be the actual price plus the 50%.  
3. Years is just a year. Nothing special going on there. Close is the price at the end of the day exactly two years ago, yes.  
4. Growth per year is calculated from a very common equation and that can be found under the information tab.  
I agree with you. As long as bitcoin can stick around the price could very easily be 20k at some point in 2025.  
  
Please feel free to ask anything. I am always trying to make the sheet better.

Lingo will catch on as adoption does; the internet has new terminology and no everyone uses it without thinking anything.

I'm running 0.11.0 too. I like to stay up to date :)
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:22:12
hahah that's awesome; I hope to (as time goes on) refine this chart more and more to get the best projection reading possible.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:01:32
I agree, that exit node problem is kind of a big deal.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:48:08
I added the 3 year just for fun; it may be more useful in a few years.

I have been using Ledger wallet the mulitsig functionality via my mobile. (not sure if it is true multi-sig but i can't spend them without authorizing the transaction on my mobile first).  
  
But I also don't have 100 bitcoin to store so...
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:08:17
I am one of those nodes running /Satoshi:0.11.0/  
And I will say there is a sense of pride in helping out the network.

Bitcoin for sure; silver is also pretty cheap right now for how rare it is these days. Might be a good idea to get a few ounces, hell, maybe even some gold (i'm to cheap to pay for gold though lol)
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:24:08
Thanks! A friend of mine shared it to there as a good deal of bitcoin haters that replied with only one user actually giving any kind of good info. Other than that I have been receiving some great feedback in person.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:24:33
I'll run some tests and see what comes out. However if the starting value is lower than the current value it will have a negative growth rate and eventually lead to zero.
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:35:12
Got the averages worked out; it was a bit time consuming the first time but now I can just copy the original and just change the year. Thanks again for the idea :)
@_date: 2015-09-04 10:06:19
Graphs are my next step; it will add a more visual element.
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:30:12
well now i got the first section fixed and the second one broke. lol not sure why this is so unstable all of a sudden.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:34:54
Looks like all the Google Finance errors have solved themselves.
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:53:24
Sure man! More help the better!  
I am also thinking of adding some graphs
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:59:50
Hey I'm still around :)  
I still have to get those graphs into the sheet
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:17:59
send 1 bit
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:21:48
Added :)  
  
However at the time I am writing this Google Finance is not loading the data for the original column... (Yearly average growth is working fine though)
