Noob related question:
I have a Ledger Nano S.   I have my BTC in the Legacy wallet.  How do I switch them to the Segwit wallet?   Will there be a few to transfer from one of my wallets to another? 
I am just HODLing, so I don't see a reason to move them,  but I do want to do my part,  however I can. 
Any advice? 
Edit: 
I see you addressed my concern in your post.  Thank you.

I think this is a big part of why we are seeing endless wars and new wars being picked/egged on right now.  The US and its oligarchy needs the business of war to maintain solvency and productivity.
We are seeing the breakdownwn now.  It's messy as fuck.  Look at both of the major parties.  They are a fucking mess.  
I also see the tax bill as a way hindrances wealth upwards as the value of the US dollar and economy thins out.

The upcoming tax breaks combined with low interest rates, along with an increase in US government spending (i.e. Increasing debt) is setting up inflationary conditions for the US dollar.

Keep telling yourself that.  Voting is a joke here in the US.   Maybe some minor, local representatives are influenced by popular voting, but most officials are selected by real estate investors,  banks,  and other large,  powerful lobbies.   The people 'vote' for their pick.

I don't think votes are being significantly manipulated, not directly. 
I think people are being manipulated on various levels. I agree...  Too much intentionally poor information and information processing,  aka lack of critical thinking.

I'm not sure about MyCelium.
Hardware wallets are considered some of the most secure ways to hold.  The device is protected regardless of whatever device it's connected to.  The apps are all browser-based and open source.  You can use them even in a hacked/compromised device,  according to the company (Ledger).
