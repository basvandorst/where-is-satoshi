I’m at BTC bull so chill yourself out. BTC at $100 was nothing significant in significance in the global currency environment. There was no business or consumer impact. 
Bitcoin currently is beginning to break through the ceiling where global finance and global technology is beginning to take it seriously. It has to continue to shock others to pay attention and develop further to gain more mainstream adoption. 
If access to convert from fiat to BTC became severely hampered, then the reversal will happen. It may to back to being a niche currency but there won’t be widespread adoption

Yeah I deal with KYC AML stuff daily and it’s something regulators take very seriously.  I don’t understand why people plug their ears about it

Give me a break everything would change if instructions and rookie investors would be too scared or careless to go down the rabbit hole of shady online exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:53:25
That’s a dumb comment and totally incorrect

Is code language? As in, protected by the first amendment?
How could you outlaw the expression of a private key, which is basically just letters and numbers which can access a database? Nothing about it is physical

Oh boo-hoo the govenment shut down an entity which dealt in the exchange of illegal drugs on the internet. God damnit Obama!

Okay, then what wallet Mr. I know everything?

My limit orders set at $8900 and $9k went through. I checked because I went to cancel them when BTC was going from 11k down fast and was surprised to see BTC moving $50/ sec

Lmk if you get an answer

Oh noes, the big bad bank. Those millions and millions of people around the world, they're so EVIL!
Shut the fuck up you have no idea what you're talking about. The $$$ is the most valuable asset in the world. The world moves because of the dollar.

Alright I bought my first coin off them a few days ago. What should I do? Make my checking account balance below 500? I bought 700 of btc and 500 of eth today
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:13:50
Ok thanks. In the event btc begins to soften as it just has, an I able to cancel a pending order with coinbase after it's made?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:06:14
Newbie here. I just purchased $1500 through coinbase of btc and eth. What should I do? June 1 was my close date
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:54:50
I need to pick a wallet to go with, it's not a ton of money so I don't need a cold storage, super secure solution yet. But if you could recommend me a newbie option or point me in a direction that would be great!

You're still not getting it. If there's a massive global upheaval and the very foundation of basic structures begin to collapse - fiat currency, tech companies which create and maintain the worlds digital economy will suffer. All of these exchanges have a ton of issues  with a fraction of the volume of the NYSE 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:20:11
Nah, the company I work with is a large corporate entity that's beginning to get into Blockchain. I don't think it's worthless, but people here praise bitcoin as the new currency to end all currencies. And that's absolutely not true. 
 Bitcoin won't mean anything to the world unless its mass adopted. Not saying it won't. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:27:40
Yes you can. You sell the Deutsche stock and it takes .000000001 seconds to fill. You then use the $$$$ or ££££ or €€€€ to buy what ever the fuck you want. 
Do not begin to argue, because you're wrong

Okay, somewhat serious post. I am a noob, been getting educated as fast as I can. I work in banking so I know a little about finance. But every subbreddit  I find is 90% memes and garbage comments and 10% interesting analysis and provoking comments. 
Where can I find somewhere that's 90% provoking comments and less people memeing ?

My only complaint with Gemini is not being able to use a QR code to transfer out of the exchange into a wallet

Norges has $40bn in Real estate investments end of 2016, per their 2016 real estate report. That's global, primarily US, London and Paris. US made up 50% of the Fund. 
They have 34 office and 358 logistic properties. 
I've been to every country is SE Asia, with exception to a very few. Look at the construction boom in downtown LA, a lot of it is Chinese investment funds building mixed use, condo and multifamily

Coinbase, Goldman Sachs, or Snapchat have the right to do whatever they want and skirt any laws they want around the world. 
But in US law, they will pay the consequences. And these consequences include being sanctioned by the United States Treasury, which basically would ensure no other first world country would bank or work with a company sanctioned by the US government. Guess where the worlds money flows through?
The US
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:02:24
Fair enough, it's Norways sovereign wealth fund worth about $1T. Singapores wealth fun is abot $800bn I think. They invest a lot in US real estate and I know because I see their transactions all the time. 
And I've been to 20 countries so don't tell me I'm ignorant about the world. I've even lived in one of the countries mentioned above
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:07:34
The US Treasuries market is stupidly enormous. A stupid amount of foreign money flows into US equities market and the US real estate market. You don't see the same inflows to Japan, for instance.

First of all, you can't buy or sell bitcoin on the street in any reasonable way. So stfu. 
Second of all you can owner fractional shares of stock if you receive dividends as reinvestment. So you're still wrong. 
And again, why would anyone trade stock from John to jimmy? You sell it on the open market and receive cash, which is the only thing that matters. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:19:05
What? Do some research about Norges Bank or other country's funds investing in US real estate. It's an enormous amount of money because yields are so low around the world. 
Us a world police? That's a improper way of thinking about the worlds most important economy driving influence around the world in every aspect.

I work on a floor with traders who sell securities. Let me tell you again you have no clue what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:37:13
The value of gold is somewhere near 5-7 trillion. Someone tell me how bitcoin could ever become relatively comparable? Gold has value. You can melt it and use it for things that people use, wear, and consume. It's a store of wealth. 
So someone, tell me how bitcoin is better? Because i haven't heard any good argument other than "BITCOIN IS L33t NOOB"
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:45:20
Crypto is becoming viewed as a real asset and can be traded as a security. 
to do so you have to follow Anti money laundering laws. 
Plenty of companies did business in the us, and were based abroad that got fined by the US govt in the last 10 years
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:53:29
Your answer was terrible dude. Crypto is a currency barely 10 years old. Inflation has existed for centuries. Why don't you take a look at a history book.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:59:35
lol wut? No counterparty risk? How about mt gox? Or exchanges like coinbase crashing 
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:08:14
If bitcoin was worth $100,000 a coin, then why would anyone spend it? What becomes its use if people only hoard it? Don't understand

What happens if your phone gets stolen?
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:21:07
I mean are there ways in which the selling and buying of bitcoins can bring about ad revunes, products to be sold, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:47:21
There's very low fees so I'm assuming there's no 'middle man' correct, like a brokerage?
