The fact that people here imply that 1 BTC is equivalent to 1 Lambo because there's 2.2 billion untapped customers is fundamentally flawed. Look at everyone here complaining about how they can't get BTC at the moment because Coinbase won't validate them or XX exchange is currently offline. What does that tell you? That tells you that their access to cryptocurrencies is controlled by more than their access to a smart phone.

I'll wait until BTC has some sort of tangible utility before I buy in. The blockchain has a number of interesting applications but I'm not sure it suits a currency. From a financial sector perspective I see it more likely that the blockchain will facilitate a decentalised stock market rather than a decentralised currency.

The easiest person to scam is someone that is trying to run a scam. Tether has only been able to get away with this stunt for so long because people are greedy and are trying to use it to avoid the tax man. The interesting thing to watch will be how fast the exchanges pull support for USDT when it all starts turning to custard. I'm guessing they have their own stop loss in place which means if USDT drops below around US$0.95 they'll suspend trading and their customers will be left holding the bag. Can't convert USDT to crypto and can't cash out to USD.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:19:04
US customers are already supposedly excluded from trading in USDT so what does it have to do with them?? The whole point is that they don't control cryptos and therefore don't provide much oversight/regulation either.

The issue is not hiding crypto. The issue is converting crypto to and from fiat currency. If someone is happy to be paid in crypto and to keep the crypto then they can do it in the middle of New York. The headache is how do you convert that crypto back into fiat currency without anyone noticing? Sure, if you want to live in some country without KYC controls then you're fine. If you still want to live in New York then you have a problem.

Only on the tether backed exchanges as people attempt to flee tether for crypto (they can't convert to USD as Kraken is the only exchange that offers USDT to USD and that won't last very long on a run). At some point the tether exchanges will either go insolvent or dark at which point tether will be effectively worth $0.00. From that point you'll then see the decline of crypto values. Whether that is fast or slow, who knows??

It's because crypto is a method of money laundering that is potentially lossless. That is if you convert US$1M into a crypto you can convert it back into US$1M without necessarily taking a hit. This is not true of other avenues such as casinos or a front business. Combine this with the fact that the volatility in the market gives an excellent means of justifying unexplained wealth which is the whole point of money laundering. The only other markets that give this sort of opportunity are property, stocks and currency trading and all of these are heavily regulated. As there is more liquidity in the crypto market then the problem will only get worse as it will be easier and easier to hide.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:47:12
The only crypto I have is for testing the tech. Nothing of supposed value. As soon as USDT drops the entire market will collapse because the exchanges will have to suspend all trading. The big ones rely on USDT directly and the smaller ones won't have the liquidity to handle the run. Will be interesting to watch.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:31:59


Depends on your scale, If you're only looking at the last 7 days then this is correct. However, if you look at the last 3 months then it is definitely bouncing lower. As soon as it escapes the denial phase and hits the fear phase, the drop will be something else. The other problem is that Tether has introduced systemic risk. It is not easy to convert BTC into fiat which means people will initially try to use USDT as a safe haven but this will expose the mirage. At that point the wheels will really fall off as the exchanges will collapse. Harvard business school is going to have years of material out of this little adventure.

BTC is nothing like real estate. Real estate goes up in value because each year there are more people that need somewhere to live. Proof is the Japanese property market - population declines therefore demand declines therefore price declines. What exact utility does BTC serve other than letting people gamble without feeling guilty for gambling?
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:06:48
Are you being deliberately obtuse? Over the last 3 months you can see the climb (higher lows and volume on price rise) to the ATH in December and now the inverse is occuring. The highs are getting lower and the volume is on the price drops. That's what 3 months will show you.

The question was somewhat rhetorical. The utility of blockchain technology vs the utility of Bitcoin are two very different things.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:17:02
Exchanges are a trusted third party just like your bank is in old fashioned fiat land. So when when you "bought" BTC on coinbase all that happened was you got a ledger entry on their system and a commitment from coinbase that says we'll let you control X number of their bitcoins. Until you transfer those bitcoins to your wallet, you don't really own them and there is no record of any transaction on the blockchain. To get a transaction on the blockchain = US$10. This is one of the fundamental flaws of BTC, in that it is a resource constrained network. This is the reason you can't buy things with gold any more, the cost of the transaction made it unusable. The BTC community knows this but now you've got two equally dumb responses to it. One is that BTC is not a currency but is instead a store of value (except it has no other utility) and the other is lightning network (a complex technical solution that will cause centralised payment processors). Fun to watch though.
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:35:05
Store of wealth is important but the vehicle you do that with has to have some other utility to support demand. Gold is valued as store of wealth for three reasons. It is difficult to acquire, it is practically impossible to destroy and there is demand for it as a metal. You need all three of those things to drive value. BTC doesn't really meet any of those criteria, let alone all three.
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:12:45
I don't think that was a compliment. You should feel insulted and upset, not appreciative. I feel offended that you have demonstrated the incorrect emotion in response. Oh wait, was that communication of gratitude sarcasm too?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:28:07
Your definition of "store of wealth" appears to be in terms of a currency and BTC has already demonstrated that it does not work as a currency.
A more logical argument as to the value of BTC is that trading crypto is a game that people can play. Everyone thinks they can win using whichever strategy they choose (hodl, TA, buy the dip etc etc). The reality is of course that the masses are being exploited by the few. I mean, who in their right mind thinks USDT is legit. The greedy, that's who.
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:16:31

Don't worry, I don't "own" a single satoshi. As I said, it is in an interesting experiment in human behaviour.
In terms of difficulty to acquire, that is debatable as it is based on a human construct rather than any physical barrier and relative to the number of people trying to acquire it. As far as difficult to destroy, that is completely false. It is very difficult, although not theoretically impossible, to destroy proof that it existed but it is very easy to destroy. Just ask anyone that has lost a private key or thrown out a hard drive about how easy it is to destroy.
BTC is a speculative bubble that is really interesting to watch as, unlike tulips, it has no utility.
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:08:35
Nice theory but you have one small flaw in it. What utility does BTC have other than a store of wealth? The only thing driving demand for BTC is speculation. There are solutions emerging that utilise blockchain concepts that will likely prove useful and therefore valuable but the concept that BTC specifically is valuable because it is valuable is just odd.
BTC is an interesting experiment in human greed and psychology but unless you use BTC is protect you from the weather, feed you, transport you etc etc then it has no real purpose. The only potential use was as a currency but it has already failed at that. Plus the concept of a global currency is crazy because localised currency is an important factor is market control and insulation. People seem to think Venezuela or Turkey prove the value of BTC but in reality is just shows the danger. Just look at Greece and the EU for examples of how having a common currency was part of the problem rather than part of the solution.

In theory you can convert it back into USD at any time. As long as people believe that then it will stay close to US$1 through arbitrage. The price you see now is the market applying a risk factor on whether Tether is 100% backed or that you can actually redeem it for USD.
The reality is that like most things, Tether is trading on confidence and if confidence is lost then the value of Tether will collapse. If Tether.io actually had the US$2.x billion dollars needed then someone could make a lot of money as the price drops but the reality is that they probably have 10% of that (like most banks/ponzi schemes) and even if they did have it, there's no way either them or the bank(s) they're using/conning are going to give it up.
The more interesting thing is to see what the collapse of Tether does to the price of BTC. If there is a somewhat orderly exit from Tether (this is what is happening right now) and the position is unwound then when it does collapse the impact may not be significant. But if Tether lets go in a hurry, and it probably will, then expect to see some carnage. BTC is yet to prove it's worth as anything more than a gambling platform and if people don't think they can win at any odds then they probably won't want to play the game.

You do realise that of the dot points you've listed, only the last one is actually possible with BTC at the moment and who would want it.
* Low cost transfers - as long as there is no volume
* Pay anyone - the number of businesses accepting BTC is falling plus who wants to wait minutes/hours/days for payment confirmation
* BTC is not private, with your address I can see your entire spending history. Welcome to the immutable ledger.
* Porn - see dot points 2 and 3
* Gambling - BTC is unregulated gambling with a lot a dodgy players involved and loaded dice.
* Paying people - that's fine as long as the purchasing power is stable. At the moment if you were to use BTC is money then you're be experiencing hyperinflation.
In terms of merchants using BTC, you've got two major hurdles there. Firstly, the blockchain does not scale well. This leads to things like lightning network and the lightning network will just lead to centralised payment processors (like VISA or Paypal) who will charge fees, give credit etc etc. The other issue is money laundering and tax avoidance.

The problem is that Bitcoin mining works like normal mining. When margins are high then you get all sorts of players in the game. However, when margins get tight then all the little guys get squeezed first because they don't have the economies of scale. This then causes further consolidation as the big guys swallow up the little operations. Thus, the next time there is a boom the market is more centralised.
Same thing is happening with Bitcoin mining. Whilst the margins on mining were high, every man and his dog was having a go and mining was decentralised. As this squeeze continues, the smaller operators, or operators with high overheads, are going to get squashed and hash power will centralise on to just a few players. 
That's the reality and another reason why Bitcoin just can't scale effectively.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:30:45
As I said, lightning network will just cause centralised payment processors but without the protections that VISA or Paypal provide.
As for your last statement, that's just simple ignorance. I'm not going to pay you unless I know who you are and I can't pay you without your address. From that point on I know both how much BTC you hold and how you spend it. If that information if valuable then there will be a market for it. The only way to try to protect your identity is to use a third party service (eg online wallet or mixer) but then these are just great big honey pots.

You're mixing perspectives. If you look at the price at the moment, that is purely based on Bitcoin as a speculative gamble. The other perspective is to look at Bitcoin as a commodity and in that view Bitcoin is pretty much worthless. It does not function as a currency and as the past year has shown, it is a terrible store of wealth.
So, if you wish to gamble and like the odds at $4xxx then buy some. If you don't like the odds at $4xxx then don't. But don't say $4xxx is cheap. $4xxx is only cheap if the alternative is more expensive but for there to be an alternative, Bitcoin would have to have some sort of practical utility.

Really? Of the companies that still exist from that time, the one's that lead the charge, like Cisco and Yahoo!, have never recovered. Microsoft didn't boom as much but it still took them 17 years to get back to their ATH. Apple doesn't count because it didn't boom at all and Alphabet (Google) didn't exist. Amazon got caught up in the hype at the time but the chances of you picking that stock and holding it from 2000 are pretty slim.

Because as the price rises, the bigger players can increase their hashing capacity in line with price and thus keep smaller players out of the market.

Step 1 - Create a wallet
Step 2 - Pick an option
Option 1: Give someone your wallet address so they can donate some BTC to you - good luck
Option 2: Start mining, if you have a good graphics card you may have something useful in about 6 months but will probably cost a fortune in power and you'll have to buy a new GFX card as it will be toast.
Option 3: Go on one of the local trading websites and offer to buy some. Expect to pay a heavy premium for them and also be ready to be scammed out of your cash or robbed.
Option 4: Register on an exchange (may not be possible in your country/some exchanges are closed to new members) which can take weeks; Once you're registered - send them your cash and hope it turns up on the exchange; If you actually get cash into the exchange you can then place buy orders and hope they actually get filled correctly. If you then want to use those BTC you'll have to pay a fee to transfer them back to that wallet from Step 1. Then sit on them because there's not really much else you can do with them.

If your only utility for BTC is value relative to USD then yes it is a zero sum game. Gold has a lot of utility outside a store of value and can be used to generate income.

Ooh, ooh, I know this. What is Apophenia? I love Jeopardy, give us another one.

Yep, Binance's Stablecoin Market is not a way to use customers to deleverage out of USDT at all. Fully legit.

Are you saying the price will increase because there are more people that want the price to increase?
In terms of the ecosystem, what has improved because from where I sit it looks like it has gone backwards? The last bull run attracted every fraudster and con artist into the market, mining has become more centralised, exchanges have been shown to be rather suspect and apparently there is a now a need for so called stable coins which seems to contradict the supposed purpose of Bitcoin.

Yep, Bitmex, Bitfinex and Binance are 100% legit.

There are no definitive answers to your questions. If you view BTC as an asset class then the value is purely based on it's utility is a decentralised immutable ledger. To date that ledger has primarily been used as a method of speculative gambling with a bit of money laundering thrown in.
If you view BTC as a currency then value is even more subjective as it basically conflicts with all of the principals that modern economies are built on. Thus for it to become a fully functioning currency in it's own right you'd have to tear down society and start again.

And that's why there will be no ETF's and no institutional investors. Any unregulated markets of significance is invariably corrupt. A pension fund is not supposed to be used for gambling in a fixed game.

Cheap is relative so what are you comparing Bitcoin to that indicates it is cheap?

I suspect they'll probably have more luck with русский.

Sure, Goldman Sachs currently owns between $10B and $30B worth of crypto. Makes perfect sense.

USDT != USD

So basically the best scenario is centralised mining then?

What's fascinating is that as societies face democratic challenges they are drawn towards authoritarian states.

I'm confused, what is going to happen in the next year that you're excited about? Another price bubble? What exactly caused the last ATH?
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:45:06
But BTC is never going to be a currency so the comparison is invalid. BTC is a traded asset class and thus it requires exchanges to enable broad market involvement. Unregulated exchanges are just like unregulated airlines, it never ends well.

Why are the cryptocurrencies so highly correlated? This pump occurred across almost all of the top 100 currencies and all started within about 2 minutes of each other.
