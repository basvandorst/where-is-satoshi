This is my opinion of him as well. Here he is on [Let's Talk Bitcoin]( in September, just days after the IPVO launch. He was confident, articulate and obviously very ambitious.
And here is one of his last [tweets] ( just before he got up and left.
Hard to believe it's the same person, yet that's the kind of person we had to deal with.

Many newcomers today, very social atmosphere. Bitcoin Traveler Felix announced that pizzas were from donations and everyone was very thankful, so I thought I'd share.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:39:49
You mean by trading bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:30:11
Will do!
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:59:05
Yeah, they suck but not as much as pesticides
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:04:37
This is fantastic news. With Neo and the University of Nicosia leading the way, Cyprus will become a world center for bitcoin adoption and innovation.
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:08:28
Thank you!

I think a return to the pound is absolutely necessary, but I also believe it should coexist with the Bitcoin. A new Cyprus pound would be devalued very quickly and so Bitcoin, an international currency, would be more stable and have a higher value. Both are needed to jump start the economy.

For one, Bitcoin has shown to be a good storage of value, despite its volatility. Also, they will have an incentive to convince their suppliers to accept Bitcoin as well. Lastly, and if it catches on, its use will spread to the market. Hypothertical, I know, but remember: many people in Cyprus have limited access to euros. They need a new currency to get things going again. Why not Bitcoin?

You are more than welcome to visit our Forum on May 25. Thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:28:49
I am in no position to do such thing, but I like the idea!
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:10:16
I've been active on twitter and blogging about it. But bitcoin still seems like a hard sell to people who equate money with bank paper.
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:16:46
Can you come to the bitcoin forum in Nicosia this Saturday to talk about it? Me and others who have little knowledge of bitcoin would like to know more.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:21:15
Farmers produce some products that are easy to ship and do not spoil easily (honey, herbs &amp; spices, etc). I will get in touch with farmer coops and invite them to the forum. Small farmers would much rather sell these products directly to consumers rather than retailers; bitcoin would be perfect for them.

Cash can be taken out, but only 1000 at a time per person.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:17:18
Summer harvest is coming, get your bitcoins ready!
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:35:52


Amen, brother

I appreciate the interest! I'm in the process of finding a crew to shoot a documentary this month for which I will seek donations. I will visit cafeterias, bars, souvlaki shops, produce sellers, convenience stores etc, and ask them if they accept Bitcoin. It's likely that most won't even have a computer or a smartphone in their stores, but it'll be fun and entertaining. At least we'll get the word out and bring Bitcoin into the mainstream.
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:12:01
There's only one person in Cyprus selling bitcoins for cash. If there's demand for it in the next days, this could be an opportunity for anyone holding bitcoins. Electronic bank transfers are unavailable in Cyprus and will be at least until Tuesday.
@_date: 2013-03-21 09:38:31
I could send you a picture from a Cypriot ATM :)
@_date: 2013-03-21 11:03:55
Maybe :) I'll let you know.
@_date: 2013-03-18 07:02:44
Done! Now if only I could buy bitcoins and someone to trade with.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:05:18
That's some good advice, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:26:53
I had a presentation prepared for hydroponics this weekend, but I will definitely open a discussion about bitcoin. Thank you for the tip, my very first bitcoin amount!
@_date: 2013-03-18 09:02:44
I downloaded and synched my bitcoin wallet. 
I've been promoting the idea on my twitter account ( and people here in Cyprus are definitely open to it. I think donating 0.01BTC to anyone who opens a new account as an incentive would get more people interested. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:20:40
I can see how this would be good... in theory. In practise, there is no way to enforce such a plan. How can we determine that a product or service is only for local use?
Plus, there will be no "my people" that will do my bidding. People will set their own prices and really, that's the whole point of introducing a competing currency into an economy: to get everyone to evaluate prices and determine which currency is in their interest to use for any given transaction.
But I feel Bitcoin pricing issues are still too early to discuss with any confidence. Firstly, we need to bring Bitcoins into Cyprus and get them circulating.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:24:01
Glad to hear it!
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:16:42
That would be assuming the value of the euro would diminish as the use of bitcoin increases. There's no such correlation.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:06:28
Thank you!

These are all very valid concerns which I share as well and do not have the answers to. I have opinions that I will gladly share, but I feel I need to clarify something. I am not suggesting that everyone in Cyprus go exchange their euros for bitcoins tomorrow morning. What I am suggesting is people in Cyprus to think of start up ideas and seek funding from the Bitcoin community. So I'll get right into your questions.
1. My only plan at the moment is to organize a Bitcoin Forum and listen to other people's opinions and concerns. Whether or not Bitcoin is the way to go remains to be seen. What is important is for us to start talking and constructively seek solutions to a very real economic problem.
2. The Cyprus economy is experiencing a major cash shortage right now. With the government unable to print new currency, this situation will continue for the foreseeable future. Those that still have jobs and cash will likely limit their purchases to the absolute minimum, causing a further contraction which is generously projected to be -8,7% this year. If Bitcoin is injected into the country in the form of donations or investments, then this would be fresh capital that people can use. But like I said, this is a gradual process. All I can say is that there are many people in Cyprus, including myself, who have no job, no wealth and nothing to lose. Give those people Bitcoins and see what they do with it.
3. If their products, services or ideas are good enough, they can expect the support of a growing international Bitcoin community that would like nothing more than to see Cyprus succeed, prosper and thrive. I believe this subreddit can back me up on this.
4. By seeking investments from the bitcoin community. My idea is to start a website, similar to kickstarter, that would connect Cypriots to that community. Hopefully, I can attract investors and in turn I can begin financing Cypriot startups.
5. I guess the real question is how desperately do they need it? Since both currencies will be used nationwide, there will always be someone available to exchange, either personally or through currency exchange services.
6. If all I had was 500 euros I would not exchange the entire amount into Bitcoin, that would be ill-advised to say the least. In an economy of competing currencies it would be wiser to have a supply of both. The amount of each one would keep is an individual choice.
Thank you for your questions and I would like to hear your feedback.
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:10:27
I agree! I'm sure we'll see many ups and downs in the near future, but overall bitcoin's value will continue to rise as more people use it.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:30:17
I know the feeling. It's depressing to see that all the cash I have in the world is not enough to buy one bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:53:52
"The notes are known jokingly as "Bin Ladens" in Spain due to the fact that they can't easily be found in circulation because they are used to stash money from the taxman."
I realize they're not related. However, the 500 euro banknote is mostly used as a means to stash money. If they abolish it, the idea of investing in a non-fiat, digital commodity/currency such as Bitcoin would seem very appealing.

Thanks buddy! I was hoping to have a good honey harvest this year, but unfortunately I lost half my hives over the winter due to wasp attacks and pesticides. But I will get in touch with other beekeepers in Cyprus and let you know.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:58:30
Absolutely. But if it's to become a legitimate alternative currency, it needs to become accepted in offline and local transactions too. At this point I'm not even sure if anyone else in Cyprus is using them.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:10:38
I'm in Cyprus. I gladly accept donations :)
I've been talking with people on twitter about bitcoin and started blogging about it (bitcoingr.wordpress.com). But it would be nice to send tips to newcomers as incentive.
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:56:15
You're right, random internet guy. I'll just stop writing.
@_date: 2013-03-21 09:35:19
I simply see bitcoin as a legitimate alternative currency that everyone should know about and I'm doing my best to inform as many people as I can. I believe that if bitcoin can become more practical to use offline then confidence will be restored and job prospects will increase.
