so what was your initial investment?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:36:23
Do you really believe people will invest again in this coin after the mess the last few days? How many unconfirmed transactions until now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:44
Why is that? Who wants to lose 5k? Or only rich people should invest???
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:02
They tried to flippening? Maybe, idk. But that is not the main reason for this "immediate aftermath. I sold all my coins yesterday when i saw shitcoins like RDD got pumped over 350% within a few hours. That has nothing to do with investing - this is pure gambling. How long did you guys think this would last. Also it seems bitcoin cannot handle the traffic it is facing right now which is even more worrisome.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:23:07
oh nice...you are so rich...
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:32:42
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:46:33
Maybe yes. Just find it difficult to understand why people with very high stacks would risk all their money. If they are not sure why don't try to push the market up instead of bringing it even further down with these fake sell orders.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:47:46
Good idea. Can you borrow me 6k? I would love to buy one �� 1C577cHJe423q5UZy1DnQTmZfb9cbrTNRW
@_date: 2018-08-03 05:33:07
Haha ok. Not sure what u mean with that...
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:34:53
ok got it thanks :)

If you say gold is centralized cos someone can/does own a lot then what is not centralized?
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:27:16
It is just what i noticed. But sometimes reading all the negative posts I also start to doubt...
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:21:07
Not sure how this would apply in my case. Somebody already owns a lot of coins. Sets a sell order but just removes it once ppl start to buy the coins or sometimes just moves it to a higher price. What would need to happen that this guy really sells and profits from it (like it is in your case). Can you give an example. Maybe i just don't get it yet :)
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:23:32
Bulls and bears...all bullshit. It needs not even 5 minutes looking at the binance order books to see that there is a war going on. Without this the volume would be very little. Will it go up or down in the coming days and weeks? I dont know. It depends on who gives up first.
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:31:31
The thing is I cannot believe that they are selling thousands of coins everyday not noticing that they cannot beat the buying bots. It goes like this for days now. All the money from sold coins needs to go back into bitcoin before this can go up again. They won't let this moon without being onboard. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:15:21
What is going on? Can you explain it so newbies also unerstand...what is csw trying to do?
@_date: 2019-03-03 16:48:49
Seems like you know what u are talking about. Can you explain 3a again for an idiot who does not understand  anything about trading? I guess you mean bitcoin will go down to fill the placed orders in range of 1-2k? Is that correct?
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:44:17
What options do I see 1. Sellers are utterly stupid not realizing they cannot beat buying bots and bitcoin will slowly going up while they are left behind  2. Sellers know they will make it dump at some point and buy back cheap. 3. They sell coz they think it will fail. 4. its wash trading - a big show for us idiots for whatever reason... I go with either option 2. or 4. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:28:45
Sure they know its going back up...trying for a bit but look at the amount they burned the last few days. You cannot buy this amount back in a bullish market. Lets see how this plays out....
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:04:06
So you saying "they" are selling thousands of  their coins across all exchanges right now in the hope to dump bitcoin? Totally underestimated the buy power? They could not easily long their coins let it go up and make a lot of money? I think it's obvious that something  fishy is going on for the last days. Trying to figure out what they are up to...
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:57:16
Either they lost a lot of money and seeking revenge or they sold high and want it to go lower to buy more.
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:28:35
Maybe a lot ppl did the same as you did. Kept quiet for a while. So this was the chance for the idiots to takeover. Also with crypto becoming more mainstream it attracts ppl you would not want in here.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:20:21
Most of the altcoins are useless IMO. There might be a few projects that will survive. Just do some research before investing. Ask yourself  does the altcoin you want to invest in solves any problem? Or does it even need blockchain to solve this problem? Maybe look into privacy coins or projects that try to build middleware for BTC/ETH.
@_date: 2019-01-10 15:43:15
Sth like xrp???? You are obviously dump...I understand all your points and bitcoin is far from perfect but to think there would be another coin to replace  bitcoin is just stupid. With all the awareness and popularity of crypto you really believe that there will be a next bitcoin??? Any possible successor with the ability  to replace bitcoin will be controlled, monopolized and squeezed out by the greed of investors before it even takes off.. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:46:06
Don't think it was all of a sudden. For the last days all shitcoins have been pumped heavily one after another. Profits have been taken. Now BTC needs to dump and take all shitcoins down. After a few days or weeks it starts all over again. BTC will go up, shitcoins pump, profits taken, BTC dumps and shitcoins follow. This is just my idea on what is going on....
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:57:32
Yeah that is why I said not ready...
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:27:05
Looking at the 2nd place on CMC I know the world is not ready for bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:23:16
Don't know also who is coordinating. I could be wrong. let's see what happens next ��
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:40:56
Dude WTC seems like a big scam?
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:45:57
Sometimes it is so exhausting that the stupid masses are so conservative and refusing to adapt. Our world could be so much more developed...You do really think that our current monetary system is the future for a globalized world? You cannot be that stupid...
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:45:59
Why would you say that? I used bitcoin several times to transfer money cross-border in the last year. Did not had to run to a bank. It was pretty cool.
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:00:22
What is your guess?
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:57:20
up or down?
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:33:15
Hold was good if you were clever enough to take profit at some point.  In 2017 for most of the ppl hold was the much better strategy than trying to swing trade. Investors made x2 x5 x10 profits and were too greedy to sell. So yeah at some point hold was not the best strategy anymore...
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:34:03
Quick questions. Pump or dump the next few days? I know nobody knows but what is your prediction?
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:28:49
Not sure what you did but yes I only invested what I could afford to lose. If it goes to zero i will still miss the money but i can deal with it....
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:57:11
How big? ��
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:44:02
Why 2k? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:44:20
good question....
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:39:49
Agree with many of your points. However, the rich becomes richer is happening right now with BTC too. It is just different ppl this time...
