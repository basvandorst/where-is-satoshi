I put in a ton of tiny buy orders from market on down to crazy low bids. Set-it-and-forget-it style. Then once every 2 weeks I would cancel a couple of the lowest orders and buy at market. I did have some bigger bids when it was really low (Can't remember the price, I buy in CAD.) So far its worked for me with waaaay less effort than the guys at bitcoinmarkets seems to put in...!

Useability, and vendors need to offer discounts for Bitcoin in cases where they save on credit card fees. Get Airmiles or other rewards systems rolled in.

You're downvoted for telling the truth. Consumers are used to the imbalanced advantage over merchants in purchasing via credit card chargebacks. (Forgive a technicality), but the credit card company takes the roll of the escrow company. Crytpocoins need to compete with that feature or customers will have to willingly accept more risk with their purchase.

***WRONG***. When I read statements like it weakens my hopes for the future of the currency. Bitcoin would be well served for people to take their blinders off and look at the landscape objectively. 
With Bitcoin, your security relies on your **due diligence** as well as the *hope* that you are smarter than an army of hackers that are scheming around the clock on how to get your coins from you. A misstep in Bitcoin can cost you your entire life savings. The cyptography protects you against brute force guessing your private key and the ledger protects you from people just making shit up (transfers, coin creation).
With a bank, your security also rests on the shoulders of you and your bank. The key difference here is the bank will cover your losses. A misstep in banking can cost you an afternoon.
I've never heard of anyone ever loosing millions through a hacked chequing account password. We've all read people losing their BTC in a plethora of ways from hardware failure to brain wallets to shoddy exchanges to trojans and malware to man-in-the-middle attacks. And I'd love to know how many people actually store their coins on machines that have never been connected to the internet.

I did read it. I *used* to be really into Bitcoin, the innovation and the possibilities. I was stoked to see innovations like in Namecoin and Darkcoin. I still have a special place in my heart for dogecoin. And I watched BTC-ers shit on them all. I've made several purchases via BTC and DOGE to experience the process. I have concerns over its use over other forms of money transfer - Downvotes and angry replies a plenty. Add to that, the community started wearing on me (FUD, circlejerking, pump pump pump! etc) So now I'm just holding what I have and seeing where it goes. There is too much false "good" news to be able to see real news; I would have been happy to see Bitcoin stable at $100 forever, but seeing as how bitcoiners are more interested in watching charts than discussing issues with its utility... Moving forward I'm treating Bitcoin as a play in Vegas and letting it ride; Moon or bust.

It most certainly is a pitfall of Bitcoin. Until there is a common, mutually trusted service provider that allows for cheap, fast escrow *or* simple chargebacks akin to credit cards, Bitcoin just seeks to take power out of the hands of the consumer. This may be a good thing for both parties, but best of luck getting consumers to 'adopt' reduced consumer protection to use Bitcoin.

I see this as a good thing. Flood the market with silly coins and you'll flood the market with a ton more people wanting to get in on cryptocoins. I've been shunned a ton for saying it but this is why Bitcoiners should embrace altcoins like Dogecoin - It brings fresh blood, interest, innovation and money to the cryptocoin game.

I didn't say that. Moreso it is generally more expensive to convert to Bitcoin than it is a foriegn currency. (Huge spreads on ATMs, local bitcoins, and depending on method of fiat deposit exchanges)


You got your definition of defacto backwards I'm afraid - They aren't supposed to accept it, most do. (Anecdotal - Never had anyone in the South *not* accept my Scottish money)


In your opinion. In practice back in the early days of the internet, the chargeback is what gave consumers the confidence to make purchases online. Without this a consumer has no recourse should a seller just not decide to follow through. Alipay appears to have found a great middle-ground, but as of yet there is not any equivilant with the same level of trust in other countries that I have found. It will happen, but hasn't happened yet.
Regarding international transfers, I've done many, many of them in a variety of flavors (Banking, FOREX, [Norberts gambit]( And conversly I have accounts on 4 bitcoin trading platforms. Buying Bitcoins was more complex - Wait times, know-your-customer laws, getting bank drafts or certified cheques... Its a pain. As far as vanishing transfers, countless people have found their Paypal accounts frozen or bank accounts closed.
There are very real issues Bitcoin will struggle to compete with traditional payment methods, to ignore them all but guarantees Bitcoin will remain a niche currency not worth the effort for the average consumer.
**Note:** In true fashion people are downvoting in an attempt to ignore and hide the things holding Bitcoin back from going mainstream. If you don't acknowledge concerns then developers or venture capitalists will miss opportunities to improve and develop solutions.

Oh ya, most certainly.


Do you have a true interest in tech and doing a bit of work to be ahead of the curve in technology? Then you should. Or you can wait until more vendors adopt it and the kinks are worked out like the majority. 
A lot of cryptocurrency users here are incredibly tech-savvy, but can't understand why Bitcoin etc is not appealing to Joe Public in it's current form. You hit the nail on the head with the hassle of starting out. If you're an entrepreneurial type, this is the wild west for new ideas. Hell, you get a *ton* of free advertizing right now if your business accepts crypto.
If you're an investor, this is the ground floor for Wall St as its entry point, so this could be seen as the ground floor for Joe Everyman. 
Ultimately its up to you though. Most of the people in are hoarders that are hoping the price goes up. They hope everyone *else* starts spending BTC to make their stash worth more.

It would be a HUGE threat. Bitcoin wouldn't disappear or die, but that doesn't matter - Adoption by the masses is the goal.
They could create a competing cryptocurrency and partner with Visa and/or Mastercard. In that landscape they could more or less force merchant adoption through adding bitcoin to all point of sale devices. And it is a complete clone of Bitcoin - Decentralized, no pre-mine, open source... But the transaction fees are paid 50/50 between miners and Paypal.
They are a trusted financial entity, can push adoption, have political clout, infrastructure Bitcoin could only dream of.

I'd love to know how many people in the world have a phone that can run a Bitcoin app vs having access to a credit card. I'm sincerely curious. I said Western world because I'm familiar with the Western world. I'm also curious if people in the 3rd world have the education required to securly keep their life savings safe and avoid being stolen/wiped out/accidentally deleted. Or held for ransom. All issues which credit cards either don't have to deal with or are better at handling.
Thanks for the downvote to whichever stereotypical went through my list and gave me a barrage of downvotes. Many in here cant hold a conversation without getting mad and hitting that purple arrow. So to wholever you are, feel free to ignore discussion and somehow still wonder why Bitcoin isn't more widely accepted.
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:05:01
I am sad to see your cold, hard truth is downvoted. The part of the bitcoin community that cannot accept (understand?) why Bitcoin currently is less appealing to consumers than credit cards is actually holding adoption back. 
How can I convince someone with a straight face that Bitcoin is better than credit cards for online purchases when they are being asked to give up consumer protection? Is buying and holding Bitcoin better than airmiles and other rewards such as travel insurance for purchases?
One area Bitcoin has opportunity to beat credit cards is with international purchases. Amazon.com refuses to ship most goods outside the USA - I think this is likely because of chargebacks. If Amazon agreed to ship internationally in cases where the payment 
is irreversible, that's a benefit.

For fun we can try and compare apples to oranges: The guy selling oranges gives Airmiles, consumer protection, more places welcome people that eat oranges, oranges cost about the same day to day. If your orange is stolen, the orange company will give you another orange.

Interesting times for sure. I cant focus on the day to day white noise. It would stress me out. I figure, 5 years from now Bitcoin will most certainly be worth more. Even if it 'only' doubles, that still beats the average market return. With that in mind I see no reason to try and by the bottom and sell the top: I have a large chance of missing gains just to gamble

An easy way to convert money internationally would be key. There are still better ways than Bitcoin in it's current form, but if/once you can use Bitcoin worldwide for day-to-day things - It opens up a whole new ballgame for people who travel a lot.

I remember when the 'purpose' of a cryptocurrency was to be a form of electronic currency. These days it's all about daytrading and a way for early adopters to enrich themselves. The Dogecoin community is completely about tipping and content creation. It doesn't want to compete with Bitcoin as a currency or as an investment vehicle. The 'unlimited amounts with no cap forever' is called inflation. It's good for that coin because it discourages hoarding. If the OP has only now realized that Dogecoin is a bad investment as an asset, good. Buy up another coin. Doge is meant to be *spent*.
 I hold BTC, PPC and Dogecoin. The former I save, the latter I spend.

I see very few people fighting Bitcoin&lt;--&gt;Dogecoin to be honest. I was a Dogecoin early adopter (Though I've kept my holdings.) I wanted something to play around with without risking deleting my Bitcoin wallet. The Dogecoin people were much more helpful to me than my speckle of noobie questions I had die in the new tab on The real benefit to Dogecoin is that I got to see all the crytpo-community foibles that bitcoin went through in top speed - 51% fear, forks, scams, developers in their teens making apps and websites, marketplaces morphing from joke sales to actual real products. I've bought a number of things via dogecoin in Don't think of it as a zero sum game though. For me personally, if Dogecoin collapses I'm not likely to transfer it all to Bitcoin anyways.  Bitcoin is the foundation. Dogecoin is still small enough to be considered a low risk experiment.

I'm pro on cryptocoins and think Bitcoin the most likely contender across all the coins. Responding point by point:
1. Contrary to some people in this forum, I dont think BTC will ever replace USD in our lifetime. Add to that, the largest per capita countries that adopt BTC wont be American. As a Canadian I see BTC as a way to convince international vendors to trade with our country without fear of the consumer-leaning rules of credit card companies. Other countries as a hedge against failed economic policy (Greece) and hyperinflation (Romania, Zimbabwe) 
2. I think Bitcoin beats Litecoin only because of "First to Market" The (minor and argueable) advantages of LTC aren't strong enough for parity. To be frank, all of the crypto's are more or less the same at the core. Bitcoin simply has the 'branding'. IE: Is "Rollerblade" the *best* inline skate on the market or does their name play a big part in it?
3. You have done your homework and are are spot on. The one thing to note is most Crypto&lt;--&gt;Fiat trades require Bitcoin as the middleman in the trade. The Dogecoin community specifically is trying to get merchant adoption, with some success. Bitcoin is still the dominant player by a massive margin.
4. I can see no reason at all to not accept multiple cryptocurrencies with services like bitpay (Which are cheaper than credit card fees?). Without the fiat conversion a merchant would have to be careful as a well timed pump-and-dump or general fluctuation may cause grief. I think (for the time being) a guaranteed fiat equivalent is necessary for any crypto to work for merchants. The advances made may even pave the way for next-gen on-the-spot FOREX. As person that travels often this has *massive* appeal to me. 
**Noteworthy:**  Dogecoin has gained a lot of developer interest. I don't predict DOGE will ever replace BTC, but could be adapted as a defacto "gaming currency"
**Full disclosure:** I'm mostly in BTC, and hold PPC, LTC and DOGE

See, to me it sounds like you are making things difficult for yourself, and miss most of the glaring problems with translations in Bitcoin.
The bars P.O.S was down, a true issue. Your choice to carry such a small amount of fiat on hand left you with little options for sure. In the case of the network going down, internet problems are just as likely. And if that happens to either party using Bitcoin you're left in the same situation. Add to this, if you have ever found yourself to have an uncharged phone... You're out of luck. And if you're one of the many people who doesn't have a smartphone and/or a regional data package while traveling... Things get more difficult as well.
Our largest international cell provider (Bell) was all but completely down on Saturday night in my region (West Coast BC). Paper money was still working fine though! 
Regarding fees, no doubt banks are vampires. Still, I've lost more cash in transfer fees, wire fees, currency conversions and spreads getting bitcoin than I do with some furgal banking practices.
I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have a ton of potential, I wouldn't be here if I didn't, but this image and your weekend sounds like overstated inconveniences.

I cant comment much on FDIC. As far as buying things with credit card: totally agree; the protections for the consumer are great with a credit card, and non-existent in Bitcoin. But there is the rub: Because credit card companies/Paypal etc usually side with the consumer, merchants are opting to not sell to regions that are high risk for chargebacks. Anyone in Canada ordering from Amazon.com can attest to this.
I agree though, a hybrid/escrow would be ideal.

None of them are likely to go anywhere. The white noise will force exchanges to reduce the coins they trade in, taking a few other under adopted lame/scam coins with it. I like a lot of the humorous altcoins (that aren't premined scamcoins looking to enrich early adopters). Altcoins takes the intimidation and 'scariness' away from cryptocurrency. Introducing new blood, innovation, and money into the system that will eventually settle in on one of the few major coins.

If you keep Bitcoin serious and intimidating to newcomers it will remain a niche concept to a niche community. Or would you rather Bitcoin keep its old image of being tied to the Silk Road and money laundering? That's serious enough to keep a lot of people from testing the water. No matter how much you hate it or don't want to see it, Dogecoin is introducing a whole fresh demographic of new users to cryptocurrency. 
Oh, but its got a dog on it. 
Number 2 LTC would kill for the kind of buzz Dogecoin has been getting. Right now Bitcoin is all about FOREX speculation, day trading, and trying to ensure we enrich ourselves though early adoption.

Add to that, a "well off wallstreeter" might be interested in what is going on in the altcoin world.

Bitcoin is a complex thing to wrap your head around in the beginning. 
"Why is it popular?" - He follows up to ask why anyone would want to use Bitcoin over Paypal or credit cards. That's a good question. Bitcoin lacks consumer protection, a HUGE plus for consumers. 
"Why is it expensive?" Supply vs demand? Economics? Popularity which increases price which increases popularity? It's not backed by anything. Fiat isn't backed by anything physical any more of course, but it is backed by the US government. Is good faith the only thing that determines Bitcoins price?

Did I say that? My faith in the Bitcoin communities ability to have a sensible discussion has dropped drastically the last few weeks. 
Lets be clear: Some governments, like the USA, like to keep tabs on capital flight. My opinion on this is irrelevant, ***it's just what they do.***


And $100 bills are nothing other than green pieces of paper, just like tissues. The border agents like to know when you're bringing too many special green tissues in.
Right now, if you want to bring $100,000 in paper cash across the border, you are required to declare it. If you want to transfer fiat 1's and 0's electronically, your bank declares that on your behalf (Sort of - KYC laws). 
And if you want to bypass these declarations, you can use Bitcoin. Is that illegal? *Maybe*. Depends on who is asking I guess

Ok, you and everyone above you keep fighting a position I don't hold. I'm not saying you have to declare your Bitcoins at the border. I haven't said that. I haven't implied that. I haven't even hinted at that.
Converting your assets to Bitcoin so you can transfer them out of the country is a technique you can use to get around declaring cash at the border. Is it legal? MAYBE. Some governments like to keep an eye when large volumes of cash move in or out of the country. If you are leaving the USA, you declare *what is on your person* at the border. Or when you do a bank transfer they declare that on your behalf (Sort of - KYC laws). One could argue (successfully in my opinion) that Bitcoin doesn't change hands until a transaction is made. The government doesn't currently have anything in place to require reporting that transaction. That's the loophole, and that's why it is probably legal.
At what point should the government be noticed it's money has left the country? SHOULD they be? Should it be when you use the Bitcoin to purchase goods or services outside of where they were purchased? Are people being honest with their taxes as it relates to Bitcoin as a currency or asset, declaring the value at the time of the transaction? I have not hinted at my position on ANY of these concerns. head is so far up its own ass shooting down discussions that they automatically assume I'm Jonny Law with a boner for taxing bitcoins. I'm not American and I could give 2 shits how much money trickles out of the country to the 3rd world. They need it more anyways. What I AM saying is, when large sums of money leave the country, the USA is one country that wants to know about it. It's one of the costs of earning money in the USA.

Adoption vs "Adoption". Instantly converting to fiat at the point of sale isn't adoption.
We had some bro in here going door to door with pamplets like some Jehovahs Witnesses. I can just imagine "Did you hear the good news?"
Current bitcoiners are acting way too much like pyramid scheme hopefuls: WAY too much buy and hold, VERY little real innovation and true adoption. If people spent half the time they are spent trying to do technical analysis on the price on trying to create and innovate, Bitcoin would stand a chance.

I don't see why they *couldn't*. They could integrate VISACoin into all the point-of-sale devices, effectively *forcing* merchant adoption. Bitcoin in its current form has a lot of things that need to be tweaked and improved upon before it will be adopted by the average person - Visa has the resources to fix a lot of the issues slowing adaptation, the reputation as a world renowned financial entity, and the political power to change the minds of any political entity that may resist their efforts.

That's pretty standard fare for letting a 3rd party debit/credit your bank account.
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:27:46
You can compare apples to oranges just fine if you're talking about overall weight. We were comparing overall risk. 's point was fully valid. Escrow is only as risk free as your trust of the 3rd party. Anyone that's ever done time on Craigslist knows the risks there. Noteworthy: BTC escrows costs are in the ballpark of the fees merchants pay for credit cards.
Storing Bitcoins is currently very risky: It's difficult to know what the best options are. Do we store them on a computer that has never been connected to the internet? Print off the private key in a way that is provably unable to be stored in a printers RAM? (One that is not on a network). Or on a flash drive encrypted with a password you can remember but shouldn't write down? This is our life savings here, its hard to be too safe. Storing BTC locally on your PC is basically the same as stuffing money under your mattress. House fire, forgotten password, theft - Life savings are gone. Lets be honest, technical knowledge on how to be *truly* secure and safe online involves much more than basic common sense: The smartest crooks on the planet are scheming around the clock on how to get your coins knowing once they do you have little recourse. I can leave my credit card at a restaurant, make one phone call and everything is fixed in 3-5 business days.
Conversely, credit cards certainly have issue with identity theft that bitcoin wont have. I've had to deal with cloned cards before - Its a pain, but I got my money back - All it took was a phone called and a signature on a legal document. Identity theft is a bigger pain in the ass. A huge one, but in the end I will still have most or all of the money.
**TL;DR:** Bitcoins advantages should not be overstated or we will risk not seeking improvements in areas that slow wider adoption.

I would love to be able to take money out of the USA freely but for different reasons. I could make *notably* more money working in the USA. I could live modestly and send all the surplus back home where the cost of living is cheaper. Many people do this. Magnitudes more would if they could do it without having to report everything. As it stands currently, there are lots of hoops to jump through. I have a decent pile of money sitting in the USA right now that I have spent a few years trying to pull out. I'm on my 3rd round with the IRS. And as a non-American let me assure you they are in no rush to help.

You might not agree with how every penny you pay to taxes is spent, but part of living in society involves doing your part and pitching in for services everyone benefits from.

I don't know enough about the programming to answer that. I know that changes can be made and if the majority of the miners accept it, it's law. I also don't know how stock splits work for legal documents or scientific papers, but they do. (Unless you are Berkshire-Hathaway haha) If you say this is a physical impossibility in the code of bitcoin, well that's that. Maybe mBtc needs to be the standard. All I can tell you is throwing around numbers like "0.000317" puts people off. Online its easy to read, in real life - hard to say and quickly comprehend.

I personally hope something *better* than Bitcoin comes along. What form that takes I have no idea. I don't think any of the current batch of alts are poised to 'dethrone' Bitcoin though. Not enough innovation that I've seen. (I like PPC thought). Im stoked to see what will be possible with the *next* iteration of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:57:25
So hows about you calm down for just a moment.
Bitcoin in its current form is complex to the average person. Roll that in with some "How would Bitcoin benefit me?!" and "Why is it so hard to buy with normal money', and that's the current state of affairs. My mom will never in her life explore the blockchain, care about mining pools, encrypt her wallet (unless its automatic), or pay with her phone if she has a credit card handy.
There can and will be advances that will help to change that. Hopefully. There will **have** to be or Bitcoin will remain a niche currency for a niche demographic.
Saying all this, I sincerely look forward to seeing your magical startup that will solve all adoption problems.

100% correct. I know its cool to throw blanket hate at Dogecoin for whatever reason, but it got cryptocoins some major airtime. Especially when Josh Wise beat out favorite Danica Patrick on the fan vote.

Consider showing them Dogecoin to get their feet wet. Not even kidding. Its a great intro to see how Bitcoin all started and how it work(ed) early on when Joe Public could mine on their home PC. Super friendly community to noobies as well. And when they want to play with the big boys, they can exchange that Doge for BTC.
Good AMA by the way.

Almost no-one deals in millibitcoins or Satoshi. For now everyone is stuck on the 'Bitcoin' name for the brand.


On the crypto side (multiplying number of coins) maybe, but moving the default decimal should be pretty easy. 


This is only worrysome if this "stable" currency actually multiplies in value 1000 fold (again). Even so, by that point it would be much easier to trade over to a newer protocol altogether. Like how countries adopted the Euro if people felt the benefits were there.


No, because that is a rigid mathematical definition not subject to speculation, inflation, and manipulation. A ghz 500 years ago is equal to a ghz today. Not so with currency.

There are 2 kinds of Bitcoiners:
The ones that believe in the concept of cryptocurrency and want a shift in paradigm regardless of the coin that is ultimately adapted by the masses. And the ones that only seek to enrich themselves via early adoption. The latter view altcoins as a potential roadblock to riches. The former understand you need competition to help innovate. There are plenty of issues Bitcoin has yet to overcome. Alt coins push and tryto solve those issues, and are able to try weird things without destroying the mainstream publics confidence in crypto as a whole. I am comfortable if Bitcoin adapts or is ultimately beaten by another superior coin, as long as we are better off than we were when we started.
It's funny how much dick comparing there is in IE: "How early I bought my first coin"

Im in *BTC* for profit. I really want Dogecoin to succeed apart from currency speculation however. I'm a one-man indy content creator. I've made a bunch of little vids and such over the years but never put ads on my work. I love the idea of being able to earn tips from people - Like Reddit karma, but spendable. I've had a couple things of mine go viral over the years -I've made more from Dogecoin tips than all of those previous successes combined. I'd happily keep Dogecoin at the price it is now forever if it was adopted as a means to quickly and easily tip content creators.
So yes, ultimately we're all in it for profit, but in Dogecoins case it's not about watching the price charts.

I've found buying BTC to be many magnitudes more effort at a higher risk. Admitedly to do Norberts Gambit you have to have a self-directed trading account. I'd say that was about on par for effort (but cheaper) than converting to USD then to BTC

Don't let political affiliation sway your opinion on cryptocurrency. More importantly don't let or decide your opinion. These forums are the heart of the Bitcoin circlejerk and are always bullish even when they are bearish.

Less intimidating to newcomers
Not associated with blackmarket/drugs
Can still be mined by novices, therefore can be played with without having to go through laborious Fiat--&gt;BTC process
Friendlier community.
Still in early stages. (New users dont feel like they missed the boat)
These may not be advantages to *you*, but then Dogecoin is not FOR you. Look how fast people became interested in Crypto when Dogecoin came out. Litecoin and the other alts would KILL for that kind of buzz. 
Bitcoin users should love the new demographics and life Dogecoin is bringing to the table. Its taking the intimidating factor of Crypto-currency away. Everyone in seems to like the idea of a Wall Street dude buying up all the stock he can and raising the short term price. Personally an uninformed whale is the last thing I want to see.

I'm very pro-Bitcoin, but it would be foolish to dismiss these glaring issues if more people are to use Bitcoin as a day to day payment system. The longer I play with crypto, the more I view it like an asset and less as a currency.

Possibly. Not very good issue for marketers though. How about reading out addresses over the phone?
one, upper case G, one, uppercase R, uppercase S, lowercase R, lowescase B, lowercase C, nine, uppercase R, lowercase H, uppercase L, seven, one, lowercase j, three, uppercase F, lowercase C, uppercase Z, lowercase D, uppercase D, uppercase P, lowercase Q, nine, uppercase Q, lowercase I, uppercase E,lowercase I, uppercase Z, uppercase T, lowercase U, lowercase C, lowercase T, uppercase W

Your post barely being in the positives is why you can't judge public opinion on bitcoin in these forums. You are spot on and everyone knows it. "It will get better!" is not a reason to prefer spending BTC over fiat. BTC is hard to get, volatile, and for merchants that aren't into it: A huge pain in the ass.

Ah, but they are! My credit card has worked in every country I've ever used it in. My British ones work across Europe, and the USA, and my North American cards works in the UK and Europe. I haven't had the opportunity to try them in Asia, but I'm optimistic they work fine there as well.
Of course you meant paper money which has to be exchanged. I could exchange that paper money for Bitcoin, or for the local currency. In practice its the same number of exchanges, though with Bitcoin I'm limited to certain retailers, even more restricted in rural and remote areas.

Why not? 


Sadly, most people outside of our little techno niche might not even care about decentralization. They just want to be able to spend their money as easily as possible with as few fees as possible. (Visa's?) end game might not be to target the early adopting Bitcoin techies anyways. They won't want us, they want the other 98% of the population.
There are too many opportunities with crypto-currencies to know which way the market will turn.

You're right; there is no way of knowing if Bitcoin will ultimately succeed or not. Back in 2000 I would have thought online grocery options would have done much better than something like Amazon. You are also right that Bitcoin has a few hurdles to overcome before they are accepted into the mainstream. Hell, I think its quite likely that Bitcoin is benefiting from first mover advantage and may be dethroned by a current or yet-to-be-seen altcoin.
I wouldn't bet the farm on BTC, but no matter the outcome it's undeniably an interesting time!

If someone is looking for a good intro to bitcoin the currency, I'd point them to an alt like Dogecoin. It's a good practice run to understand the basics of using cryptocurrency without the risk of jumping right in to btc
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:13:55
I don't know how we don't hear way more about this from bitcoin merchants. Unless they sell the BTC for fiat on the day, their entire business hangs on the volatility of BTC.
Their fault? Absolutely. What can be done...? This is the strength and the weakness of BTC: No centralized entity regulation. No dispute process. No chargebacks.

It's better to be linked to a silly dog meme than the Silk Road, no?
Dogecoin is still mine-able. You'll find most people that are gaining interest in Crypto-currency want to know how they can mine some. Setting up an ASIC farm is too large a step for someone just looking to check it out. The Bitcoin community is pretty cold and unaccepting of new people for anything other than how to just buy some. Objectively - These days Bitcoin looks more to be about enriching early adopters and FOREX speculation than it is about being a replacement/compliment to fiat. Dogecoin is about trading fake money for fake things, having fun and and learning about cryptocurrency.
I personally got into cryptocurrency via Bitcoin. I couldn't mine it. It took a LOT of effort for me to convert fiat to BTC. It was not a very friendly or welcoming community either. Doge might be worthless as a currency, but the Dogecoin community itself runs circles around users of Bitcoin. And if at some point a dogeminer wants to "be serious" - They can convert DOGE to BTC on one of the exchanges.
If you want cryptocurrency to catch on, **this** is what it looks like.

Haha, I love having serious discussions on the pros and cons and future of Bitcoin/alt-coins. I find it a bit of a challenge to find people that are able to think outside of the circlejerk on coin-specific sub-reddits.
To be honest, you're the first to ever bring up my side hobby in a discussion. You must be pretty good at the internet to have picked up on it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:56:28
No chance that whole amount was fulfilled. If you are playing with that much cash, you wouldn't drop it on an exchange (unless you ran the exchange.) You'd be better off making a deal with an institution (Wall st is looking to get a piece of all this tasty, emotional volatility.
My method to not panic is to not play with more than I'm willing to lose, and to only buy on certain days/price points. I let others react to news.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:52:05
It sounds to me like the (vendor) probably got caught in the volatility and was trying to recoup. We wont know unless we know the vendor.

If you only have a few coins for sure. He's a whale though. People panic "What does he know that I dont know? OMG he flooding the market" Is this a chinese panic sale?!". People panic, put in sell orders for lower than the wall he has put up. Price drops. He sells a few coins for cheap, but not the cheapest. Not by a long shot. Who is sitting around with a million dollars that wants to call his bluff anyways. Then he can pick up a bunch of the scared sellers shares in drips.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:13:45
He's not come around though. He would accept payment in bubblegum wrappers if he could instantly convert them to fiat with no risk.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:36:51
They wouldn't. And that is one of the marks against using Bitcoin as a currency vs using a credit card. And is something that will have to be addressed eventually if BTC wants a real crack at being a preferred form of payment.

A year ago Bitcoin was seen as an underound currency used to buy drugs and guns through Tor on the Silk road. You would be wise to welcome some new life (users) to the crypto-currency game.

It's actually my biggest beef with btc, it encourages hoarding. Even doge, which was made as a joke so people could tip almost worthless money, is starting to be hoarded. Want me to pay with crypto? Make my money worth equal or less tomorrow. And don't make it so hard to get
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:27:53
This is why dogecoin is doing well - Still mineable, friendly to noobies, and is fun.

The good ones did well. For every strong company like Amazon and eBay there were a dozen shit IPO's trying to ride the wave. Maybe Bitcoin is the Amazon (long lasting), maybe it's the Myspace (Eventually overtaken), maybe its webvan (Sounds like a good idea, but is ultimately a flop.)

@_date: 2013-12-21 21:33:24


Disagree. There is a large penalty for hoarding fiat and not doing anything with it: Inflation. Inflation assures that something like a savings account is more appealing than a shoebox. 
Many people are put off by Bitcoin because a few lucky people got in early. Idealist capatilism aside, no one likes to feel like they missed the boat, and its off-putting to consider purchasing something today that cost 1/1000th a year ago. I got into BTC late Nov to see what it was all about. I wasn't in it to get rich quick - I wanted to see what the potential was all around. There is a lot of it. There is also a LOT holding it back, both from going mainstream, and for staying as the most traded crypto. I consider BTC the 'proof of concept' cryptocoin.
Funnily enough, DOGE has been more exciting for me than than BTC. Sure its a clone of luckycoin or litecoin or whatever, but a lot of people are getting their feet wet in crypto currency through that coin. The only ones having a bad time with DOGE are the ones trying to replicate what happened in BTC a month ago.
