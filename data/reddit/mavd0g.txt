Mad props for that article man. 
Would you agree that scaling on-chain is limited by it's inherent linear growth potential, whereas something like lightning can serve as a base layer for some extremely high transaction-throughput solutions like streaming payments etc?
If not, what are some ideas of "3rd-layer" solutions that I've seen might be possible to implement on top of Lightning? I'd be really interested in reading about the inherent limitations of Lightning and how layers could be built on top of that. Like what would be possible to do on top of Lightning but isn't possible to do with Lightning itself, and how would those solutions work as a general idea?
I'm sorry if this question is too complicated, any thoughts would be appreciated :)

Then just go with option B and remain completely trustless. It's optional to include a degree of trust, if that's a problem for you then simply don't count on it

You can use those $1000 for payments to (presumably) the whole network, with Steam acting as a route. Your money isn't required to be spent with Steam as the vendor.
Imo it's more like having a savings account (bitcoin kept in your wallet) and then transfering to another account that's spendable with a debit card (bitcoin kept in ln payment channel)

Thanks for clearing that up. I was aware that Segwit transactions have lower "weight" than legacy transactions, but I must admit I don't fully understand how more transactions are fitted into a block if the byte-size isn't less. 
My main point was that adopting Segwit wouldn't decrease fees to a point where they are approaching zero, due to all the other non-segwit transactions clogging the mempool. I think most of what I said still isn't strictly incorrect, expect that I said fees are calculated as satoshis/byte and not satoshis/weighted-units, and I did also underestimate the fee reduction of immediately implementing Segwit as I at least made it sound like it wasn't in the 20-40% territory. 
Again, my main point was that Segwit addresses will still not avoid the penalty which we're all experiencing due to the clogged mempool

One exchange implementing Segwit wouldn't necessarily reduce the transaction fees on that site all that much.
I'm not sure how much smaller Segwit transactions are, the fees would only be reduced proportionally to the tx size reduction gained with Segwit.
The mempool will still be flooded with non-segwit tx's and thus a Segwit transaction would still have to pay the same satoshi/byte fee. The fees will only drop when the mempool isn't constantly backlogged, which won't happen if a single exchange implements Segwit, it's probably gonna need closer to 100% Segwit adoption altho I'm not sure on the exact numbers.

Wow I love this. It's extremely reassuring to see that devs are working on ideas that can help LN scale even further. Two on-chain transactions per channel is quite a lot and had me a little bit worried esp as Bitcoin continues to scale, but seeing that effort is being made to further reduce necessary on-chain transactions makes this the best news I've seen today! 
Still need some time to digest this and fully understand how it'll work, but the sheer numbers of byte-savings look very promising indeed. :)

If you're really interested in the tech and economy, then today is obviously the best time to get into btc/crypto. It's here to stay, it's still VERY early days, so you haven't missed out on anything you can't catch up with yet.
It's been said before but it's worth saying again because it's very true, a great place to start is here: 
If you were interested in making money tho, now is still the best time to get in. This market is only gonna keep exploding

You might find some good info here: 
And you might also want to look into some off-chain solutions that are possible. Lightning Network is one, also general ideas proposed by teams like Blockstream ( which include Side-chains and more.
Generally the idea within the Bitcoin Core development community seems to be to try to keep block sizes small for the sake of not introducing more centralization (however you look at it, any block size increase is a step towards more centralization/more exclusion of people that can't afford "expensive" hardware).
We might very well see block size increases in the near future, but my feeling at least is that Core's philosophy will include first trying to scale off-chain, and then when we have those solutions set up (ie lightning), then a block size increase will be considered if needed
As for any calculations of the kind you're looking for, I'm absolutely certain you can find a number of those if you search for them

Does there exist any kind of chatroom (gitter, irc etc) for bitcoin devs that isn't *too* crowded and has some decent general dev chat?

The time-period from when the transaction is broadcasted and to when it gets confirmed by the network is adjustable though right?
In that case users would simply have to make precautions to avoid having their funds stolen. If you have a channel open with someone you don't trust at all, and your internet is spotty, then keep the refuting period long, ie one week, and rest assured that if the other user tries to steal your funds, he's taking a HUGE risk of losing what he's entitled to. If you have a channel with someone you trust, then you could slack the refuting period a bit etc etc. 
This may not be 100% flawless but it's honestly quite secure imo, and I'm sure we'll see more developments in this area

Here is a three minute long video of Andreas Antonopoulos addressing this "issue".
He has in fact answered this in more details in some of his talks, although I can't remember right now which talks those are exactly.
But basically it comes down to understanding that although miners are currently using a massive amount of energy, as Bitcoin grows in use, energy consumption does not have to scale up with it. In fact, (and correct me if I'm wrong here) with the current amount of mining going on, the network would stay secure even if a global adoption of Bitcoin was to occur. That is, we do not need more miners even as Bitcoin grows.
The other thing to understand, and which might be more important, is the fact that although mining requires quite a lot of energy, one needs to recognize that it secures the network. It will replace what is probably a MUCH larger use of energy that's being used today to secure money and transactions, which for example constitutes of guns, vaults, manpower, electricity etc etc. 
For anyone interested in Bitcoin/cryptocurrency/technologies related to it, who has questions like the one OP asked, I would recommend listening to a few of Andreas's talks. He will answer those questions, and many more, in a very clear and precise manner, helping you better understand the actual amazing potential that this technology has.

I wouldn't worry too much about this. Bitcoin right now isn't competitive compared to the dollar etc because the transactions are slow and expensive.
This is being solved by some very very smart developers which are creating an off-chain solution (which basically means that it will be possible to do transactions without publishing them to the Blockchain right away). This will allow for extremely fast and cheap transactions, while being very secure and resistant to fraud.
lightning.network (website) will offer some more info, although it is a bit technical.
For now, look at Bitcoins issues as a good thing. It's a great time to invest because right now it isn't where it needs to be, and thus it's price is "cheap". - As "2nd-layer/off-chain" solutions are implemented and made available, Bitcoins usability WILL improve and thus prices will go up.
I'd be willing to bet that Steam reintroduces Bitcoin as a means of payment pretty quickly following the implementation and deployment of Lightning Network.

Is there any way to determine how much fee I need to include in a transaction to have it go through in a reasonable amount of time? Electrum does state "within 1/2/5/10/25 blocks" based on how much fee you include but I'm not sure how accurate that is, given what I'm hearing about low-fee transactions not being processed at all right now due to the enormous amount of transactions waiting in the Mempool these days.

Like some people have said it depends on loan terms, your income/expenses etc.
I just took a ~$30k loan and in the process of converting that money to Bitcoin. Some might call me crazy but really it depends on your situation. I'm paying ~$500/month for the next 5 years, and make just under $4k a month with not a lot of expenses. 
I wouldn't rush into it though, again depends on your situation and I'd really get familiar with the idea of Bitcoin, decentralized currency in general and the underlying technology (Blockchain/cryptography etc) first. If you perceive it as something that might work out in the future, and your situation allows for it, then I'd say yeah go for that 5k loan! (assuming it's terms are acceptable) - It could easily be ~50x that in 5-10 years

A good example of why Bitcoins ideology is so important.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:29:02
I'd recommend searching for answers to this yourself, if you're genuinely interested. As I said before, listening to Andreas Antonopoulos explaining Bitcoins potential is a good place to start.
He does address these things in the 3 minute long video I linked, and he also talks about the fact that algorithms can be simplified as to reduce the energy consumption needed to validate the transactions on the Blockchain. I have no source to backup my statement of the current banking system using much more energy than Bitcoin. However, in my opinion, we should we seriously considering this technology, which is still in it's very early stages, because of the many potentials it has to improve the global monetary system.

How should we be interpreting the numbers on the CME futures: 
Are they really predicting that Bitcoin price will be at 19300 in June 2018?

youre wrong. In the example youve given your iota would drop in half relative to bitcoin due to bitcoin increasing in value. Your 10 iota would only be worth 0.1 btc since btc is 2x more expensive now
