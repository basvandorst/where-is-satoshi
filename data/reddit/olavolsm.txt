Yeah virtual machine is a good idea. Once I get the time I will look into this.
I know autoit can work in linux with wine as I had a user that successfully used my program CryptoPriceAlert in wine over a year ago:
@_date: 2016-04-10 21:28:36
Nice site, thats great, thanks!
@_date: 2016-04-14 15:09:23
You can run windows applications in other operating systems. I beleive u/bailey0799 runs it in linux using wine.

Well CryptoPriceAlert is something else than RedditMessenger so it can work even though this does not.
@_date: 2016-04-14 15:24:13
Cool. Maybe try and run it in wine and see? It is just a portable exe and very lightweight. Id like to know if it works so please let me know if you try.

Good choice. I played mafia II a few years ago and enjoyed it a lot. I can highly recommend it.
G2A is a marketplace of sellers and it is high risk. There is no guarantee you will not receive an illegal product. For example steam gifts are often sold there, and keys bought with stolen credit cards too. That is why they have the optional "g2a shield". If you do not want to purchase illegal products you should stay way from g2a.
Keys4Coins ONLY sell legal products, so you are safe buying from us.
Our customer support is amazing. We are available on live chat most of the day, every day, including weekends. We do not want you hanging around for help.
Also, if you purchase mafia II from Keys4Coins, you get a chance to win $1000. All orders above $10 qualify as entry to the drawing. Another reason to buy from us.
Another great reason to buy from Keys4Coins is that you can make your purchase anonymously. G2a requires all kinds of identification and this information can easily come in the wrong hands. We only require the email address to where license key will be sent.
Finally, if you buy from us you support a cryptocurrency only merchant and Bitcoin economy.
So, with only 2 or 3 dollars difference, and still it's less than half steam price so a huge saving either way, I do not agree this product on k4c is expensive, I think it is very cheap for a great product and this service.
I hope I changed your mind. If not, why not give us a try? Make a small purchase and see if you like the order process. I think you will love it :)
Whoever you chose to purchase from, I hope you will enjoy Mafia II. I sure did. Good night (at least it is for me) or have a nice day! :D

We use one of the most known game distributors in the industry, with more than 9 years experience.
Our distributor only provide keys from official sources, therefore the codes are guaranteed legitimate.
Suppliers are manually verified to be legit and have a license to sell from the publishers.
Most of our games are region free, meaning they can be used worldwide.
The few keys that are region locked has a warning on the product page.
Be aware that some cd key stores sell Steam gifts, which is against steam terms and are probably bought illegally.
We do not provide such keys. Keys4Coins only offers real keys that are scanned from their original retail boxes.
For many games we also send you a scanned image of the license key on the box, instead of just the key in text.
Thanks for the question.

And your point is what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:33:12
Because the fee for every other coin is basically near free for us to send. 1 dogecoin, 0.00000227 Bitcoin Cash etc. is like nothing. So we can cover the cost for these without problem.  It was always like this for bitcoin too, until the transaction fees became too high for us to cover them.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:47:30
You dont have to wait for Steam to accept cryptocurrency. Keys4Coins.com offers cheaper prices and instant payment in dogecoin, bitcoin and litecoin. We have games for steam, Origin, Uplay, Battle.net and others.
@_date: 2019-03-08 05:56:14
It is just one accepted cryptocurrency among many, we are only a business and we want most customers to pay in the cryptocurrency of their choice. You can use Bitcoin or whichever other currency we accept.
@_date: 2019-03-08 06:07:11
Bitcoin has "died" hundreds of times also. We get orders in all the currencies we accept so we are not going to stop accepting any of them and excluding customers from our shop. Cryptocurrency is for everyone.
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:22:33
Nobody are allowed to sell steam gifts, they are definitely not a verified seller. It is a russian marketplace like ebay with individual sellers.
@_date: 2016-11-05 14:26:51
Like posted in [r/btc]( let me also post here benefits of using Keys4Coins:
1. Lower prices which automatically adjusts.
2. Better customer support, is of highest priority.
3. Use the potential of cryptocurrency for anonymous payments. Checkout as guest and all that is required is an email address.
4. Support a cryptocurrency-only store. Keys4Coins believes in cryptocurrency so much that we accept no fiat. We also keep as much as possible in cryptocurrency and do not automatically sell to fiat.
5. Pay directly with bitcoin, not having to load a wallet first.
6. Instant 0 confirm delivery, as long as you pay enough fee for enough transaction confidence. The higher confidence the faster product is delivered.
7. Every purchase you make over 10 USD qualify as a ticket for Such Drawing where you can win $1000:

If you want to buy illegal or stolen goods that is a great option for you.
It is against steam terms to sell steam gifts. And a great risk too, usually they are bought with stolen credit cards and resold. If you want to support scam go ahead. Do not be surprised if your license is revoked sooner or later or your account banned.
@_date: 2016-11-05 16:36:48
Thank you. Finally some good words, very much appreciated. Yes we offer this service as a cryptocurrency only store, fiat is not real currency to us! :)
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:15:23
No, Bitcoin was removed because of too high transaction fees and support backlog on unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-05 16:44:28
What do you mean its not gift, it even says GIFT in the title. Even if it wasnt gift you should never purchase from a store who sells them, that is a huge red flag. 
Keys4Coins only sell legitimate keys from legitimate sources, no illegal/stolen/carded or whatever shit. That makes our prices a bit higher than a fishy marketplaces like plati.ru and you can be rest assured that your games/account will never ble revoked/blocked.
Keep on buying from plati.ru, but once your game or account gets revoked/blocked dont say I didnt warn you.
Now please stop bashing us. We are much more crypto friendly than plati.ru, the only currencies we accept are cryptocurrencies after all. We do this to provide a service for cryptocurrency users, not for the profit.
Now please fuck off, thanks :)
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:01:12
I do not understand. We accept 0 conf transactions but only with enough transaction confidence. For that you must pay enough fee to be in the next blocks. Just use a site like this to find the correct fee: 
If too little fee is paid and transaction confidence is too low we will require 1 confirm and the transaction may time out if it takes way too long.

No, this is for worldwide use. It has no region lock. When you activate the gift card in your Steam account, the amount is automatically converted to your local currency for your Steam region.

" As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on  our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin. "

@_date: 2019-06-30 19:59:39
We agree, we think the fee is too high and we are working as good we can to reduce it. Currently we are locked to this fee as there is no partner for SEK that offers a lower price that we could use. We are working on getting a license as crypto exchange in Norway so that we can have our own conversion than using partners and beat the competitors also on fee.
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:56:51
Any exchange that charge in fiat currency digitally for example credit card or bank transfer, before giving you cryptocurrency, do get and store your personal information even if they wouldnt want to so your only alternative there is converting from cash in person with someone.

Windows 10 is new, it was launched july 29 this year.
We decided to add Windows to our collection because we got a lot of requests for it. It is the OS that the majority prefers. This is not a matter of recommending it or not. We simply offer a way to buy Windows keys with cryptocurrency, and people can decide for themself if they want to buy or not.
Most of our products are games for pc, which can only be used in the Windows operating system. Therefore it is very relevant to sell Windows as well. If you are a gamer, you simply do not have a choice for most games but to use Windows.
@_date: 2015-11-15 12:29:27
I doubt that you have given up gaming just because of this when you simply could disable the spying or use windows 7 instead.
The spying in Windows 10 can be disabled. Go to the settings and click privacy. There you can go through and disable anything that seems worrying. Read more here: 
Also, there is nothing preventing you from using Windows 7. Most games are compatible with Windows 7 anyhow so that is not a problem as a gamer.

Keys4Coins is not part of any attack on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:12:28
And we give excellent arguments for why we think this. If fees and transaction time keeps on increasing Keys4Coins will be history because prices will go up and nobody will use it. I fail to see how this is an attack. Keys4Coins want higher transaction capacity and less fees as that is extremely important for our business and all other businesses accepting bitcoin.  
Keys4Coins also never stated we are against Segwit if that is what you are thinking. We also support Litecoin, Dogecoin and Dash, and see that more and more customers are using this than BTC. We will support anything that will win in the long term. If bitcoin is not changed for the better no customers are going to use bitcoin anymore but other currencies for this. I am not going to discuss this further. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:58:21
no, read it, not just the title, before you make your opinion
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:05:45
Many people want to buy gift cards because they want to give as gift to someone, adding funds to your own account is not the same as buying a gift card and giving it to someone for their birthday or christmas for example. Buying from Keys4Coins is also very fast and anonymous, on steam you must enter all kinds of details to make a purchase while on k4c you only need to provide the email address for delivery. Gift cards is still one of the most bought products probably because of the convenience of buying them from Keys4Coins. Another thing is we see there is increased purchases, some customers buying multiple gift cards at the same time when prices of cryptos are going up much, probably to "cash out" while price is high and use that later for game purchases.

Thanks... We are sorry but we are not able to do any lower price on this item currently. We have 50 usd steam card for 50 usd and 25 usd steam card for 25 usd though, but we will try to get better deals on steam gift cards in the future
Our main focus is providing games, the gift cards are meant only to buy products on steam that we do not offer. Because as long as we offer a steam game you can get it cheaper than buying from steam.
