Given that Keynes was agreed by both Jimmy and to be an authority, appealing to him was not a fallacy:  
"...It is well known as a fallacy, though it is used in a cogent form when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context."

A good summary of the entire debate.

How did you spend most of 2018 on it when it was uploaded to YouTube in May 2018?
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:09:23
Yes. So they spent max 5 months on it, not the majority of 2018.

From the excerpt you provided it looks like Ver's company got scammed into buying a fake product and, not knowing it was a fake, sold it on. I don't think Ver is perfect, but I don't think what you posted proves at all that he's a scammer. If he were, the case would be against him and not the initial supplier.

But he does... This show was specifically for Ln. He addresses loads of issues with bigger blocks elsewhere.

Could you elaborate?

Open an issue on the repo.

I was gonna ask the same question.

We captured everything in case of this. Here's your comment in case you want it :-P -

Maybe now, but not when I posted.

I don't know enough to say. I'm generally against hot wallets. Hodl in a cold wallet. If you need to make crypto transactions, do so in BTC or BCH with small amounts in another hot wallet (maybe Jaxx?). Again, I don't know enough to confidently refer another wallet.

I have... Copper is ~42.9% more conductive than gold. Silver is only 5% more conductive than copper:

The fact that something is scarce and has utility doesn't matter that much when there are cheap alternatives. If I made a one-of-a-kind lamp, it wouldn't matter if you had other light sources that were cheaper and highly available. Similarly, gold may be scarce and have utility, but there are an abundance of options that provide similar, if not better, utility. Thus, the vast majority of gold's value comes from people's belief in it.
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:10:35
You can do that with copper but its value is like 50x less. Utility makes up such a small part of gold's value.

Huh? I saw Shinobius Monk on the list a couple of days ago.
