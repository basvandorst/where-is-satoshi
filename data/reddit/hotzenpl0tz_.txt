Well, very briefly explained, hopefully I am correct here: if you want to be 100% sure that a transaction is valid, you need to wait for one, better several confirmed blocks. A block takes around 10 minutes on average ... so yes, several minutes if you need the security. But the transaction is spread to nodes in the network a lot faster than the time it takes for it to be included in a new block, and it is verified that it doesn't break the network consensus rules. An example would be that you are spending bitcoins you don't own the key to, which obviously violates the network consensus rules. No proof of ownership via some kind of signature means no valid transaction that gets re-broadcasted. 
This throws out many possible attack vectors  but leaves a few others still open: certain kinds of double-spend attacks are thinkable, where you broadcast a different new state to the network which conflicts with the first broadcast. A place like a coffee shop might just take that risk - a real attacker won't stay put in the shop, a coffee-to-go thief won't destroy your business ;)

I disagree, if I saw the video I would think there are a bunch of bitcoin ATMs where I can insert "real" money and get some virtual money in return on my smartphone app. That is the example they give; they even show a place where you can only buy your coffee with bitcoin or use a vending machine that accepts bitcoin. 
Sure, this is again not a complete picture. It is a lot closer to the ideal you would probably would like, no ?
