Yeah and if I want to ove 0.01$ of BTC it'll cost 1$ aswell.

Wait what? I wanted to get into mining but I thought it was just a few cents per day right now. Any links to this new antminer?

Unless other cryptos take over by simply growing faster than Bitcoin, without Bitcoin necessarily dieing. There's some very promising ones out there.

You're unbelievable lol. Not worth my time. Go learn programming.

Ethereum: Smart Contracts, Decentralized Apps,... Pretty much everything to decentralize things in our daily life.
Oyster: Relatively cheap decentralized storage while also resolving the ad and ad-block problems that websites face.

I'm not a "concern troll". There's a lot of other people who think the exact same way because they have done their research like everyone should. The thing is though that when anyone tries to make a point on this sub, they get banned. You'd see the massive concerns regarding Lightning if you followed others crypto subs except r/Bitcoin .
I'll link one for you but it's not that hard to find more:

This is literally wrong. Literally. 
Miners search for the next block. When they find a block they can choose to append this block to the current chain. 
But they can also choose to keep this block offline and keep mining blocks. If you have 51% of the hashing power, you can find blocks faster than the whole of the bitcoin network combined. This means that I can mine blocks for months (without uploading them to the network) and my chain of blocks will be longer than the current chain of the network. 
When I decide to upload my months of blocks, my (until then private) blockchain will be longer then the current public blockchain. This will cause ALL nodes to override their ledger with my version of the ledger because nodes will always follow the longest chain of blocks.
So if in these months I transferred 10 BTC to an exchange, cashed out and then uploaded my (longer) version of the Blockchain in which I choose to not include the transaction of my wallet to the exchange, I will have my cashed out money + the 10 BTC I previously had, effectively doubling my money.
I can't believe I have to explain a 51% attack to you in such baby terms like it's some crazy theory instead of an undeniable fact. 
If you don't understand it after this, go learn programming and check it out for yourself lmao.

So it's okay to call out Ethereum for being "centralized" but when we touch the same topic with Bitcoin it's a "baseless statement" and "time to call it" ?  Very odd lol
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:53:09
Never said that Ethereum was completely decentralized, but they are at least making efforts to make it PoS. And even if they didn't, he'd still be a hypocrite for calling Ethereum centralized even though Bitcoin is just as bad or even worse.
@_date: 2018-06-06 10:06:24
Lol you really don't know the first thing about Ethereum do you. Or you do, and you're purposely spewing bullshit so people who don't know as much about Ethereum will jump on the hate train.
Either way, it's pathetic and your arguments make no sense. Read up on what decentralization means exactly, because you seem to have no clue.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:54:28
Ethereum, Oyster, Enigma, Privacy Coins,... Oyster being my favourite personally, but it's still a pretty young project.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:33:59
Not hard to have your coin more decentralized that Bitcoin when &gt;50% of Bitcoin's hashing power is in hands of 3-4 mining pools lol.
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:12:35
*Most* of what you're saying is true but you're giving unrelated facts. You write a whole rant about how Ethereum is only 25tx/s but forget that Ethereum has no intention of being a global *currency*, thus doesn't need to have high tx/s. High tx/s is not required for Smart Contract and DApps, but it is for a currency, which is what Bitcoin is trying to do. Bitcoin simply cannot sustain global adoption. 
Lightning is one big fucking joke. Don't kid yourself. It's untested, insecure and comes with loads of disadvantages. If you're willing to go all that trouble, just switch to something like Nano already. It's already been tested up to 300 tx/s and can theoretically do 7000. It has no fees and doesn't need funds locked up in a channel. It also doesn't face some of the numerous concerning attack vectors that Lightning does. Lightning is a joke and if you're willing to take all these risks, why not switch to a crypto that is undeniably better technology-wise.
Also, you didn't write a word about Bitcoin's centralization, very smart evading that topic lol.
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:30:23
Go read up on how the Bitcoin consensus system works because you're not making any sense. Especially this part:


What you're forgetting is that no matter how many decentralized copies there are of the network, they can and will all be overwritten if someone presents a chain that is longer than the one the corresponds to their current ledger. This can happen when an entity has more than 50% of the hashing power.
I'll break it down for you. Miners submit their hashing power to mining pools. Mining pools control all the hashes of the miners that work for them. If a few mining pools combined have more than 50% of the hashing power (which they do, btw), they can conduct a 51% attack which allows for double spends.
These are undeniable facts, which are written in the Bitcoin code that every single Bitcoin node out there is  running. A 51% attack like the one I described could happen right now. 
So again, go read up on the technology or check the Bitcoin code. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:36:59
Doesn't matter how you soon it. Mining power means network control. I don't think you know how this works if you think stronger ASICs coming out is going to be healthy for the network. They will simply join one of the big mining pools and increase centralization. You're delusional if you can't see that.
Regarding Lightning, maybe do your research instead of living in a dreamworld. Very concernkng attack vectors have been documented on Lightning. 
Also, using the amount of wallets as an argument of being the superiour currency? Lmao your arguments are laughable at best.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:47:09
How is shit like this even upvoted. Most of us came here for the technology, not for the "mad gainz". Get rich quick kids seem to have taken over this and many other subreddits. Real shame tbh.
Also, why can't you be interested in any other cryptos than Bitcoin? Technology advances, and cryptocurrency is no exception. There are some beautiful Blockchain projects out there that have no intention of being a currency like Bitcoin is.
I know some will say that it's just a joke but many people on this sub actually take the shit in this post seriously.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:28:56
Again, everyone in this sub seems to be very good at shitting on other cryptos but unfortunately that doesn't make Bitcoin any better. Bitcoin is centralized aswell and shitting on Ethereum for potentially being centralized isn't going to make Bitcoin any more decentralized.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:03:22


How do people keep comeing up with this. Literally &gt;50% of Bitcoin's hashing power is in the hands of 3-4 mining pools. Bitcoin is susceptible to a 51% attack *right now*. 
Decentralization is not a thing Bitcoin has going for it right now.
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:33:23
I hope you're trolling. I hope you are lol.
They don't have to change "consensus" rules in order to conduct a 51% attack. I don't know where you got that from, but it's bullshit.
Read this: 
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:58:37
Everything you just said about Ethereum can be said about Bitcoin aswell lol
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:41:04
Lmao this is really funny tbh. Talking about centralization when 3 of 4 mining pools control &gt;50% of the Bitcoin hashing power. Do you even know how ridiculous that is? 3 or 4 centralized parties could come together right now and just fuck over the whole network. You call that decentralized?
Your argument that Ethereum is only for developers is a laughable argument aswell. Ethereum with all its features has a way bigger potential of becoming used in daily life than a currency that can barely handle 7tx/s. Yes, talking about Bitcoin. Like seriously, how do you expect a 7tx/s currency to become globally adopted?
