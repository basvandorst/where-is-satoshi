I've been watching these Walls all night.. Its like bots putting them up some don't have any intention of selling they are trying to make other people dump and keep price low 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:12:28
Has any1 not been watching the last 24 hours hits 10k bots buy to mid 12s. Bots dump back to 10k repeat 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:22:48
It's already the 1st here... Ill save you the trouble.. Only movement is the traders 
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:48:25
Nice and clean.. Android widget would be nice 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:59:47
It looks like it's hit its bottom for today.. Should level out very soon 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:45:51
This past month almost seems like a group of big players buy around 13k offload at 15k and repeat... I dunno just a wild guess.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:31:42
Awesome right near my work..
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:55:41
Hits like 9800 than bounces back to 12. 5 and repeats 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:25:48
Crazy huh... Weak hands get flushed out real quick in this game...if your not hodling your already losing 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:34:55

@_date: 2018-01-16 02:13:25
Haha Jurassic Park... The 1 and only security guard in the entire park haha 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:47:59
It's a good move I'm sick off all those shit coin scams there all over Facebook. Btc does not need Facebook to survive 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:52:19
Ir as above are good but fees are quite high when trading... Acx.io has huge liquidity for Australia and zero fees when trading only 1percent withdrawal.. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:48:03
Zzz some1 talking charts again zzzz
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:30:47
According to rumours a 17th century a ship captained by One eyed willy filled with coins (perhaps BTC) disseapeared somewere off the coast of Oregon... Its whereabouts are unknown to all except 1 man... That's right Chester copperpot... Maybe zucks found him 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:37:43
Cool calm and collected 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:51:00
At what point do these fkn morons realise you can not classify something as a bubble if it's been around for 10 years...it may be classified as a volatile market there is a difference 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:02:50
Haha I forgot they spared no expense lol 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:14:20
Stick to ur trans forums u weirdo 
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:49:45
Aren't they back up now? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:20:34
Journalism these days.. Instead of researching a fkn story they go online and ask for scenarios that fit the agenda 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:14:43
How good.. This guy knows... He knew Harrison Ford and Wesley snipes were  innocent haha
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:01:20
Exchange? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:43:48
 Another virgin with a keyboard 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:13:39

@_date: 2018-01-10 11:16:28
Hahaha it really was 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:48:09
Lol its bouncing 
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:05:01
Fin review articles put me to sleep... Every1 who has an input in that rubbish thinks they are some God investor every1 has to pay attention 2 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:33:47
Btc is at 32.74% of thr crypto market... Used to be over 55%... Lots of moolah in some other coins 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:00:03
Congrats on the victory...
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:29:12
For all we know its Ai doing this.. Could be whales could be anything... I honestly don't think any1 can give us a correct answer. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:52:54
If btc starts a big run people will be dumping alts and coming back in... 5%swing isn't enough at the moment 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:02:53
All I see is people dumping coins trying to hop on the conga line of 1 other trash coin which seems to be on the up. Not enough people have been burned on alt coins yet... There hearing stories of friends of friends who put in 1k and pulled out 200k. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:35:38
Sounds like an absolute mission... Woukd love my exchange to do all the work haha 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:05:10
You realise whenever they sell there is a buyer
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:57:36
Instead of smashing 50s into a pokie at lunch we can increase our btc stash haha 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:20:39
Lol sounds like people I know 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:20
How long for us over here in aus
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:32:51
Sorry for your loss. If I could help I would but I don't think I have the expertise or knowledge for that. Best advice find a close friend to you who has experience in crypto field. It's sad that when people are put in these situations people just want to take advantage of them 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:22:36
If it keeps gaining momentum they will find it harder and harder to try and manipulate the market 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:55:04
I used part of my superannuation... I carnt touch the money for another 30 years so might as well hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:50:45
How much do you consider enough? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:36:43
so yer ive never had a problem until yesterday. $10 000 refunded back into my account? Never made it to independent reserve. Ive been told by the bank they are looking into it and will get back to me by next week. Fk that feel like suing them for damages if the price increases by then.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:56:50
Haha seriously btc is currently going down from $15200 but the trading price is increasing last trade $16480 haha wtf is going on... What are these people doing? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:20
It's 22 on independent reserve lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:04:30
I thought it would be worse 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:46:09
With the code they send to your home address, you sure you scratched the correct one off? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:56:20
The big 4 banks in australia are fkn criminals 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:09:42
How are there still buyers??
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:58
Ikr... So what happens? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:53:21
You have to understand this is a horrible time of year for investing... Lots of people withdraw funds because they are on holidays.. Most banks are closed transfers are backlogged... New members won't be getting registered. I think we will see a fairly substantial rise once we are back to business mid January 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:45:07
I have an account have not had any issues.. Check your emails again ensure your entering the right code
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:54
People in Australia are still buying for 5k whats wrong with them
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:19:18
I was literally looking at this all week.. I dont get it... Some possible arbitrage trading opportunities if you have trustworthy friends In the usa
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:49:13
People also need to buy Xmas presents....every1 loves a bit of surplus cash to put into crypto but that won't happen at xmas
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:18:38
Much better chance at doing it with an international partner.... Here in Australia we seem to pay overs for everything 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:06:40
I've been wondering the same thing.. Huge walls to sell for either or btc and they aren't opening that up for trading why exactly? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:00:15
It's definitly true... I remember getting notified from coinspot about banks not cooperating. I use Macquarie and haven't had a problem
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:00
I'm all for not only other crypto existing but flourishing... I dont like market manipulation or deception what we saw today was not genuine traders buying because bitcoin cash was on a bull run. It was genuine deception and that's just brings all crypto down so far 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:57:27
Awesome been up since 4am lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:29
This is an absolute mess
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:04:55
The guys an absolute ego maniac why does this surprise you. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:06
Trading is great when u can buy at a low and sell higher... However there has not been any pullback lately it's just getting bigger by the day... So you sell at the high normally you would be increasing your skin in the game however you sell now and you carnt get back into the market any cheaper.. In turn u just lost more money from not holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:25
Bitcoin trash is trading at about 5000 in Australia 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:11
Redditor for 3 days... Crypto wizard right here
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:13:24
Sounds handy.. However don't most whales that are trading just keep on the exchange so they can dump quickly? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:16:13
Love seeing actual posts in the thread other than people posting memes and shooting to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:55:19
"Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response was there anything that could even be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul!" 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:16:25
I love BTC but people on reddit are not the smartest cookies.. they don't want to see the  truth or talk facts.. They post memes.. Mention the word hodl and moon. Anything beyond that seems to much for them 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:11:57
Were do people pull these bullshit figures from... Honestly 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:49:11
It's like common sense ey.. I dont get it.. Like I fkn love bitcoin but I'm not an idiot... Feel free to Hodl I'll just sell and sit out for abit and come back in the market with way more skin in the game 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:00:13

Wait till after Chinese New year 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:08:18
Maybe a small 1 this week.. But after Chinese new year I think all signs point to an increase 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:33:46
Yer whales are wasting time sitting in chat rooms posting  fake articles on reddit so they can buy coins off the internet cheaper... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:39:38
Well said amigo 
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:09:50
What are u talking about? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:13:23
U will get down voted cause truth hurts.. Hodl and moon are thrown around these forums like a bunch of children.. U can believe in the tech.. Doesn't mean u have to invest like a moron 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:19:57
Nobody knows and I can guarantee you won't find the answer on reddit. Go watch netflix come back in 2 weeks after Chinese new year 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:56:27
This has fkn nothing to do with futures.. Seriously people 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:05:10
Nice video mate 
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:49:21
