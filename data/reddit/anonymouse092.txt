How would offline transactions even work? Does “offline” refers to “not connected to the internet” or just off the chain?

@_date: 2019-02-02 06:12:44
No regrets. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:34:14
In a way it was good. People got experience. This was like the great 2008 crash version of Crypto (if taken at face value).
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:21:10
 I’m glad for the pullback.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:43:02
Can I borrow it for a few years?

*shakes paper cup*
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:52:54
I think future BIPs will solve many of the issues.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:44:06
You telling me it isn’t one of the factors? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:25:16
He's not wrong. But neither is he right.

Could someone ELI5 why there needs to be an output for "change"? Doesnt the divisibility of Bitcoin mean exact amounts can be exchanged/transferred/pay for coffee etc?
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:42:35
Hope they don’t pull out soon. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:23:56
Get an Adblock maybe?

Nodes. I think they're nodes.

You solved economics 
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:13:20
I see. It makes more sense now. So basically the wallets are an aggregate of all the transactions. And each transaction sits in its own address that the wallets can read as one big amount. 
EDIT: a letter

Every once in a while, when I'm feeling adventurous, I peep into r/btc. It feels like dipping your toe into a muddy, murky puddle filled with trolls.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:00:41
I think they wanted to create a Bitcoin sub that refuses censorship. Its a drama worthy of a shitty soap opera. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:08:49
I see. So the old address with the initial 1$ is now empty. Say the recipient wants to send some Bitcoin back to the initial sender, could he/she/Apache helicopter send the money to the old address that had the 1$? Or is a new "receiving address" required? Sorry if this is a silly question. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:34:46

But if it’s the opposite of what I think, then I should think the opposite of what I want and then the opposite of that will happen. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:20:58
They’ll be hodling in a lot more things now. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:50:58
Make sure it didn’t get polished by accident today.
