I just want to add something here so that hacker had to have been able to take control of the user's files as well as have a keylogger to break his encrypted password as you said he used a different password for everything is that correct?

please accept dogecoin too, the community is nearly as big as bitcoin's on reddit and significantly bigger than litecoin

you're missing it haqshenas. In africa, most families have a cellphone. They use it to check grain prices every day rather than going to town to do that. This is massive value to them.
They could use the same phone to serve as their bank account. And they could encrypt their wallet and back it up quite easily (its a 5kb file).
It is revolutionary. The time frame is no more than a few years for them to catch on. In countries like Argentina, I would say the time frame is double that as they have the financial and technological means to move to bitcoin already, and they have financial pressure and incentive to do so

do you have any documentation of this? All the sources I have seen say its limited to 1mb per block. I dont see how you could raise that at all without doing a hardfork
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:57:31
Its hard to say but I would say within a few years (upward 5 years) we would see the majority of the largest 500 companies accepting bitcoin

I got an idea, which I know is probably going to be downvoted just because of hate, but why not use dogecoins?? Dogecoins already have 100B volume, so this problem is solved.
Dogecoin's blocksize still has tons of room for growth compared to Bitcoins (which is currently running at about 33% of blocks being filled and will probably run into the block limit in the next bubble (as Havin himself has said)
and Dogecoin has 1 minute blocks, thats a very nice bonus

Bitcoin or other decentalized digital currency won't end this-
Countries(or cities) will still exist, but I would regard them more as companies owning large pieces of land.
And those are governed. And this is good, because it brings stability to the area.
Within those cities, all payments for city or country or state related things are to be paid in that currency, that creates a natural demand for that currency.
And with their currency they can still create bubbles if they want to
ie: in the price of real estate
(and indeed, the world can act in unison. creating a worldwide bubble, much like it already is right now)
People can hold their savings in bitcoin, (but they can do so in gold too right now), so all in, its not very different than the status quo. The main difference is that it is is a bit easier to hold bitcoin or digital currency, and does help you support the causes, companies, organizations you like (via holding and using their currency) outside of your obligated city-related expenses.

Well now the turnover is around 2M, so that would imply bitcoin volume is now around 1000 bitcoins, or $2.35M, is that the case? That would be incredible for a first day of trading

What I dont like about Trevor is that each "hard" backup costs $119. I would rather backup bitcoins on a $5 flashdrive which I could easily make duplicates of and say, hide 5 in different places so I dont have to worry about loss or inability to access.

Show me another application that allows for a user to essentially have a "bank account" that is set up without any identity verification, instantly, without virtually any fees and is extremely secure - and by which the user can virtually instantly send money to anyone in the world.

Is this ETN backed by any bitcoins? If so how many? 
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:57:38
Just to note, it's hitting a weekly volume of around $500k USD, not that GBTC which has been out 2 weeks is hitting weekly volumes of over a million, just for perspective

There is no way consensus is reached this fast plus it's not the choice of the core developers to make, it's a choice of the community especially considering how it requires a hard fork. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:33:12
From what I understand that have a certain number of bitcoins that they are selling to the public through those shares (which can be redeemed at 2 different times per year). What I am trying to find out is how many bitcoins worth of shares they are selling before they have no more to sell (and thus people will have to buy from each other people's existing shares rather than them).

and a rogue employee in a US bank could try to steal customer funds- in fact I've heard of this happening before. Obviously the employee was fired and reprimanded, this is the same in any kind of business where trust is needed (which is most businesses, think retail where a cashier can steal from the drawer).
Again, a pin confirmation should solve this and at worst people could use their phones as "hot wallets" and do secure or larger transactions when they go to town and have access to the internet.

I mean in relative terms. Though you have to consider that bitcoin is becoming less dominant in the cryptocurrency space. In summer 2013, bitcoin was over 99% of the market cap of cryptocurrencies.
Today (largely due to the growth of ripple), its close to 85%, I believe this trend is going to continue (where soon, bitcoin may be only 50% of the total market cap, and eventually less than that).
Further, as I discuss in my video, I think we as people will chose to try to use the currency we support. I think there will be a few dominant currencies (at least 2), vying for control. 2 sides is always efficient for evolution. Consider democrats and republicans, the evolution that occurs because each side is fighting for a variety of different issues.
zombiecoiner made some good points as well.

From what I understand coinbase doesnt have a ticker symbol for bitcoin that trades on a the stock exchange, so no, they haven't outdone the Winklevoss twins in that regard.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:33:56
Most people already have phones and are using them as I said in my original post (penetration is between 50-80%).
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:28:34
I would say you wouldn't. You could send a text to the company's account setup phone number, with the word "Start" or something similar, and then it texts you back and asks you for a pin, and bam, you're started.
Whenever you get a chance to go to a place where it has internet access you can add more featuers and setup an account with email backup, etc.

Toilets and clean water are expensive (along with other things like quality food, shelter, automobiles). Technology has become quite cheap relative to these things, especially 10 year old brick phones and 5kb message transmissions.
And also it costs 1-2 cents per text message, not 30 cents, as I indicated in my original post
some sources: 
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:17:39
I agree with OKaythebear, if you are tipping people outside the community, tip only $1 or more, for people outside the community 10c is exactly that, 10c, which is basically nothing.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:17:52
Actually its about $5m --but good on you for pointing out the past year's volume and doing most of the math ;)
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:40:18
Nearly so. They dont have as many smart phones but most have basic phones. Look it up.
Edit, heres a source for you:

I would say its smarter for this bot to do tips of $1 but far less frequently. 
Why? yeah then it actually gains attention of people in the forums, this 2c crap is just spam (most people who recieve these tips, see it as that 2 cents, not something that thought exponentially increase in value.
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:07:41
That happened over 6 months though, we have been in a downtrend now for over a year. Taking into consideration that bitcoin has had a significant growth rate since its inception, to match the magnitude of that fall would give us a higher bottom that.

This. Free knowledge is also only one facet of the internet, how about internet communication (ie: skype, facebook, etc), and the internet economy at large sans bitcoin (ie: the existing amazon, ebay, and millions of other ecommerce sites, etc)

Thank you for posting this, came here to say this. Blows my mind when I hear people say bitcoin is bigger than the internet, they clearly havent thought enough about it.
