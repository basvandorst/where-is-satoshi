In the Newsweek article, they mentioned that they a lot of CW's education background had been followed up and verified. 




The exception being his supposed Doctorate of Theology, which you could reasonably conclude that he does not have based on the shenanigans that have ensued this week (I'm assuming he's referencing that in his "drcraigwright" moniker and web address). 
Given the current knowledge in the community about Craig's fraudulent patterns of behavior, I think this should also call in to question the validity of said degrees. 
I don't doubt that The Economist did their due diligence in investigating whether those degrees had been obtained, and I guess he may have a quirky, but perhaps malapplied brilliance. However, I admit that I'm suspicious about *how* the degrees were earned/obtained, which appears very suspect now (to me).  He seems to have a propensity for plagiarism in his writing. I question whether they were earned legitimately - were his advisers also victims of his plagiarism? Did he use assistants (virtual or otherwise), to complete course work and tests (much of it was distance learning after all)?
