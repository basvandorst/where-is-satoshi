Why's that? Did you have some unpleasant experience with our wallet? What happened, if we may ask?

Atomic Wallet is completely secure. It is a non-custodial wallet that gives you full control over your funds. All your private keys are encrypted on your device and protected with a 12-word mnemonic seed.
We use open-source libraries and block explorer to display all information on your funds, but never have access to them.
We'll be happy to answer all your questions about Atomic on social media or telegram channel :)
