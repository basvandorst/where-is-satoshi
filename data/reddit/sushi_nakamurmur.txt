You missed part where is say that you can buy and sell only through the exchanges.
It’s still great piece of news.
However, if exchanges are owned by government or oligarchs- then forget about privacy

@_date: 2017-12-26 05:26:48
I believe you are taking about changetip bot.
The company closed, because it didn’t get much traction.
And if you think carefully  you were part of the reason why it didn’t. 
Sorry for being blunt, but that’s how I see it.
And now you want “your free bitcoins”. 
Maybe start giving to the community instead of asking and taking.

Trade crypto to crypto in not taxable! Stop spreading misinformation.
You are trading same asset group with similar risks without exiting into fiat. So you don’t pay taxes if you had never seen dollars. And even if you exit from one crypto into dollars and buy another crypto - it’s still can be considered as switching within one asset class.
Please, do you research before you do anything.
I spoke with my CPA.

1. Make sure that fork actually happens
2. Own your private keys
3. Use guide ( it'll be wildly popular) for splitting coins after fork

Andreas is amazing. Besides of what you know about him- he is a very modest and humble man. 
Right now he is trying to scale the amount of information and education he brings out to the world.
He is writing books and doing interviews non-stop. Andreas is giving himself away to the space, by creating educational infrastructure for crypto from scratch.
Oh, and one more thing, he doesn’t have thousands or even hundreds of bitcoins. 
He. Does. Not.
And he will never ask you for donation or anything like that. Maybe once a month he will tweet out about patreon.
That’s it.
So it’s ok to do for him, that he has been doing for the space for the last 4.5 years.

1. Don’t tell anyone that you own bitcoins, especially this many.
2. Spend couple of weeks understanding what you got and how to cash out. Spend time to understand the technology.

(repost of my comment from different sub )Guys, please, be careful. New type of FUD is coming. Like this one :
Long post
Yes, I’m long term HODLer, but it’s time to quit at least for now
Series of unfounded “ facts”, connected with faulty logic
And the worst part is that noobs will upvote already upvoted stuff, giving it more “validation” to other noobs in means of upvote.
I have suggestions how to deal with it, but community might think that it’s draconian, therefore unvalidating the whole comment
