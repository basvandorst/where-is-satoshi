Everybody here likes to chirp doge, but without it would have never came to the conclusion that "its more fun to own 1000 of something than .0001 of something. Dont hate the altcoins. They grab new users and eventually migrate to bitcoin.

Xbox advertised a game to Me and when I tried to buy it I couldn't?  I would have never tried to buy it, had it not been on the available download list.  Why is that my fault for assuming that a game on my list has credentials. This is called False advertising.

Good fucking grief I turned this shit off the moment he revealed his "SpearHead". "People lost money off gox" Well tough shit buddy. How many times has it been said don't keep your BTC in an online wallet?, Same goes for exchanges. I'm tired of this same old argument. It was unfortunate yes. But i'm smart enough to not put my money in an online wallet.

I don't have 2 BTC's to rub together. BUT i do spend where i can. Supports gotta work both ways.
If i can personally give someone some BTC and have them remember about it later on in the day. Its a win. If they get interested its an even bigger win.
I loose... At the most some shithead telling me 20 years from now "HEY BUD, HOWS THAT BITCORN THING DOIN?"

Have you thought about doing a Partnership with the phil parsons team and dogecoin. Id love to see a "Crypto Team" on the racetrack. All crypto's are in the same boat.
