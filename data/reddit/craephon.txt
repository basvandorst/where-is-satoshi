In hindsight, openly challenging the dollar with bitcoin might have, in fact, been bad for bitcoin. We need to focus on bitcoin being a speculative store of value, and IF ANYTHING it may threaten gold. Then our government overlords might get off our backs a little bit. We have nothing to lose by adjusting the narrative like that
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:05:26
But 30 million was not actually lost was it? I mean, if it was all at 100x, it could have just been $30,000 that was lost right?
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:04:38
gold has a chart?
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:30:47
So... it's like someone placed a $30 million dollar bet that bitcoin wouldn't go up from here. Then, they lost the $30 million within a matter of minutes. (still trying to understand... for instance, do shorts which had stop losses in place also contribute to this number - or just flat-out liquidations where the individual lost their entire position?)  
on a separate note, I just saw the bitmexrekt got suspended on twitter. Wow.

You're one of the few that would remain. Not everyone can sleep at night making such choices.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:06:03
only some? I'd say you're doing pretty darn good.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:30:23
No no, you just get liquidated. Meaning, the 76k goes down 100%. Otherwise 100x leverage would be a terrible business model for exchanges... They would have thousands of people who owe them millions of dollars... Err maybe that's a great business model, but no one would do it lol, but what do I know, I won't touch leverage

Well if you're using any exchange that connects to a bank account and you withdraw youre going to have to declare? I don't know I'm kinda new to this

I think it came early..
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:59:00
think of it this way... if one of the western countries had gone first, then much of the western world might follow, but since communist China went first, well, western countries don't want to be perceived as communist China, so they are less likely now to impose the same draconian measures as China. so, yes... in the long term, this is good for the longevity and health of crypto

@_date: 2018-07-24 17:44:19
Yup. People will always try find the easiest justification. Occam's razor is often a lagging indicator and useless exercise in markets. By the time you try and find a reason for why something happened, it is already too late.

So much money... So late in the game... The future is uncertain with Bitcoin with all the scaling drama. Personally, I'd think long and hard about such a move.

Use multiple exchanges such as coinbase, Gemini, CEX and maybe a small amount on kraken just to prime the pump in case you want to use them. These companies are cautious, so I don't think you'll be able to convince them to let you get it all at once. You'll have to onboard your funds in steps like the rest of us I suppose unless you are willing to use localbitcoins, which... Yeah, could be kind of shady.
My suggestion is start right now and get verified with multiple exchanges and start the transfers immediately even if you can only do smaller amounts at first. Do this while you are still searching for greater thru-put. I know people who never went through any of the processes because they were dismayed with the limits and they ended up massively regretting it later.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:41:10
Haha I can relate :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:41:59
I think one reason is because all of the exchange pairs are ???/BTC - so, BTC is constantly having to be used, reluctantly I think  by many, just so they can get access to other cryptos

Time for Ethereum blockchain-based, decentralized operating system.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:01:15
Ahh, but its perceived value *is* attached to things! Namely, trading pairs. BTC/USD or ETH/BTC for example. Bitcoin's value is measured in reference to the currencies it is *attached to*. You see, your question contains  the answer to itself by using the word "price".
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:35:42
Kraken or Gemini maybe? I'd just get approved at all of them and see which one works best for you

I use Coin Tracking personally and I love it. Takes care of all of this and calculates whichever tax report you would like (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, etc...). Takes some time to get all your trades and transfers entered properly, but totally worth it. Here's my referral link if it looks like something you would like:
