I dont want to retire at 65, I want to save 50% of my hypotetical income from now (30) and I want to know retire earliest possible. So Am i wrong that I need like 5-10 BTC to retire in next 5-10 years?

I liked the speech of Andreas Antonop who said that Libra will be nightmare for central banks controlling weak currencies... If people can buy libra (which is backed by USD and EUR) it will be much stronger currency than bolivar, turkish lira, argentinian peso... What would goverments do? Ban Facebook?  And what when people realize that facebookcoin is longterm worse storeof value than bitcoin... They will be blown away when they wake up...

You buy 100 000 bitcoins on CFD platforms on leverage 1:100 (bitmex). It looks like you need to pay money if the price is not going where CFD platform like it... You instantly sell 1000 BTC at market and you rekt them. People are stupid. They just buy/sell and dont counterleverage it elsewhere.

Economy needs to be pushed because governments use inflation to pay down unpayable debts. This is construct by central banks. Look at it as a declined road government drive on. Its beneficial at the start but after some time they get free money they will see there is not really difference from the flat road before. Other people than government have it oposite, they have to go into same incline with more energy. To compensate. Best scenario for central bank is hyperinflation aka freefall and its worst case for economy and people because vertical wall is hard to climb. Perfect balance is 0 inflation because it doesnt push for malinvestments just because you are otherwise losing money thanks to inflation. 2% optimum is a lie. Its optimum for central banks and governments. Optimum for people would be -2%

OK lets assume you will pay owners of the roads by GPS. Even on Times Square NY, owner will set price per car for users. Therefore he can focus on maximizing profit for heavy traffic flow, or reduce congestion, or set is as no car area. Only by changing of the prices.

For reversal of the trend you need positive sentiment over long period of the time, not short time. People will buy and promote rising more... More will buy and then the avalanche. Or you can dive more deep directly and start uptrend faster.

In hyperbitcoinization there is exponential growth... At current price there is still a lot of bought bitcoins when the price was lower (1000$) So after they will be sold for 2000-10 000, after that there will be pressure to rise of the price.

These goldcoins have nominal value much lesser than the gold value which is made off. Nobody will give you coin that says 1GBP which has gold value for example 100 GBP But you can pay 1 GBP with this coin and pay no taxes, because you will be stupid. Otherwise you have to calculate profit between the time when you acquired them and sold them for something.

I think the biggest problem is they cannot see out of their bubble, where some **things are sacred and solid as a wall** For example: Banks, pensions, state, government, gravity, oxygen, roads, police. They didnt even thought about that it can be different or even without presence of it. People dont see there is possibility to run things other way around. 
Same is for eco-people. They dont see that real problem is not polution, but number of people. That easiest solution is to help environment is to get rid of 6-7 of 8 billion of people. You can chose the way. War/disease/hunger/drought/collapseoffiatmoney... They will do la-la-la-la-la with plugged ears and continue to ban straws and plastic bags.

But for the first time, you cannot be sure if all transfers will proceed and you dont do very expensive mistake.

Price of the food will raise faster than your income. You have to choose if eat or pay debt and sacrifice gold... Otherwise they will take your property. So you want to be debtfree to keep gold to exchange it in the right time for best asset you can get.

In peak o last year rally I have taken out everything i put in bitcoin and I was left with some of it. So I dont have my skin in the game. Sometimes i just wonder why bitcoin didnt died already. I know why… People will always be greedy and central banks will always print money. There is no other way around than longterm rising value of bitcoin. Buy low, sell high. Just wait for the next financial crysis to come to see how bitcoin will react... Buy low, when high, take out everything you have put in, but leave the profit inside. This way you accumulate bitcoin and you will not have anything in "The Game" - did you lost?

It makes sense to buy more. At first I put huge amount of money into it. Then withdrawed during peak. Now it rests and iam watching the leftovers going from 19K to 6K. Iam not worried or selling anything. I will just buy more maybe next month when the price will floor before next rampup. I dont know why people dont se it in wider perspective. If you will buy 20M bitcoins and there will be massive shortage of it on the market, the price will skyrocket and you can then sell then slowly for major profit. (Same is for stocks/bonds/housing...) As soon as people understand that they need to make huge shortage on the market to make real profit, the faster the price will go up. On the opposit when crysis starts, there is always flood of everything and price go down... Thats the principle of rising prices of eggs during easter, turkey on thanksgiving... You have to make shortage of anything. When i unzoom Price chart on GDAX (that tide graph in the middle) you can see 12K BTC to buy and 4K BTC to sell. If I remember correctly, the chart on november looked like 9K to buy and 3K to sell. We only need to shrink the market now. There is too much BTC on markets. Yeah a lot of people want to get rich, but this time is best time to buy BTC from weak hands and just wait for opportunity.

There are a lot of people who dont mine for current profit, but for future profit with a lot of money, so they can subsidize the current loses. Also you have 9 years history of possible unsold bitcoins when mining was much cheaper. So there can be very long time period with price under the mining price. Mining price at this moment means nothing. But ultimatly, this cant go on forever, someday this inevitably needs to switch to other side and comes the boom !

1) Do the oposite. Dont hold it. Trade it... You will cry after 14 days... Hodlers are massive movement to keep the price high enough. They keep price stability. Otherwise price would go from 0$ to 1M$ in a day and back.
2) What does mean gun and drug bans for the price and market demand of drugs and guns? It makes them more desirable and more expensive. (Safety premium)
3) and 4) There can be only one major cryptocurrency and rest will be dust. Supply and demand. There needs to be major currency (where you save money, even at world level) and the rest can be used to do buy cofee.

Gold is more stable... If you want store of value, you need the material to not decay. Therefore there is much more gold above gold than it is used every year. For example 60x. So if price skyrockets, there is no way how to inflate amount of gold on the market by mining than from releasing it from storage vualts. Meanwhile, we are stocking 1 year worth of silver, which decays and you can double mining and reduce price of silver on half... Do you see the point? Ammo on deserted ammo is a store of value, while water from river cannot be, because each time its price increases, you can go and collect more of it...

IT decreases inflation of bitcoin below inflation of USD/EUR and all major world currencies. So after that it will be mathematically sure, it will increase the value in these currencies even if demand will be the same and even if number of people using bitcoin will be the same. This is huge. Ordinary people dont see this. Its like when there is very hot weather outside and everyone is running out of water while you have stored huge amount of it. Price will increase dramatically once they see how unprepared they are.

Denying holocaust law is the most stupid law ever made and can hide most important lies ever. Religion banned other point of view on how life and Earth started and banned and imprisoned and burned everyone who disagreed... Now people "believe in goverment and states" Statism is new religion... Truth needs to be challenged. If only one version is used and is forced by law, it will end badly.

Need for inflation is biggest lie teached in school. You can have monetary system on the island based on rocks. Its deflationary. It works. You store stones for example in house construction and it still supports economy because somebody needs to build it and you will pay with excess of rocks you have. Poor people will just use wood or sand. Inflation and forced use of one money just promotes spending, debt slavery and tax slavery... and not what we really need - saving economy and sound money. Thats why people in USA are debt slave. Medical, university, car, house... Everything in USA is debt to be payed later. Dont spend money you dont have on things that dont yet exist.

You can basicaly buy a house with mortgage, where you benefit from inflation, where more money is born and each months payment is cheaper in buying power point of view, but you risk when you dont have income in future... Or you can save in deflationary money to buy house. Its the same but without risk. 
Saving in inflationary resources is stupid because you lose buypower, so you have to risk and spend money you dont have. So there is tendency not to save and become a slave. Deflationary money dont have this problem. But that doesnt mean there can be only one money- we can use both of them. But only one of them ends up in hyperinflation when coeexisting.
So in inflation system you either buy useless crap, or buypower is stolen from you via inflation, or you become slave. There i no other variant what you can do with money.

How can you pay 1gram of gold from america to person in EU in year 1600? You will not send a lone ship across ocean containing 1gram of gold, that will be expensive like hell... You will tell someone who is sailing to Europe that you will give him 1,01g of gold if he gives 1g of gold to person in Europe.
Closest we can get right now is to open "lightning channel" and pay with it with lower fees very close to 0. When the price of bitcoin will be 10-100x higher, majority of transactions will be utilized with something like "lightning network" and people will not buy bitcoin directly, but in "lightning banks" which will be interconnected via bitcoin network.
So in the future you will not need to have ship to ship 1g of gold, but you will just pay a man to transfer value over the ocean for very small fraction of it.... Is it clearer now?
Today you dont really have this kind of problem... If you put your salary on bitcoin network, you will just pay 4 dollar for it and you dont care, because its like 0,1-1% of the amount you send. Its nothing. If the price rises 100x, you wouldnt care at all too, beacuse instead of 4000$ you will have 400 000$ and the fee will be the same 1%.

Inflation is 2-3% central banks says...
**Reality is this**
The price rises in the Czech Republic. In February, inflation grew the most year over the last six years. Mainly prices of basic food, energy and fuel are growing rapidly. And according to economists, it will be worse. However, prices are also rising for services. According to analysts, entrepreneurs are said to be unable to cover rising costs and must raise prices. But they are supposed to do it by little steps, so that if possible, the customer does not notice it.
If we compare last year's second year with this year, February's inflation rose almost by one percent. "This will, of course, be reflected in an increase in household spending, as it is mostly consumables and services," said economist Ivan Jac.
Perhaps the highest price jump is for food. Especially in vegetables, which in a month or so, averaged a quarter. The most striking is potato, whose price rose by a record 67% month on month. A 15% drop in egg prices didn't save it. The result is more expensive restaurants.
Also, holiday, culture and routine prices have increased by almost 5%. And fuel prices are also rising slightly. "Even though fuel prices are rising at a fluctuating pace, we can still see a slight increase in their prices," Jac said.
For example, in Liberec fuel prices per liter are already attacking the 35-crown border. And housing costs are rising. Prices of electricity by 9%, natural gas by 3.6%, heat and hot water by 4%. The only thing that makes things cheaper is real estate prices, but only somewhere. "Except for Prague, where there is a steady increase, in some regions prices are already falling because they have already reached a certain limit," the economist added.
And we'll spend more on cutting. Hairdressers kept prices unchanged for several years. This is no longer possible now. "Since February 1, we had to raise from 150 to 200 crowns. Everything is more expensive. Social, electricity, rent. explained the head of hairdresser Andrea Tomášková.
According to economists, construction can do whatever it wants. In addition, price rises in this sector may not look so much for competition, because the market is so hungry that it cannot bring or increase the outflow of customers. "Polystyrene by 10%, bricks by 10%, just services cannot stay the same. We have to increase the price of overall work and services and offer prices. It has no effect on demand because there are few people to work with," said businessman Jan Cermak.
Tire services and car repair shops are also going to be more expensive. However, according to the head of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, there is no reason to panic yet. It will depend on how the economy will behave in the coming months.
"Inputs are growing, but purchasing power is growing. So far, a small increase in prices has not resulted in a negative effect of buying less. This may not go on forever because any measure of economic shock or mild instability will immediately be reflected in people's attention and start to save money, "said Karel Havlíček, Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic.

Bitcoin turns energy into proof that you burned that energy to obtain it. You can later sell this certificate of burning energy to someone else. Same is with gold mining. By owning gold you prove that you spend at least some kind of energy to find it, or you spend money to get it from someone else. Advantage of bitcoin is that you cannot steal it from someone else if the person is not willing to give it to you or is just plain stupid.

Same story as every time. They will sell you used dusted off equipment after they run it for at least half year until profitability is very low for them in first world country and sell it for the full price with insane profit.

If I buy 15milion BTC right now and hold it for 50 years...

Why do we mine gold if PoW is stupid? Mining of gold requires energy/equipment/time/knowledge.... We should pay with things than can be easily replaced by any other things... Like fiat money out of thin air, or crypto that requires no mining at all. We just should agree about what rules we apply and which transactions can we democratically refuse and which wallets should we ban... just PoS... WTF did I just typed. We need PoW. There is no other way. Even stinky FIAT has proof of work. When you borrow money, you have to pay back more than you have borrowed - thats the additional work. Bitcoin cannot be beaten by something with absolutly no PoW.

If excahnge like coinbase take 0,3% from each transaction, they can take 0,15% of BTC and 0,15% of fiat. Now they have for example 1bilion in fiat and 1 bilion in BTC. They have 2 posibilities:
    1) Use fiat to pay employee, electricity, rent...
    2) Sell BTC and keep fiat as a profit...
    It depends what coinbase believe in, what has future... They can be dumping BTC to pay rent in offices... Everybody forgets about this.

Now is the time to chose the side. If 95% of people report crypto gains, there will be pressure to tax it for everyone. If there will report only 5% of people, nobody will force it. Chose your side. Will you give bully your launch at the first day at school and keep giving it to him for rest of your life, or you will fight to have the right to not give it to them on first day?

Speaking about food. Here in EU they raised prices a little bit and decreased sizes of portion at the same time. For example they dont sell 1kg, but 900g, the dont sell 500g but 450g... at the same time they increase prices. Everything has market value and is not regulated, but agriculture is heavily subsidized more and more. So the farmers are selling under the real price because they get money from goverment. Goverment is also inflating public debt this way even in these "good times of prosperity". From the Venezuela point of view, how close we are to deep shit situation when everybody notices?

"Just like there is no market demand for a smaller internet knock-off, there was never any real demand for a smaller, unsafe, unreliable, untested, new Bitcoin alternative.
Bitcoin is the first and most battle-tested cryptocurrency. It has the highest network hash rate. It has died over 300 times. Yet, it’s still here, working as intended with 99.99 percent uptime — making it the logical choice for investors to park their money."

If tether have any problem it will lose peg to usd. People watching tether go to 0.5usd would buy it because were told its 1=1... 
Different view: as it will lose value, people will panic and will buy btc with it, pushing price of btc up and tether more down. There will be some temporary spike at btc and abyss at tether but after that it will balance out with huge oportunities  on both sides. 
In both cases it will be the same as theowing stone in lake. Only waves. It doesnt change fundamentals.
