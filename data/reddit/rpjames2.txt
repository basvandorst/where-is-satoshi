btc doesnt take long at all. If you use segwit it's much faster. Sure, I have had to wait hours before, but it's the same wait till if you send 1 dollar worth or 1 billion worth. and when lightening and the other side chains/drive chain get built, it will be almost instantaneous. As for the fees, it's great that they are high, which means people are willing to pay higher fees to use the service, so again, it's a positive. With time, the fees will come down. Why did you buy ltc and iota?

No one is ever scared, this is bitcoin and crypto. These 50% " dips" are fun and you just need to buy more and not panic, don't get scared. If you are scared, you invested too much, so just sell until you have an amount that is comfortable for you to lose. Bitcoin will hit one million usd in the future, so any price under that is a steal and a joke. Even if we dip to 100 bucks today, so what? Just buy more and enjoy the ride higher...
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:47:40
Yes, and about 4 million coins have been lost already. Also, 99% will have been mined by the year 2030, so people will slowly begin to wake up. With alts, a few of them will survive, but that money will flow back into btc, the question is, which alts are worth our time and investment? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:31:35
It doesn't matter if 6 billion people sign this, coinbase is just after profits and fees and segwit decreases its fees, so they won't implement it.

Yea, maybe in 2499. Right now, only 2% of the entire world has even heard of btc, let along owns any. Hype will never die down, since people will always want btc, if you own a ' whole btc' you will be looked upon as a God, as lucky, stories will be told of those people... Sure, some shitcoins are going up 10,000% and more and bitcoin sucks so bad, its only up 1300% in 2017, and course a few people bought at 20k, and are down 45%, but by end of 2018, we shall be at least 50k, so they will all have a gain on their purchase.

if every country banned it, btc would be 100k tomorrow, since it would be even more scarce than now. and russia, china, vietman already banned it, then unbanned it, then banned it again, so it doesn't matter. you don't need permission from any country to be in btc. True, they could make the onramps, like coinbase and exchanges illegal, which would make it harder to get...

Yea, try and take out your own money from the bank. They file a SAR on you and ask you 10 questions. Or try and take 10k thru customs, to a different country, you need to declare it, they think you are a criminal...  So for me, I will gladly wait an hour to have my confirmation confirmed, if i pay a higher fee, it goes into the next block. Imagine being an 18 year old, growing up with this technology and then going to the bank and having to fill out all those forms, and then being told, your money will be there in 2-3 days, or come back during normal business hours since we don't have that kind of cash here and have to order it from the FED, or sat/sun night, we are not open, so please wait till Monday morning if it's urgent...
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:46:17
Math. The price will be much higher than that, since we won't value things in dollar terms anymore. Research " the S curve" we are still very early on and things will get better in the future, so these prices are pennies now...

@_date: 2017-12-15 17:45:48
those are worthless. Since you can always mine more silver/gold. I bought SLV call options, 2 years ago, that are 99% worthless. I thought deutsche bank would fail, all these derivatives would crash the financial system, and what happened? DB doubled, QE continued and the stock market goes to all time highs, due to the 24/7 money printing.  I know its hard, but gold/silver are rigged daily on the LBMA and we don't even know how much silver/gold is out there. And we can just mine billions of more ounces on asteroids, moon, which would increase the supply 100000x ( or whatever that % is).  But with bitcoin, we know only 21 million will ever be mined, but already 4 million have been lost and daily, only about 5 million change hands. So its price, in usd, will keep going up. CME futures on sunday night, will push it ever further. Most futures accounts need margin of 5x the amount of btc to go short, while you need to only put up 1/2 btc to go long. Everyone wants a piece of this new asset. And also, when was the last time a commodity was listed on the futures exchange? 40 years ago, so this is a totally new asset, a new play toy for Wall Street, they will pump the shit out of it, they blow up every bubble, larger and larger...
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:01:56
I welcome volatility, it will shake the noobs out, make them scared. Most of us just hold and smile. I think many future traders won't be ready the way btc moves and will get margin called and rekt. It will be fun times. The path of least resistance is still up and richard heart thinks we hit 20k by end of the year, once wall street enters, and I tend to agree with him.

Yes it will. The us dollar and every fiat in the world is worthless, it's purchasing power is almost zero, inflation kills it, bitcoin is the only asset that is deflationary ( even though as of now, it's still inflating a little bit). Wall street and nation states will print their fiat and will buy bitcoin, driving up its price ( in dollar terms) . But to me 1btc = 1 btc

Bitcoin is going to the moon. There is no doubt. The question is when? By 2020 we should be at 100k, mcafee thinks 500k-1 million. So why would you sell at 11,000? and worse, why would you accept worthless us dollars ( or fiat) for your precious bitcoins?

What happens if coinbase disappears tomorrow, or their web site goes offline forever? Your coins are now gone. But, but I had them in that coinbase vault, or their new service, where companies will pay them 100k " set up fee" and then a certain % each month to ' feel extra safe.'  About 50% of the world is dumb, and yes I agree people will pay others to watch over their money since " they are the experts, they have the fancy degrees, certifications"  I don't care about all that. If everyone would learn about safety, security, Op sec, they would feel so much better...

Yes. People will be asking that at 500k, 1 million, 10 million etc. As long as bitcoin continues to function and blocks are mined every 10 minutes or so, yes, you will be ok. Sure, at times, it will be bumpy, but 40% dips can be fun too ;-)

There doesn't "have" to be a correction. Bitcoin is new, unlike anything we have every seen. The rules are being broken daily. Sure, if you use technical analysis, you need a pullback, some say bullshit like " too hard, too fast" or other bullshit.   I never ask " am I getting a good deal?" since the answer is  Fuck yes!  Every day bitcoin is available to buy, it's a great deal. Remember, 4 million btc have already been lost. Only 1800 are mined per day, and in 2 years, that drops to 900. Wall Street is not even in yet. Many people are all waiting for ' the dip.'  It dips almost daily. So buy when you can, dollar cost average if you can, hell, some people are taking out mortgages, selling kidneys and eating left testicles to get in....

1/ A note on what's "sensible." This parabolic move isn't moderately sensible. It's gone far past euphoria. It's caused FOMO over and over and over again. I can tell you after I've look at most of the parabolic moves of the last 100 years, this is an entirely different beast.
2/ You have to throw out all models of what "feels" or is a "normal" time that something tops, or corrects. I am convinced that the way this thing is going to behave is going to be literally designed to make you part with your coins and completely spin you around.
3/ This little consolidation up here sent everyone bonkers, and it was near ATH most of the time. The volatility is going to kick up further and it's going to be even worse whipsaws than before. My point is, when you feel like it's going to correct or top, it probably wont.
4/ Sticking to the basic rules: euphoria is vertical wide ranging candles that cover huge ground rapidly, and bottoms are vertical decline whipsaws that create multiple long wicks are going to be the best tool to figure out where we are in the gym of the market.
5/ Otherwise, just HODL it's going much higher. We are charting the S curve. I am convinced of it.

The deficit doesn't matter. It's already at 21 trillion and no one cares. Every country in the WORLD is just printing and increasing their deficits. The dollar is basically worthless, hence the smart nations will print fiat and buy bitcoin with it, since that is a true asset, and its deflationary too.

That's the fallacy on your argument. Why would large addresses ' start to cash out?'  There is nothing to ' cash out to'  In the future, things will be priced in bitcoin. So yes, they are hoarding now, but once we are stable around 100-500k, you will see the buying of houses, lambos, real estate with only .10 btc and the velocity will increase. For now, use those dollars, while you can...

I agree. I saw the dollar amount too, since the normal person wouldn't understand if you started quoting him in satoshis. Or saying btc ratios. But the rule I live by, 1 btc= 1 btc. The dollar is what is dying. A few places you can buy a lambo or house with btc, i think in the next 10 years many places will accept btc, and will prefer that to fiat currency. Perhaps they will give 5% discounts if you pay in btc, or something...

Yes, I totally agree. I bought puts on Deutsch Bank last year/earlier this year, since I thought all their unfunded obligation, derivatives would bring down the entire banking sector, and yet their stock doubled over a few months and due to market rigging etc, my puts were worthless. But the liabilities and derivatives are still there, growing, getting worse and worse. So yes, usa has 200 trillion or more and one day, the music will stop, there will be a cascading failure with all the banks, since they are all tied together. But for now, the market goes higher and higher, almost daily, every piece of bad news is spun to sound positive, every bad quarter for a company is labeled as the ' kitchen sink quarter' etc. That's why I left the stock market 1.5 years ago. Got tired of the silver/gold rigging, day after day. p/e ratio don't matter anymore, worse case the analyst say " it's a bit frothy."  10 years ago a p/e of 25 was considered expensive, now, it's normal and in some cases ' undervalued due to their growth prospects.'  I still don't understand why people turn to the US dollar in a time of crises, why the dollar is worth anything at all, since it has lost 99.7% of its purchasing power these last 100 years and can be just printed, daily, in whatever amount they need. I think it was Paul Krugman, who joked a few years back, that they could print a trillion dollar bill and pay off the national debt? They may still try that, but lucky for us, we have real assets in our lives, bitcoin.

First off, 14-19k for a single bitcoin is very cheap, since a bitcoin will be worth millions of usd in the future. Secondly, ' whales' aren't manipulating the price. Sure, if you have 1000 btc and dump it, market order, it will cause a dip, but people are buying up all dips. Right now, a few are pussies and are scared of futures, but I think, futures will actually be very bullish for btc, so just hold...

They will never be 'unusable.'  It will be very hard to find whole bitcoins, people will be buying houses with satoshis etc. eventually nations will be settling debts with each other in bitcoins, so the price will be in the millions. Even then, they will be considered ' cheap' so enjoy these prices while you can.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:55:41
thank you very much, yes it makes sense now ;-) 
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:32:48
True. It's rumored Satoshi mined 1 million coins in 2009, so perhaps he will claim them one day. So many coins have been lost by people forgetting about it, or stuck on their hard drive or they lost their private keys etc. Once we hit 10k or 100k, perhaps people will be dumpster diving, trying to find a drive that has 100 or 1000 coins on them. i wish i could have been the guy who bought 100,000 at .50 or whatever, but even if you have a single whole bitcoin, that will be worth at least 1 million or more, so it's so cool if you think about it. People will be happy with decibits or satoshis and they will be telling stories about I know this guy, who actually has a whole bitcoin...

2drink. Bitcoin will be at an all time high almost every day. Even when it's 1 million dollars a coin, people will still be buying it, since it will be considered ' cheap.' And it's deflationary ;-) 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:26:06
I guess I am very ignorant. Sure, there will be dip of 10-20%, but that is just normal for bitcoin. But bitcoin is not like any asset, so it can't be compared to traditional assets. I'm still learning about it, but it's very exciting ;-)

@_date: 2016-12-31 18:32:49
hi btc forever, I agree with your post 90%. Yes, there will be dips along the way, but I think the stock market will dip in Jan/Feb and not bitcoin. People will move their money from the bond selloff ( yields rising) and will invest into bitcoin, which will be making all time highs and will garner more media attention. Just today, there was a long article in the WSJ, on Bitcoin's 2016 rise, since it outperformed the Dow, 120% to 14%.  People like chasing stocks, commodities or whatever, since they believe in FOMO.  The large banks, will keep printing that worthless fiat, and will start to buy up bitcoin, increasing btc's price. So there is nothing they can do to stop this train, there is still plenty of room left on this rocket-ship to the moon! 
@_date: 2016-11-05 23:41:46
True. But with btc's limited supply and the use cases increasing daily, this portends an exponential rise in its price. So enjoy these cheap prices while you still can...

Any fake news, shakes out the weak hands. And if btc was banned in China, the price would sky rocket, since it would become very scarce. So it's in fact very stable and not volatile at all. Just buy a single bitcoin and wait for it to hit 1 million usd in the next 10 years. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:33:06
the trick is to never sell ;-) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:46:05
Even at 1 million usd per coin, bitcoin will be very cheap. It's the only deflationary asset in the world, so it's priceless. Every other fiat currency in the world needs to depend on inflation, money printing to survive, bitcoin is the opposite...

I enjoyed your reply, it was well thought our and written. My only comment is based on your 'evaporated' comment. Money doesn't evaporate. In this case, people in the futures market sold short and bet against that company in the afterhours, that's why it dropped 40%.  People who held the shares in the company couldn't sell, since regular trading hours were closed and you can't trade options in after hours either, so you were ' stuck.' in that position. 
Hopefully in the future we are not pricing anything in dollars. People tend to sell their btc for dollars, since that is what they know. Milk cost 2 dollars, in the future, perhaps stores will have signs that milk costs .0002 btc ,or perhaps even milibits or satoshis. Most people haven't even heard to bitcoin yet, so we are all early adopters ;-) Mr. Pinochet, how many stretch limos will you be buying, when they are $100 each?  ;-)

there are rumors Satoshi is dead and his 1 million coins ( private keys) are lost, which further decreases the supply, which is a good thing to any btc holder. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:16:44
then all those people are dumb asses! I know people who had their security boxes empties, or the bank said their boxes were ' lost' and can't be found. So good luck storing your seeds there.

That is wonderful! Though I suspect many sign up and don't complete their registration or don't want to log into their bank, wait 2 days and confirm a .27 deposit etc.  But it's great news regardless, more and more and waking up to bitcoin and to the other cryptos, so we are still very early adopters, and it feels great!

@_date: 2017-10-20 15:46:36
Bitcoin price is ' never high' By end of this year we should be at 10k, if not higher. Even at 500k, or 1 million bitcoin will be bought, it's deflationary while the whole world is inflationary. Bitcoin, is honestly, priceless. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:35:40
In a few years, that ' bit things' will be worth at least 100k, so that rich idiot better have a lot of fiat to buy more than you. Unless you only have .50 btc at this point...    Either way, the more people involved in bitcoin, the larger the network effect and the community will keep growing, so it's great. Plus that rich idiot, will probably have a huge mortgage, will get divorced, will lose 1/2 his ' bit things' and you will come out ahead...

Hi Dakota, It may be true they opened 1.2 M accounts, but perhaps people gave up, since they couldn't wait 2 days for that .57 and .24 deposit that coinbase sent, to have them verify their account. Or I think most accounts are only funded with like 5 bucks usd, so it's not really that big of a deal. However, at least they opened an account, so that is the first step. And we don't know if these are unique accounts, or some bot just opened up a bunch. Either way, I too, except a btc price of around 10k, by end of this year, just wait till Wall Street really jumps in...

@_date: 2017-09-20 01:03:42
actually, the opposite would happen. With limited access, it makes buying/selling bitcoin even harder, so the price would keep going up, since it's now more scarce. Bitcoin can't be stopped. Sure, they can ban/shut down coin base, but there are other exchanges out there. There is also localbitcoins, where you can buy/sell online or by meeting someone in a coffee shop. We will continue to fight this war, at times it may seem like we are losing, but trust me, we are winning! We.. are.. bitcoin!

thanks Bctich,
I majored in econ ;-) However the stock markets are rigged and propped up by the FED and the ECB with cheap money, QE printing etc. I understand clearing prices, dead weight loss etc ;-) It's fun stuff.  I just love bitcoin in that there is a fixed supply, demand is rising, 1800 btc are mined each day, but in 2020, there will only be 900 etc. We are part of the .05% worldwide that even knows that bitcoin is. So if you own 1 whole bitcoin, you will be considered ' elite' or a ' big swinging dick'  and your children and grandchildren will thank you for risking fiat to buy this experiment. I know btc could fail, but I feel it will be adopted by more and more countries, some may even pay off their debts with bitcoin in the future, and it could become a default ' reserve currency.'   Oh and bctich, if you are bored, take a look at a few IS-LM model charts, those were not too much fun for me ;-)

With demand rising, supply getting cut in half, I am getting an erection just thinking about it...

bitcoin is worth almost 95 billion now and they are not noticing, so spending 50 million in a day is going to do jack shit. And why spend your priceless btc now, when in a few years, you will be able to buy a house or a lambo with just a single btc? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:21:22

you can see a return in a few seconds. Bitcoin can go up or down by 30% in a few minutes, it's very volatile at the moment. But once more than 1% of the entire world knows about it, uses it, its price will increase and it will become less volatile. Remember bitcoin is still an experiment and could go to 5 cents tomorrow, but that doesn't mean it's a failure, since it would still work. Bitcoin is a protocol and has always worked, never had a down day and to me, it's so fucking amazing!

@_date: 2017-05-23 15:49:46
and if it drops $500 in the next few minutes, would you be willing to buy then? Probably not, since then people will worry ' what if it crashes right here' and they will just watch it and be paralyzed with fear and do nothing.  Sometimes I wish to be in a 10 year coma...

They will be out of luck. Also remember about 4 million coins have been lost so far. So there will be only about 17 million coins available in total. And we have the next halving in 2020, that's when the mining reward is decreased by 50%, to 6.25 coins per block.  So fun times are ahead!

it actually scales just fine as it is. Segwit is ready to go, it just needs the network to agree. And lightening is coming too and a bunch of other things. Sure, you can't buy a coffee with it as of yet, since it takes hours for a confirmation, but they will fix that. The other coins will have the same issue, once they have enough use cases and users.

Or the miners could realize they will lose in the event of a chain split and will activate segwit, thus pushing the price of btc up 100% in a few days and thus there is no chance to buy ' cheap coins', since everyone was waiting for the collapse due to bip148, and now will FOMO buy...
