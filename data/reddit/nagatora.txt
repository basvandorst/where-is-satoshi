Frankly, you're being disingenuous and underhanded. It doesn't seem like you want to have a real conversation here, and you're trying to redefine things on-the-fly to suit your argumentative desires. For example, this is a total non-sequitur:

I've always considered classifying Bitcoin semantically to be a misguided activity. Inevitably you will wind up shoehorning it.
Bitcoin is (rather obviously, in my opinion) money. It is a lot of other things, too. Traditional/classical labels or categories are insufficient to describe revolutionary new innovations.
If you asked, early on, "Is the Internet a telephone network?" you would have been committing the same error. Some would answer "Yes", some "No", but neither answer would really tell you much about what the Internet is capable of or its upcoming role in society.

How did you determine that? This sounds like extreme hyperbole to me, but I'm definitely willing to hear you out. Could you expound on this portion of your argument?

That *is* the nothing-at-stake problem. In a nutshell, if it doesn't actually cost significant energy to reorg, there is nothing meaningful at stake preventing large-scale reorgs. It sounds like you're trying to redefine what "nothing-at-stake" refers to, similar to your redefinition of "blockchain" in this thread.


In other words, checkpoints. Yes, that's a centralized solution. If you're okay with centralization, Proof of Stake makes sense. But if you're okay with centralization, blockchains don't.
I suspected you were going to handwave and rely on checkpointing. It's highly disingenuous to pretend that nothing-at-stake is a solved problem, when the "solution" boils down to: *simply trust someone*. You have just admitted that introducing trust into the equation is the only way to make Proof of Stake "work", which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in the context of blockchains.
I don't want to come across as rude, but it seems like you might have a set of rather severe misconceptions regarding this technology, despite how long you've been a part of the community.

Exactly right, especially because the Bitcoin whitepaper came out on October 31, 2008 and version 0.1 of Bitcoin (the first implementation) came out on January 9, 2009, a couple of months later.

That doesn't make any sense... a hard-fork would be a backwards-incompatible change to the protocol. Not doing anything (i.e. leaving the limit in place) is not forking.

As a software engineer who has been earning my living writing code for decades, I have to strongly disagree here. The *vast* majority of my time is spent conceptually solving the problems I'm faced with, and sketching out blueprints on a whiteboard or in a journal before trying to type anything up (even pseudocode). Trying to jump straight to the keyboard more often than not leaves you frustrated and wishing you had set aside some time to think and sketch instead.

@_date: 2016-08-17 08:00:46


Well, if no fork occurs that means that the market has ruled that those are not actually serious pain-points. In fact, the assumption of "ever rising fees" basically means that Bitcoin is skyrocketing in value, which means that things are going pretty well for the market at large.


I'm simply referring to the final blocksize (i.e. the size of the block as saved on the disk). This includes all the transaction data in that block, which does include witness data.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:01:01


That is **exactly** what Satoshi did. The whitepaper came out on October 31, 2008 and version 0.1 of Bitcoin (the first implementation) came out on January 9, 2009, a couple of months later.
@_date: 2016-08-17 21:44:24
Oh, Satoshi explicitly stated that he had written the code before writing the whitepaper, saying that he first had to convince himself that it worked as he had envisioned. So he definitely did write the bulk of the code before typing up the whitepaper.
But when you say something like "Imagine if Satoshi had just released the whitepaper without an implementation. No one would have cared." it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, because that's exactly what happened. 
The point here is that with complex systems, releasing a spec or whitepaper prior to releasing a finished software product is the standard and most reasonable approach. Mimblewimble is in the early stages of the process, but that doesn't mean it's not exciting!

At that point, if absolutely no other optimizations can be made and there are practical issues arising from a fixed blocksize which can only be increased with a hard-fork, it would be a rather uncontroversial change to make, no? 
In other words, your thought experiment essentially concludes with a solution. If we ever *do* run out of superior scaling solutions, then the inferior ones would reach consensus rather easily!


There's not an issue to prevent, that I can see. 
Finally, SegWit itself increases the maximum blocksize to a 3.6MB limit. Even though this would still be a "fixed blocksize", it's actually a higher limit than what would be achieved with a hard-fork to 2MB.

I wish I had read this before trying to have a meaningful conversation with you. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:10:44


Without understanding what MAX_BLOCK_COST means, you won't be able to understand what the 4000000 figure represents. 
TL;DR: it represents 1MB blocks. BIP141 explains this more clearly than I'd be able to.
Unfortunately it seems you're not interested in correcting your misconceptions, and would rather just argue. I would rather not have a shouting match, but if you ever change your mind and want to learn more, know that there are no hard feelings and I would be happy to answer your questions.

One of the problems with a centralized altcoin like Ethereum is that legal actions and investigations can have real consequences on the future of the platform.
In this case, if an extended legal battle ensues from this investigation, it could very conceivably kill Ethereum. 
This is in contrast with Bitcoin, which is a decentralized platform, which means that there's no obvious target to litigate against.

@_date: 2016-04-13 19:59:34
No, it's from the same SegWit. The tweet you're referencing is phrased misleadingly (perfectly highlighting my point that precise usage of language is important). A more accurate tweet would be "I mined a block that would have been 2MB large without SegWit on segnet!"
The SegWit block explorer at segnet.smartbit.com.au is designed with the "Size" field as a representation of how large the block would be, if the signature data were not segregated ~~(and was fully included in the block, as is traditionally done).~~
@_date: 2016-04-14 07:11:37
Ha! Somehow missed that.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:43:22
I apologize, but you're still mistaken. Good job on finding some of the relevant code, though.
I would encourage you to read [BIP 141]( to understand how the limits have been adjusted. 
One reason why you're still confused is because you're looking at MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE (which isn't actually the relevant restriction, it's just to avoid problems with buffer size limits -- which you can actually tell by reading the comment line above it), rather than the actual relevant limit: MAX_BLOCK_COST.
MAX_BLOCK_COST, as you can see, is *also* 4000000... but you should read the BIP141 link that I provided to understand what this figure represents. 
I think, once you do so, you'll understand what I mean when I say **SegWit is about using blockspace more efficiently, not about increasing blocksize.**
Also, as an aside, there's no reason to be upset. I apologize if I've offended you in any way. I truly did not intend to do so. I'm just trying to help correct common misunderstandings.
Again, let me know if you still have questions about any of this. I'd really appreciate if you'd try a little harder to be more tactful and respectful in our dialogue, though. Flaring tempers aren't going to help either of us in any way.

You're right; for all my "use language precisely" preaching, it's ironic that I slipped up like that. Thanks for catching that. I edited my comment above to atone for my mistake.
The witness data is still included in SegWit blocks. But my primary point (that SegWit blocks are still &lt;= 1 MB each) is still absolutely true.
SegWit is about using blockspace more efficiently, not about increasing blocksize.
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:47:10


That's not actually true, blocksizes are still limited to 1MB with SegWit. What *is* true is that more transactions can fit into the same blocksize with SegWit.
It's important to use language precisely when disagreeing with someone, otherwise it may prove unduly difficult to come to any sort of understanding.
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:28:16
Again, I'm not interested in arguing. However, if you do decide that you want to learn more (or if anyone else reading this is interested in learning the truth of the matter), here are a few corroborating resources:

The actual [BIP itself](






@_date: 2016-04-14 09:11:23
Hey, just wanted to give you an update. We both seemed pretty certain of what we knew, so I decided to investigate the matter empirically.
I went ahead and spun up a SegWit node. Turns out, the blocks are actually the same size on disk as reported on the block explorer. So ultimately, the blocks do wind up exceeding 1 MB in size.
@_date: 2016-04-25 14:28:05
In my opinion, specific chunks of land.
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:25:06
I apologize, but you're mistaken on that front.
Blocks cannot actually be larger than 1MB without a hardfork to remove or increase the maxblocksize variable setting. 
As I mentioned above, SegWit is about using blockspace more efficiently, not about increasing blocksize. It will increase the *effective* maxblocksize (which is likely why you and are confused about this), by allowing more transactions to be included per block, but it will not actually induce a hard-fork to remove/alter the maxblocksize limit, which is a consensus-critical setting. 
This is easily confirmed by referencing the diffs on Github. If you're not a programmer or don't have the free time to read over the code, I can absolutely understand and appreciate that. Personally, I am a software developer, and I have read the relevant code directly; if you have specific questions (or would just like some assistance in getting started -- knowing where to look is sometimes the hardest part!) then please let me know, I'd be happy to provide what assistance I can.

This is not true in any meaningful sense, so I'm afraid you're being disingenuous on this particular point.
"Insanely centralized" would imply that one or two entities unilaterally control all aspects of the system, which is not at all the case.
Even if you were to argue that mining pool operators are "in control" of Bitcoin (which would, of course, be a silly argument to make for numerous reasons -- just look at GHash.io to see how fickle this "control" can be), there are still a dozen different pools, all competing directly with one another for hashrate, which means that the network is *still* decentralized in practice.
Beyond mining, there are other factors to consider, like the power that Core devs have. You can argue that development in Bitcoin's codebase is centralized, but as soon as you admit that they *do* have a certain amount of control, you're simultaneously admitting that power is distributed between the devs and the miners; notably, you are admitting that control is decentralized.
Then you have the ecosystem players, like Coinbase, who have undeniable sway in the evolution of Bitcoin. This sort of power is abstract and difficult to measure by nature, but it is certainly something to consider.
The Bitcoin network is absolutely decentralized, and frankly, trying to describe it as "insanely centralized" makes you sound like a troll, whether that's your intention or not.

It's fine, though, let's not worry about it. I'm fairly confident that we'll be over $500 by mid-January, and since you seem unwilling to risk betting against this prediction, that's that.
In any case, the price will surely be fun to watch between now and then, regardless of any bets made on reddit about it! :)

@_date: 2017-02-03 20:46:22
Yes, but that's only one component of the block now. The entire point of SegWit was to open up another 3MB of space for witness data to go into.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:24:42
I'm surprised that this misconception still exists.
SegWit transactions are actually slightly *bigger* than legacy transactions, in most cases. However, SegWit also increases the block size cap (from 1MB to 4MB, with 3MB of this reserved exclusively for witness data), so it allows more capacity and transaction throughput.

@_date: 2017-02-12 18:32:00
You're both absolutely right. But I think a critical thing to point out here is that SegWit being activated would pretty clearly help with scaling in a lot of ways; if we can safely put a band-aid on as we prepare for surgery, why wouldn't we?
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:37:18
I don't believe that Satoshi actually ever explicitly explained his rationale for the 1MB consensus limit, but consider this:
It would make sense as a mechanism to limit how quickly the cost to run a node increases, because any blocks in violation of the limit would be considered invalid by consensus. It would **not** make sense as a mechanism to prevent a spammer from sending whatever transactions they want, because it is a consensus rule (not a transaction selection rule, which can be customized on a per-miner basis without any impact on the rest of the network).
The 1MB limit does not actually limit spammers in any way; it only limits *miners*. 
Do you appreciate the point I'm making?
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:25:45
There is no "no altcoin discussion" rule. There are the following rules:

@_date: 2017-02-15 18:53:10


That's very interesting. I'm guessing that you haven't been following this discussion very actively for the past couple of years, in that case?
Some of the most dangerous repercussions from increasing the blocksize (and especially from allowing miners to increase the blocksize unchecked) are with regards to the marginal bandwidth and latency demands, and how this would increase mining centralization pressure over time. Not due to manufacturing monopolies, but due to the *massive* advantages of being in closer proximity to the biggest miners/pools on the network as blocks get heavier.
To demonstrate the point rather swiftly, consider the fact that more than 51% of the mining hashrate is concentrated in China. The Great Firewall of China essentially prevents any blocks larger than 8MB from propagating competitively over this barrier, which means that if the blocksize were increased to, say, 10MB, anyone mining outside of China would be at a *massive* disadvantage, and would likely see astronomical orphan rates that fatally hurt their bottom lines. The only recourse in such a scenario would be a redirection of your hashrate to a Chinese mining pool, where you are no longer hindered by the Firewall (and are instead benefited by it, since you are on the same side as the majority of the network hashrate). 
This phenomenon (affinity for geographical proximity) would have a pronounced effect even without the Great Firewall as a catalyst; the same underlying centralization pressure would result even in normal and healthy network conditions. The closer you are to a big pool, the more profitable mining becomes, if blocks are large.
And if you're the operator of a big pool, it is suddenly in your best interest to get that blocksize increased as much as the network will tolerate, because doing so will increase your pool's "gravity" and profitability over time.
I would recommend checking out [this seminal paper]( for a more rigorous elaboration on the subject.

Why modal versus median?
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:12:13
That is the "long-term" perspective that I was trying to show isn't as much of a concern as the "short-term" bottom line to most miners.
In other words, on the *way* to centralization (where the price would inevitably collapse), the rational thing for any competitive miner to do would be to maximize their revenue in the meantime. Following that, miners could (and should!) attempt the sort of thing I described above.
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:21:47


Bitcoin has actually gone up much **more** than 375% in the past 5 years. Much, much, much more.
Also, this was the conclusion of the paper that you linked to:


no real consistent estimation of  beta can be made.** For the purposes of the CAPM analysis, it seems that all bitcoin risk is idiosyncratic, and it shares no systemic risk from the market portfolio. This is an interesting result because it means that bitcoin offers new diversification for the investor trying to create a market portfolio. For the  purposes of contributing to the classification debate, it appears that bitcoin does not share significant amounts of systemic risk with currencies, gold, or commodities more broadly. This perhaps slightly supports the assertion that bitcoin represents a new class of asset, but that is up to the reader to decide for themselves.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:00:47
I think the crucial point here is that Bitcoin is a delicate and well-modeled balance of incentives and attack vectors. Satoshi laid out exactly what should and should not be possible for an attacker with 51% of hash-power, and BU undermines this by introducing further incentive/ability to leverage a 51% attack. 
Try considering it from an adversarial perspective: imagine you're part of the "beefy" 51% who can afford the costs of larger blocks. It's now in your best interest to "pad" your blocks with fake transactions (from yourself to yourself), inflating the UTXO set in the process, in order to keep blocks full (both so that fees can be higher, and so that your weaker competitors die off, giving you a larger share of the network hashrate). It's suddenly much more attractive to do such "evil" things, which hurt Bitcoin but might help you.
To put it bluntly, it changes up the game. Suddenly the incentives would not be arranged in the same way that Satoshi left them. Any social contract that Bitcoin represents would have been violated.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:01:20
The problem would be that a miner maximizing short-term, localized profit isn't necessarily maximizing long-term, generalized profit. For instance, a large mining pool might be able to win more blocks by offensively fiddling with their EB/AD settings in an attempt to steadily drive out other miners (especially those located on the opposite side of the Great Firewall of China from them). In the worst case scenario, this same phenomenon/incentive would result in a centralized single-mining-pool (or single-miner) eventually, which would undermine Bitcoin's value proposition (decentralization) entirely.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:15:12

@_date: 2017-02-08 19:32:43
Firstly, it's not a matter of hardware. Bandwidth and latency (the latter of which is highly impacted by geographical proximity) are actually much more relevant factors than storage, memory, and CPU power in this context.
Secondly, if you don't see the problem of completely replacing the balance of incentives and attack-vectors that Bitcoin implements with a completely new one, then it's probably best to do some research into altcoins, because many of them have done exactly this (and you don't have to wait for an activation which may never occur or anything like that). Unfortunately, the "blocks without limits" model hasn't actually ever been tested on any coin's mainnet (and, for that matter, isn't available on any public testnets at this time, either), so if you *really* want to test that model, you might need to get your hands dirty and spin up a coin (or testnet) yourself.

That's true. But by reserving the extra space for witness data only, SegWit prevents all the drawbacks and new attack vectors of a "standard hard-fork blocksize increase", which is the rationale behind why it was set up that way.
You're right that the full effects of the increase wouldn't be instant, unfortunately. A significant fraction of the ecosystem [has indicated readiness]( but it could still take a while (even after SegWit hypothetically activated) before all the capacity benefits would be realized.

You keep claiming that Bitcoin is inefficient, which in some respects is true (e.g. the blockchain data must be redundantly stored and relayed on a massive scale, for the network to remain decentralized) but in other respects is decidedly false.
It is this latter category of efficiency which and I agree that Bitcoin excels at... one demonstrative example is "informational penetration"; by nature and design, Bitcoin is structured so that any user of the network can very quickly and efficiently ascertain the total number of coins in existence. Other assets like USD, gold, and silver are not nearly so efficient in this regard.
With this in mind, I hope you understand what was driving at when he said:

* Ethereum is significantly pre-mined.
* Ethereum is permanently-inflationary.
* Ethereum has a central dictator.
* Ethereum's creators receive quite a substantial chunk of newly-mined coins every year, no matter what.
* Ethereum has not even decided whether they will be PoW-based or PoS-based in the long-term.
* ...and, in fact, there are many, many Ethereum protocol details that are changed on a relatively regular basis in response to newly-discovered vulnerabilities.
* Ether was never designed to be a monetary token, and is ill-suited to this role. It was designed instead to be a fuel for smart-contracts (and it is almost a truism that no matter how successful the crypto revolution ultimately becomes, financial phenomena will always be more important and ubiquitous than smart-contract phenomena).
* Much of the hype around Ethereum is based on the fact that entities like R3 are considering forking their blockchain for their own private purposes, but unlike in Bitcoin, these forks do not stand to drive any value to main-chain Ether, because any forked networks will be entirely independent from the main one, i.e. demand for Ether will not increase due to R3's usage of an Ethereum fork.
* Ethereum's functionality can be replicated on the Bitcoin blockchain in a number of ways.
* Ethereum advocate(s) have recently perpetrated a widespread spam campaign to pump their altcoin.
I am not trying to argue that Ethereum is a scam, but rather that there are numerous faults/drawbacks that aren't often acknowledged regarding the network and its token.

In effect, it does. If an individual is willing to buy 1 bitcoin for $400, and they know that there are 15 million other bitcoins out there, that may not mean much. But if a dynamic and open marketplace continues to trade at this rate (and the fact that there are 15 million other coins in existence is publicly known), then ultimately $6B of investment has been represented in the market.
It would be just as valid to say that most of *money's* value is "on paper", or that a particular company's stock value is primarily "on paper"; if everyone decided to cash out their AAPL shares, most of them wouldn't receive anywhere near the current spot price per share, but that doesn't mean AAPL doesn't have a $573B market-cap.
Of course, comparing the "market-cap" of a cryptocurrency to that of a company is not an apples-to-apples comparison (for a number of reasons), but that doesn't negate my point here.

He's actually correct on this point. Andrew Stone wrote an article with a [suggestion to address this issue]( but unfortunately it ultimately boils down to "Miners can choose the consensus chain manually, by disqualifying contender chains via *invalidateblock* calls if such a situation arises".
This is unfortunate because it basically represents an un-solution of Satoshi's big breakthrough; it replaces "machine-determinable consensus" with the much-flimsier "human-arbitrated consensus" and is, in a nutshell, antithetical to Nakamoto Consensus.

I don't believe that Satoshi actually ever explicitly explained his rationale for the 1MB consensus limit, but consider this:
It would make sense as a mechanism to limit how quickly the cost to run a node increases, because any blocks in violation of the limit would be considered invalid by consensus. In other words, you were exactly right with what you said above.
However, it would **not** make sense as a mechanism to prevent a spammer from sending whatever transactions they want, because it is a consensus rule (not a transaction selection rule, which can be customized on a per-miner basis without any impact on the rest of the network).
The 1MB limit does not actually limit spammers in any way; it only limits *miners*.

Lightning Network is already operational; it is just usable on the Testnet (where SegWit is activated) rather than mainnet (where we are still waiting for SegWit to activate). 
As soon as SegWit is activated, the Lightning Network will be usable on mainnet, though it is still alpha-level software, so it is recommended not to use it for large payments (and in fact, many implementations of Lightning Network clients *won't even let you* use it for big payments).
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:27:03
Hear, hear! Great post.
I do want to say one thing, though:


There is actually a general academic consensus that Bitcoin will ultimately *rely* on a transaction backlog to some degree, moving forward. 
See [this seminal paper]( as well as [this one]( Peter Todd summarized the latter paper quite excellently:


Gregory Maxwell also did a really good job at it:


to move the blockchain forward goes away.  An optimal rational miner would be best off forking off the current best block in order to capture its fees, rather than moving the blockchain forward, until they hit the maximum. That's where the "backlog" comment comes from, since when there is a sufficient backlog it's better to go forward.
Basically, the bottom line is that a normal backlog might not be a bad thing; in fact, it might be *necessary* for a stable and useful Bitcoin network, over the long term.

Respectfully, this attack vector **does not exist**.


Any newly-mined coins would have to age for 100 blocks before being able to be sent anywhere, and a 25% mining coalition will **not** be able to maintain the longest POW chain for nearly that long without some sort of divine intervention.
Furthermore, Coinbase performs extensive KYC and has strict withdrawal limits, meaning that *even* if by some miracle this attack manifested, they would not be at risk of losing a substantial amount of funds, and even if they *did* manage to lose any money, they would know exactly who defrauded them and would be perfectly capable of recourse.
In short, this attack vector does not exist.

From a miner's perspective, BU would (likely) result in *lower* aggregate fees. However, it would also grant them much more control over Bitcoin (not locking them in to Satoshi's consensus constraints like the 21 million bitcoin limit and block/transaction validity rules).
To me, it seems like the primary incentive for any miner to consider running BU is to gain further control and the ability to "steer the protocol", rather than any (hypothetical) additional fee revenue they might stand to earn.

The point of this post is that if Luke-Jr's proposal were accepted, then a hard-fork would be deployed and activated without such a grace period.
For Core to maintain any semblance of logical consistency, Luke-Jr's proposal should be summarily rejected and dismissed, on the very same grounds that "a grace period less than 12 months is too dangerous to consider".

Hear, hear! I am regularly recommending that people (re)visit the Core Roadmap, since it is such a fantastically-written document and outlines an incredibly rational plan. 
I personally think that proposals of **incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls** (the one crucial ingredient for a flex-cap proposal that is missing in e.g. BU) would be some of the most welcome work that we could explore at this stage in Bitcoin's life.
The strategy outlined in the Roadmap involves getting some data on how blocksize increases affect the network and ecosystem, though, so at this point we're basically waiting on SegWit activation before seriously pursuing such stuff further. Still, I wish there was more discussion about this stuff.
It's interesting that SegWit hasn't already activated, to be honest. It definitely does go to show that the capacity "cliff" wasn't really as existential threat to Bitcoin at all, at least over the short term, as Hearn so famously argued. As you said, we are making new all-time-highs, no skies are falling yet, and that's without ever upping the blocksize limit (despite safe code to do so being available). Bitcoin is prospering with a 1MB size limit.

I think this has been a really good discussion, but I just wanted to speak to one point you raised:


Speaking personally, I don't think much stock should be put into Vitalik's blog-posts on the subject of "the merits of hard forks versus soft forks" precisely because he has a clear agenda to serve. He bailed out TheDAO with a hard fork, after all, and expends great effort (on a regular basis) towards defending this decision.
I'm not trying to argue that he's wrong or that his arguments aren't worth considering, but I think it's worth taking his perspective with a *giant* grain of salt, because he, moreso than pretty much anyone else in the space, has a clear and abiding conflict of interest when it comes to assessing these matters. Simply knowing who wrote the article, I was able to predict the conclusions he'd espouse with perfect accuracy.
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:23:27


Yes, that's exactly right. Which supports what I said above (the 1MB limit is meant to limit miners only, including "spammy miners").

I'm really not sure what you're even asking me to do. If you're interested in learning more, you can read about the basic idea behind ["Emergent Consensus" here]( and a good article to read about it is available [here]( as well. 
The bottom line, however, is that right now, in order for a block to be considered valid under Bitcoin consensus rules, it has to be smaller than 1MB in size. Any paradigm that relaxes that restriction would necessary require a fork. This is merely speaking definitionally, and there's no way around it; if your local client is set to accept blocks larger than 1MB in size, it necessarily represents a consensus fork from the consensus parameters enforced by the client versions that preceded it.
You might also want to check out [this page]( and/or [this one]( if you want more clarification about what these terms mean.

There are no reasons to *want* the allocated space for witness-stripped-data to grow, other than for the ultimate goal of more transaction capacity. Your comment here appears to indicate that you would like for this space to grow merely for the sake of it growing (not necessarily for the capacity improvements that it might yield).
In fact, I've seen some convincing analysis done (offline, unfortunately, or I would provide a link to it) which indicated that the biggest capacitative constraint in a SegWit-active network would be the *witness-allocated space*, even though there is 3MB available for it (which, intuitively, might seem like it is 3x less restrictive of a factor than the non-witness-data restriction is).

I understand that you believe your own definition is adequate. Others obviously disagree, however. And because you've crafted your own definition and are now referencing it (in what is known as "a circular argument"), you are unable to see eye-to-eye with those who disagree with your custom definition.
It is actually fairly simple to demonstrate the inadequacy of your definition, with a quick thought experiment. I can go [create an altcoin]( right now, and begin mining it without exhibiting any discretion with regards to transaction inclusion. Because no one would actually be using my altcoin, this costs me virtually nothing, and I can continue mining away happily.
Now imagine some bored third party discovers my altcoin and decides to acquire a miniscule amount. They use this amount to transact back-and-forth between two addresses they control, and embed something like "BE SURE TO DRINK YOUR OVALTINE" in the OP_RETURN fields of these transactions. Using a penny's worth of the token, they transact tens of thousands of times a day, flooding my little blockchain with these redundant messages.
Because I am not particularly concerned about blockchain bloat (or perhaps because I am not tech-savvy enough to adjust my mining policies as desired, or perhaps I just don't notice the transactions for a while), I continue to mine and include these transactions in the blocks that I find. 
If you ask 100 people on the street whether those transactions are "spam" (even though they were valid and included in mined blocks on my blockchain), I suspect that 98 or 99 of them would answer: "Absolutely, without a doubt, yes."
Assuming that I am right, your definition is therefore inadequate, according to majority opinion, no matter how much you favor it.

The definition you quoted would be relevant if we were talking about *self* moderation, but we're talking about moderation of a *forum*, which is explicitly included in the definition that you chose to ignore.

The lawyer presided over the estate.
Obviously, the curation of content (regardless of the underlying motivations thereof) on a forum (like this subreddit) qualifies as a form of moderation, when we use the applicable definition.
You say that you do not want a "pedantic discussion of what *moderate* means" but [you were the one who originally steered the conversation towards the definition of the word]( 
Again, I'm just trying to help make sure that we are all speaking the same language. The curation of rule-violating content in this subreddit (including the automation thereof with custom CSS rules and AutoMod activity) is moderation, without any room for doubt.

Actually, that's one of the interesting differentiating aspects of SegWit: it is completely backwards-compatible, which means that all old transactions continue to work just like they always did... it just introduces a *new* transaction format (using the "P2SH" transaction type, just like how multisig was first introduced into Bitcoin). 
So what this means is that even though SegWit would give us a fancy new (better in pretty much every way) transaction format, users would be free to ignore this new format if they weren't interested in it (or didn't trust it yet), and continue transacting just like they had always been. They would end up paying more (proportionally) in terms of fees for doing so, so it would likely be in their best interest to start using SegWit eventually (and take advantage of the efficiencies and network benefits it has, including but not limited to linear rather than quadratic sigops costs), but the big point here is that *no one would be forced to adopt a new technology that they didn't want to*.
In a nutshell, what SegWit does is give us a 3MB blocksize increase (up to 4MB total), but those 3MB are *only* available for "witness data" which is SegWit-specific. So normal users (not making SegWit-style transactions) would only benefit indirectly, as more of the 1MB "base block" was made available to them by others using SegWit and moving a chunk of their transaction data to the 3MB "witness section" of the block instead.
One interesting note, while we're on the subject, is that [Satoshi actually advocated this method of upgrading Bitcoin explicitly]( he designed Bitcoin's Script language specifically so that cool new upgrades like SegWit would be possible as soft-forks. 
I really think that Satoshi post above is an *excellent* resource to reference; he basically lays out "I think SegWit as a soft fork is the smartest way to upgrade the network, and actually built the network with these types of upgrades in mind, and furthermore I think competing implementations (like BU or Classic) are a bad idea and always will be." You might think I'm misrepresenting what he said, but if you read his words closely, that's exactly what he was saying.
Hopefully I'm not off too far on a tangent, at this point... but let me know if you want to hear any more about the benefits of SegWit transactions over other transaction formats, or if you'd like me to move on to another point, or anything else.

That's basically what sidechains represent. As long as your blockchain understands and plays nicely with the relevant scripts involved in a 2-way peg, you can perform the operations necessary to participate in inter-blockchain transfers. That's basically the meat of the sidechains paper; they're working on an inter-blockchain swapping mechanism.
Check out the whitepaper, bottom of page 5:


I will say that in my opinion, the most compelling argument for Bitcoin maximalism is the looming completion of sidechain development. The coin with the largest network at the time when sidechains go "mainstream" will basically be established as the *anchor* of the sidechain ecosystem. And then we start seeing *hyper*antifragility comes into play, because sidechains (nee altcoins) allow for blockchain transition/exodus. We all share one superledger, but can fluidly experiment with different code and rules.
Sidechains are basically going to push Bitcoin/cryptocurrency into another dimension. 21 million coins, infinite possibilities.

The block-size limit was never meant to prevent against the "dust spam flood" attack described here. That was actually [brought up and discussed]( and solved rather trivially, with a node-specific adjustment in the transaction/fee relay policy (like I describe above). Satoshi even showed up to [say]( 


This was well after the blocksize limit was introduced. Since Satoshi  explicitly said that the dust spam limit of the above thread was the **first try** at solving the problem you describe, we know for a fact that the blocksize limit was not intended to solve that problem.
Hopefully with that in mind, my point is a little bit clearer: the 1MB limit does not actually limit spammers in any way; it only limits miners.

Such a proposal would likely not get widespread agreement (it sacrifices the best part of SegWit and the defining attribute which allowed SegWit to garner developer consensus), and would need many additional safety features (e.g. replay protection mechanisms) and appropriate testing for these features by virtue of being a hard fork... which would mean that it might be years before we would have working code achieving what you describe.
The Hong Kong Agreement was that the network would activate SegWit *first*, and once we had some data on how the network responded to larger blocks, we could use it to inform our strategy on increasing the blocksize further. See [the Capacity Roadmap]( for a more-detailed breakdown of this general strategy/approach.

If only it were that simple. 


If it's a choice between "no fees/reward whatsoever" and "fees that could possibly plummet in value because of your greedy behavior" every rational self-interested miner should opt for the latter. The assumption that a majority of miners are honest is only a reasonable assumption *because* of rational self-interest and greed. In our hypothetical here (close-to-zero backlog as well as close-to-zero block reward), that assumption is no longer valid nor reasonable.
Furthermore, from a consensus standpoint, there is no authoritative way to distinguish between valid equal-work chains, so there would be no way of knowing which miners were being dishonest and detrimentally-greedy, and which ones legitimately mined the block(s) first.

I think maybe the simplest way to put it would be with shapes.
Pretend there was a "shapechain" that had one consensus rule: *all shapes added to the chain have to be rectangles*. So we have a long chain of rectangles, some long and skinny, some more squarish, but all of them valid.
If you were to propose a new consensus rule that *all shapes added to the chain now have to be squares*, that would be a **soft fork**. All the old clients (who are prepared to accept any rectangle shape) would still consider your squares to be valid, and you wouldn't break consensus with them no matter how many squares you add to the chain.
Alternatively, if you were to propose a different consensus rule that *circle shapes are now valid*, that would be a **hard fork**. If you added a circle shape to the end of your chain, older clients (that are set to only accept rectangles) would consider that an invalid shape, and reject your chain. This would result in a consensus break with those older clients.
I hope that helps.

*If* the blocksize limit serves to maintain such a level of decentralization (and I definitely understand the arguments that it does not meaningfully do so), then it seems fair to consider it just as much part of the "social contract" of Bitcoin as the 21M coin limit.
I think this particular discussion has probably run its course, though; we both seem to understand where the other is coming from, which is a great thing, and pretty much everything you can hope for out of such exchanges. 
Thanks for spending some time talking about this stuff with me so politely!

That's an incorrect assumption about how SegWit works.
SegWit is more like: we add an extra 3-gallon jar, but only unshelled peanuts can go into it (in other words, you only allow peanuts of a newer and more efficient format to go into the extra jar). The 1-gallon jar can accept peanuts with or without shells (efficient or inefficient), because we've realized that trying to cram in too many peanut shells could break our jar.

Yes, it's the same link, and it includes many sound and valid arguments against a hard-fork blocksize increase. 


Because Bitcoin is a complex system with many nuances and intricacies. If you're unwilling to read arguments and explanations because they are long, you are never going to appreciate the issue significantly enough to understand it.
If you would like, I can start laying out some of the specific arguments, one-by-one, that help to convey what risks there are that accompany hard forks, blocksize increases, and both. But this would most certainly involve long "walls of text" so if you're unwilling to read long messages, I don't know what good it will do.

What about a fork that would allow a majority of miners to spend others' coins, even if they don't have the private keys for those coins? Would you still consider that "Bitcoin" if a majority of miners got on board with it? And if they took your coins from you after doing so, would you be okay with that?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:31:21
Ok, so to simplify, basically the only risk vector that you're currently aware of is "larger blocks take longer to propagate, giving large or well-connected miners distinct advantages over smaller and less-well-connected miners, which in turn causes centralization pressure". Is that right?
That is indeed a big and pertinent risk vector, so I'm glad that you have heard of it. While it truly deserves its own dissertation, let's set it aside for now, since it's the only risk that you're already aware of and I don't want to dwell too long on stuff that you might find repetitive.
So, let's start with a relatively straightforward topic: signature operations. 
In standard Bitcoin transactions, there is a design flaw (a massive inefficiency) in how the transaction is processed by the CHECKSIG instructions. Because the amount of data hashed is proportional to the transaction size *squared*, this means that validating a single transaction could, in some cases, require hashing gigabytes of data. This is referred to as the **quadratic hashing costs** of a transaction (and/or the "quadratic sigops scaling" issue).
With larger blocks the amount of data that has to be hashed could grow catastrophically quickly. With a "well-designed" set of transactions (or even just one, in the extreme case), a block could take hours to validate and process, which presents problems for any miners who actually bother to do so (but no problems for miners who do not bother with validation -- like the miner who creates the block, any miners who are cooperating with them and assume their blocks are valid by default, and any miners who do no validation at all of the blocks they receive).
SegWit was designed in a way to [fix this flaw]( but this *only* applies to SegWit transactions, because they have a well-defined serialization formula that is specifically constructed to avoid quadratic costs. Legacy Bitcoin transactions (what we use today) will unfortunately always suffer from this design flaw, by definition. 
This is one reason why increasing the blocksize *for SegWit transactions* is safe, whereas increasing it naively (allowing more/larger legacy transactions) would not necessarily be so.
There are a number of different ways that this vulnerability might otherwise be mitigated or addressed. Gavin originally implemented a limit in BIP109 (for Bitcoin Classic) that limited the total number of signature operations that any block/transaction could incur. Unfortunately, besides being radically inefficient and potentially making users' funds unspendable in some cases, this limit also caused problems on the "big blocks testnet" that BU and Classic were using last year, and when these issues were discovered, the limit was removed entirely from the Classic codebase. In other words, the only other proposal for addressing this particular bug/issue has been entirely abandoned, which means that as of right now, SegWit is the *only* blocksize-increasing proposal that takes this particular cost/problem into account.
If you have any questions about this, I'm happy to answer them. Once you're satisfied that you understand this issue, please let me know, and I'll proceed forward with expounding more issues/considerations/technical-constraints that you may not be aware of.

It seems that I wasn't clear with my message above. My entire point was that if you want transaction capacity increases, scaling the witness-stripped-data portion of the block is the most unproductive way to do so.

Satoshi actually didn't "leave Gavin in charge of the code base"; Satoshi actually used Sourceforge for his version control platform. Gavin had the idea to copy things over to Github, and Satoshi didn't object to him doing so.
After Satoshi left (which some believe may have actually been prompted by Gavin visiting the CIA about Bitcoin), Github rose in popularity and the Bitcoin repository maintained there became the de facto reference client. 
I believe the "Satoshi left Gavin in charge" claim is mostly from Gavin himself.

It very much is. Otherwise it wouldn't generate so much discussion. It is part of the block-validation code, and unambiguously a consensus parameter.


This, to me, indicates that you still haven't appreciated the distinction between soft and hard forks. Soft forks can cause chain splits (imagine someone using an older client mined a rectangle shape, after the soft fork of "all shapes must be squares" were activated). That doesn't make them "effective hard forks"; they are still soft forks, by the definition of the term.

Interesting perspective.
I truly believe that the implosion of Mt. Gox was a good thing for Bitcoin in the long term. It did an excellent job of demonstrating just how important of a factor **counterparty risk** is in the grand scheme of things. 
After Gox, people truly understand that "If you don't (exclusively) hold the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoin." This prevents "paper bitcoin" from flooding the market and diluting the value of "real bitcoin" and keeps the 21M cap sacrosanct.
Perhaps, for the same reasons, the ETF denial will help in the same way.

It's contentious because many people with robust understandings of Bitcoin have valid arguments for why it would be a detrimental change to make. The thread that I linked to (and the mailing list archives that it links to) lay out a number of these.

Yes, that was an example of a *soft fork* (the last link in my above post leads to a very informative wiki page on the subject). 
Soft forks are *restrictions* within existing consensus rulesets, such that older clients' consensus parameters remain valid even after the fork activates. In contrast, hard forks represent *derestrictions*, such that (at least in some instances) a block or transaction is considered valid on the hard-forked network that would be treated as invalid by the older clients (which aren't running code compatible with the hard-fork). In other words, soft forks are backwards compatible, whereas hard forks are not.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:10:50
I assume that you are referring to [this PR]( If not, please let me know. If so, then you have misunderstood the PR in question. 
The BU change I linked to above means that BU nodes will accept blocks without validating signatures if the block header timestamp is 30 days in the past. In other words, validity is assumed when block timestamps are dated older than a certain age.
Bitcoin Core, in contrast, will skip signatures on blocks which are ancestors of a specific block hash set in the software, where it is part of the normal audit process. This has actually been done since v0.5.2. 
The change in Core v0.14 (from the PR I included above) decouples this from the pinned chain and also makes it configurable by the user. The main motivation of that change is eliminating the chain pinning entirely.
These are two radically different things, though I can understand why you might be confused by their apparent similarity.

Core Developers released SegWit months ago, which removes the 1MB blocksize limit and replaces it with a 4MB blockweight limit. 
Any "1MB stall" at this point is due to miners wanting to keep the limit in place.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:21:48
Well, the reason that I brought up that specific change is that [BU has already implemented it]( 


Just because *you* don't consider the token valuable, doesn't mean that *everyone* would feel the same way. It is entirely conceivable that you would sell all your majority-fork tokens, buy tokens on the minority-fork, and the market ultimately disagrees with your assessment on the matter (and instead agrees with the miners' initial decision).
In that scenario, you would ultimately be left holding the bag.

@_date: 2017-03-16 18:24:33
Yes, it's definitely unfortunate that we're still waiting on SegWit to activate, because that's literally the *only* reason Core aren't hard at work coding up further blocksize increasing code (which would, of course, need a hard-fork). Because SegWit is so beneficial in terms of capacity, it was expected to activate pretty quickly and smoothly, so the plan was laid out as: "Roll out SegWit, observe how the network responds to the larger blocks that it allows, and based on that data, implement a long-term (hard-fork) solution for blocksize increases."
Without the data that SegWit would give, that plan is basically stalled out. Which, I think we both agree, is a pity. But it's also important to note that bundling in further hard-fork code, as "political appeasement" to try and get SegWit to activate, is *strongly* opposed by many members of Bitcoin Core, because in the eyes of many contributors, hard-forks should *never, ever* be politically motivated. So any suggestion along those lines is unfortunately a non-starter.

Good point. I personally think that proposals of incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls (the one crucial ingredient for a flex-cap proposal that is missing in e.g. BU) would be some of the most welcome work that a developer could provide at this stage in Bitcoin's life. I'm surprised that more aren't seriously approaching this right now, though I suppose it is a subject embroiled in controversy, which many engineers like to steer clear of whenever possible.

You can make a deterministic peg, and mathematically work out the formula for the ratio of your coin's issuance versus that of Bitcoin, and launch a sidechain according to that. In other words, it would be entirely possible to create a permanently-inflationary token with a sidechain.

Hey I've seen you winding up in a lot of arguments around this subreddit recently, and I just wanted to take a moment to say something, if you'll hear it.
Firstly, I'd like to say that I appreciate your perspective, and it's clear to me that you've put a lot of thought into the matter of scaling Bitcoin and have arrived very firmly at specific conclusions. I hope you continue to contribute your voice to the community in the days to come.
However, I do notice that you're also extremely dismissive on a regular basis in debates, rarely taking the time to fully elucidate your arguments and provide thorough explanation or justification of your beliefs. Furthermore, more often than not, you phrase your responses deliberately condescendingly, which just tends to polarize the discussion and provide the other party a reason to take you less seriously or give you less due consideration. I really think you'd have a much more successful and enjoyable time if you made a conscious effort to be more gracious and considerate with your commentary, and spend more time explaining exactly *why* you believe what you do (rather than just *what* you believe). I think, if you do spend a little more mental energy on forming such habits, you'll also notice better reactions from the people you're debating with, and find them easier to persuade and more receptive to your views.
I really hope that this doesn't come across as condescending or unfriendly in any way, and once again I want to say thanks for being a part of this community. Keep it up!

That is directly contradictory to what most Core developers have said on the subject, and directly contradictory to the Core Capacity Roadmap, too.
What is your belief founded upon?
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:39:44


I think this is the root of your misunderstanding here. Almost all of the developers in Bitcoin Core *do not* want to "lead the Bitcoin industry", and have repeatedly said so at every available opportunity. They are a decentralized group of developers who contribute and peer-review the Bitcoin source code; no more, no less.
That is also why it doesn't make sense to ask Core to "negotiate" or "compromise"; they are not a political organization, and have no authority to do either of those things. Again, the bulk of the membership has tried very hard to communicate this concept, but it seems that decentralization and leaderlessness is a tough concept for the community to come to grips with (even though it is a fundamental tenet of Bitcoin)!
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:20:09
To be perfectly fair, that's how moderation works. Low-value content which is against the rules of the platform, like spam, is curated out. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:30:10


Not quite, and that's a dangerous misinterpretation to make.
The consensus model of Bitcoin is dependent on 51% of mining power being controlled by *self-interested* operators, and moreover, the security model has additional safeguards even if a majority of hashpower *is* dishonest. 
From the whitepaper directly: 


chain. **Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes**, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block
containing them. An attacker can **only** try to change one of his own transactions to take back
money he recently spent.
This should hopefully help to show what a radical security/consensus change a flex-cap proposal without proper incentive controls would represent, because it grants such "attackers" (even those who aren't deliberately trying to "attack") far more power than they have today, and far more power than they were ever meant to have in Bitcoin.

This is a common misconception. SegWit isn't a "bundle" like what you describe, it is just *one* new feature which manages to achieve a lot of benefits at once.
Basically, all SegWit represents is the definition and introduction of a new transaction format. This new format is not malleable, it is more efficiently serializable, it allows for smarter pruning, and can be more easily extended with future improvements (for Schnorr signatures, MAST, etc). Another benefit is that it allows a *backwards-compatible* blocksize increase to occur *as a side effect*.
It might sound like it's "a lot of features bundled together" but if you look closer, it's really just one new feature. This new feature just happens to be a really great new feature, that allows a lot of awesome other stuff to happen much more easily.
The actual [SegWit BIP]( is worth checking out, if you're interested.

It does not actually address either, unfortunately. A mining consortium would be perfectly capable of gaming Bitcoin mining with larger-than-tolerable blocks (or more-than-tolerable cumulative sighash ops within those blocks), regardless of whether smaller/leaner alternative blocks were able to be validated in parallel to them. 
This particular risk vector actually compounds on itself, too. Initially, a coalition of 50.1% of hashrate could (possibly even accidentally, especially due to network limiters like the Great Firewall of China) mine and extend-upon blocks that are larger than the other 49.9% are able to validate competitively. Even if the 49.9% of miners are able to validate smaller blocks in parallel, they will ultimately be doomed trying to compete with the 50.1%, and as their orphan rates climb and their profitability declines, they would eventually be forced to shut down (assuming they are motivated by profit). This means that the remaining 50.1% of miners now make up the entire mining network... and the process can then repeat, with fewer participants on each iteration.
[Peter Todd also explained this idea very well years ago.](
Parallel block validation, while an important step forward, unfortunately does nothing to address the underlying issue here. 
That's why most Bitcoin engineers consider flex-cap proposals to be untenable *unless* they include proper incentive-alignment controls (e.g. the sacrifice of mining rewards in exchange for larger allowed block-sizes or [this proposal that came up with a few days ago]( which I'm still wrapping my mind around and digesting!). Otherwise, the network becomes much more gameable and will (almost certainly) become unattractively centralized over time.

Yes, in some cases it is particularly ugly, and I am greatly ashamed at how a subject or thread is handled by the team here. It can be downright unnervingly fascistic.

I'm sure there is a lot of nasty material and tactics that the mods of both subreddits have to deal with on a daily basis, at the very least, and I can understand an overly-aggressive zero-tolerance reactionary mindset if your patience had worn through. 
I think we all wish there was an easy solution here. But at this point, heels have been dug in, and those of us in the middle (which I'd imagine is most of us) have to do our best to improve things in the little ways we can.

Smart contracts are useful right now; each Bitcoin transaction is a relatively-simple smart contract. More complex contracts will be perfectly useful further down the road, too, as soon as they can be securely executed in a sequestered way (e.g. sidechains).

Money by nature has an ultimate opportunity cost. By holding one money, you are prevented from holding another. I can either have $1 or 0.00175 BTC, but not both. In other words, I can't have my cake and eat it, too. Similarly, I can either hold big-block coins or small-block coins, but not both.
Money, as a technology, also has incredibly strong network effects; the more people that use a particular money, the more attractive that money is as a tool. If you use the same type of money that I do, we can "speak the same language" and avoid transactional friction.
Beyond this, there is a particular cryptographic function chosen as the "hashing algorithm" for mining a particular coin. In Bitcoin, this is SHA256. If both chains were to continue using SHA256, the chain with the higher hash-rate would be incentivized to "attack" the smaller one, and they would be able to effectively sabotage that chain's functionality to the point of killing it. The only way to avoid this would be to change the proof-of-work function to something other than SHA256, which is possible, but neither side would like to be the one to attempt that, because it would basically be "starting from scratch" and the chain would be immensely insecure/vulnerable to begin with.
In short, it is highly, highly unlikely that there would be a stable equilibrium with two chains peacefully coexisting. Instead, we would expect consensus to converge on one singular chain and the other to be driven to a very low relative value.

What do you mean? The fact that no hardfork was deployed or activated a year ago pretty much conclusively refutes this. The argument "SegWit still hasn't been deployed" applies equally well to a hard-fork. 
Deployment delay is not due to waiting for code availability, it's waiting for the network to adopt the change. SegWit is much, much farther along in this regard than a "straightforward" 2MB blocksize bump, so it seems to me like you're arguing **in favor of SegWit and against a hard-fork** with this approach.


I legitimately mean no offense by this, but this is definitively incorrect. If the average transaction profile of the network stays the exact same as it is today, that should **already** be equivalent to block-sizes being 2MB. Any shift in average transaction signature profiles would actually increase this figure **further**, and this should begin yielding **even more throughput** when things like Schnorr signatures are deployed at scale.
TL;DR: **SegWit will most likely deliver far, far more than an effective 2MB increase**.
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:04:53


Well, SegWit as a softfork is **much, much cleaner, safer, and less complex** than as a hardfork. 
A hardforked SegWit would be a much uglier and more-complex implementation, code-wise. Pretty much everyone who has reviewed the code firsthand is in agreement with this.
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:52:07
True, but the chronological trajectory/transition is pretty clear; first, the overall network liquidity would need to grow by an order of magnitude (or multiple), which would require a huge upwards revaluation. This would make Bitcoin a fantastic investment during that period (assuming that it occurs at all).
After that was done, and the liquidity (and ubiquity) of Bitcoin had undergone massive expansion, Bitcoin would begin to function very usefully as a currency and everyday unit of account.

Oh no, there's no taking-out-of-context going on. He has been very clear about this, and expressed on many occasions: he believes that 1MB is too large, and that we should have something lower (I believe he said 400kb or 500kb max blocksizes would be much more appropriate in his view).

I agree with everything that you just said, but the best way to "extend a hand and help them to do better next time" is to explain, as patiently and thoroughly as possible, exactly why capital should be invested in Bitcoin (a money protocol) rather than Ethereum (a complex and mutable semi-centralized VM). 
In my experience, no matter how patient and helpful I try to be when I'm explaining these matters to ether-holders, they invariably respond with hostility and negativity, and do not take what I say seriously.

As for the analogy, would the recommended course of action be "Buy Bitcoin"? It stands to reason that long-term, in particular with the advent of pegged sidechains, holding bitcoins would be the equivalent of "betting on the success of the blockchain model in general", right?
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:59:40
Making it easier to change the consensus model *is* changing the consensus model. 
Imagine schoolchildren playing a game where they try to guess a number that the teacher picked before the round started. The teacher has an allowed range of numbers she might pick from. The child who is the closest to the number wins, and gets a piece of candy for that round. That's sort of like how Bitcoin works today.
Unlimited would add a whole new rule to the game: the children  each individually decide their allowed range of numbers before the round starts, and are able to see the winners' allowed ranges from the previous rounds. Then they try to guess the teacher's number, and if the winner's number was within more than half of the other childrens' allowed ranges, it wins, otherwise, the kids ignore the winner and wait for someone else to guess a winning number.
It's a different game entirely. Hopefully this simplification doesn't feel condescending in any way... it's just an attempt to reduce things down to basics, so that you can see that these are clearly *very* different games, with different rules and different strategies.


I'm glad that you said this, because it actually does a good job of "hitting the nail on the head" here. The way that Bitcoin mining works is specifically designed so that the mining membership is *completely dynamic*. The rules of the game are decided beforehand, so that everyone is able to play fairly and understands exactly how things work before they try to play. That way, you don't have to know *anything* about any other players, because the proofs-of-work speak for themselves. 
The point here is that attempting to deliberately orphan submissions in an anonymous-membership participation context is purposefully a high-friction, high-risk activity. If it weren't, Bitcoin would be completely uninteresting and would not have value (much less a price over $1000 per coin). 
It may also help to think about things in terms of the coin-creation schedule (or block rewards). If miners were able to determine the coin production rates via "emergent consensus", surely you see how that would fundamentally threaten or undermine Bitcoin's value proposition, right? The 21M coin cap wouldn't be "set in stone" at all!
Now, just to be clear, I do know that there is a difference between the coin-creation schedule and the blocksize limit, and I do know that BU's current policy on this subject is that "money-function relevant consensus rules are not subject to the rules of emergent consensus; everything else is", so please don't think I'm trying to pretend otherwise. What I'm trying to demonstrate is that rule fluidity has *enormous* implications for consensus constructs, and even though it can be hard to see sometimes when the relevant parameters are abstract (like "maximum block size"), the same principle most definitely applies -- *even* if the BU devs "promise" to never subject what they consider to be money-function relevant variables to the same consensus schema as everything else. 
It's perfectly fine to think that this is an acceptable change and tradeoff to make. It's not fine to pretend like it's not a dramatic change of the consensus model, though.
@_date: 2016-06-17 04:11:07
To be fair, transactional capacity is getting increased significantly in the near-term by SegWit. So it's not a case of "not increasing production [throughput] at all".

@_date: 2016-06-27 18:02:58
That is incorrect.
It allows blocks up to 3.6 MB in size. You can see examples of such blocks on a [SegWit block explorer]( 
The 1.6MB figure is not an upper bound, it is an approximate estimate of the average blocksize that would result from the network fully adopting SegWit, assuming the transaction profile of the network remains similar to what it is today.
Please, Mr. Ver, try to first understand both sides of an issue before attempting to weigh in on the matter. The fact that you were not aware that SegWit blocks can be up to 3.6MB in size is alarming to me, because it highlights a deep lack of understanding on your part. I mean no offense by this at all, I just wish that people on both sides of the fence would take a little more time to understand each others' perspectives, and this is a shining example of you *not* doing so.
@_date: 2016-06-01 21:38:37


Ask and ye shall receive. [See here for a quick glimpse into the transaction profile of the network]( or [here for a longer (but older) analysis of the same]( 
As you can see, the average transaction size is somewhere around 600 bytes these days, and trending upwards in general. The non-signature data of the transaction accounts for [about 150 bytes]( per transaction, usually, so that means that we're looking at about 450 signature-specific bytes per transaction. The way that SegWit works is by discounting this by 75% for SegWit-style transactions, so those 450 bytes are going to effectively drop to ~115 bytes instead. After adding back the 150 bytes of non-signature data that we originally factored out, we're left with transactions that have effective average sizes of 265 bytes each, as opposed to the 600 bytes they would have taken up without SegWit. 
So, assuming 100% SegWit usage and a relatively-identical network transaction profile, our final result is effectively **2.25MB** block sizes, give or take a marginal amount.
These calculations are all based on conservative estimates, too, so the actual throughput increase *should* ultimately be higher than this, assuming 100% SegWit usage. 
In reality, SegWit will likely result in &lt;2MB effective block-sizes for the near future just because a portion of the network will use standard (non-SegWit-specific) transactions which don't harness its benefits. That's perfectly okay, and one more reason why SegWit is superior to a hard-fork for the time being (in a hard-fork scenario, that same portion of the network which opted not to upgrade would be **orphaned** and likely lose a lot of money as a result).
 &gt;If people start to user more complicated signatures because of the discounts then you are comparing apple's to oranges in terms of savings. You can't add bytes and then count them as saved bytes.
No, you misunderstand. People are *already* using more complicated signatures/transaction-types in general; see the analysis of the second link in my first paragraph. This has been expected for a long time, and the empirical evidence is fully supporting that expectation so far. 
And beyond that, with Schnorr signatures (and/or other similar signature optimizations) the size estimates for any given transaction are going to reduce significantly, which when combined with SegWit should result in something like an **effective 6x block-size increase** if used at-scale. This is another nice thing made possible by SegWit which should ultimately be a larger upgrade, in terms of throughput, than a single hard-fork to something like 2MB or 4MB. 
It's not a case of "adding bytes and counting them as saved bytes"; it's a case of "being able to do more with the bytes that we already have, **and** adding bytes".

Assuming that the OP's argument is valid, which I very much dispute (for a number of reasons), the 1MB limit actually *mitigates* the problem he has outlined.

Yes, but that doesn't mean that the "mempools are connected". You and I are on the same network (the Internet), but that doesn't mean that the text documents I have saved on my hard drive are "connected" to you. They are local to my machine, just like a node's mempool.


Yes, as I said above: **the relative accessibility of different portions of the network from different locales or authorizations-of-access doesn't mean that those portions are not part of the Internet.** 
If I set up a password-protected page and host it publicly, and don't give you the password, that doesn't mean that the page "isn't on the Internet". It is. You don't have the password, so you can't access the content, but it's still definitely on the Internet.


No, this is not true.

This is really rather incredible to me. Months ago, many of us here were discussing this phenomenon: in a bear market, miners are more willing to sell their coins OTC to large prospective buyers, which basically absorbs the demand that would otherwise have to be satisfied through other channels. This would contribute to a negative feedback loop in terms of price; in other words, the bear market reinforces itself.
An interesting note, though, is that a bull market should logically experience the same self-magnifying effect. Miners who would, in a bear market, be much more willing to sell OTC, are instead "holding out" a little bit more, expressing more reluctance to sell. The demand has to be satisfied elsewhere, price responds positively, and the feedback loop proceeds.
This is **exactly** what that tweet is demonstrating. It's uncanny how prescient those old comments and conversations look in retrospect.

That's basically right. The brilliant aspect of the structure of the blockchain is that the alignment of incentives basically forces universal consensus, assuming that people (for the most part) are greedy.

No one *wants* to lose any money, but plenty of us can *afford* to lose quite a bit, and still be fine.
It means that if the amount of capital you've allocated to Bitcoin is so high that a crash to $0 would meaningfully hurt your standard of living or quality of life, you are overinvested. Sure, anyone holding Bitcoin would be upset if their holdings disintegrated in value, but anyone following this rule would be completely fine, in the long-term, even if this happened. 
So basically it means "If you want to buy bitcoins, be prepared to deal with the worst-case-scenario where your investment money disappears entirely." For a lot of people, that might mean that they should only buy $10 or $100 worth of bitcoin, if they still want to buy. The idea is to decide what amount makes sense for you, personally, and to make sure that this amount isn't so high that it could seriously affect your life if you lost it.

If you're looking at Bitcoin as an investment (and to be honest, that's the best way to look at it at this stage) then you should almost certainly have a long-term time horizon on that investment. In other words, don't plan on buying and then selling a few hours/days/weeks later; you're just going to be guessing. You might get lucky, and make a few bucks, or you might get unlucky, and lose a few.
If you've looked into Bitcoin and you're convinced that The Blockchain is a revolutionary technology, and that this technology will grow more and more as it has time to mature, then you shouldn't need to worry about what's happening to the price on any given day; the long-term trend should be up, so stick to your guns and wait it out for a real duration of time.

Check out [Core's Capacity Roadmap]( which explicitly talks about raising the limit, describing it as "critically important long term":


incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks** at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,
and prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee
market behavior that will eventually fund security. I think that right
now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that
**we don't immediately need these proposals, but they will be critically
important long term.** I'm planning to help out and drive towards a more
concrete direction out of these proposals in the following months.


be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, **dynamic
block size controls**, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.


soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability, and recent speedups
and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9
and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to
deploy. We’ll continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based
scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable.

4) From February 2014 to August 2014, the number of transactions "flatlined". 
5) From March 2015 to July 2015, the number of transactions "flatlined".

I would recommend first doing a lot of research into Bitcoin itself and how the mining process works.

This means that, unless the almost-8-year-trend of climbing hash-rate suddenly stops, whatever you invest into mining hardware will almost certainly be obsolete (i.e. unable to mine a non-negligible amount of Bitcoin, even under best-case-scenario assumptions) within 6 months to a year. 
If you are unable to reach a positive ROI in those first few months, it is almost guaranteed that you will never do so.

Good question. In this case, I'd say no. Apparently, ["multimillionaire" usually refers to individuals with net assets of US$10 million or more](
I see what you're saying, the "multi" prefix can be ambiguous and I may be guilty of using it inconsistently. But nevertheless, in this case, SegWit will be enabling blocks &gt; 2MB anyway, so my primary point remains unaffected; SegWit will deliver multi-megabyte blocks even if you define "multi-megabyte" as &gt;2MB.






Maybe I should be more clear on what I'm trying to communicate here: this isn't any more of a problem with SegWit than it would be with an alternative scaling solution (like a "simple" hardfork to 2MB). Such a fork would still be "months away from being activated" and would still "take even longer for people [i.e. miners] to start using it".
Hope that clarifies my point!

To be fair, we haven't been seeing exorbitant levels of volume so far... the exchanges are likely not under severe levels of load just yet. If the price volatility continues, though, that volume is bound to pick up in a big way... we'll see if the exchanges can roll with the punches then.
I expect there will be at least a couple temporary outages in the days to come. One or more exchanges could conceivably collapse, too. I'd ultimately expect Bitcoin to shrug this off, though; the world has seen that Bitcoin is more than just any particular Bitcoin exchange.

Looking at the app in the Google Play Store, it seems that it still has 3.6 stars at this time. I scrolled through the recent reviews, and there are dozens of 1-star reviews (complaining about dropping bitcoin support) and occasional 5-star reviews sprinkled in every now and then.
With very very few exceptions in the past couple of months, **every single 5-star review was made by a Circle employee**. I determined this by simply typing "firstname lastname circle" into Google (without quotes), and without fail, the first result for each 5-star reviewer's name is a LinkedIn page revealing their current employment at the company.
I won't list any names here (I don't want to doxx anyone), but here are a few examples of culprits' job descriptions:
* Risk Operations Manager at Circle
* Director Of Technical Operations at Circle
* Customer Experience Specialist at Circle
* Director, Legal &amp; Business Affairs at Circle
* Software Engineer (CloudOps) at Circle
* Software Engineer at Circle (x2)

There will be no such proof. The argument is "The lower the blocksize, the better, as long as the network is still able to handle the transactional demand for it [which, right now, it most definitely can]."
Fortunately, the blocksize is being increased by Segregated Witness, so once that activates, you'll get multi-megabyte blocks anyway!

If it has many more transactions, obviously it's not "too expensive" because people are willing to pay those fees to make those transactions.
If it *does* become "too expensive" and people stop making as many transactions, then there is excess capacity and people can make free/cheap transactions again.

The problem with the definition you provided is that it is unfortunately circular.

Sure thing. Check out [Core's Capacity Roadmap]( which explicitly talks about raising the limit, describing it as "critically important long term":


incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks** at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,
and prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee
market behavior that will eventually fund security. I think that right
now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that
**we don't immediately need these proposals, but they will be critically
important long term.** I'm planning to help out and drive towards a more
concrete direction out of these proposals in the following months.


be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, **dynamic
block size controls**, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.


soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability, and recent speedups
and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9
and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to
deploy. We’ll continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based
scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable.

To be perfectly fair, every single developer (without exception) who contributed to Bitcoin in any way over the first 6-7 years of its existence has voiced support of SegWit.

network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but **as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware**. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.](

I'm not sure what you're referring to here, either. No one in Core has recently come out strongly against any block size increases, as far as I'm aware. SegWit itself is a blocksize increase, which has just been released, and every subsequent blocksize increase would be made easier with SegWit, so Core seems to be following the Capacity Roadmap faithfully so far.

By that logic, the alleged "censorship" by theymos is also a perfectly valid game mechanic.
@_date: 2016-11-21 20:01:18


You'll note that I mentioned this in my comment already.


I don't think you're appreciating what I'm saying here. It's not a matter of "implementation-specific variance", it's a matter of network consensus. The entire point of Bitcoin is to facilitate universal consensus on the ledger. That is why the blockchain was invented, that is the point of involving Proof of Work, that is why mining rewards even exist. If you make a change that stands to violate this consensus, it amounts to an attack on the subset of the userbase which disagrees with the change.


Then you support Core's choice not to hard-fork the blocksize limit up (and instead increase it via SegWit, soft-forked in). After all, almost every single Core developer agrees that a hard-fork to increase the limit is dangerous, risky, and suboptimal. 


They do have such an attitude. Altcoins are not discouraged by Core at all. But when it comes to the Bitcoin network and blockchain, which is defined by consensus, the attitude of most Core developers is to preserve that consensus to the greatest degree possible. Alternative implementations that violate this consensus are rightfully discouraged, because those implementations are (by definition) not Bitcoin.
Granted, *if* an alternative implementation managed to achieve consensus on the changes that they made (whether or not those changes required a hard-fork), then the resultant chain supported by that implementation would *be* Bitcoin, and things would proceed from there. Until then, it is Core's duty to preserve consensus to the best of their ability.
I appreciate the dialogue here, by the way! I hope I'm not coming off as confrontational (I really don't mean to) -- again, just trying my best to explain the Core perspective as I understand it.

He means that, for instance, if you were a miner and you tried to reward yourself 100BTC in a coinbase transaction, BU will consider this invalid (*even* if the majority of hashpower accepted and built upon that block). In other words, BU does *not* actually facilitate Nakamoto consensus as you've defined it.

Could you provide an example of a single Core contributor who has said something like this? 


Yes, many think that the current 1MB limit is already causing harm to the decentralization of the network. For instance, Luke-Jr feels this way. However, Luke-Jr is also supportive of blocksize increases in the future, when it is safe to do so (he signed and supports the Core Roadmap, and has personally coded up blocksize increase candidate code). Believing that the maximum blocksize should be lower than its current value is not the same thing as believing that it should never be increased.
@_date: 2016-11-21 06:07:00


Rising transaction fees are *necessary* for Bitcoin to survive in the long-term, as is a continual transaction backlog. I understand the argument that "It's still too early in the game for us to allow high transaction fees" but this is not a cut-and-dry issue, where "higher transaction fees = bad" and "lower transaction fees = good". We would all prefer to pay less on the transactions we make, but we must reconcile this with the reality that Bitcoin is designed and predicated on transaction fees alone subsidizing miners in the long term.


Even during peak loads, transaction fees on typical transactions are almost never higher than $0.15 or so... and that is for next-block confirmation. This is still significantly cheaper than most remote-value-transmission alternatives like credit cards.


I haven't seen such an attitude expressed, personally. And by "top bitcoin leadership" do you simply mean those with commit access to the Bitcoin Core repository? That's a rather loaded phrase, in my opinion.


I don't think this is a fair characterization at all. Bitcoin Core isn't supposed to "pick sides", so if there is a contentious hard-fork proposal where some think it is a good idea, and others do not (which is the case for every hard-fork proposal made to date), it would actually be an abuse of power to merge that change in anyway. 
Imagine that you did *not* think that a hard-fork to increase the blocksize was a good idea (like many of us do), but Bitcoin Core decided to do it anyway. That wouldn't be very fair, would it? You would suddenly be *forced* to upgrade your software to support a change that you didn't agree with, if you wanted to continue safely using Bitcoin. 
I find it helps to think things through from the opposing perspective, to understand an issue fully. I completely understand that you (and many others) want the maximum blocksize to be raised with a hard-fork, but there is also a significant portion of the ecosystem who do *not* want this right now. Consider things from their point of view, as much as you are able to. A hard-fork that Core decided to push through, ignoring their objections, would be a *massive* sleight and abuse of position; that would truly be a dictatorial maneuver. 
I hope you appreciate what I'm saying here, I really do. I think almost everyone should spend some time trying to imagine what things look like from the other side of the fence. It can be a very illuminating experience.

Yes, but that's a completely different claim. Believing that the blocksize should be decreased is a *totally* different belief than believing that "hard forks are just too difficult and we don't need them anyway". Luke-Jr has never said "we should never hard fork", he has instead said that the blocksize limit is currently too high, and having a centralizing (negative) effect. I hope you can appreciate the difference between those two beliefs.


It's still accurate. Many of the signers (including Gregory Maxwell, who wrote the roadmap to begin with) have voiced their continued support of the capacity roadmap since then. I don't think it's fair to assume that any Core developers who signed have changed their minds, unless you've actually seen them express so.


What do you mean? The scaling post talks at length about on-chain scaling, explicitly. I even bolded a few excerpts where it is discussed. It's clear from the roadmap that the Core developers think that on-chain scaling is important (just like off-chain scaling is). I would encourage you to re-read the document if you got a different impression.


Again, I recommend to re-read the document, because it addresses this. For example: "right now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that we don't immediately need these proposals, but they will be critically important long term." 
It's a matter of priorities. SegWit has been top priority (and rightfully so!), so the other proposals have not received much attention yet, which makes perfect sense and is perfectly logical. Once SegWit activates, this will almost certainly change.


Well, it's explicitly listed on the [SegWit benefits]( page. It's not the *only* reason for SegWit, of course... that's why SegWit is so exciting and beneficial. It helps in many different ways, with one relatively-minor change. It kills many birds with one stone.


Yes, definitely true.


I'm happy that you're thinking about this and doing your best to estimate what will be needed, that's great and should be encouraged. But with that said, we can certainly do better than off-the-cuff guesses, especially when it comes to critical changes. It's important to make data-driven, logical analyses (and preferably from many different people) to inform our decisions on the matter. Guessing-and-hoping in the absence of meaningful data is not a smart way to approach big problems where a lot of money is on the line. 
The smart thing to do (and what Core has stated their intent to be) would be to make what safe improvements and optimizations we can, develop and deploy the orders-of-magnitude "game-changing" solutions (like Lightning Network), gather data, analyze and discuss this data, and then base our next actions off of what we find. It is entirely possible that we can achieve VISA-level capacity, in the short-term, without even needing to hard-fork... though I agree that in order to get there, we will *probably* need to bump the maximum blocksize up at some point. We just don't know yet.

Do you have more accurate data than [the analytics]( linked to in the tweet? As far as I can tell, they are accurate. Over the past year, P2SH usage has increased significantly, which is what has increased the "expected capacity increase" from ~1.7MB to ~2.1MB.

Yes, that's right, but like you said, he's always felt that way (or at least has felt that way for more than two years now). He didn't recently come out against any block size increases, his views on the subject had been quite established for some time now.
He also signed the Capacity Roadmap, signaling his support of that plan, and was instrumental in the development of SegWit, and has also been working on a hard-fork implementation of a block-size increase, as well. So even though he believes that the limit should be smaller than it currently is, he is not adamantly refusing a block-size increase (in fact, if I'm not mistaken, he is the Core developer who has put the most work into actually coding one up!).

@_date: 2016-06-10 15:03:42


Clearly not. If the fees for Bitcoin transactions are equal or bigger than those for bank transactions, that means that there is enough demand for Bitcoin transactions for those fees to be being paid. That would mean that Bitcoin is **succeeding magnificently**, the exact opposite of collapsing.
It's like seeing a restaurant that's always crowded (fully-packed), and asking "Is that restaurant about to go out of business? It's too crowded to keep operating!" In actuality, the restaurant is prospering, not on the brink of bankruptcy.
In other words, if you begin with the assumption that fees in Bitcoin are super-high, you are implicitly assuming that there is super-high demand for bitcoins, i.e. that Bitcoin is doing super-well.

I didn't have much of an opinion regarding Andrew Stone's technical competence until reading this article and the responses to it. I have to say, I am the opposite of impressed; it looks like he went out of his way to try to identify bugs in the Core codebase, convinced himself that he had done so, and wrote an article about it... not realizing that none of the alleged "bugs" were actually bugs in the Core codebase.
This episode reflects *very* poorly on Andrew Stone as a developer.

It is [still the agreed-upon roadmap]( for Bitcoin Core.


That is not true. 
1) Individuals (some of whom are Core developers) agreed to this, not Bitcoin Core as an organization. There is a meaningful distinction here.
2) These individuals did agree to release such code, but the promise was that this would be done within 3 months **after** SegWit was released (which would mean there are still almost 3 months left to fulfill the promise).
3) The agreement stipulated a provision that the mining pools involved do not run any Core-incompatible code in the meantime. F2Pool in particular quickly violated this provision, which effectively invalidated the Hong Kong agreement.


Actually, Luke-Jr (did release a ["hardfork2016"]( code-branch, so technically it has already happened. However, there is a rather tongue-in-cheek implementation detail of this branch that I'm sure many hard-fork advocates would be quite unhappy to discover (I won't spoil it, but if you go through the commit diffs you should see what I mean).


I don't see how that is the case. The Roadmap linked above lays out their intentions fairly clearly. Step 1 is to implement SegWit, which makes every subsequent step much easier. 
And part of the *point* of the Roadmap is that Core supports multiple scaling options (ideally implemented in tandem). This is a good thing.

Because Lightning Network transactions *are* Bitcoin transactions. The security model is therefore the same as that of Bitcoin itself. 
The key difference is that every atomic transaction on the Lightning Network does not need confirmation (to be included in a Bitcoin block), because of the properties of payment channels, and instead only the opening/closing channel transactions ultimately require explicit confirmation.

Bitcoin usage is pseudonymous and there are no identity-based barriers to entry in the network. An inherent quality of such a system is that you fundamentally *cannot* measure how many distinct users there are on the network without an external polling mechanism of some sort (which, to date, does not exist).
The only meaningful metrics that we can use to judge adoption, as stated above, are those that involve actual capital expenditure. Other than that, everything is gameable to the point of meaninglessness.

Actually, that's totally incorrect. The **very earliest** prediction, from Satoshi himself, was this:


network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.](

In all fairness, everyone in the second camp thinks we need both on-chain and off-chain scaling, too. One of the big advantages of SegWit is that it makes later on-chain scaling much safer.

incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks at some cost.**

The best metrics to judge the rate of Bitcoin adoption are those that can't be gamed at zero-cost. If a metric can be gamed at zero-cost (in other words, if I could easily inflate that metric considerably without spending any money), then it is likely not going to be a very good indication of reality, because there could be (and probably are) people doing exactly that.
**Bad metrics include:** users subscribed to Bitcon subreddits (reddit accounts are free), Coinbase/Blockchain.info wallet counts (starting new wallets is free), Chinese exchange volumes (there are zero fees on most Chinese exchanges).
**Good metrics include:** [the market price of Bitcoin]( (to affect the price, capital must be used), [LocalBitcoins trade volumes]( (LocalBitcoins charges fees for using their escrow service, and these volume figures only include those trades which use that service), [transaction fees paid]( (by definition, this costs money), [network hash rate]( (mining hardware requires capital investment).
You'll notice that each of the good metrics indicates profound, unambiguous growth. The conclusion should be obvious.

On this note, I recall [Olivier Janssens awarding $100,000 to Mike Hearn]( in an allegedly-unbiased bounty program like what Ver is doing here. Considering that Roger Ver, Olivier Janssens, and Mike Hearn each have a history of ardently advocating large blocks (and stirring up drama in support of this cause), it would not surprise me to learn that most of these bounty programs are rigged in advance i.e. largely just political theater.
After all, *who* gets the final decision on where the funds are awarded? I would be much more impressed if the funds were put in escrow managed by a party (or coalition) that were respected for their objectivity in such matters, than I am with a pool of funds allocated at Ver's sole discretion.

No, it's not like PayPal, because PayPal has custody of your funds. When you say "Seems like it all just comes down to a database and trusting that database" it shows that you still have a misunderstanding here which is preventing an accurate mental conception of what payment channels represent.
Imagine you craft a Bitcoin transaction which sends your coins to a special address, which only lets you withdraw those coins from those address at a certain date (let's say January 1, 2018). You broadcast this transaction to the network, and it is included in a block. You then craft *another* Bitcoin transaction which sends those same coins from the special address to a normal address which I control, but this transaction can go through at any time (it doesn't have to wait until 2018 to be valid). Rather than broadcasting this second transaction to the network, you write it down on a slip of paper and hand that paper to me. 
Now I can take the transaction information (from the slip of paper) and cryptographically verify that it is valid, and that it pays all your coins (in the special address) into my own address that I have full control of. I don't have to broadcast this transaction to the Bitcoin miners if I don't want to -- I can hold onto it instead. As long as the date is still prior to January 1, 2018, I know that you can't withdraw or move those coins (because of the cryptographic restrictions on the special address). So even though I haven't submitted the transaction itself to the network, I'm not "trusting a database" at all; I'm trusting the cryptography of the transaction(s) themselves, just like in Bitcoin itself. There's no counterparty who could suddenly decide to cancel the payment (like there is with PayPal) and there's no central server with a database that I am relying upon to know that the transaction (on the slip of paper) is valid. I can just test things cryptographically, and when I'm ready to settle up, I just broadcast that Bitcoin transaction you gave me, and that's that.
Lightning Network operates conceptually similarly to the process outlined above, except no physical paper needs to be involved. :)
I hope that helps!

What would be the incentive for doing so?
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:23:48
Money, as a technology, creates (or at minimum preserves) wealth by making trades and transfers more efficient. If we all had to trade in chickens, goats, and gasoline (i.e. barter-based trade) there would be a great deal of deadweight loss that we would all suffer from. "How many goats do you want for that bushel of apples? What do you mean you don't need any goats? You only want armor? Okay, fine, I'll go trade my goats to the blacksmith, and then I'll be back with some armor to get those apples from you..."
Money allows us to trade with one another using a common unit of account, which prevents many inefficiencies from continually bleeding transactors of their wealth and produce. But not all money is created equal; some types of money are *better* at preventing these inefficiencies than others are. [Rai stones]( aren't as good as gold, and gold isn't as good as cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin creates wealth by *being better money* than alternative monetary technologies are. By allowing wealth to be transferred more efficiently and flexibly than its predecessors do, it allows more of what we produce to go to good use.
Or at least, that's my view on it all.

Many people have demanded proof for the assertion that Gregory Maxwell has made here. Fortunately, [Bitmain themselves provided proof today on their blog!](
In this post, Jihan Wu confirms that the boost-exploit *is* manufactured into Bitmain's chip hardware, which is the claim that Gregory Maxwell made. Note: he did *not* claim that they were using this on mainnet (and for what it is worth, in the blog post, they deny doing so).
Other than the clarity that this provides, there is other good news, as well: they claim that it is not cost-effective to actually take advantage of the exploit on mainnet, so they should (logically) not be opposed to activating the BIP that would prevent doing so. Whether or not you believe that Bitmain is using the exploit, it's excellent news that we can trivially remove the ability to (covertly) do so, so that the mining playing field is leveled appropriately (at least in a way that prevents perverse incentives to resist network upgrades that might interfere with this boost).
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:03:36
There are a number of ways in which the existence of this exploit hurts Bitcoin.
It makes mining empty blocks appreciably more efficient than mining blocks with transactions (and explains why AntPool mines so many empty blocks, relative to other mining pools). In other words, it creates perverse mining incentives that hurt Bitcoin's transaction capacity (no matter how big blocks are able to be).
It is incompatible with many, many protocol improvements and upgrades. It therefore provides an incentive for miners taking advantage of this exploit to block or oppose such upgrades (which do include SegWit, but also include numerous other unrelated upgrades).
It is also patented, and on top of that, Bitmain does not appear to be allowing ASICs outside of their direct control to take advantage of this exploit (even if they originally manufactured them). This has a severe centralizing effect on mining.
All in all, the covert-boost exploit is a clear negative for Bitcoin as a whole. Patching it is definitely a good thing.

The folder size doesn't have anything to do with the wallet balance.
It sounds like you were, at one time, running Bitcoin Core (or more likely, Bitcoin-QT). One quick way to check your balance is to run that program again (your Bitcoin program), and look at the addresses that are in your wallet. 
Since you won't be synchronized with the current blockchain fully, and this can take quite a while to do, you can go to a block explorer site like Blockchain.info and enter in the addresses from your wallet there, to see the current balance of them.

In other words, when people talk about "microtransactions" in the context of Bitcoin, we mean "very small-value transactions that are too cost-prohibitive to be viable in legacy payment systems", whereas the microtransactions VISA has "enabled" here are instead "application-specific customer loyalty points".

The system would work for normal-sized payments just as well as it would work for micropayments. If you disagree with this fact, would you mind outlining why, exactly? When I read your article, it seemed to me that this assumption was foundational to your arguments, and to me, it seems clearly flawed. If you have a defense for this assumption, I'd love to hear it, but it was conspicuously absent from the article as it was originally written.

It prevents covert ASICBOOST from working, which is (most likely) granting an extreme and opaque advantage to particular mining conglomerates. This sort of advantage can be (and almost certainly has been) leveraged to the severe detriment of competing enterprises.

First you would need to acquire/buy "2MB coins" (by which I assume you mean UTXOs that exist on the 2MB chain but do not exist on the 1MB chain). 
Any coins you already own at the time of the fork would be valid and recognized on both chains, so you couldn't "sell all your 2MB coins immediately" in any meaningful sense. You could hypothetically attempt to double-spend your coins, but would likely have no more luck with that than you would have right now trying the same thing.

Yeah, I think it's pretty unambiguously deplorable, in light of that fact. The BIP proposed earlier today should patch it (and would not be incompatible with BU software). The code to implement the BIP isn't released yet, but I imagine that it will be rolled out as quickly as possible (and from what I understand, it is a *very* minimal change, which will require very little development effort).

The successor(s) to Bitcoin will still very much use the underlying ledger.

@_date: 2017-04-13 20:14:59


Yes, that is true. Semantically speaking, a successful UASF is not a hard fork.


Again, you don't blacklist unupgraded nodes. 


But the old node is still able to receive blocks from you just fine, and is at no risk of defraudation nor susceptible to risks like overinflation. The same cannot be said of a hard fork.
It is not accurate to describe a soft fork as a hard fork, even if there are similarities between them.

So by recompiling my ProgenyFed software, wouldn't I be able to grant myself as many ProgenyCoins as I want?

A user-activated soft fork is not a hard fork. You appear to be misunderstanding the terminology here (which is understandable). Just because there is the possibility of a chain-split does not make something a hard fork. Furthermore, a UASF would not blacklist non-mining nodes in any way.

If what you say is true, would you mind corroborating it? **This** is what the community is after: actual data-driven arguments demonstrating the validity of the assertion that a 2MB hard-fork is detrimental to Bitcoin at this stage. To date, I have seen *nothing* of the sort, and was under the impression that no such analysis has been executed. You're telling us otherwise, and I'm certainly not insinuating that you're lying, but I think publishing further details about these workshops would be *huge* in the push for community unity.

This blog post from Bitmain actually proves Maxwell's only claim (that the covert-boost exploit exists, on a hardware level, in their chips). In other words, this blog post itself serves as confirmation.
Maxwell did *not* claim that they were using this exploit on mainnet (it would be undetectable if they were, anyway). However, the data does seem to indicate that they are.
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:53:26

@_date: 2016-02-09 18:55:40
Why should it?
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:19:27
There are a number of ways in which the existence of this exploit hurts Bitcoin.
It makes mining empty blocks appreciably more efficient than mining blocks with transactions (and explains why AntPool mines so many empty blocks, relative to other mining pools). In other words, it creates perverse mining incentives that hurt Bitcoin's transaction capacity (no matter how big blocks are able to be).
It is incompatible with many, many protocol improvements and upgrades. It therefore provides an incentive for miners taking advantage of this exploit to block or oppose such upgrades (which do include SegWit, but also include numerous other unrelated upgrades).
It is also patented, and on top of that, Bitmain does not appear to be allowing ASICs outside of their direct control to take advantage of this exploit (even if they originally manufactured them). This has a severe centralizing effect on mining.
All in all, the covert-boost exploit is a clear negative for Bitcoin as a whole. Patching it is definitely a good thing.

SegWit actually increases the blockweight limit to 4M, which can result in 3.7MB blocks. A hard fork to increase the "base" block size on top of that would allow 7-8MB blocks, which research indicates is untenable on the current Bitcoin network.

Well, I never mentioned "VISA" in my comment at all. 
I don't think *anyone* is trying to argue that doubling the blocksize to 2MB would allow on-chain Bitcoin to process VISA-levels of traffic. You may (unintentionally, I hope) be strawmanning with that one.
The actual argument would be: "Doubling the blocksize right now would double the on-chain transaction capacity now, which would prevent premature fee pressure as other solutions (a la Lightning Network or other payment channels) are developed and deployed." No one is suggesting that innovation stop after the blocksize is increased.

Actually, that post contains many inaccuracies and misunderstandings. He seems fairly confused about the entire ordeal in a number of ways.
Bitmain have confirmed that their chip circuitry is indeed set up with this functionality (and consumers who have bought the chips have also confirmed this through experimentation). The bulk of Sam Cole's Medium post appears to argue that it is unlikely that the chips' hardware is set up to support this, but we now know that they do.
He also seems to be under the impression that the patch to prevent covert-boosting would require a hard fork (or even a PoW change), which is similarly false. Furthermore, the patch would only preclude *covert* boosting; if the network-at-large decides that ASIC-boosting in general is a good thing and a valuable optimization, it would still be possible to do it overtly. The patch was specifically designed to support this.
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:35:57
1) To reach 8MB blocksizes under EC would still require a coordinative duration. It's unrealistic to assume that the maximum blocksize would transition immediately and frictionlessly from 1MB to 8MB overnight.
2) Even ignoring the transitional friction, the mempool could very easily spike (at least temporarily) to sizes well in excess of 20MB, *even* with continually-full 8MB blocks being mined on the network. It's not wise to simply "hope the mempool stays manageable" when it could very well fail to do so (whether under adversarial conditions or not).

Why would that be the case? Miners still have costs and constraints on what they can handle, BU is not supposed to be "zero constraints on blocksize whatsoever" or anything like that.

Either the UASF-chain is longer, in which case this block is never even considered by the old node, or the non-UASF-chain is longer, in which case the node will ignore the UASF-chain entirely and is at no risk of defraudation.


These would not be "bitcoins" in any meaningful sense. In the same way, you could say that altcoins "dilute the value of the original 21M coins" but there's nothing to prevent anyone from launching as many altcoins as they want (in fact, there are websites that allow you to do so in a matter of seconds).

It can, and *does*, work for all consensus parameters, very much including the max blocksize.

How do either of them have any more influence on the protocol than Coinbase? Neither has commit access to Bitcoin Core. 
Really, the only influence that Gregory Maxwell or Adam Back enjoy over the Bitcoin protocol is the social influence they have accrued through consistently-high-quality contributions over the years.

The 95% threshold has been hit numerous times for soft forks over the years.

What about a **hard-fork to 2MB on block-height 420,000** (i.e. the moment that the block-reward halves)?
This is about [22 weeks away]( (plenty of time for nodes and miners to get ready, especially if a network alert to upgrade was sent out reasonably soon), it makes logical sense to double block capacity as the block "subsidy" is cut in half, and this would bypass the 75%/95% activation threshold disagreement entirely (simplifying the code and logic for hard-fork activation).
I've started drafting a BIP for this proposal, but I'm not convinced that yet-another-blocksize-increase BIP is a good idea... should I finish the process? What do people think of this suggestion?

It seems like a UASF has all the pros of a hard fork, but fewer cons. I think, as you said, a hard fork should be a "last resort" option, and we should at least make an *attempt* at a UASF before attempting something so dangerous as a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:33:35
Yes, this is indeed a very nice synopsis of the situation.
It seems that both factions would like for the minority faction to "fork off" onto their own blockchain. However, the minority faction in this particular instance covets the "Bitcoin" name, and feels that double-SHA-256 defines Bitcoin, so they are waiting for the majority of hashrate to signal support before initiating their fork.
So, really, what would now be best is for BU to get more hashrate support, so that they are comfortably over the 50% mark. I'm certain that if they manage to get more than half of miners signaling BU support, they will eventually attempt the fork (even if they never reach a 75% threshold or anything reasonably close to it).
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:04:31

No, this is mistaken. The fact that particular UTXOs exist on one chain does not mean that they are invalid or missing from an alternative chain.

But if the 1% that are mandating UASF are also the only *economically relevant* nodes (i.e. if all Bitcoin businesses and users who handle serious amounts of Bitcoin) are on the UASF-side of things, then the other side, despite its larger node counts, will die, because the bitcoins mined there are no longer valuable.

This is full corroboration of Maxwell's claim, in other words. 
Other than the clarity that this provides, there is other good news, as well: they claim that it is not cost-effective to actually take advantage of the exploit on mainnet, so they should (logically) not be opposed to activating the BIP that would prevent doing so. Whether or not you believe that Bitmain is using the exploit, it's excellent news that we can trivially remove the ability to (covertly) do so, so that the mining playing field is leveled appropriately (at least in a way that prevents perverse incentives to resist network upgrades that might interfere with this boost).

The real value of Bitcoin is that it is an objective (fair) monetary protocol, over which no single entity has unchallenged dominion. 
The blockchain was created solely to facilitate the immutability and consistency of this protocol.
Being "nimble" is not a desirable property for such a system/network to have. It may seem like this is desirable, especially from the perspective that Bitcoin is a new type of "startup", because traditional companies usually *do* have to be nimble, to stay ahead of competition. However, traditional companies run via a top-down power structure, and are fundamentally antithetical to the idea of Bitcoin and the Blockchain. 
It is difficult to wrap your mind around the true value proposition of Bitcoin, which is a large part of why this debate has gone on for so long and so many people have gotten so frustrated regarding it. But if you spend some time thinking critically about the value that Bitcoin brings to the world, you might very well come to the conclusion that the current "gridlock" we're seeing actually demonstrates that value better than any smooth state-change would.
@_date: 2017-04-13 01:35:18
Interesting idea. I have a few questions, if you have the time...
How do you plan to address the quadratic operations issue and the poison blocks that are possible when the base block space is increased? 
Have you worked out replay protection mechanisms and safeguards, too?

@_date: 2016-02-03 21:59:49
Neither of those sources give any indication of a 2MB hard-fork being planned for early 2017 by the Core team. In fact, the latter comment explicitly states that it is believed by Core that 2MB is **too dangerous** to even consider forking to in the foreseeable future.

@_date: 2016-02-25 16:53:11
Just a couple of minor points I want to contribute:


Those blocks are not going to be filled, unfortunately. They are a result of SPV mining, which is an economically rational choice. So in any analysis you perform, you should be careful not to factor in "When those empty blocks are instead filled up" because it is an unrealistic expectation.


This seems to imply that using SegWit transactions will give you a greater chance of having your transactions included in the next block, which is again, not realistic. There is no imperative for miners to include SegWit transactions over normal ones. In other words, everyone using SegWit *will* result in more transactions fitting in a block, but any individual using SegWit rather than a standard transaction will *not* really have any better chance of their transaction being included in the next block.


Negligent node maintenance isn't really a valid argument to stymie network growth, in my opinion. 


This really isn't an argument at all. *Why* doesn't increasing the blocksize work? Naturally, it *should* work, to a degree. Will it result in order-of-magnitude more block capacity? No. But will it "work" by allowing more transactions to fit into a block in the short term? Of course.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:22:18
It's a soft fork which may or may not cause a chain split. That is very different from a hard fork, however.
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:20:44

@_date: 2016-02-03 19:56:53
Unfortunately I think you missed the point. The consensus-critical change in Classic would be the 2MB hard-fork. When you ask:


The answer is: "Merge the 2MB hard-fork into Core, and the merge would be made by Core, because without such a merge, their repository would be made obsolete."
From there, it wouldn't matter whether you're running a Classic node or a Core node, because both would accept 2MB blocks without issues. Subsequent developments (e.g. the SegWit soft fork in a few months' time) would not be impeded in any significant way. No Core developers would be "fired" and they wouldn't lose any control save for the ability to unilaterally veto or approve later consensus-critical changes.
I hope that helps clear things up.

I'm sorry to hear that your experience has been so... "dismissed", for lack of a better word, but I'm also glad that you're being diligent about the entire process, seeking feedback and assistance, and not trying to be too forceful or overconfident with your proposal. It really makes me smile to know that you (and others like you) are willing to put in the legwork like that.
I especially think it's prudent of you to hold off on pushing this proposal until November (a lot can change in Bitcoin in 6-8 months, after all). 
I don't have much commentary to input on the specifics of the proposal, though. I think the idea of a gradual blockweight calculation change is an interesting idea, but it also seems like it might be tricky to get consensus on, if for no other reason than complexity. I wish I had better advice or input to provide, but alas, nothing springs to mind.
As for the political/social traction (or lack thereof), I think it might be in large part due to the "burnout" that the developers probably generally feel, at this point, with regards to the scaling wars. There are many other interesting components of Bitcoin development that have (sadly enough) not received as much attention as the problem of "how to increase capacity intelligently", and it seems like so many people (from those who have never programmed even the simplest of programs, to the most qualified engineers in the space) have offered so much input that the topic is, in a word, *overloaded* by now. Again, sorry that you haven't gotten much attention or assistance (so far), but I think it's probably healthy to keep in mind some of the social reasons that might be the case. I hope you don't get too discouraged, though... it seems to me that the more reasonable and diligent developers collaborating on Bitcoin behind-the-scenes, the better!

It's a flag-day patch; if abusers don't apply it (and especially if the rest of the mining network *does*) they are permanently orphaned. 
If the majority of miners don't apply the patch, then things could definitely get interesting (or possibly even "ugly"). It would be rational to apply the patch for any miners that are not using ASICBOOST, though, since it would level the playing field (eliminate their disadvantage) and increase their bottom line in the process.

Bitcoin is secured by "Proof of Work", and someone found a way to skip doing (some of) the work but get a "satisfactory proof" anyway, and they have a way to do this attack secretly. This exploit can reduce both the security and decentralization of Bitcoin, and also hurts the normal operation of Bitcoin in a number of ways.
It makes mining empty blocks appreciably more efficient than mining blocks with transactions (and explains why AntPool mines so many empty blocks, relative to other mining pools). In other words, it creates perverse mining incentives that hurt Bitcoin's transaction capacity (no matter how big blocks are able to be).
It is incompatible with many, many protocol improvements and upgrades. It therefore provides an incentive for miners taking advantage of this exploit to block or oppose such upgrades (which do include SegWit, but also include numerous other unrelated upgrades).
It is also patented, and on top of that, Bitmain does not appear to be allowing ASICs outside of their direct control to take advantage of this exploit (even if they originally manufactured them). This has a severe centralizing effect on mining.
All in all, the covert-boost exploit is a clear negative for Bitcoin as a whole. Patching it is definitely a good thing. Fortunately, Maxwell has proposed a trivial and uncontroversial patch that prevents this exploit from being abused (though you can still use the ASICBOOST optimization even when the patch is active, it would just have to be done in a way that is transparent to the rest of the network).

Firstly, the current pool of such developers is downright microscopic. And of those, the ones who are concentrated on Ethereum are actually, from what I can see, shockingly amateur. TheDAO fiasco (and how it was handled) really showed the ugly truth of the Ethereum community, and that their emperors really are naked. I've spent a lot of time looking over the dApps that currently exist (and those that are in the works) and haven't found many that are particularly impressive. Most of the high-profile ones are, in fact, identifiably misguided, poorly designed, and implemented sloppily. On top of that, Ethereum itself is a very centralized initiative; it's a lot more of a private company than it is an open blockchain.
The **serious** developers, the ones who take time to understand problems, build from solid foundations, and consider the myriad implications of any particular issue, are pretty much exclusively concentrated on Bitcoin. This should come as no surprise, when you think about it, but it holds remarkably true in the real world. And they seem to understand, by and large, that the interesting (read: complex) smart contracts will only be meaningfully implemented when the data-structural foundations have been laid and fleshed out properly. That's exactly what is happening with Bitcoin; you can actually watch the development on github and mailing lists, if you're inclined to pay attention.
What motivation do dApp developers have to develop on Bitcoin and the sidechains thereof? It's **The** Blockchain. It is the standard, open, and non-biased protocol of money. It has a larger network (by *at least* an order of magnitude) and it is where all the smart developers are currently concentrating their efforts. It isn't done sloppily; it's done right.
Please, if you want to continue this discussion at all, I ask that you first read [this post]( It's not a whitepaper, and it's fairly short and written for a general audience, so it is particularly digestible, and it does a very good job of outlining why the people who understand matters thoroughly are focusing on Bitcoin (and will continue to do so).

Why should standalone blockchains be any better at achieving diversity than sidechains, though?
My question is "what advantages do standalone blockchains offer to otherwise-equivalent two-way-pegged sidechains?" To date, no one has been able to provide an answer to this question, as far as I can see.
There just aren't any advantages to a multiple-blockchain paradigm, and there are numerous advantages to a sidechain paradigm. It really sounds like the biggest issue here is that you're severely underestimating the power of sidechains.

Exactly right, and that's a critical insight!
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:21:18
There will most likely be one major blockchain, with many variant sidechains. That's the rational model which maximizes both cost-efficiency and interoperability, and over the long-term, markets tend to choose rational solutions.

There's really no advantage to having multiple disparate tokens, and everything that can be done on Ethereum could ultimately be done more efficiently with a sidechain. There are many, many solid and well-thought-out reasons for why sidechains are better to standalone chains.
I really struggle to see what benefits having two disparate blockchains could possibly provide. Could you explain exactly why you think two blockchains would be better than one blockchain with as many sidechains as are necessary to suit the use-cases that people come up with?

I think there are actually two communities at this point. The anti-SegWit crowd is entirely distinct from the rest of us, however unfortunate that might be.

Certainly. Multiple soft forks have achieved this; there is historical precedent for the 95% figure. In fact, it's fast becoming the de facto standard.

I don't believe this is accurate. What actually happened was:




In other words, what happened was a **soft-fork** didn't work as expected, and caused a chain fork. This prompted miners to consolidate by running the **pre-soft-fork** code. In other words, Bitcoin soft-forked and then un-soft-forked. It never hard-forked.

There have indeed been softforks with significant pushback in the past, yes.

No, this is simply a misappropriation of the word "hardfork". Just because consensus rules changed doesn't make a fork a hardfork. For instance, the 1MB limit's original introduction was a softfork, not a hardfork, even though it certainly affected the consensus rules of the network.


No, again, that isn't a hardfork. 


That's the *only* hardfork in this hypothetical, and that is the only thing in the entire hypothetical which puts users' funds at risk. That was the point I was trying to make in my previous comment. 
Without that rule-reversing hardfork, no funds would be at risk. So it is incorrect to say that the softfork (activating SegWit) incurs any such risk; it is the hardfork that you've postulated that incurs the risk.

@_date: 2017-05-12 17:48:18


There is a significant quantity of statistical evidence indicating that covert ASICBOOST is indeed being used on mainnet.
Furthermore, we know for a fact that Bitmain has expended capital and resources towards patenting the technique as well as designing and fabricating chips to support it (which, I suspect you are aware, would entail multimillion dollar expenditures); it seems fairly naive to believe that this expensive functionality would be idle "dead weight" in such a competitive market as Bitcoin mining.


Yes, I agree, that's what I am trying to say. Bitmain and its many subsidiaries are opposing the only production-ready proposal that would increase the blocksize past 1MB. It's a shame, too, considering the fact that the majority of the ecosystem and community is ready for the upgrade.
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:00:05
There are plenty of interesting aspects worth *at least* one discussion or conversation when it comes to Bitcoin. 
For instance, I find it rather mind-blowing that the creator(s) -- Satoshi Nakamoto -- is entirely pseudonymous, and basically disappeared altogether from the scene before their creation really started taking off. Satoshi even explicitly predicted Bitcoin's growth in a number of different quotes, and described with almost-eery correctness the "positive feedback loop" phenomenon that continues to drive Bitcoin adoption to this day, half-a-decade later. Can you name a *single* other multi-billion dollar industry or technology that was created out of the blue by a person or organization who remains unidentified? Can you think of any other examples where a single secretive creator suddenly brought a technology forth into the world which has grown into an almost-universally-recognized revolutionary and game-changing invention? The tale of the genesis of Bitcoin, alone, sounds like the plot of an over-the-top spy movie. 
Furthermore, it's really cool to me that at any time, Satoshi could step forward and prove, beyond a doubt, with unassailable cryptographic evidence, that they are the actual creator of Bitcoin. So it's effectively impossible for someone to "steal credit" for the idea!
Even people who don't care about the specifics of the technology and how it works "under the hood" can appreciate stuff like this; Satoshi is/was a remarkable entity, and is even being earnestly discussed as a candidate for a Nobel Prize in Economics, despite his/her/their true identity remaining unknown.
This is just one little example of something interesting and conversation-worthy when it comes to Bitcoin. There are plenty of other fascinating aspects which might be worth diving into instead, depending on your given audience and context. At the very least, Bitcoin opens the doors for conversations about the nature of money, value, and currency, and how these things are managed in modern society. This is a conversational rabbit hole with no discernible end; I've had many wonderful and enlightening conversations/debates with people who most certainly would *not* identify as "Bitcoiners" about these things, and I feel that talking about "heavy" subject matter like this can sometimes really animate and enliven a group of people that would otherwise be making inane small-talk at best.
I do agree that there is a tactless way to go about it, too... if someone is clearly not interested in talking about a particular topic, it's almost always best to drop it rather than ignore the signals they send. But with the 2013 bubble(s) so far in the rear-view mirror at this point, I've noticed that most pro-Bitcoin people don't really try to evangelize much these days, despite what those folks over at would have you believe! 
In any case, my point is that there are plenty of different cool routes a conversation could take, when it comes to Bitcoin. Open up your imagination!
@_date: 2015-11-27 10:05:28


Though that's a rather dismissive way to phrase the summary, yes, that's a fairly accurate description of the claim, in my opinion. However, with regards to your "growth has stalled for multiple years" claim, I've actually noticed data indicating the exact opposite. I think, visually speaking, the most staggering charts that demonstrate this are the [global LocalBitcoins volume charts]( but there is plenty of other supportive evidence indicating adoption growth, even including price, with the recent re-emergence of a bull-market in 2015.
Furthermore, at least in my opinion, it doesn't seem logical to expect Bitcoin adoption to proceed in a linear fashion, steadily growing each month, because one of the most compelling reasons to own bitcoins is as a speculative tool or investment, and people don't like to buy in during a post-bubble fallout. It's only after a bottom is reached, the market has stabilized, and a bull-run materializes again that the feedback loop really kicks into gear. This might sound like a chicken-and-egg problem on first glance, but empirical evidence actually indicates that it's not -- there have been many bubbles throughout Bitcoin's history, and in the interims between them, "growth in user numbers" has always seemed to be stalled, relatively speaking. But if you think about it, that makes perfect sense.


That's a valid point, and you're absolutely right - my initial statement on this matter was untrue. The general point still stands, but I phrased it far too strongly.


He/she was already [nominated]( by Bhagwan Chowdhry.


Are you trying to say that there is no way to have a discussion about nuanced societal issues without trying to "push your politics on others"? If that's your stance on the matter, unfortunately we may just have to agree to disagree on this one. Like I mentioned earlier, I've had plenty of stimulating and amicable conversations with people who fundamentally disagree with me on things like "the nature of money and its role in society" - if you're open-minded and willing to listen just as much as you're willing to speak, you can have great exchanges without ever trying to force your own beliefs or perspectives onto those around you. I'm sorry if you haven't yet had the pleasure of having such a conversation, but please don't rule out the possibility, because that might accidentally result in a negative self-fulfilling prophecy.


This actually highlights *another* reason why Bitcoin is such a fascinating topic of conversation: it's **not just a currency**! It's a protocol, network, technology, and model, and many other things, too. 
Surely you must understand the allure of the subject, considering you spend so much of your own time discussing it. I see that over 80% of your reddit comments are in and and that Bitcoin has (by far) the single highest word frequency in all of your posts. So I really don't understand why you seem so determined to argue that Bitcoin isn't an interesting subject to discuss, when you spend the bulk of your time online discussing it!
In any case, I'm really not here to try to argue that Satoshi is going to win the Nobel Prize, or that Bitcoin is being rapidly globally adopted, or anything like that, but rather that Bitcoin provides a foundation for plenty of interesting conversations and discussions. I think it's pretty disingenuous to pretend that the only possible way one of these conversations could possibly play out is "Bitcoin is interesting..." "ya I guess so" "Yeah like it's decentralised" "Yup..." "so.....why are you walking away?" and I just wanted to provide a quick example of another direction the conversation could conceivably take. The details (like whether Satoshi is actually going to get a Nobel Prize) are mostly irrelevant, since I was mainly speaking to the possibilities of discussion instead.

The part in bold is the dangerous part. That would represent a hard-fork, and *that* would be the fork that puts user funds at risk (as hard-forks are able to do).

Almost everyone agrees with you on this; the only problem is that since SegWit impedes covert ASICBOOST, Bitmain and their subsidiaries (like AntPool, BTC.TOP, ViaBTC, and CANOE) are opposing the only viable blocksize-increasing proposal on the table. 
It does look like there are ways forward despite their opposition, however, so that's good news. We just have to be patient as the solution(s) come to fruition!
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:51:58
I think you've hit the nail on the head here. If you *just* want SegWit, it still makes sense to support this proposal in the short term, at minimum to get the mining majority on your side (if at all possible) for its activation. 
It seems like a huge advantage of this Omnibus proposal is that it "throws a bone" to supporters of all camps.

It hasn't "failed" in the peer review process, it just hasn't garnered anything near widespread support. [Adam Back wrote some constructive criticism for it]( which is worth reading; there have been [minor comments]( made on the dev mailing list, but one of the biggest problems was that BIP100 was not actually actively developed (Jeff Garzik was working on other things, and no one else bothered to try and implement it) beyond the general gist and a rough-draft of the spec. It was set aside for years after SegWit (a superior proposal in a great number of ways) gained support, and it was only recently that BIP100 actually started getting attention again. You can check out the [history of the BIP itself]( to see what I mean. 
So, once again, it's not that BIP100 has "failed" the peer review process, it just hasn't *passed* it. In contrast, SegWit has.

Yes, it does, for those running the Omnibus Proposal code, just like any other hard fork proposal would require.
This proposal basically says "SegWit activating automatically locks in the hard fork activation (which happens 6 months later)"; I think it is a great proposal, personally.

That is the strategy that many (perhaps most) of us have decided is the wisest strategy of all.
However, as others have suggested, **do not invest more than you would be okay with losing, if worst came to worst**. If you can tolerate a loss of 100% of the funds you invest into Bitcoin (and still get by in life just fine), then you have done things correctly. This also helps to prevent you from becoming too emotional about the price (because holding for that long -- and sticking to your original strategy/plan -- is harder than it seems!).
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:42:16


That was already agreed to, years ago, with the Hong Kong Agreement. Unfortunately the miners did not honor the agreement (though all the Core developers involved *did*). 
It seems that the only reason the miners backed out of fulfilling their end of the bargain is to preserve the secret advantage afforded by covert ASICBOOST exploitation (which isn't a concern in Litecoin).
The quickest way to activate SegWit, in light of this fact, would be via a user-activated soft-fork (as Vertcoin did, successfully). However, this is a controversial proposal and there are concerns on both sides.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:02:27


It did (and does) within the development community, which is what my entire previous comment is referring to. I apologize, I thought that it would be obvious what sort of consensus I was referring to, considering what I wrote.


The process of **peer review** was defined centuries ago, actually.


No contributing developers voiced any disagreement with SegWit as a proposal whatsoever during the peer review process, actually. If you have evidence to the contrary, please provide it.

The top-tier builders are still working on Bitcoin. It's just that the work that they are doing is serious and complex, and not so soundbite-friendly as "Web 3.0" (which, ultimately, is just marketing gimmickery).
The blockchain ecosystem is still very immature, and we have been through *years* of "It's not Bitcoin, it's *the blockchain technology* that is revolutionary!" memes. It will take time for the world to realize the true value that a blockchain provides, and to come to terms with the fact that "a big VM that redundantly performs computations" isn't actually an economic use-case for one. In the meantime, many amateur developers and engineers will experiment with "easy" smart contract drafting, which will likely be very useful later on down the line when complex smart contracts start to play more of a meaningful role in society (though, of course, arbitrated with proper oracles and settled through Bitcoin). But it's important to keep in mind that this doesn't represent a "loss of builders", it represents "the temporary absence of participation from builders who aren't at the level of understanding necessary to actually contribute to the protocol itself" (which is the vast majority of them, of course).
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:52:10
I'm very interested to see where things go from here. The really cool thing about this COOP proposal is that it *combines* the SW+2MB idea with the UASF idea, taking advantage of the momentum of *both*. People who want a hard fork, people who want a user-activated fork, people who want SegWit, and people who want to honor the DCG Agreement all have good reasons to support the proposal (at the very least in the short term).
I really don't see any downsides to the COOP approach.

Thank you for your answer.
So, to be clear, the only drawback in implementing SegWit as a softfork is the fact that in a softforked version, non-upgraded nodes (which don't understand SW transactions) will not discard these transactions as invalid. 
To me, this seems like it is obviously a **desirable** quality; it removes the risk of a network split! If those same old nodes weren't upgraded and SegWit were implemented as a hard-fork, their chain would be orphaned (and if there were enough of them, there would be risk of a significant fork). 
The crux of the issue here (which a lot of people seem to be missing) is that **in a hardforked SegWit, non-upgrading nodes are significantly worse off than in a softforked version**.

Well... more than one, at least. For the sake of continued discussion, sure, four sounds fine.


The intermediaries would be no more "centralized" than Bitcoin miners themselves... important to keep this in mind.




No, it does not have issues with high-value transfers. It works equally well with all amounts of value.

No, that's not true. If you feel this way, please show me the specific math that you used to inform your opinion.


I understand these concepts fine. What I do not understand is what you are trying to communicate when you say things like "Lightning Network does not scale **users**" because that's a misuse in terminology, as far as I can tell. You haven't yet explained what you are trying to communicate with this phrase, or at least, I've never seen you do so.


Yes, they do.


It does not.


It does not.


I'm not sure what "simple fact" you are trying to refer to here. Again, I'm just trying to get you to clarify what you mean by "scale users" which doesn't, to the best of my knowledge, actually mean anything.


Now that I've responded to each component of your comment, perhaps you would be so kind as to elaborate on what you mean when you say "scale users"? Is it a phrase that you came up with?

Please read over the [Core Capacity Increases Roadmap]( to see what the scaling strategy is. A hard fork blocksize increase is untenable until *after* we have activated SegWit on the network and assessed what sort of effects it has had. 
The fastest path to a hard-fork is via activating SegWit. 
However, since SegWit neuters the covert ASICBOOST exploit, and a non-negligible subset of the mining community appears to want to preserve the efficacy of that exploit, we need to discuss the options available and come to a conclusion on how to proceed, with these facts in mind. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:26:12
Nothing at all, but node count doesn't trigger (or even affect) UASF in any way.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:31:20
A contentious hard fork to increase the blocksize is opposed by the majority of the community and ecosystem, though. The only blocksize-increase proposal that has widespread consensus among exchanges, wallet-providers, developers, and other community participants is SegWit; the only proposal that has undergone serious testing and peer review is SegWit; if covert ASICBOOST weren't possible, we would almost certainly have larger blocks, more on-chain capacity, and Lightning Network on Bitcoin by now.

In a fundamental sense, Ethereum is not useful in the same way that Bitcoin is. 
* Ether was not designed to be a monetary token, and is particularly ill-suited to that role. 
* The Ethereum blockchain is also much more prone to bloatability than Bitcoin, so any scaling issues that Bitcoin encounters would be significantly worse in Ethereum (the main reason why Ethereum isn't seeing such issues now is because it is relatively unused in relation to Bitcoin). 
* Ethereum is currently developed under a "benevolent dictator" which is not necessarily a bad thing *a priori*, but certainly runs counter to the ethos of decentralization. 
* The primary abstract benefits of the blockchain model are censorship resistance (which allows freer market expression) and long-term protocol standard enforcement (supported by the incentive structures in place); Ethereum in its current state fundamentally lacks both. 
* Bitcoin has a base foundation of demand with the darknet markets (and other frowned-upon industries like internet gambling) as the de facto currency; this provides price support and fuels the bootstrapping process. Ethereum lacks any such demand generators; right now, the demand for smart contract usage is negligible in relation to the darknet demand, and it is much more likely that a Bitcoin-powered smart contract engine will emerge (through sidechains or one of the many private initiatives already in place) before market demand for smart contracts really starts to meaningfully emerge. 
* Foundational tenets of the Ethereum model are still very much in flux (for instance, it's not clear whether it will be PoS or PoW in the long-term and critical inquiry into this matter ultimately leads to disappointment, in my experience). 
* Unlike in Bitcoin, where the blockchain is necessarily universal and public, the Ethereum blockchain is being forked by private enterprises and used as the blockchain-equivalent of "intranets", which will not and cannot translate to demand or value of the public ether token.
* Money is a technology which is particularly sensitive to the network effect. For a general article regarding this which may help to keep things in perspective, see [this.](
Personally, I'm very happy Ethereum exists and is helping the world to experiment with the blockchain model (and the limitations thereof). I just don't see it as an actual challenger to Bitcoin in any real sense, and as a primary long-term investor, ether seems (to me) to be an unattractive asset.

There have been [multiple]( actually. 


Note that there was no stipulation that anything would be recommended by "Core" (which isn't a person), and instead the stipulation is that **the Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable** would recommend a proposal to Bitcoin Core (which Luke-Jr did, less than 3 months after SegWit was released in v0.13.1). 


As both you and I have stated, yes, the miners broke it within days of signing the agreement. Whether they felt like it was "ratified" or not, they broke the Hong Kong Agreement that they signed and subsequently publicized. There is no way around this simple fact.

Reading it carefully, I see that it says "provided that is what we want" and "if that is what it takes to achieve the cooperation between community, industry, and developers in this critical moment of Bitcoin's history"... in other words, if consensus exists for any given hard-fork rule/change, it should be included. Seems almost like a truism.


[The proposal]( actually explicitly included Luke-Jr's specification:


Did you read the actual proposal? It was written to precisely fulfill the Consensus 2017 DCG Agreement (in the safest possible way).

[Luke-Jr seemed tentatively supportive]( at least. 
But it's not about "number of Core devs onboard", ultimately, because (from the [original proposal email](

Assuming that the "83% hashrate" is going to run hard fork code anyway, wouldn't the best option be for them to be compatible in the meantime?
According to my understanding, the distinguishing purpose of the COOP is to remain maximally compatible (with the existing SegWit deployment, BIP148, and segsignal) *prior to the hard fork*, while still satisfying the DCG/Silbert agreement. It seems preferable to abide by this proposal rather than an alternative, less-compatible one (where there is significant risk of fracture in the short term).
The hard fork itself may or may not be successful (a lot can change in 6 months, and there might even be a different miner landscape by then), but it would be best if everyone remained intercompatible until the attempt.
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:01:02
Fantastic comment. You made your point very well, I think.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:02:51


I agree, and definitely understand your argument, but if the parties of that agreement are determined to run code that behaves a certain way, and we have any say about it, *shouldn't we encourage them to be compatible with the UASF movement in the meantime*? 


Exactly! From this paragraph, it sounds like you should be in favor of the COOP, because it provides a means for the miners to run BIP148 without "losing face" (which, I'm given to understand, is an important aspect of Chinese culture). I understand that you oppose the included hard fork in the proposal (and that is definitely your right!) and it's important to remember that neither you nor anyone else has an obligation to run hard fork compliant code. However, *assuming that a majority of miners are going to run such code anyway*, wouldn't you prefer for them to be compliant with the UASF (and existing SegWit deployment) come August 1?
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:52:48

@_date: 2016-05-05 20:55:22
Thanks for that. I suspected the "leaks" you were referring to were [these]( and it looks like that is correct. Personally, I don't think this qualifies as "unwanted attention" because of the following observation (from the article):


It's pretty clear that Wright went out of his way to get attention on this (first by retroactively editing his own blog to add in the Bitcoin/Satoshi references, and then later by teleconferencing and presenting at the Bitcoin Investor’s Conference in Las Vegas). I don't see how this could be fairly called "unwanted attention" in light of those facts.
In any case, I appreciate your responses!

The Hong Kong Agreement (which is available [here]( was basically a meeting where some mining pool operators and some Core developers/contributors got together and tried to work out an agreeable plan to work towards activating SegWit and increasing the blocksize.
The miners agreed not to run consensus-incompatible software while SegWit was being developed (like Bitcoin Classic), and the Core developers present agreed to get SegWit out the door as soon as possible, and after it was released, to propose a hard-fork blocksize increase for consideration by the community (and other developers).
Unfortunately, just a few days after the agreement was signed, the mining pools directly violated the agreement, signaling Bitcoin Classic in their blocks. Despite this, the Core developers honored their side of the agreement, shipping SegWit in Core v0.13.1 and drafting up a few hard-fork proposals in the months after SegWit was released. None of these proposals received significant support (neither in the developer community nor the wider community), and because the miners had violated the agreement almost immediately after signing it, it is mostly forgotten by now (except every now and then, someone brings it up wistfully).
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:06:00


This statement doesn't really make sense. The phrase "scale users" doesn't actually mean anything; blockchains do not process "users", they process transactions. Scaling is just processing more transactions.

None of the BU developers are Bitcoin developers, though (and it's pretty obvious from their code quality; no offense intended to any working on BU). That's pretty much the point I'm making.

Ultimately the "UAHF" simply represents the launch of another pre-mined altcoin, of which there are many thousands at this point.
Also, from my understanding of the matter, it would take very little relative hashrate on the BIP-148 chain to sustain (and actually give a considerable economic advantage to) the chain. I believe 15-20% hashrate is more than sufficient. And this is all before we consider the very real possibility of a minority chain implementing a proof of work algorithm change.

The original proposal is [here]( if you're interested. 


Basically, the COOP seems to be, in a nutshell: **satisfy the agreement compatibly.** It would also have the benefit of: "the code to do most of everything we want to do is already written and reviewed and tested", which speeds things along on the tight timeline. So far, no other BIPs have been proposed regarding the agreement.


It seems like you may have a pretty severe misunderstanding of the motivation and rationale behind the UASF idea. The end-goal of a UASF like BIP148 is to achieve *100% hashrate support*, because miners who try to mine the non-compliant chain would be mining worthless coins, and would quickly stop mining them, one way or another.
The COOP basically gives the miners a reason to move over to UASF-compliant code (because they get everything else they want/demand, anyway).

Core cannot "block" something that never had consensus in the first place.
In order for the maximum base blocksize to be raised, there needs to be a proposal that people agree on, so that it can be coded, reviewed, tested, released, and activated. No one has come up with such a proposal.
A proposal that some people *did* manage to come up with that survived the entire process (and has widespread agreement) is SegWit. That's the only viable proposal on the table right now.
You might not think SegWit is the perfect solution, and perhaps you would prefer something else... but as of right now, SegWit is the *only* viable blocksize-increase solution that has been proposed, reviewed, coded, tested, and released. Nothing else has been "blocked" because nothing else has even attempted to go through the peer review process.

I am not calling it "base size", I am calling it what it is actually described in the BIP as: **block cost**. Furthermore, it hasn't been changed from 1000000 to 2000000, it has been changed from 1000000 to 4000000. I can show you this with **one line of text**, the code itself:
[static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_COST = 4000000;](
You can also review [the specific commit where this was all changed]( if you're feeling particularly skeptical.

I suppose you're right, on second thought. I was mentally qualifying "flexibility" with "safe flexibility" but in all fairness, that falls under the "insularity" category, so it's not really fair to say there are flexibility gains there.


Well, this model simply means that the parties interested in the storage are the ones who are responsible for it. Ethereum hopes to be able to offer efficient blockchain sharding, which is, in effect, attempting to solve the same problem, but it is fundamentally less economical to have data stored redundantly by thousands and thousands of parties to whom that data is not relevant, and this cost will have to be borne somehow or another. The public-blockchain-as-computation-engine model will be intrinsically more expensive to execute code on than an external, more-localized execution engine would be. 


Computations and their results *are* data. They can be verified at the edges, and the relevant verification proofs can be provided or checked by the entities who care about them.


Interesting that you say that. I think a solid argument could be made that, in light of the DAO episode and the ensuing Ethereum hardfork that is underway, the Ethereum Foundation itself is a trusted counterparty in their model. We have seen that contract execution on the Ethereum blockchain really *isn't* trustless or immutable; it appears that precedent is being set wherein the Foundation has to, at minimum, implicitly approve of the results of a particular smart-contract's execution in order for it to finalize.


The argument is, to crudely summarize, the lowest layer of a blockchain is ill-suited to be the same layer of the stack which executes or tracks the state-changes of arbitrary computations. The intrinsic costs (and risks) of doing so effectively preclude any potential long-term economic viability of the model, when there are cheaper, safer, and more rational ways to reap the same benefits by using a properly-thought-out stack-based architecture where the blockchain itself is not the sole engine.
In a nutshell, Ethereum seems to have tried to cram too much logic into the base layer of a blockchain, and there's no good reasons to do so (and plenty of reasons not to).

Your credit card and debit card purchases actually take *months* to finalize. Even in the worst case scenarios, Bitcoin transaction finalization is cheaper and quicker than such fiat alternatives. The only difference is that in the case of credit/debit card purchases, the risk of chargeback is accepted and factored in along the way.
Bitcoin will have similar entities willing to shoulder the chargeback (or doublespend) risks in different ways (arguably Bitpay and Coinbase already do, to a degree), but it is a young industry and will take time to mature.
Right now, microtransactions are not the best use case of Bitcoin. Users will have to come to terms with this. The solutions that enable microtransaction viability are already coded and waiting, but have not been activated on the main network yet for complex reasons (misaligned/perverse incentives stemming from ASICBOOST exploits, and politics). 
Patience is an investor's best friend.

[My point]( has nothing to do with the subreddit and the moderation policies thereof. There are [fundamental issues]( with Ethereum's design, even if we ignore its obvious lack of immutability, censorship-resistance, and developer competence (as evidenced by the DAO incident). Post-DAO, you would be *very* hard-pressed to elucidate an iota of value-add-proposition that Ethereum truthfully represents over alternative smart-contract platform implementations.
Ethereum, sadly enough, appears to be no more than a very successful pump-and-dump. Fortunately, there *is* a silver lining, in that we can observe and learn from the many mistakes that have gone into it.

SegWit increases the blocksize limit. It can now be up to 3.6MB in size. The "actual limit" is now a "block cost" rather than a "block size", which works out to a practical maximum of 3.6MB per block.
That's why I was providing actual source code and BIP implementation details; it's a common misunderstanding that SegWit leaves the 1MB limit in place - **it does not**.
I hope that helps clarify matters.

Again, there will be no "2mb hard fork blocksize increase" because that is a contradiction in terms. If you hard forked the blocksize to 2MB after SegWit was released, it would be a blocksize **decrease**.
There may be a hard forked blocksize increase down the road, but it would not be to 2MB, because once again, that would be a **decrease** from the SegWit max blocksize.

It is fundamentally impossible to guarantee equal-ish wealth distribution in a competitive and capitalistic society.
This is not a problem that Bitcoin uniquely suffers from. It is a problem in *any* form of wealth. Bitcoin is no worse than the dollar in this regard, and because the rules of Bitcoin creation are so strictly defined, in the long term, it is actually *better* than uncapped alternatives (like the dollar or any other form of fiat money).

"Marginal" is an economic term, and it basically means "change at the edges". For instance, the definition of [marginal revenue]( is "the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by one unit".

You seem to be making the assumption that "adding a blockchain to it" will be a long-term solution to a wide array of problems, but I would argue that this is a bit far-fetched.
The blockchain is a data-structure, very carefully designed to solve the digital cash/gold problem, and optimized for that in particular. It appears to offer value to the world, at least when used in this capacity. There is a lot of energetic research and developments into the application of a blockchain to other areas than digital cash, but to date, no other "usage models" have actually panned out and seemed to offer real value. Maybe that will change in the coming months (as the results emerge from the recent torrent of crowdfunding seen in the space), but so far, the actual deliveries of most alternative-blockchain-usage projects have been disappointing, to put it mildly. It's not at all clear that blockchains are generally useful outside of e-cash use-models. 
For what it is worth, Satoshi seemed to prioritize keeping Bitcoin isolated from "general purpose data" (anything not directly related to the transfer e-cash) at pretty much all costs. He [advocated merge-mining]( any experimental (non-cash-oriented) networks, allowing the Bitcoin chain to be used exclusively for transactions.

Again, my point has nothing to do with the moderation policy on My arguments are based on the facts of the matter, not the prevailing narrative of a particular community. 
I base my analysis off of source material (e.g. the Ethereum/DAO whitepapers, the Ethereum blog, etc) and my own logical breakdowns, not the upvotes or downvotes of reddit comments. 
The reason that I do this is actually showcased rather well in this specific instance. Right now, in this very reddit discussion, you are trying to change the subject to something completely unrelated to my arguments (the moderation policies of individual discussion communities in the space), rather than actually addressing the arguments themselves. 
Now, that does not mean that there is absolutely *zero* value in discussions and arguments (and it does not mean that the media they take place through has no influence on the trajectory of those discussions). Overwhelmingly, though, in my experience no one has managed to present a cogent argument in favor of Ethereum's design or long-term viability as a protocol; this holds true in Ethereum blog posts, etc. I have seen plenty of well-expounded arguments with the thesis that Ethereum is, to put it bluntly, a shitshow, and never once have I seen the opposite case be made anywhere near as strongly.

Don't worry, that's exactly *this* step. Blocks (on the testnet) are now able to be larger than 2MB, because the old hard-coded 1MB limit was replaced by SegWit code. Soon the same will be true on the mainnet.

Actually, both had 100% successful UASF activation deployments, because *the entire point of a BIP148-style UASF is to put a user-enforced deadline on the MASF*. The fact that both Vertcoin and Litecoin had miners activate SegWit before the UASF deadline means that the UASF was totally successful and went exactly according to plan.
Right now, it looks like the BIP148 UASF is achieving *the exact same thing* for Bitcoin.
So far, it really looks like UASFs are impressively effective at achieving fork activations (at least for upgrades with as much consensus and widespread demand as SegWit).

Bitcoin development is moving shockingly fast, but it's very difficult to appreciate all the monumental achievements that are being achieved unless you have a deep understanding of the engineering of the system.
libsecp256k1, CSV, CPFP, versionbits, Segregated Witness, Schnorr signatures, RBF, new-and-improved relay networks, Lightning Network routing channels and alpha implementations, other types of payment channels, sidechains (even if the best available options are federated at the moment), confidential transactions, key tree signatures, headers-first synching, improvements in mempool and pruning configuration options, etc
Most of the above listed tech and development represents absolutely beautiful engineering and growth. Again, it will be very difficult for non-developers to understand and appreciate these sorts of things, but Bitcoin development these days is the opposite of slow. I don't think any other developments teams in the crypto space even come *close* to the level and quality of output that Core is continually producing.
What your perspective is indicative of is **a lack of PR** about Bitcoin developments. Other teams are a lot "louder" (they almost *have* to be, because they're fundamentally trying to compete with Bitcoin), but Bitcoin development really is on a different level. For one final repetition, though: it's going to be difficult for you and other non-experts to gauge this unless you go out of your way to understand the contributions being made.

Did you read the comment by Gregory Maxwell that explains why I said that? It's not because Ethereum is a "threat" to Bitcoin, it's because the EVM is a silly idea to begin with. There are better ways to achieve anything that Ethereum purports to achieve.
Turing complete blockchains, for better or for worse, will certainly exist in the future. But that doesn't, in any way, refute the architectural misstep that Ethereum exhibits.

So the article mentions:


And displays [this graph](
If the entire Neural Network prediction was made on Day 1 of trading, then the fit of prediction-to-price-curve is remarkably impressive, and this software should be incredibly lucrative for the developers. However, if (more likely) the prediction was updated on an ongoing basis, then the graph isn't particularly impressive... as a simple example, I can make a program that takes one input (current price) and makes a prediction of the price one minute from now by adding or subtracting $0.10 arbitrarily, and the graph generated from this model will be an almost-perfect-fit to the actual Bitcoin price over the relevant interval. 
That wouldn't be impressive, though, for obvious reasons.
The fact that no concrete details were included regarding how the prediction was made (and how often it was updated over the interval) indicates, to me, that it is probably much more like my example above than it is "one atomic prediction made on Day 1".

And do you appreciate the crux of the argument? Namely, that the only part of the computation process that makes economic or pragmatic sense to involve a blockchain on is the *verification* portion of a given contract, and that computation executed on the edges (rather than in the center) allows for far more flexibility, scalability, and insularity than the other way around?
If you are trying to solve a given problem, and would like to reap the benefits of a blockchain in your solution, it makes more sense to incorporate the blockchain as a *layer* in your stack rather than *the entire stack itself*, because blockchains, with their necessary openness and redundancy, incur real costs. 
This is a crucial point, and it's important to understand it if you're at all interested in the frontier of smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:04:54


It is worth taking some time to understand BIP-141. The malleability fix is a result of a vastly-improved transaction serialization standard. This standard also allows a soft-fork blocksize increase via witness-weighting. 
Initially, the SegWit implementation did *not* include the witness-weighting (which means it would qualify as your "separate BIP"). However, because Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and their followers began to demand a blocksize increase a couple of years ago, the witness-weighting was added (forming BIP-141), as a compromise. It was a blocksize increase developed to carefully prevent the risks of a (potentially catastrophic) network split/fork.

@_date: 2016-07-03 19:23:42
Ah, I see why you're confused. Here, first try reading the [SegWit BIP]( where it explains that the old "block size" is replaced with a "block cost" instead.
They didn't "fiddle with a different constant", they introduced a new method of size-calculation altogether which replaces the old one. 
Hopefully that clears up any points of confusion for you, so you can see that each of the following statements are strictly true:


You can verify this by referencing the OP.


You can verify this with the links I have provided above (the SegWit consensus.h file, and the BIP141 link).


This is true because it has already been merged into the "master" branch of Bitcoin core. Now we are just waiting for the next release.
Now I think it should be clear that your initial comment (which read: "Not true") is factually incorrect. In fact, if you wouldn't mind, I would appreciate if you would go back and edit the comment to reflect this (that way you don't accidentally mislead anyone who happens upon this thread).

As are "marginal cost", "marginal profit", "marginal supply", "marginal production", etc. 


Try breaking it down. Since "marginal" means "at the edge or margin" and "supply" means "available/extant units", it should be pretty obvious that "marginal supply" means "the supply produced on the margins", or, in other words, the *change in supply over a particular interval*.
In the context of Bitcoin, "marginal supply" can be thought of as equivalent to "rate of inflation".
Let me know if you have any more questions.

It sounds like you may be confused about what the phrase "user-activated soft-fork" actually means. It does not include any connotation of "zero miner participation" and in fact a majority-supported user-activated soft-fork is expected to consistently result in **100%** miner participation in the fork.
Most of the upgrades that Satoshi coded for the network in the early days were user-activated soft-forks, in fact. See [Shaolin Fry's original email]( for a coherent explanation of what the phrase refers to.
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:58:33
I have indeed spent a considerable amount of time in this subreddit (as you should be able to tell from my comment history). If SegWit activates prior to August 1, then that will indeed represent a "glorious victory" for the BIP-148 UASF, because that would represent the achievement of the sole objective of the proposal.
Again, I really do recommend that you try to learn more about what defines a user activated soft fork. Like I said, all of the soft forks Satoshi implemented were done this way. 
The BIP-9 signaling method (the MASF option) was a relatively recent deployment development, and was only intended to *accelerate* the soft fork activation process. It has quickly become clear that BIP-9 may not be ideal for deployment purposes, because of how politicized it can evidently become, so most upgrades moving forward will likely take this into account.

You've misunderstood the advocates of UASFs here.

In other words, you're basically assuming failure *and* success in your hypothetical, which of course is going to lead you to absurd conclusions. No one is making the claims that you believe they are making, and it appears that you have confused the claims that *are* being made rather dramatically.

In the interest of full disclosure, I think this should be qualified:
**As a libertarian who is running a business with revenues entirely dependent upon collecting fees from consumers who are switching between Bitcoin and altcoins (Shapeshift), you support both.**
Naturally you are going to argue that altcoins and Bitcoin should and will meaningfully coexist; your business model requires it. Now, I'm not saying that this discounts your argument(s), which should be addressed on their own merits, but it's still an important disclaimer in situations like this one.


It's important to understand that money, as a technology, is highly, highly dependent on the Network Effect; it is, fundamentally, a network technology. The more people that use a particular monetary platform, the more useful and attractive that monetary platform is to potential *other* users, so there is an inherent feedback loop which should, unless somehow interrupted, entrench any apex protocol which achieves "critical mass" in a global sense. There have been many, many solid arguments for long-term Bitcoin maximalism. Please revisit these resources briefly, if you have a moment:
[Bitcoin - a 6-sided Market and Network Effect](
[One Chain to Rule Them All](
[Bitcoin Maximalism](
[Why you should be a Bitcoin Maximalist](
[The Problem with Altcoins](
The closest anyone has come to a rebuttal was a completely [flat argument]( which can be summarized with this paragraph:


In case it's not clear, the conclusion above is borne of willfull naivety. It ignores the possibility of sufficiently-complex sidechain stake-unlock schemas which can completely invalidate the argument's fundamental premise. 
While I'm on the subject, I **highly** recommend re-reading [the sidechains whitepaper]( for anyone who has 30-45 minutes to spare. I remember reading the paper around the time it initially came out, but for some reason, after re-visiting the whitepaper many months after my initial read-through of it, I was able to appreciate the magnitude of the technology's potential, and it really did seem to indicate that independent public blockchains that ostensibly solve problems in ways that Bitcoin does not (a la Ethereum or Monero) really do not offer a competitive advantage over sidechain implementations of the same solutions. The fact that these altcoins are necessarily open-source in terms of codebase allows their exact software to be co-opted by the larger (and more liquid) Bitcoin chain at will, meaning that as monetary platforms, such blockchains don't really make long-term sense. It's important to take some time to appreciate exactly how much impact the advent of two-way-peggable sidechains will have to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Beyond this, there are a lot of reasons why [Ethereum, specifically, is incredibly architecturally misguided]( and ultimately it *is* a premined crowdsale executed by a private corporation which seems to have pivoted multiple times from its original vision for the sake of short-term PR, so even if you're *not* a Bitcoin maximalist, there are plenty of reasons to be wary or even outright hostile towards Ethereum pumpers. And on the subject of Ethereum pumpers, do remember that the recent ETH bubble was pumped by persistent, malicious private-message spamming of posters... in short, the community itself seems much more "get rich quick"-oriented than Bitcoin is, and it seems to many of us that their recklessness and ignorance is just going to cost many otherwise-innocent people a lot of time, money, and human capital that could have otherwise gone towards making this world a better place.


While we do see plenty of "cheerleaders" for any given cause, I don't think it's really fair to dismiss the careful, thoughtful arguments of Bitcoin maximalists like the ones I have linked above. There are good reasons to expect Bitcoin to achieve and maintain a massive monopoly in the realm of cryptocurrency over the long-term, and writing them off without taking the time to consider them carefully is the wrong thing to do.

I don't think you understand: there will be no "2MB hard fork" because the block size limit has been changed already by SegWit. If we were to hard-fork to 2MB blocks, it would be a size **decrease**.
