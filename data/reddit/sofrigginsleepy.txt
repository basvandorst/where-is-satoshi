Coinbase is easy to use but it's easy to get scammed on there.

No don't keep in GDAX and/or Coinbase. They might take your money! Get a wallet!

Well, to be honest with you, Coinbase has been having lots of problems when it comes to releasing bitcoins (it takes forever in some cases) and this was happening to me before (which is why I decided to leave). Right now, I think there are even MORE and LONGER cases and I've seen a lot of people complaining about it. I moved over to Paxful and I don't have anything to complain about so far. Check it out if you're open to trying something new lol.

Lol fuck coinbase.

It kinda makes you think about the impact that these big companies have. It also makes me wonder what the other big btc platforms are doing..

Power to the people!!!! lol! But true though, LBC does suck now.
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:54:04
Well there's Localbitcoins but I really wouldn't recommend them. It's hard to know which examples to give you if we don't know what your purpose is.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:21:15
Since when was Coinbase ever NOT a scam lol
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:31:39
It's chill. Localbitcoins sucked anyway lol
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:39:42
But... but... but.... Coinbase sucks. :( 
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:24:57
Doesn't change the fact that Coinbase sucks lol
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:19:46
Same dude. EVERYONE STAY AWAY.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:00:24
I don't think that it does. Plus, LBC is losing all of its charm with its recent KYC implementation.

I've been using Paxful for a while now and it's quite good. I'm satisfied with their services.
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:22:38
It's actually quite good but their customer service has a lot of problems. I've also gone through bullshit waiting periods. It's always quite good until the shit storm comes, and once you're in it, you're in it forever.
@_date: 2018-06-04 04:22:28
Coinbase sucks. Get out before they freeze all your money.
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:19:06
I generally try to stay away from Coinbase. I've gone through a lot of bullshit with them before and I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I went through.
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:20:15
You're probably safe from a hacker, but you're probably not safe from the bullshit that Coinbase pulls off lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:20:28
I'm genuinely happy that you're not experiencing any problems. But there are instances wherein people would have to wait a couple of months just to get in touch with the support or get their money.
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:04:06
Sad to hear that you lost the dispute! The Paxful customer service usually pulls through, but I guess it was just a little too late this time for you.
@_date: 2018-04-16 08:57:40
Contact customer service! Paxful's got one of the best in the game, I'm sure they'll help you in no time!
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:04:02
It's really the simplest solution after what's happening with LBC: just use Paxful.com
