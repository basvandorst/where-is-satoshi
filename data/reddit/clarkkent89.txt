Huge growth of new users, still turbulent market in China, people are worried about what Trump will do when he sets foot in office, differemt funds are starting to get interested in btc, SEC might accept ETF in March. Dont get surprised if btc is 2500 in a few months from now....

Do some Google trend searches, bitcoin is growing. Yes it fell 25℅, but thats after an insane growth in both the ecosystem and the prize. Look at the stock market and see that small pullbacks are natural with every stock that is making gains. Bitcoin has grown a ton and there is no indications that it wont continue to grow and mature.

Ok, so the chinese government is trying to mitigate the risk of people converting yuan to usd on a larger scale if yaun keep being volatile. Anyone who knows if this is related to btc, is btc even seen as a currency in China?

Look at how much the bitcoin community has grown since the start of last year. No indications that 2017 wont be a great year

Crash?! Come on... Still up a lot last month and Still not far away from ath

Not happy with the gain in prize ecosystem and popularity the last year? Take a look at the bigger picture and youll see that a small pullback is natural with everything that increases its value quickly, just as with stocks. Ecosystem has grown, popularity has grown, prices are still up if you don't just look at the last couple of days. No indications that we wont see a continued upward trend in 2017 but if a small dip makes you this negative bitcoin might not be for you.

Sure the video is great but that title is annoying. How can this be a plunge? Just a small pullback after huge gains, thats natural with everything that is gaining popularity quickly. Still up the last month and still close to ath and still insane growth in ecosystem and popularity.
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:57:26
Still pretty close to ath actually :)

Like all stocks in growth mode do? Small corrections after months of growth is pretty natural...

If youve entered that early you should recognize what growth looks like. Traders might make btc a bit more volatile but they are also bringing in lots of new money that make btc seem more interesting for the masses. More traders now, but more importantly a lot more people in general along with a growing ecosystem. In general its always possible to think of all the negative aspwcts of something being this new, but isnt more productive to think of the positives, especially when being in this stage of amazing growth?

Not exploding but have a look at google trends. Its getting a lot more popular to say the least
