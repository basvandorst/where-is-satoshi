Blockchain does not need bitcoin at all. It just needs processing power that scales with use.  Everyone using block chain could do their own hashing. If block chain provides as good of benefits as bitcoin users think it does this should be more than sufficient.  Bitcoin is absolutely a bubble.  It’s valued so much higher than the value it provides to society through its use. It’s just a speculative get rich quick gimmick.  Your post is evident of this attitude. It’s just like All the people who thought they were going to get rich off of beanie babies.

People that don’t think it’s a bubble don’t understand bubbles...or investing for that matter.

And now people will cash in and it will drop a bit. It’s crazy volatile. And the volatility is going to get worse. After the price goes up, people are more likely to hop out fast during a correction to stop the loss. Bit coin will continue up for a while, but it’s setting up for a historic, record breaking crash.  Volatility bitcoin’s ultimate weakness and demise. Bitcoin may have the headlines, but Ripple may have a future, if crypto sticks around that is. Historically big bubble.

Nope, but I did go to a good business school and did grad school in technology. I learned a few things. This is a classic bubble. The price goes up without there being any additional value added to the product. It’s not creating value like a  company does when they manufacture something or provide a service. Hell the product is only used by criminals for normal transactions.  It could be banned at any point.  Governments likely will ban it because it takes control away from its leaders.  But go ahead, keep holding that bag.

I’ve been making plenty of money with s&amp;p 500 and stocks related to Gene therapies.  What irritates me is seeing friends and family “invest“ in bitcoin when it’s doomed to fail.  It’s pretend money that’s not accepted many places at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:14:07
Wow, déjà vu from the .com bubble. Everybody was saying how far the NASDAQ was going to go up.  A lot of people committed suicide after that crash. I wonder if it will be the same this time.

Block chain doesn’t back crypto currency, like you say it’s a ledger. That’s it.  I have an accountant that keeps a ledger for me, that doesn’t mean I’m any more likely to pay my mortgage than the next guy.
Let’s say I want to buy my groceries with bitcoin. At this point where I live this is impossible. So it could be argued that bit coin is not worth the price of the groceries. Now let’s take a US $100 bill. Not only will be accepted at my local grocery store, but it would be accepted by people even outside the United States. This is because the cash has a track record of value, and a stable one at that, backed by stable nation.  Bitcoin does not have this.

Exactly, in stocks they are called “bag holders”.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:00:40
Or never...no guarantees. It’s a bubble after all.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:38:42
It’s a bubble that is about to burst. It’s just seen as a get rich quick scheme.  Like you say it’s not being adopted as a currency. When the bubble bursts and enough wealthy powerful people lose millions, we will see laws against crypto currency just out of spite from the rich folks .  Seriously folks invest in on S&amp;P 500 index fund like VFIAX Not crypto. Listen to warren Buffett.  Seriously, bit coin is higher now what about one month or year from now. Are you really that confident and its future 50 years from now?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:57:40
No, it’s not even good for paying bills.  It’s beanie babies all over again...but beanie babies had at least some intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:53:19
It’s not a stock. Stocks are in companies that do something that creates real value. Bitcoin is a currency for criminals and speculators. There is a reason that you can’t use it to pay your electric bill or rent.   It’s the definition of a bubble. Seriously though if I had any bitcoin I would get out now.  It reminds me of eToys.com, During the.com bubble their stock went from about $87 a share to being ‘worthless’ within a 16 month period.  There are countless other stories like that. People thought they were going to make so much money and that it could never go down. Lots of people lost everything. Crypto currency is the same only the details of changed. No way I’m hopping in now.

Well, it would be better than taking the hit on the inevitable crypto crash. But, I recommend investing in the S&amp;P 500 index funds. Slow and steady growth over a long period of time will win out over booms and busts.

Nope, I have a bachelors degree in business from a good school, and a masters degree in computer security from another good school. I’ve run hashing algorithms on paper and calculated them by hand (huge pain in the ass lots of modulus operators).  I have been following crypto for a long time. It is just a new twist on the classic bubble.  The news media has made the bubble worse and likely doomed crypto as a currency. Only criminals use it for transactions (It’s a money laundering tool for them.)  When The bubble bursts no one will want to use crypto ever again. It grew too fast for its own good which will eventually kill it.

You could swap the Word “bit coin“ with “beanie babies“ and it would show the sentiment during the beanie baby craze in the 90s
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:46:57
Wow a lot of people are going to loose a lot of money. It’s beanie babies or the dot com bubble all over again.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:28:36
...beanie babies and pets.com never regained their value, just sayin
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:22:50
You haven’t made any money unless you’ve cashed out. It’s not like you can buy a house with crypto. How the last few days been for you? People are saying to cash out and other people are gonna be left holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:00:23
The ones that can pass laws and have people with guns enforce them. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:40:05
And that is why it could be banned. It would help hamper crime and wouldn’t have that big of an impact on daily life or the broader economy.
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:09:09
He needs others to Hodl so he can get more when he sells.  Seriously folks cash out don’t get left holding a bag of nothing 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:23:28
I wouldn’t exactly call it trusted. Today I heard an interview with a financial advisor that deals with bitcoin. He recommended to only invest money in bitcoin that you are willing to lose 100% of.  There’s a big difference between the Internet and bitcoin. The Internet provides an intrinsic value. Blockchain is copyable, The technology has value, the currency “backed” by it does not.   Seriously, if it’s your retirement money I would cash out now. People who got out at the right time did all right with the past few bubbles. I don’t think It will be any different with this one.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:20:15
I was just showing an example of a bubble. I just as easily could have used beanie babies, or tulips as an example.

Unless ANY governments ban it to fight child porn, money laundering, drug trade, funding terror groups etc.....  oh and then there is the fact that few people are using it for more than a get rich quick scheme.   Eventually a mas exodus will start and someone will be left holding the bag. 
It’s a classic bubble by definition. The price goes up even though the value generated for society remains the same.
