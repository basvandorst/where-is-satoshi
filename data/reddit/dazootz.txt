I'm a CPA AND I support bitcoin.  best of both worlds.

Hi Clark!  I ran into you during the last bitcoin conference.

It really doesn't matter whether the federal reserve is private or public, because it couldn't exist and operate without the government.  Private Prisons are private, but they wouldn't exist without the government.  It isn't the private aspect of the federal reserve we should be worried about, it is the public aspect.

Well I am just speculating of course, but many of the bigger companies are transparent about their policies regarding their acceptance of bitcoins
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:27:13
I figured it was known.  That is why I asked.  I don't claim to be some genius bitcoin philosopher.  
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:29:30
I agree that it is positive.  I just haven't heard people address this factor when discussing the current downtrend in price
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:34:03
actually it does.  Ever heard of Silicon Valley? There are more bitcoiners looking up the price in California than there are in New York.
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:30:41
Eh and I am sure it will be discussed 500 more times.

Also, if it does get this rep, it won't necessarily come from people who recieved the tip, but from all the people who did not receive it.  It is harder to invest in something that you see being thrown around for free randomly.

cool the mafia is going to provide us some "protection"

Ya know, this whole google search thing is really misleading.  A lot of people type bitcoin into google just so they can get the price.  This doesn't necessarily mean that more people are interested in bitcoin.

I just hope people don't associate bitcoin with "that thing everyone is trying to give away, because its worthless"

I ordered some of this back in October of 2013.  still haven't received any. cool beans.
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:46:34
good.  they are the proper custodians.
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:42:31
that is a picture with a long of good things happening.

is this better or worse that betcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:33:48
I've got a 30day CD right now and it seems to be working pretty well.  I wish that I would have just left it as a normal deposit though so I had the freedom to move my coin around If I needed to.  It seems to be doing as advertised though.

Not sure if coinbased double charged or I clicked on the buy button twice, but trying to work with coinbase and shirtoshi on getting a refund.  No updates yet, but this should be a good experiment one way or the other.
@_date: 2013-08-16 15:15:59
I bet you could show this to people who hate fox news to be more interested in bitcoin.
I also would guess that a lot of people hate fox news.
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:32:15
Verified! Thank you !  Shirtoshi was able to respond to this customer service issue within a few hours.  Well done.

First of all, you can purchase any amount of btc you want so it doesn't matter how much money you have.  You can purchase 5 dollars worth of bitcoin if you want. 
When I was learning about bitcoin I started with a 10 dollar purchase and got .1 btc.  This was about 2 months ago.
Capitalism is all about saving up capital and making sound investments.  You will be rewarded for putting your money in the correct places.  If you have no investment money, then you should start saving in order to get some.  
I was able to save up 400 dollars to invest and I was able to buy 6 bitcoins.  I then invested my bitcoins into asic.miner and now I have 12 bitcoins.  These 12 coins are worth ~ 1400 dollars.  That is a lot of money for a starving graduate student like myself that has a total monthly rent cost of 250 dollars a month.

I actually convinced my boss to invest into bitcoin and he bought at 260.  Work wasn't very pleasant the rest of that week, but since then I was able to get back most of his money through asic-miner shares..  He is still down about 10%, but I'm confident that he will be in the black this time next year.  (His original investment was 5,000 usd)

"AI controls our government and entire economy, completely eliminating human greed from economics."
That was the most naive/delusional part.

I am a bitcoin noob and have no bitcoins, but why would anyone ever spend their bitcoins?  It seems like the currency is destined for deflation at which point you can make money by holding on to them.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:51:52
I like how they tell us the dollar to bitcoin exchange rate in the article as if this is relevant information.  wow you can really tell how much they hate bitcoin.

I am having the exact same problem.  All of the people I got into bitcoin when it was about 100 dollars ended up getting their coins stolen by coinlenders.com.  They blame bitcoin and not the theives.  I am considered wrong about bitcoin even though their investments went up by 10x.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:15:55
My adventure into bitcoin started by attending a liberty conference.  a lot of people made fun of me for doing something so weird, but that simple little trip has made me 1,500 dollars so far!  I also met someone that explained what asic.miner shares were so I had quite a bit of help, but I wouldn't have attended the liberty conference if I hadn't already taught myself a bunch of stuff.
@_date: 2013-07-22 19:03:14
What I mean by normal deposit is that the money is transferred into your coinlenders account.  It will automatically earn interest without you needing to do anything.
