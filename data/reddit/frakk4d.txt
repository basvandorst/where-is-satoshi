For some of us it's still a bit of a novelty to use this internet currency. Especially in physical, brick-and-mortar locations. It was also to let other bitcoiners in the UK or who might be visiting London know that this is somewhere cool they can go that accepts their coin. It wasn't just meant to be "look what I bought!".

The whole idea behind their multi sig wallets is that no one would be able to spend/run with the coins without the approval of any two out of:
-Neo themselves
-the customer
-a trusted 3rd party auditor/lawyer.
So even in a bankruptcy situation, the customers funds would be protected (unless there was collusion between neo and the 3rd party, but that would undermine the whole thing).

This was my first physical bitcoin purchase, bought a bottle of Dodds gin from the London distillery company ( They used bitpay and even gave me a discount! I used BitWallet for iOS and was amazed at how fast the process was.
Would definitely recommend their tours if you're in London and have even a passing interest in gin/whisky.  Their head honcho Darren is an absolute legend! 10/10 would tour again. Looking forward to trying their whisky in a couple years time.

I never trust anything specific for bitcoin qr code generation. Who's to say they won't try a sneaky one and swap their address in place of yours one of these days? Maybe they get hacked and someone hardcodes their address in?
Much safer with google/duckduckgo/wolfram alpha IMO.
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:54:20
I have to confess that I'm (typically) not a huge gin drinker but the samples we were given on the distillery tour really hit the spot! I probably couldn't do the flavour profile justice but it really packs a botanical punch. 
You're probably best reading the opinion if someone who can properly describe it, I just read this  while having a sip and I'd say they capture it pretty well.
It's worth noting that the flavour can vary slightly from batch to batch because of the natural variance in the ingredients used. They even put the postcode of the local London honey on the bottle haha. The honey used to make my bottle came from E1.
Admittedly it is a bit pricey for a 500ml bottle (though it is 49.9% ABV), but I really like what they're doing. Also good to support a new company that embraces bitcoin. I was talking with the director and apparently they hold onto 50% of bitcoins from purchases rather than just convert it all to cash.

The way I see it, is for anything bitcoin related. If you want to just talk about the price then go to a price specific subreddit like or if you want to talk about mining then go to should be a melting pot of conversation where everything bitcoiny is welcome. Feel free to disagree and downvote posts that you don't feel belong here though, it's what the system is there for. If enough people agree then those posts won't make it to the front page of the subreddit.
@_date: 2014-10-10 09:07:28
Fair enough. Does not seem like the majority of individuals (on here anyway) are with you on that policy decision.
I will say, however, after my initial kneejerk 'censorship = bad' reaction, I read the reasons for this blacklisting. They do seem to have some technical merit if true, but I can't help feel that you went about this issue wrong. If you made a nice post with some charts and statistics showing how satoshi dice and others are impacting the blockchain, it could have been a discussion about solutions including the possibility of blacklisting. 
Now the community feel you were trying to pull a sneaky one and are reacting accordingly.
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:35:32
Massive dump on btc-e leading to (possible) margin cascade driving the price down. Sellers on LBC just haven't caught up yet or are unwilling to sell at this price.

Seems cool, but what's to stop someone setting up a 'master' account with malicious intentions?
I could see someone putting a small amount of their money into a master, doing some profitable trading so they look attractive to slaves, then when they have a healthy bankroll of slaves, they could exploit those slaves for their own profit. E.g by trading against themselves, filling their own pockets while milking the slaves (and their dummy master account) dry.
That would be my concern, especially with unregulated and pseudo anonymous crypto currencies. Not to mention that slaves can't see trades in real time, so a malicious master would have a window of time to act before slaves noticed anything wrong.
Unless I've totally misunderstood how this works, in which case someone feel free to correct me.

Oh cool, didn't realise there was a coindesk video on them! Good find.

Yeah I bought it in person at their actual distillery. It's all done in batches of a couple of hundred bottles at a time so you can sometimes find everything is out of stock :(
They had a fair bit ready to be bottled when I was there yesterday though so hopefully there's more in stock soon!

Yeah ignore the downvotes, I think maybe you didn't explain your concern well enough and people got trigger happy.
You've got a real point here about investing in any project with a long timelag. Or investing in anything with bitcoins really (that you hope to then sell again for bitcoins), at least until the price stabilises. Unless you're converting to/from fiat at either end (which defeats the purpose somewhat) you're gonna be hit with this problem.
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:31:00
I don't, as far as I can tell the only way to get one is by mailing invite They don't give them out to users for some reason, bit of an odd system.
When I signed up they were fast at getting back to you though, I got my code within 30 mins.
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:22:37
If you just put your public address in it shouldn't actually let you send it - you should be able to see how much there are there but I don't think it will let you send any without the private key. At least in theory!

Easy on there Tyler Durden. No reason the systems can't both coexist.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:39:32
I think the idea is that they would continue to mine on their fork, and you would end up in a messy situation with multiple coexistant forks. ASIC miners on the "old" fork and devs + others on the new.

There shouldn't be any issues, but it never hurts to have your phone backed up with iCloud/iTunes just incase.

Yeah sounds good in theory but I'm not sure what prevents this system from abuse. What's to stop someone saying that 'own' tons of gold when really they don't?  Or attaching nonexistent gold to an asset class or something.
The only way I could see it working is if there was a centralised gold storage entity (or entities) that issue these digital asset classes while storing the gold in their vaults. But it seems a bit contrary to the decentralised direction this technology is moving in. And if one of the centralised storage entities go bust then it'd be like mtgox all over again, but with gold.

It's near Battersea - I think you can go down most days between 9am-6pm if you want to buy directly from them (not 100% sure about weekends though, I'd email to ask). They also do tours which you can arrange by emailing them, they cost £15 but you get to sample the gin and get to chat with the folk who make it as well as seeing all their equipment.
You can find directions and whatnot here:

Why? The markets have been skittish due to Chinese uncertainty. This brings some certainty and closure to the issue, so hopefully this will be the beginning of the end to China-induced volatility.
Just a thought - maybe you could explain your point of view rather than calling people "fucking retards" and your post wouldn't be such a downvote magnet. Unless you get a kick out of being 'so edgy'.
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:26:36
Well the way it works is you add a bitcoin address and they give you a unique reference number as well as bank account and sort code info to do a bank transfer to.
You then just do a transfer from your bank using those details (I use online banking). You don't even need to have speedybitcoin open or be logged in, as long as you have the reference number saved.
They send you an email when they receive your money (5-10 mins for me) and instantly send the bitcoin to the address you specified. 
Setting up a standing order is just like doing an automated transfer so as far as speedy are concerned there's no difference between that and a regular purchase.

Well if you're ignorant on the issue perhaps you should refrain from making substantive claims on the issue, kinda like:


I'm not a hodler, I own less than 1btc and I'm personally dubious as to whether this 'grand' experiment will succeed or fail spectacularly. But if you're going to troll then don't do it just by making wild, incorrect statements about the technical aspects of Bitcoin and the blockchain.
is that way, my fellow captain of industry.

The supply will actually decrease if they pause all their cloud mining just after a difficulty retarget. The network hash rate will decrease, so until the difficulty next adjusts, blocks will take longer to find so the effective supply will reduce.

Were you under a rock last week? Satoshi's email got hacked and apparently the details were sold on the darknet. 99.9% sure that's how this got leaked.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:21:34
It will be slowed down until the next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:17:21
I never said it would stabilise the price, just that it would slow down the supply of (new) coins until the next difficulty adjustment. 
Fuck knows what effect (if any) it would have on the price.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:49:19
It's actually a pretty clever way to adjust difficulty and maintain a reasonably constant block generation rate, since there's no way to directly measure the network hashrate.
If it's really that bad then I'm sure someone of your obvious intellect could propose a better difficulty adjustment method, right?
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:35:55
No, the difficulty adjusts in order to maintain the block emission rate at 1 every 10 mins, based upon the average block generation rate since the last difficulty retarget (which is a function of network hashrate). 
So if you reduce the hashrate significantly just after a difficulty retarget, say by 11% as some other commenters are suggesting, blocks will take 11% longer on average, so around every 11 mins instead of every 10. That means 11% less Bitcoin generated daily, until the next retarget can adjust the difficulty to match current hashrate.
As the difficulty retargets every 2016 blocks (14 days at 10 mins per block), if the network hashrate dropped by 11% just after a retarget, it would take 11% longer to generate those 2016 blocks (15.54 days) while still only emitting the same number of bitcoins. This in effect lowers the emission rate, unless other miners bring online enough hashrate to mitigate the 11% drop. To claim otherwise is just demonstrating your ignorance of how Bitcoin really works.
Also, I'm not saying this will 'solve' anything, so please don't put words in my mouth. Just trying to clarify from a technical perspective how Bitcoin works, and why a significant drop (or rise) in hashrate just after a difficulty retarget will impact the emission rate.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:34:12
Wow, way to derail the conversation with an off topic rant? For what it's worth, I agree with you that Bitcoin is currently dangerous for people not technically savvy enough to properly understand both Bitcoin's pitfalls and limitations as well as general PC/network security.
Not sure what "hidden dangers" have to do with an 11% decrease in average block time like we were discussing though?
I have never said Bitcoin is anonymous, will dominate the world (though increasing the maximum block size is far from impossible), or that Bitcoin is the same as the blockchain (the number of altcoins with their own blockchains is evidence enough of that). 
You say "people are waking up". It definitely seems like you woke up, but perhaps on the wrong side of the bed this morning? Take a deep breath. It's just software and numbers. It's not like it killed your family or anything.
But yeah if you want to just discard what we were actually talking about in order to rehash some anti-Bitcoin talking points (that may well be true) then that's cool, I'll leave you to it. Have a good life!
