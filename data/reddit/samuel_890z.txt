We still have automobiles too. Tulips aren’t exactly a technological breakthrough.

It's about usage.  That is all that matters.  
For this to be a bubble, people would have to stop using Bitcoin, and for that to happen, there needs to be a superior technology, with enough momentum to overtake the network effect and the branding.   
You are perhaps a bit to focused on the value in dollars rather than the adoption in users.

That’s also true of dollars too

I think the brand is already established.  Why don't you design a new logo for bitcoin cash?

Would you have been late to buy amazon.com at $250? Where else are you going to store your money anyways?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:54:06
Fine, but do it in a crypto wallet :-p

Sounds like a narc

Sort of, the dollar was pegged to gold.  As you know, bitcoin is an application of the block chain.  It seems that the core use case is a medium to store and transfer wealth.  
So, in a way it is a currency (which basically does the same).  The problem is that these transfers require proof of work algorithms and running these algorithms have a cost (electricity).  
This cost puts a lower limit on how useful Bitcoin will be for a certain size of transactions.  So for day-to-day transactions (buying coffee, etc.) it seems to me that there is an opportunity for a different token.

How do you think Visa works?
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:01:14
Yep!! Keep sneaking down baby
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:32:14
I agree with this expectation. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:55:09
I think that thinking about bitcoin like gold is valid.  Until 1971 the dollar was based in gold.  People used dollars that were RELATED to gold.  Nobody traded in gold.  
This economy is just getting started, folks are building an economic ecosystem ATOP of bitcoin.  There is value in holding the bitcoins and trading in future tokens build on the bitcoin block chain. 
More and more people are accepting bitcoin every day, soon they will be able to accept more than bitcoin.

99% seems fairly pessimistic... Why would you 'hope' for the crypto markets to implode?
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:02:43
That seems horrible.  But at least it respects our corporate overlords 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:32:51
So then you are being paid in it too?  Correct, I am converting USD into BTC
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:28:45
I would think it is too valuable to use at this point as an every day currency
