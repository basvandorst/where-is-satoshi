You're kidding right.

Scepticism is healthy. It stops group think and helps promote problem solving. Theres nothing worse than everyone "agreeing" about everything, see the bay of pigs disaster.

Look up Brandon Kelly on Youtube. Thank me later friend ☺️

$235,429,980,915 is the market cap right now. So .5% of the market cap is actually transacted/year. BTC pushing hard into the store of value and away from digital currency.

I'm sick of all these forks. Its so annoying changing wallets, not to mention having to pay fees to do so every time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:34
GDAX has no fees for makers or withdrawals. Don't swap from Coinbase just because people are boycotting. Just silly.

trade alt coins well and you can make consistent btc gains of 10-60% if you do it rationally. That way you enjoy the dips too ☺️ 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:07:00
Whats the rate minus fees?
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:24:09
Its a pity, considering everyone is just hodling away anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:45:48
If youre in bitcoin for the utility, you're using lite coin or bitcoin cash ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:49:31
Can I ask, why should we waiting when there are other coins that already offer low fees and speedy transactions? They're already there, why not adopt them, *cough* ltc *cough*
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:04:32
Soon as in 18 months?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:58:29
That's awesome then. I'm not one to jump on either side of the coin(s), but something coming in sooner rather than later is rad and great for the space.

The problem is: theres a possibility that Wall St money has been flowing into BTC all year and now they can short it in futures and try cause a crash. Then during all the panic, big dogs can acquire btc at lower price whilst cashing in on futures.

Store of value. See: "Digital Gold"
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:07:03
I don’t think 2x is bad as a short term fix though??

How great is it when 3rd party companies start dictating what certain cryptos are/aren't called...
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:48:31
Yeah, except double the cars are on the road.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:36:31
Value is inherent in utility, not inherent in itself.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:30:12
Scyrocketing? You're kidding...
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:15:15
Just wait til the chain is blocked up again. It unfortunately does not feel as good

Figuring out how to minimise fees with the increasing volumes being traded as adoption increases 
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:02:14
What is the core plan to control fees?
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:26:54
Oh I see. I’m still learning everything. So with the ever increasing demand does this mean the fees are gonna go up and up and up or do we have to deal with longer confirmation times?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:07:08
On my way!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:45:09
No no no, I'm in. I just think theres a lot of misinformation perpetuated by the constant price fapping. Its just not as infallible as is sometimes portrayed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:50:19
Anyone got link?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:41:33
Theres better options for transactions than bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:05:35
This needs to happen. People are obviously financially invested which brings with it an emotional investment as well. Unfortunately that seems to translate to shit on everything else because its scary to think 'x' coin that I've invested in will get pushed out. 
Each coin has its benefits and things it needs to work on. If you see the world as black and white you're doing yourself a disservice in the long run. 
Diversify and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:55:31
Its because 99% of the posts are hype shitpost memes and a lot of people don't see bitcoin for what it is, a volatile investment.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:43:59
There's nothing humble about this
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:54:37
You make it sound like August 2017 is olden times... you're kidding right
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:11:53
Nah remember r/bitcoin hates coinbase. Boycott
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:28:59
Don't worry we're still going down.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:02:48
I'M BUCKLING HARD
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:18:57
I'll buy dip, I'll show you!
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:32:26
Where's the good research? If we can't look to the community for opinions what is this sub for?
I'm just new trying to learn! :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:14:55
This is completely incorrect. I read a book about the creator and he originally created the silk road as a way to sell mushrooms he was growing
