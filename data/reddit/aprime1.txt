You should consider the following before you take this stuff any more seriously than you ought to:
Dogecoin has all the values of a meme, that is it's entire premise is a joke, a memecoin. It's going to be used and abused until no one gives a fuck anymore.
Trade is (last checked) four times the market cap. That speaks wonders about the validity of that economy (people don't hold on to it. At least, not those with half a brain), reinforcing the idea that it has about has much value as an image macro. That's not to say that memes have no value, Jesus, no, memes are capitalized on, but the capitalization aspect never brings anything new or interesting to the table (read: actual value, although one could argue that this educates some of the masses about cryptocurrencies. I wouldn't be the one doing that).
It's inflationary by design. GG. To the tune of 5 billion extra coins a year last I heard.
Trading it to fiat involves archaic methods that generally result in scamming. This is a problematic that may apparently be resolved in the short run, but it's still completely uninteresting to the genuine investor (again, a minimum of intelligence is required here).

Before you do decide that you want to actually waste your time (this is my perspective, you may actually profit on it if you're into it for the short term, but don't go investing in hardware for it, it's stupid so long as the market behaves the way it does right now (e.g. more trading than actual value in the marketplace) on a memecoin like Fedoracoin,Coinye or Doge, you should actually try and understand their design and markets - basically, what differentiates them from established cryptos like BTC.
E.g. Dogecoin is inflationary by design to the tune of 5 000 000 000 DOGE per year.

@_date: 2014-02-04 07:06:20
You've put up an arbitrary date which is subject to variations.
It's inflation with a ceiling. We all know what that ceiling will be, much like we know what the ceiling for DOGE will be on a yearly basis. The difference being that DOGE doesn't actually stop.
Price inflation is a result of the factors I've mentioned. So far the inflation of the BTC supply has not been an apparent (at the very least over the past year) factor in its valuation.
You're speculating on usage of a competitor that's late to the game while we're seeing a standard being established at the present time.
BTC is seen however people want to see it. You're seeing DOGE as an investment vehicle with hopes that its value increases as its use potentially increases. I'm seeing BTC as a tool whereas I'm seeing doge as a gag based on some of the principles of the tool. I don't understand what makes you think that it's for a "different segment of the population" because of its growth pattern as we're not talking about solid units of currency here (you can buy into decimals, need I remind you). Most merchants right now are seeing BTC as a way around banking fees, and they'd be right to think so. I'm aware that some smaller time merchants work exclusively in BTC, hell some corporate employees even take their salaries in BTC. Anyway, my point is that cryptos are a tool. Any one of them has the potential of having the various uses BTC has. The difference is BTC is an established player now, whereas DOGE is behind and is essentially being used in the same fashion as image macros for most people. There's waaaaaay too much speculation going on about its future outlook, but based on the trading patterns I'm seeing, I  personally believe that right now, it's anything but serious.

It's dying as a currency? 
It has a future as a protocol to transfer value between entities, which in itself doesn't negate it's properties as a currency, it's just becoming invisible to the consumer. We're still moving Bitcoins around based on their worth and that's all that matters to me. 
Get this: BTC is the Linux of finance in a sense. With the proper partners, it can gain mainstream adoption, but not without what some might consider heresy. Android is a great example of this. On the other and, the Linux market place is also saturated with desktop/PC distros that serve varying purposes but of which practically all the world couldn't give a fuck about.

Your first point, I've already addressed it in my first statement (e.g. Snowden). We're not talking about this here, and the source isn't even said to be confidential. There's context to everything, I'm aware.
I'll let the insult slide since you've got comprehension issues.


You've implied that others are doing it, so not revealing source material is justified in this case. Again, we're talking about alleged research and an alleged interview. While it could be true, there's nothing proving that the interview took place or anything "incriminating" the man Newsweek claims to be Satoshi aside from Leah's written claims, which can be falsified. Audio or video statements? Eh, not so much. If your credibility is disputed and you're dealing with an individual who's suing your organization and since we're talking about a public opinion battle here, providing proof is pretty much par for the course.
Should this be an issue with the state or any threatening organization, so to speak, I'd obviously treat it differently, but then again, the allegations would probably be accompanied with media of some sort.
The "principles of journalism" you're speaking of here and which I'm completely aware of aren't applicable. Newsweek is claiming to be doing investigative work without any supporting evidence submitted after the man they framed as Satoshi denied the fact. No sound bites, no video, nothing and rather than addressing the disputed claims with anything formal, they're instead insulting those who disagree with the claim made, in a sense. If they're unable to provide said evidence (e.g. Rob Ford bullshit), it's a different story (again). In this case, it's their own work, their own interview and everything that lead to their claim. I don't disagree with the principle of protecting your sources and whatnot, but what you're saying here simply does not apply to this ordeal.

Tipping has become a mechanic of the meme, much like posting image macros. The phenomenon is comparable to communicating as when you're communicating, you're actually trading value to varying degrees. The only difference with tipping is that you're quantifying that value. Now, given that the tipping involves a continuously depreciating currency that observes more trading than there is value in the market, its value is very much attached to the sharing of meme images. Tipping was a serious act that's been the source of mockery, and much of that mockery has turned to both Fedora and Dogecoin for a "proper" response.
Addendum: Monetary inflation doesn't differ from price inflation, at least in the proper sense. Price inflation is supposed to reflect scarcity and higher difficulty (regulation, taxes, or just natural reasons, they all count) in obtaining the resources. It can also reflect monetary inflation. An inflationary currency will not appreciate based on its increased availability. It may stagnate in price, but it may also drop in price. If the increase in availability coincides with an increase in price, that's because there's still scarcity regardless of the increase (I'm disregarding speculation here, mind you).
Not that I have any idea how much hoarding you're actually doing and if you've invested any resources in mining hardware, but I'd seriously take a couple steps back, if I were you. Feel free to enjoy it while it lasts, but I sense a bit of delusion here. I mean, unless your objective is that of increasing speculation.

Do you not realize that there was an actual interview, however informal it was? What the hell.
Journalism without sources or proof isn't journalism, it's editorialism or commentary, hence my association to tabloids. I don't know why you claim the opposite. Investigative journalism always shares whatever it can with its public unless its shoddy or biased.
This isn't "off the record" stuff. If you have a story to share, you have compelling evidence of its validity. Newsweek's credibility is in question here and while they're free to reject demands for proof of what they're advancing, the overall attitude and refusal to does not help their case here.
I don't understand why you keep referring to how "historically wrong I am" or even ignorant when you don't even seem to know the extent of the claims being made by Leah and/or how unsupported/poorly supported they are.
Again, there are different contexts in which SOURCES should/shouldn't be divulged. However, this is completely without relevance here as I'm talking about SOURCE MATERIAL. You should learn to understand the difference.
Anyway, I'm done, this is hopeless, you didn't even know they had a chat and that she's made claims he's disputing about what he's said but couldn't be arsed to record anything, apparently.

2. Scams extremely prevalent still (not saying it's exclusive to bitcoin, but from mining hardware to fucking trading markets, it's pretty absurd how big the scams are).
3. Wild variations with regards to valuation
4. Few regulations (not necessarily governmental, just market regulations outside of the protocol)
It's been years and hardly anything has progressed in this regard. The upside is it's being used as a protocol to send money from A to B now rather than something you buy, send, and hope the market doesn't crash when the merchant picks up the payment, thanks to players like Bitpay. Stockpiling is  unappealing to the corporate world given the instability.
The wild boom-busting shit we've seen was a subset of how we were using BTC "before", but the way the protocol and corporate are interacting is reshaping the marketplace. 
I'm potentially wrong here, but I think things are going to be quiet (and stay that way) for the foreseeable future.

It's already becoming a running gag because of this (Power Points failing midway because the interpreter is Office - interoperability is important, and while MSFT is most likely to blame, I get similar issues loading ODTs and other open formats in Open alts. as well as Google Docs, something must be wrong here).

How is it not their fault? Trading lag is usually an indication of massive activity. How are we supposed to treat a market place with such sysemic problems that every lagwave is interpreted as something scary happening, causing people to panic? Add to that Gox being 50% of the market meaning whenever it fails it alarms traders (again demonstrated this morning) to a point where the value drops dramatically everytime as the kids running the show are too autistic to understand what adequate PR is.

I take bigger issue with Libre's compatibility issues with proprietary formats. With regards to open formats, it's pretty much in a class of its own, given how Open Office tanked.

I don't like alcoholic beverages; what's intrinsic about the value of your aged wine to me if I don't want it? I could admittedly give it to someone who does, but it just has no value to me. Backing my currency with it is futile as it in itself becomes a currency (e.g. I'm only using it to trade). Your appreciation of wine on its own gives it no intrinsic properties anyhow, as it's not a necessity but rather a luxury, much like gold.
One would most legitimately argue that objective value comes from the fulfillment of basic humanitarian needs, such as the need to eat, shelter, and trade. Trading is facilitated by currency, thus currency has objective value so long as it's accepted by most people. But there's no such thing as something being valued all the time. Gold has an history of being valuable over the centuries because of we actually still care more about beauty than the mind. It obviously has industrial uses, but that's hardly what drives up its price to the levels we know today. If water comes to be replaced as a means of hydration, or food as we know it, what's the intrinsic value then? It might be valued more, but that's not objective or intrinsic anymore as it stops being essential.
Markets are built on both trust and reason. Goods are generally purchased based on subjective value or characteristics. There's nothing scary about claiming it's subjective rather than objective as hardly anyone has the same desires outside of bare necessities.

Bullshit, it's a mixed system, even in official documentation and paperwork at times. You're only starting to see it fade with youngsters. My generation learned imperial in the 'reverse order', in a sense (learn metric in school, convert to imperial for certain things).
People who speak of their personal height hardly ever report it in meters, for instance. Same with paper, same with formatting standards in general.
We mostly hang on to it because America hasn't phased it out yet and we're their main trading partner.

@_date: 2013-11-28 15:35:48
Third parties need to provide protection. Relying on reputation alone is insufficient in a wide marketplace where most transactions are anonymous in nature (not fully, but I mean, we have the 'wall' of the Internet diving two parties, whereas when you go to a store and buy a cookie in BTCs, you're pretty much knowing what you're getting).

That's pretty much why I sold around 1.2K. I've seen enough of China's bullshit business to know that this wasn't going to be sustainable demand. They do the same thing with practically everything they don't make (ban, curtail, protectionism policies, etc). They're ultimately making a mistake, but it's done in a context where China wants its banks to be investing in the country, not around the world.
Basically, it's consistent with their policies and you should've seen the bust coming given all the attention it was given.
I'll buy back in soon, I guess.

They did send out refund reminders. We, as mere peasants, cannot read, though. Admittedly, the comments seem to lead us to believe that the actual refunds did not take place. I wouldn't dispute this. The whole 'scam' aspect' of it hasn't been adequately covered in the news, as far as I can tell. Last I heard of it, it was simply 'unfulfilled' and the guy got his money back. I dunno what the process is and if there's actually one.
Anyway, I certainly wouldn't give that asswipe given his track record (fail to deliver or scam, doesn't matter).

The other party also filed a police report? That's okay, we'll refund the two of you.
It is harder to be a seller than a buyer with PP but the difference is marginal except when they feel you need to prove that you have a business because you decided to list 20 high-risk iPads the night you joined.

With regards to pressure: you do realize that I'd have to install software on someone else's computer?

Some school boards have recently switched to Linux so that they didn't have to upgrade their 'fleet' of computers to Win7.
It's adaptation; I'm trying to run into as little quirks as possible, it's why I also have offsite backups of school projects and the likes. I generally bring my own laptop but not everyone has HDMI hookups or the necessary adapters.

The first time I got screwed over, it thought me a valuable lesson about how easy it's to screw others in these systems.
It's called open up another account and get your resources back by taking advantage of Paypal's own bullshit.
Did you know they measured your non-receipt claims in % of total purchases, not the totals? That means a buyer can buy a ton of cheap goods to build his reputation up on the system and then buy a big ticket item only to dispute its receipt.
Seller provides a proof of shipping? No problem, arrange a return... and ship a item similar in weight to somewhere not too far from the actual return location. Seller doesn't confirm receipt? No problem, contact Paypal (preferably by phone) and show them how you've respected your end of the deal. Fun fact, though, it doesn't work that way if you're a seller.
Yes folks, it's this retarded.
Edit: I think my formulation makes my stance difficult to understand. That's the POV I got as a seller and after experimenting with their system over the years with buddies of mine (we'd sell stuff to each other in hopes to better understand how dumb their dispute (and capital retrieval) process is; believe me, it's unimaginable).
