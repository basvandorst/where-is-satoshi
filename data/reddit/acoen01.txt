Correct, Bitcoin is the currency and Lightning Network is the financial system for the currency. I think even if others emerge with new aspects or features that Bitcoin lacks that Bitcoin ultimately will figure out how to implement those lacking aspects or features as well, and better.

Let’s just use a decentralized currency and send it to a centralized exchange to swap it for another currency to send it off the centralized exchange back to our wallet to then make our transaction and call that “the future”.
I’m glad you’re not in charge of Bitcoin development friend. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:21:41
Eh it’s ok. It just provides evidence that Bitcoin will eventually implement it and is working on anonymity, which is what I believed was the one thing holding me back from Bitcoin maximalism. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:04:44
Your thinking short term. Who ever said Bitcoin wouldn’t implement those later as well.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:28:14
Once Lightning Network, wallets, and UI are 100% ready. That’ll allow the acceptance of BTC as payment from your employer and in commerce. If people are accepting payments at work in BTC that’s when we’ll most likely start to see BTC used often and remain within the network. The old timers in regulatory positions retiring or dying will help too, as immoral as that sounds it’s true.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:25:14
The currency and new financial system is for the future. Nobody said it was for us.
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:28:30
What’s 2023, the amount of surpassed cryptos or are you saying that by the year 2023 you estimate that’ll happen? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:26:27
It appeared as if you were being sarcastic. I do apologize 
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:05:21
Ban, unban, repeat. Ban, unban, repeat. It only tells you it’s inevitable. Let old grandpa aged politicians try to regulate what their grandchildren are creating. In a decade or so they’ll be gone or dead and Bitcoin will thrive. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:07:16
It’s new to me haha. I’m excited because it shows that Bitcoin is the Monero killer and that no privacy coin will matter because Bitcoin will become private more than likely and at a much greater anonymity level than any altcoin. It’s almost as if the Monero team completely steals every idea Bitcoin has and sloppily releases it by amateurs when it’s entirely incomplete and not ready at all and may not even be the correct solution to begin with.
This article is how I just became a Bitcoin maximalist. I’m sure Litecoin will implement everything too, or first, which is exciting too because it shows we’ll have an excellent and secure transparent or anonymous store of value and payments currency. Lightning Network just makes it that much better too with all that can be done with it.  
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:25:05
I agree with you, but why do you think that means there will be zero anonymity. It seems as if they’re actively sorting out what will work and what will not. Just because they turned something down doesn’t mean it is the only solution. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:26:19
Strange fellow huh
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:40:56
The base layer is essentially transparent with any coin. The only thing that makes the transparency private is what’s added to the transparency itself, which yes can be changed requiring a hard fork. It’s inevitable at some point, and of course it will create a controversy, but who said it’s a bad one. Hard forks are better than soft forks because hard forks require the most consensus before doing so. If Bitcoin hard forks because of anonymity I would assume that’s a great thing.
I love Monero as well. I think it’s great and there’s a ton of community effort involved. Some of their research may even flow over into Bitcoin, who knows. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:34:03
I agree.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:20:20
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:21:09
I’m not. I’m just curious to see what happens.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:36:35
Valid point! Haha 
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:19:40
True 
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:10:12
if bitcoin is worth $8.1K per coin right now its because fiat gives Bitcoin its valuation. If fiat disapears, what would be giving each coin its value per coin? Goods and services sounds correct, but what would there be to buy more Bitcoins with besides more Bitcoin? Or is that the whole point. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:42:56
Bcash or Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:00:22
Its a $5 fee just to trade.......
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:28:59
Very true
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:44:19
so in that case increasing the block size or block weight would result in the same on-chain speeds per transaction if they were both evenly increased? For example, if Bitcoin had 8mb block weight and Bitcoin Cash had 8mb block sizes, would they transact at the same TPS on-chain?
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:54:21
In my opinion, In order to turn any cryptocurrency into a stable currency for the world it’s going to need to stop profiting/losing. Storage of value’s and fiat aren’t volatile like that. It will have to have so much money inside of its coin supply that the cryptocurrency transacted will always stay within its own network allowing for a rock solid price valuation per coin to move much less volatile, probably even less than the USD. Eventually, a coin’s demand for goods and services will determine its valuation as fiat slowly fades away indefinitely. That’s my opinion at least. If anyone has a better one I’d love to hear it. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:55:02
so increasing the block weight speeds up transactions and allows for BTC to earn more fees essentially?
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:01:10
I mean good luck making a worth while return with $5 though... 
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:14:12
I don't see that as true as BCH will serve as a coin in commerce, has a different economical approach then BTC, and is basically the Bitcoin research that BTC isn't doing to collect real world data that could then become valuable for BTC to use later if it desires too. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:29:58
If Bitcoin is not used, then by the time fiat disappears when a coin is valued by its demand for goods and services it would not be worth very much at all if it’s not being used as money.  Good digital money will first need to also be a secure excellent storage of value. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:12:58
So it sounds like Bitcoin is keeping 1MB blocks to purposely be a storage of value and Bitcoin Cash is increasing block sizes to be a version of Bitcoin that could be useful in commerce?
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:28:19
Agreed, but it will act as a real currency then, not profiting/losing hundreds to thousands all the time like an investment.  
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:30:07
To be honest, I don’t know. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:22:55
I think mining and hosted nodes will become ran by crytographically autonomous software and human beings and the servers/computers required will not matter eliminating any centralization when it comes to mining and hosted nodes. Otherwise, what would be the point of cryptocurrency if miners and nodes had the opportunity to become centralized long-term speaking. I understand this issue has not been addressed yet in the community, but it most certainly will. I support Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash because of that reason.
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:40:01
Oh I see. True. But they had to hold their money initially and for a very long time before so they had enough saved in order to get into currency trading. The rest earned millions and are able to do so, but that’s not the average person 
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:35:59
How the hell is that off topic for Bitcoin. It’s specifically about Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:03:41
Ya, so in a sense Bitcoin’s demand will be that it’s the marker used to gauge the valuation of all cryptos, which means that Bitcoin’s goods and services are actually other cryptos themselves and whatever else that may be in the future, if not everything that’s blockchain or price related. With that being said, Bitcoin would be  forever, but what about  and  Will BCH be used in commerce and facilitated as cash or will that be Litecoin or Monero. I have thoughts, but I’m curious to hear yours. You pointed something out nobody on Reddit has anywhere!
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:20:44
What’s your point? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:27:16
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:17:30
So if fiat gives 1.0 BTC a $300,000 valuation per coin for example, then if fiat becomes obsolete that 1.0 BTC could become worth $1 in essence or would the valuation per coin that 1.0 BTC had up to the last moments of fiat be how its judged? This seems confusing.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:40:05
Oh wow that actually makes a lot of sense. Bitcoin will be the reserve standard that acts as the marker for the other cryptos to gauge what their worth is.
