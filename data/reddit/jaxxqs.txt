Firestone's tires run best on cobbled roads and also run best when taking up the whole road travelling at 2mph letting no other vehicles use the road. They also have a large convoy of firestone lorries competing with other lorries. Due to the design of the Firestone tyres it's more adventurous for the lorries to travel with 0 payload. Making the toll for using the road go up and up for people wanting to travel with real payloads. A plan has been put forward to use tarmac instead of cobbled roads which would allow alot more improvements to vehicle design and structure and would also allow alot more vehicles to travel on the road, this is incompatible with Firestone tyres. Unfortunately due to the volume of traffic 0 payload traffic blocking up the roads using Firestone tyres, upgrades to the road can't be done and thus artificial gridlock is an avoidable reality.
