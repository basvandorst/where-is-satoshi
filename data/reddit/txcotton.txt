I would only be interested if you used as many GMOs are possible. They're tasty!

hey, do you mind telling me if Bitcoin is roaring? a few days past Thanksgiving now. Cheers.

Yeah, actively managed. Any sane investing professional who doesn’t have a financial stake in the game will say you’re almost always better off buying passive index ETFs rather than actively managed funds. Nothing really profound there. 
Good for you that you bought and sold bitcoin and were able to maintain a 12% return. Very impressive considering the volatility. It must take a lot of work. I’ll just sit here and keep reinvesting into a passive S&amp;P ETF that averages an annual return of 11.8% that requires almost zero effort on my part.

lol, "underperforming indices". Please explain how you benchmarked the "underperformance" of an index that.... follows the market itself - which is the benchmark. God, this sub is so rich (not literally).

If you're hoping for the fiat to die anytime soon and are banking on crypto,... yikes.

"A volatile 'currency' that has massive swings is a bad investment and a poor replacement for fiat currency, which has an actual monetary policy? You must be a banker!!!!" (I didn't realize banker is pejorative - perhaps you confused the entirety of the financial sector with Goldman Sachs?)

Hahahaha, solid DD, mate. Setting a reminder for day after Thanksgiving to come back and remind you of this comment. This sub is rich (figuratively, because all your assets are tied up in bitcoin)

Uh, ok. So the rest of your investments performed the same as market? 
I’m not sure I understand your question. Most people don’t use one, unless they’re looking for someone to help plan. You don’t need a financial adviser to buy or invest in equities lol. Financial advisers typically sell actively managed funds of the company they work for since they have higher expense ratios. Higher expense means more money for them, regardless of returns. It’s why if you are looking for a financial adviser you should consider how they get their incentives. I’m sorry, but this is very basic stuff. Active vs passive funds is investing 101. Actively managed funds rarely outperform the market, and on top of that, cost more.
