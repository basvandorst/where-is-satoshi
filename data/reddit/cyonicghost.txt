Next year it will probably grow a lot like A LOT good on ya for taking that risk. By what I can see, bitcoins will keep growing in price.

The newer version for me dosent detect my GPU and will not allow me to benchmark... I'm not sure if they have fixed it yet :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:38:48
Ok I'll try legacy :) thanks
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:44:06
Yep it's so annoying. I downgraded it and it is working fine now :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:58:41
Oh hahahah thx :)

Yes, that happened to me. What you need to do is to downgrade to the previous version if you still have the 2.0.0.12 installer. The new version is either bugged or does not support GPUs.
