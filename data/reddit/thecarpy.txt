Interesting, I didn't know about the ability to build a block in secret like that. Makes sense.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you working under the assumption that if the pool operators are not well-intentioned that the miners will pack up and leave to another pool? I could not have faith in that happening. 
I might be misunderstanding though.
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:23:00
Thank you for the explanation. All of this is news to me so it seems that there are some barriers in the protocol that I wasn't aware off to stop malicious pool operators.

Actually hadn't seen it. Sorry for the redundancy, but I was just cruising Blockchain and saw this. One point I want to bring up which hasn't been talked about is that we call this a decentralized network and I supposed by definition it is, but it is so close to being realistically centralized it scares me.

This might be just the area I live in, but I would estimate that 90% of students in my class have a bank account they have access to and a debit card as well. I don't have a credit card because I don't believe I should have one until I have steady income and more essential expenses. (I work a bike shop, but my paycheck can vary)

That would be because those examples have a specific target demographic and as long as they are hitting that group they need to, they're happy. Bitcoin, in order to succeed, needs a degree of mainstream acceptance. Oftentimes teenagers and young people are the quickest demographic to accept and use my technology, and therefore are a vital group. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:03:03
Wow, you guys have quite the network over there! I only know a few people that I would categorize as bitcoin enthusiasts, but I could only hope that at my school it grows to what you guys have. The vast majority of the people I educate about it are still just grasping the basics and are not quite at the buying point, but hopefully they'll get there. There could be other bitcoiners around that I don't know about too. How did you gather everyone who was into it?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:25:17
For US users, coinbase seems to be the only viable service to use that links to your bank account. However, what makes you so sure that when campbx puts their banking platform online in a week that it'll be better? It will be brand new, untested, and campbx may receive a trading volume that they are unable to process because of THEIR daily limit. All I am saying is that you are expecting an awful lot from campbx.

I absolutely want to spend some bitcoins. I've got most in cold storage but I've got a separate wallet with a small amount of btc for when I find something I want to buy that I can do so with bitcoins. I just don't want to buy something just for the pure sake of spending them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:51:19
Seriously, I just tell my people that I've doubled my money in a few weeks, all of the sudden people are interested. And as we both know, just wait until Fortune 500's catch on. It will happen to one, and I believe that they'll go like dominoes once one decides to start taking them.

It's volatile and risky, you must know that. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:41:50
I find it amazing that people just plunk $2000 without solid research. In the last couple weeks I've probably spent 10-15 hours (conservatively) researching the best ways to buy and safely store my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:22:06
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:23:45
I'm hoping I can buy before that goes back up! Well, now we play the waiting game.

Thank you to both you and One more question, although it seems like a genuine improvement, would you agree that this would basically do nothing for the main problem of Mt. Gox, which is getting USD out?
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:33:00
I don't have a disc drive on my computer, so maybe I'll stop by Best Buy tomorrow and get one of those drives you can plug in by USB. So basically it would be
1. Download 64 bit ubuntu
2. insert blank DVD
3. burn (verify burned data box is checked)
4. wifi off, turn off computer, plug in burned disc, hold c as I power on. 
5. Plug in a USB Drive with bitaddress.org downloaded to it (QUESTION: On a Windows computer it, sounds like you normally need to disable USB autorun to prevent any viruses from transferring via USB key. Is this something that is not necessary on a mac or is there an alternative?)
6. run bitaddress.org, come up with a secure passphrase using diceware. write it down. secure in safe.
7. from that, a private key and a public address are created. write them down or print using a dumb printer. 
sound good? 
edit--- changed method
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:09:01
Except for the fact that I'm 18 and see the absolute absurdity in this statement, and statistically speaking, assuming this person owns BTC's, they would be most likely over 21. So don't assume that with youth comes a lack of wisdom.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:16:53
So basically there is no way to find out the number of people, only the number of wallets. Seeing as most people here seem to have usually a few different wallets, it's safe to say that the number of people in the world with bitcoins is probably under 5 million, or less than .07% of the world.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:33:15
Alright, I'm definitely liking the idea of the more complicated but more secure method. Do you think that the bitcoinpaperwallet.com method is good? I was reading a tutorial where someone said to roll a dice 50-60 times, input that into the brain wallet and it'll generate your private key. But it seems that with bitcoinpaperwallet, it just generates that key for you. Should I have any concerns about the effectiveness of the randomization of bitcoinpaperwallet. I am attracted towards this site because I really like the design of wallet and its security features.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:18:13
I've got another question (shockingly enough, right?!?)
I'm reading the install, and I plan on installing it via CD. Should I "install it alongside OS X" or should I partition it, and if I partition it, how much should I allocate for Ubuntu?
@_date: 2013-12-31 06:06:13
Great idea. I would probably set it at practically nothing so that if a hacker were to take control of my stash, they head over to send it to their wallet and all of the sudden 
*I just put in all this effort for .0001 BTC. FUCK.*
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:04:37
Electrum looks good. Thank you very much for the help, really appreciate it. Just a few more questions.
1. So it sounds like Electrum generates it's private keys via its own algorithm? So I would not be rolling a die and using an equivalent of a 'brain wallet' function to ensure proper entropy. So it sounds like if this is so, people believe in its randomness abilities.
2. This is about as noobish as possible, but which one do I download onto the USB to install Electrum? 
3. I found this  ...sounds like the method to stop a virus from spreading via USB? 
4. So lastly, the 4 pieces of information I'll get from Electrum is my Private key, public address, and the seed in the 12 word form and the seed in the long chain of numbers and letters, either of which can be used to regenerate my private key?
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:41:33
If I've got an old desktop in the garage running XP, would it be an even better idea to get that running, wipe it, and work from there?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:54:22
That wasn't my claim. However MySpace would have never become a household name if teenagers didn't accept it. Same with Facebook. Why did my parents both get Facebooks? Because their kids did. The teenage acceptance does not guarantee success, but without it, it would be much more difficult to gain traction. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:19:45
Thank you very much for that explanation sir. Could you please validate my understanding of this all?
1. Private key = the information typically on the right hand side of a bitcoin 'bill', like on bitcoinaddress.com. This is what is used to withdraw coins from this address. Using BIP38, this private key is created from your passphrase. Without the passphrase, the private key can't be used to withdraw bitcoins.
2. Passphrase is used to encrypt the private key. You need it to be as random as possible. edit: So wouldn't rolling a die 100 times be the best option (with spaces I guess) and writing it down generate the most random private key possible combined with a passphrase that has more entropy?
3. Address= the public part of the information, typically on the left hand side of the 'bill', and this can be used to verify the amount on the account by anyone, and also can be used to to send bitcoins to this account.
All this should be done on a clean, offline computer. I have a Macbook Air, would installing a virtual Windows desktop be sufficient?

It is fun to explain it to people! One thing that I neglected to say was that 3 of the people I explained it to today (in a group) were interested about bitcoins because they heard about the College Gameday stunt and it interested them.

@_date: 2013-11-24 21:06:20
I'm slightly older than you but in the same situation. I don't like posting specific amounts but I have between 2 and 5 BTCs. My reasoning is:
Right now, we are at a time (the only time) in our lives when losing money does not mean that we will be kicked out of our residence or struggle to put food on the table. This means that at this time more than ever, we can risk a larger proportion of our assets than at any time. 
Assuming you aren't dropping a ridiculous amount of money, the amount you will spend on BTCs will be very insignificant to the entirety of your life, especially considering the potential gains. Even if you lost all your money, you wouldn't be ruined or anything. So I say go for it. What else would you spend it on? A new trendy iPhone? Food? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:41:26

I simply use my success with it to gain their attention to explain how the protocol works and its benefits. I'm not baiting them to buy in and every time I explain it to them, I mention that it's volatile and could easily be down 30% in a day.

If I'm just taking it right off of coinbase's site and printing them that way, how can I be sure that it's secure? Because all the other methods talk about being offline, but with this way of doing it with coinbase, there is no way to do it offline, correct?

I'm pretty sure it's not 24 hours based on the actual time, but just a 24 hour period. (someone correct me if I'm wrong). But if it was that time, that'd be 9pm my time (PST) so that wouldn't be too bad. I just would rather not try to stay up late tonight, and then go to bed, only to have it open and close while I'm asleep. I think they need to integrate an alert. Send an automated call/text/email to me if I so choose. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:36:53
I had the same problem. I was waiting for a check to clear so my plan was to buy about 1/3 of my total one night and 2/3 of my total the next night when my bank account had the money from the check. But I didn't know I would have to wait. So I simply made another account with a different email but the same bank account linked, and when I actually receive my coins on Monday I will consolidate them to one account.

As shallow and boastful as it sounds, I first mention my 'profit'. (I put it in quotations because it's not profit if I don't sell!). When people hear that I doubled my money in a very short amount of time, they become very attentive! Once I bait them with that, I take the time to actually explain the system to them, and why it's so great. Did that today to 3 dudes in my Photo class. They all gather around me like some God because I made a good choice, and after the period was over, we had 3 more educated people.
