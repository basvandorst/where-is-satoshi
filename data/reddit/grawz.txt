Just as weird as you doing exactly the same thing earlier?

Everyone is sure because he admitted it.

Statists shouldn't get to steal the coins, they get to steal the private key. That way, they own the coins like you said.

He didn't admit to hiring the hitman, did he? That's generally what people were denying. Obviously he started silk road.

Well, I just got some numbers from a fellow mental patient. I have a good feeling about this!

When Silk Road was taken down, five other sites popped up. The closure of Silk Road gave the drug trade (and those websites) extreme publicity. At least some of the increased value of bitcoin can be attributed to the new users entering the drug trade.
People don't just stop using drugs.

The vast majority of products and services are harmful to humans in some way.
It's a good thing nobody is forcing you to log on to Silk Road, transfer bitcoins into your account, choose a drug you want to try, go through the process of encrypting your communications with the seller, input your address, pick up your drugs from the mail, and finally consume said drugs entirely of your own free will!
I probably missed a few steps, but you get the point. It's only evil if the drugs are forced onto you.

The publicity seems to play a huge part, with the China adoption playing some part as well.
Some might also be explained by new blood entering the drug market. It's unlikely that more than just a few Silk Road users gave up; they probably clamored to find new sources and followed their favorite vendors. Not only that, but almost every article about Silk Road lists several alternatives, which is great publicity for the drug market as a whole.

You can't stop the signal.

You should be arguing for proper education and responsibility, not for banning anything that is bad *enough* for people. Banning drugs doesn't work.
"Hard drugs" are pretty rare. The vast majority of drugs sold on websites like these are not detrimental to peoples' health (either directly or indirectly) with responsible use. Cannabis, most psychedelics, even some hard drugs will do absolutely nothing negative to the human body or mind unless they are used too much. This is exactly like sugar, alcohol, and almost every other product out there.
In general, people are ignorant and have no idea what drugs actually are. The solution isn't to take away freedoms; instead we should avoid abstinence-only education at all costs and allow people to make their own choices in life.

Speaking of Ripple, does anyone have the 300XRP needed to get in? I hate to ask, but it seems like the only way. :(
