You can import a pre-existing private key in a paper wallet app or it can generate one for you. Then it calculates the public key from the private key and the public address from the public key.

That's why I think Electrum will be the first lightning killer app (on android) thanks to their pre-existing 2-layers architecture (routing table on server), and it's open source and they're working on it for some time already...

1. Yep, done automatically. What is remaining is transfered to a change address also part of your wallet.
2. Depends but the important part is that it's not the public key but an address derived from it. Once you transfer from that address, the public key is published and you should not use it anymore.

I share your point of view, except I would see a very slow rise in the next few months instead of stagnation. A huge price increase now wouldn't be profitable on the long term because it would surely increase the reaction of the anti-bitcoin establishment.
With time, I think people will get tired of all the FUD as they realize Bitcoin is still here and cannot disappear that easely. Many declarations (e.g. France and Germany @ G20) are also just vague intentions and won't be easy to implement on a large international scale, that would require a very strong and sustained effort which I'm not sure those countries are really ready to commit to.
In the meantime we should continue to quietly and resolutely build the technology and network (LN) and at the end, we will prevail.

Have you actually tried it ? 
If that's the case, can you tell me what difficulty you met ? There are just 3 operations to do :
1) Fund the wallet like any regular wallet
2) Open a channel, can be done with one click using the auto-connect button (just have to choose the amount you want to deposit)
3) Confirm the transaction you made from the merchant's checkout page
You can simply swipe from one screen to the another, very easy !

I've read the white paper and been following the developments, they're working on it from quite some time. The team, located here in Switzerland, seems quite solid and they are Visa program manager since September.
The metal cards are pretty cool and you will be able to keep everything in crypto, what you spend is converted in real-time. In addition to allow you to use your crypto everywhere without fees, they aim to become a major fiat to crypto on-ramp gateway and it seems that they may have an agreement to serve Binance's users.

Hi there,
1. Yes, hodling is about having a long term strategy in which you don't sell before several cycles. You can still sell after that if hyper-bitcoinization hasn't happened and you can't buy anything using BTC yet but the price should have stabilized a bit with time and liquidity. Dollars cost averaging is a very compatible strategy in which you setup automatic and reccuring buys at a fixed time intervals. Both provide great peace of mind as you don't have to constantly follow the price and worry when to buy and sell, it's a long term strategy based on the fundamentals.
2. It's the opposite, if Bitcoin is priced in dollars and dollar looses value because it is produced in great number then one Bitcoin will buy you more dollars. Bitcoin is protected against inflation by its max size cap on the protocol level.
3. When transaction fees do not represent a significant part of the amount, depends on the exchange but you could wait for the mempool to be rather empty if you're dealing with small amounts. A mobile wallet may not be much more secure than an exchange though, depending on the quality of your op-sec.
4. If would say anything above the price of the hardware wallet, $100+. Great idea BTW!
Have a great Bitcoin journey.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:45:33
Why are you wasting your time here then ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:00:41
If that's daily trading that you want to do, you can do it on Bitstamp without any transfer, why Binance ? Of course you can also transfer directly from Bitstamp to Binance If you absolutely want to be there. 
When you'll have something like 1000, it would be better to transfer it to your own wallet, the fees will be less important percentagewise.

@_date: 2018-09-20 14:16:39
What do you call adoption?
The current price is when they are as many coins that people agree to sell than people agree to buy at this level, thus it is always "right". If, through improved adoption, new people want to buy and nothing else changes, the price will automatically rise.
We are at maybe 5% penetration among investors. When we go mainstream, the price is automatically going to rise A LOT!

If by manipulation you mean that everything you see on your screen is totally fake and doesn't match real trades then of course there's no guarantee of anything and we should all leave at once.
Personally I don't think this is the case, and when most people speak about manipulation, I think they speak about pump and dump schemes, rope a dope, etc. which are temporary and involve real liquidity. Such things as fake walls don't involve liquidity but do not directly affect the price and are also very short lived. Manipulations work best short term IMHO.
Another important point is that money is to be made through manipulations on the way up and also on the way down, I believe they negate each other on the long term.

The energy consumption is not related to the number of transactions but to the security of the system. We already have a very high level of security and it would't be necessary for it to grow much more even if it will probably do due to competition between miners.
The number of onchain transactions per second will always be limited and they will probably be dedicated to high value transfers only ; this number is not on the 2nd (Lightning network) and 3rd layers and the transactions on these layers, while being extremely secure, incurre very small costs (energy included). 
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:33:23
That's not necessary, not on one channel. Because a merchant will typically have more funds on his/her many incoming channels (funded by third party) than on his/her outgoing channels (funded by him/her).

Network effect is important but it's not because it was the first that it is the best. It's because it's the only one which is truly :

\&gt;I  get that fundamentally a wallet is just a set of private and public  keys, so it's not tied to any service/UI/whatever.
Yes, most wallets are not tied to anything and store your private keys. Public keys are generated from private keys and addresses are generated from public keys.
\&gt;So that means if I  already have funds in a wallet that I made with some other service can I  make a coinbase (or whatever service) account with that preexisting  wallet?
Generally you cannot import your keys but you open an account with Coinbase or another exchange (preferably Bitstamp), ask for a deposit which will generate an address for you to scan or copy, finally you send the funds from your wallet to your account. But your coins are a lot safer offline than online.
\&gt;I've heard of people having their  fiat bank accounts frozen after linking it with coinbase/whatever and  buying BTC, is this actually that common? Is there an easy workaround  for that?
Don't know much about that, never had any problem but I'm in Switzerland.
\&gt;I think there are a fes BTC ATMs near me but I assume they  charge a fee.
Yes, usually 4-6%.
\&gt;Also, the keys are  generated using the seed phrase right? So the seed phrase isn't just  authentication, like a security question with a bank, but rather it's  essentially the keys themselves right?
Correct, the seed phrase is used to regenerate in a deterministic way your private keys as they were before.
Don't hesitate if you have other questions. Good luck !
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:19:31
Hope it's a genuine question and I'm not loosing my time here.
First you should psy no attention to that b2x thing, it is of no importance.
Bitcoin will not "slowly die", it evolves with each release. Some changes can be done with soft forks where old versions are still functional and others, like block size, which are done with hard forks and must be consensual because everybody has to upgrade together or a new coin will be created. And the pipeline is full of new features being developed, those can be easily googled...

My pleasure, I think you're making a very good move (as long as you're doing it for the long-term) and the person who made the gift was wise to choose Bitcoin itself and not an altcoin.
I must tell you that ben.co is not one of the open-source wallets that are very much trusted and used by the community. The old adage is "not your keys, not your Bitcoins". With this wallet it seems you have your own passphrase and therefore are in control of your keys but personally I'm not sure I would trust them. Just buying and selling from them is of course less risky as long as you immediately transfer most of your coins to another address. For this, I'm using Bitstamp because nobody has ever lost a coin with them, the fees are medium-low, it's fast and they take good care of the blockchain ; but I hear the process to get registered is rather long now. Of course many people use Coinbase/Coinbase Pro.
It also depends on the amount you're planning to invest. They are many scams and dangers but if it's a small amount for you, why not ; otherwise the Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets are extremely secure and convenient for something like $100, not much effort I would say. Good non-hardware wallets are Electrum (desktop, Android), Samourai and maybe GreenAddress (IOS).

In a faraway country, some bad miners used a secret magic cheat called "asicboost" to mine more gold than the others. One day, a beautiful fairy called "Segwit" came to the mine and prohibited them from using it unless they put a special writing on the ore so that everybody can know they used it. The bad miners, who had never confessed using the cheat and did not want to use the special writing, then asked a very ugly witch called "Bcash" to open another mine (full of useless trash) in order to continue secretly cheating. In the end, the good miners started using the magic trick the way the kind fairy asked them and lived happily ever after.

I really like the reasons they give for refusing it, good for non future-based proposals which anyway are lot better for us :
"Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment. Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, the Exchange has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that a national securities exchange’s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.10 Among other things, the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are “markets of significant size.”

I personally think it's a good moment (and just bought more) but obviously nobody really knows. You shouldn't try to catch the absolute bottom though because you could miss the opportunity for what will probably not make a big difference several years from now. You should think long-term, that's important, at least 1 or 2 halvenings.
Otherwise solid advice by u/TadojinFarms.
I personally use and like Bitstamp (secure, reasonably cheap, fast and taking into account the health of the network).

When you buy a bitcoin, you don't buy a token indexed on the whole crypto marketcap. You specifically buy a bitcoin, a commodity which will exist in very limited supply forever (we know this through game theory).
But I agree with you that buying a little bit of every crypto is a sure way to loose money because of the global crypto inflation and nonsensical marketcaps.

It's not like we must have 100% Segwit before Lightning can work : the Lightning wallets automatically open channels using Segwit transactions which prevent malleability attacks. Lightning's payments also replace standard transactions.
Thus it's more like Lightning's usage will actually increase Segwit's adoption.

You've got lots of interesting things here, some I agree some I don't, won't go into details.
I'm in a small neighbouring country which I think works quite well as it is but still, I think it makes sense long term for all those different countries and currencies to disappear... or we could say unify, depends how you see it anyway. And for individuals to be able to interact more directly with each others, depending less on intermediaries and institutions...
They are many unanswered question as you say. It's History in the making, we can do some in a direction or the other but we can't do much. Interesting times to be alive.
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:59:05
OK but personally I think it's not expensive at all. I actually consider it free ! All you have to do is HODL for 6 months 50 MCOs (+-$500) and after that you get your tokens back. And in the meantime you gain a lot on cashback etc.
In addition, since it's a solid project and if you lock early, you will most probably be able to resell them at a higher price. They are only 31 millions tokens and the locking mechanism will mechanically and significantly increase the price.
"interbank exchange rate limit" is for all your buying in foreign currencies and "atm withdrawal limit" is about, well, atm withdrawals :)

No prob :)
The 2% fee after $200 withdrawal is for the introductory plastic card (Midnight Blue). You're right that there are no additional fees because they only use perfect interbank rates. But I think it would be a lot more interesting to take a metal card.
I have reserved the Precious Metal one, I locked 500 MCO tokens for 6 months, no other fees involved. I get 1.5% cashback on all purchases, LoungeKey Airport Lounge Access, $10,000 interbank exchange rate limit (per month, 0.5% thereafter) and $800 ATM withdrawal limit (per month, 2% thereafter).
The Ruby requires only 50 MCOs, has less perks (1% cashback, no airport lounge) but is still very good IMO.
Looking forward to the live demo tomorrow at Consensus.

Also "Processing one trillion private keys per second, it would take more than one million times the age of the universe to count them all." (

I think that future wallets will probably need only two settings that the user will have to set : 1) maximum amount that I want to be able to spend and 2) maximum amount that I want to able to receive (these values would be constrained by the off-chain or on-chain balance available). The wallet would then automatically trigger such things as Loop Ins and Loop Outs in order to continually ensure these capacities.  Does it make sense ?

It has been forked many times since mid-2017 and not one of these chains proved successful, I think it's not anymore a big danger in the coming years.

No, you're right, yes it itsn't ;)
Increasing divisibility is not the same as increasing supply.
When supply is increased, every current holder suddenly has a lower proportion of the total supply i.e. his/her  position lost value ; on the contrary, when divisibility is increased  (e.g. let's say we add 3 zeros and count in millisatoshis), every  current holder's position also increases proportionally (e.g. 1000x counted in millisatoshis). The total number of existing full coins hasn't changed i.e. the good is still as scarce and it is a neutral operation for the people who bought under the assumption that it was scarce.

It makes sense to begin with a strong foundation, i.e. buy real Bitcoins (BTC) first, which is less risky and still has an incredible potential. A popular advice is to not buy any altcoin before you have at least 1 BTC.
Bitcoin Cash is one of the worst, it has no future because it is centralized in the hands of few people and its community experiences huge internal conflicts with an very ugly upcoming fork.

Closing channels won't be necessary and topping up won't require an onchain transaction.

I have used this site successfully some years ago but be sure to tell your niece that she'll have to transfer all of it when she'll be ready or she could loose the change. And paper wallets have several other drawbacks, you have all the information here : [
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:26:40
There is no relationship between number of transactions and block timing, emtpy blocks are quite common. Transaction fees are only a small part of miners' incentive, many pools don't even distribute it. Do you mean when there will be no more coinbase subsidy? If at least one miner is left, we'll have a block every ten minutes, even without any transaction, like when Bitcoin was just born. But maybe I just don't understand what you mean... 
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:03:42
The incentive will be to collect the transaction fees, which should be a lot higher at that time (thus we need onchain fees to rise, don't listen to bcash propaganda). Another incentive, for big institutions for example, will be to protect their own capital.
@_date: 2019-02-19 14:04:48
Well, you'd be better off reading [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:49:37
I would say you're doing great. Electrum is a good choice (you can also have a legacy wallet on it, for example to transfer to your bech32 address), just be careful to upgrade it from the right site.
I'm convinced that, in the grand scheme of crypto adoption, we're still very early. I'm in it since 2013 but still buying (DCA).

This. Where we are now... it can only be Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:36:47
BTC is non-custodial, one could say that the fiat is in custody for a few hours but I personally don't care much as it is only a small amount every time.  Here's how it works:
You only provide an email, phone number and an address from your wallet. In return you obtain their bank info and a reference number.
After that, every time you send them a SEPA with the reference number (e.g. automatically every week), they buy the corresponding amount of BTC for you and send them to your address, same day.
Fees are 1.5% (+miner fees) whatever the amount, they have good rates and very optimized miner fees.
A DCA dream solution.
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:31:31

@_date: 2019-06-06 11:59:55
It is reasonable only for short periods of time, for example if you want to be able to quickly buy a dip. But then, when you have more time, you should sell those "virtual" coins and use the fiat to buy real bitcoin on a proper exchange and have it delivered to your cold wallet.

Of course not, don't worry. And if some developers had that crazy idea, they would have to fork and the main chain would destroy it. We're perfectly protected by incentives alignment and game theory. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:29:38
You're already quite a specialist I see. Bech32 is unfortunately still not very common. Would you be transferring to an Electrum wallet ?
The additional passphrase indeed depends on the wallet and is commonly used on hardware wallets as it can be used to hide your real amounts (different pin linked to it), and that's my advice, get a Ledger or a Trezor.
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:06:25

I think Luke is being very smart here, it may be a way to protect the current 1MB block size limit in the long term : asking for 300KB shifts the debate to the lower side and the current limit is more likely to be viewed as a reasonable compromise (which I think it is).

"Fraudulent implementation" means nothing. The problem with altcoins is that they are just copies, Bitcoin was the real innovation. If Bitcoin was not created there would be no JPM Coin.
If you say that something is just a fraud, you should think that nothing good can come of it. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 15:57:44
Increasing divisibility is not the same as increasing supply.
Look at it this way : when supply is increased, every current holder suddenly has a lower proportion of the total supply i.e. his/her position lost value ; on the contrary, when divisibility is increased (e.g. let's say we add 3 zeros and count in millisatoshis), every current holder's position also increases proportionally (e.g. 1000x counted in millisatoshis). The total number of existing full coins hasn't changed i.e. the good is still as scarce and you can see that it is a neutral operation for the people who bought under the assumption that it was scarce.

The system is designed to produce a new block every ten minutes, whatever the number of miners. If after some time not enough or too many blocks have been produced, the difficulty is decreased or increased accordingly. You can count on it and need not worry about it, on the long term you'll have a new block every ten minutes (or just a little bit less because of the continually increasing miners' power).
What matters for the price is the reward given for every block produced, 12.5 BTC at the moment. Without considering any other temporary factor, it means that more than $9 millions US dollars or equivalent (12.5\*6\*24=1800 new BTC a day \* $5200) must enter the market every day just to maintain the price (\~4% inflation rate). Every four years, this reward is divided and after the next halvening (may 2020) it will be 6.25 BTC per block (\~2% inflation rate). Since miners have to sell most of their coins to pay their electricity bills, it means that selling pressure will decrease and that the price will probably increase a lot sometimes between now and mid 2020 like it has happened everytime before. Now is time to accumulate.

BTC lost a lot less than the altcoins, Bitcoin dominance just increased.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:40:03
I'm also very confident in Bitcoin's future, the problem buying with more than you can afford to loose is that it makes you extremely weak when the market turns bearish and it is a lot more difficult to hodl then. Another problem is that many unpredictable things can happen in your life which will require that you have money on hand. In both cases you don't have any safety margin and you risk selling at a very bad time and at a loss.
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:42:48
If you had been accumulating for several weeks/months and you're now OK with the price rising, you would make your final buy in one big chunk so that everybody knows that bear market is officially over.

The Presses universitaires de France just published a little book call Cryptocommunism by Mark Alizart. It's very interesting as it brings a different perspective on many things, I think it could be of interest even to strongly opinionated right wing libertarians.
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:04:00
I don't see any contradiction here. High value transactions don't have to be bigger in size than low value transactions. 
It's not that we want transactions to be big (high value) but that they will become bigger and bigger as fees raise. Fees raise as the number of queued transactions raise. High fees have the advantage of paying the minors for their work when the block subsidy will become too low, but that's a long time away. 
Full nodes which are cheap to run will exist in far greater number than full nodes expensive to run, they will be also a lot more diverse (individuals, small or large businesses, localization, etc.). That makes for a highly decentralized network which makes for the crucial censorship resistance feature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:29:41
Nice to see that you remain very open minded.
I don't know if BTC is already too big to fail, it's a question I ask myself often. We're certainly not insignificant anymore and benefit aleady from a strong network effect, especially compared to altcoins. I think BTC is big enough that it will probably remain the most important crypto coin for the forseeable future but I'm not sure we're there yet in the grand scheme of things.
Bitcoin certainly has reinforcing properties and has been behaving as a self-fulfilling prophecy - there will be a time when it will be unstoppable - but I would say we need some more good years to be sure. Maybe in two halvenings (2024).

You must really switch your perspective to long term or you're going to be very unhappy and make big mistakes...
This year the block reward for LTC miners is going to be divided by 2, which means half the amount of new coins will be produced which means less sell pressure which has always meant far greater prices some time before or after the event. 2020 will be BTC's halving year.

The consensus is that both work great and that you can choose whichever you prefer.

It is commonly estimated that between 1.5 and 4 millions are lost forever but that the loss rate is now very low compared to the early days (since they are lot more valuable now). Hacking and thefts still happen often but stolen BTCs are obviously not lost for everyone ;)
I would say it's not a problem at all now and for the foreseeable future, it just increases the value of the remaining coins and more decimals could be added if one day that was necessary.

There's of course greed, speculation and manipulation which is the case everytime humans compete for ressources and value, there's however a lot more to it than that and it looks like you didn't spend enough time studying it in order to get the real big picture. 
Anyway the only thing I wanted to tell you is that it's not a zero-sum game in which one person takes the money from another with at the end a few winners and many loosers. The Bitcoin market is an open system, i.e. value is drawn from the outside world into it, mainly from fiat money printed like crazy in the context of quantitive easing programs. On the long term, Bitcoin marketcap has been continually increasing and there has been many more winners than loosers. On a global scale though, it is very possible that traditional finance people will see their revenue decrease because of it but it would be a logical consequence of their inability to adapt.
@_date: 2019-04-11 06:11:11

Very very few security issues and that's surprising since it's such a young technology. Some guy lost a small amount early on because he published an old channel state by mistake after a backup recovery. A clean solution to this is almost released. 
Otherwise yes, the bigger the payment, the bigger the probability it will fail because of a lack of liquidity in the in between channels. But this is not a security issue, the payment fails but no fund is lost.
@_date: 2019-04-29 19:25:09

@_date: 2019-04-14 22:49:58
Sorry but I don't understand your reasoning, it's an incentive to buy not the opposite. There are few but they're still cheap enough for most people to buy something which may become very significant. Late adopters will have no choice but to follow in order to be able to transact. 
And it:s extremely highly divisible so everybody will of course be able to have some, just not at all the same amount at the same price.
@_date: 2019-04-21 08:55:43
The main purpose of mining is to secure the network
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:05:42
People have been intensively buying and selling Bitcoin for many years and will continue to do so, adoption doesn't have to happen before a given proportion has been mined.
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:22:50
On a third layer, Channel Factories will probably be able to open thousands of channels using one onchain transaction. That will have to be integrated into the wallet and transparent to the end-user obviously.
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:50:39
I think opening will be done economically enough, even in such a context, using channel factories and there won't be many reasons to close. The only one I see is when someone would have tried to publish an older state but in that case the high fees will also disincentivize this behavior.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:38:19
Would you be interested in having gold only if it had just been mined? 
For Bitcoin, the important point is that it is still extremely early, less than 1% of the world population have some. And there never will be enough for every current millionaire in USD to hold even one whole BTC. 
Of course it's risky, no reward without risk, but here the risk/reward ratio is extremely favorable compared to every other existing investment opportunity, that's my view anyway.

Thanks for your answer, I've already bought some and will certainly buy more. 
It's not that I'm obsessed with the short-term price but it's been already almost three months that we're going down and I'm beginning to worry that people may soon start to give up on it, because the narrative is not as glorious as last year... That's why I'm looking forward for it to stabilize and start climbing again, maybe at a slower pace than last year.

I see it as the main weak point of the system, hope to be wrong. 
At the time of the Segwit2X attack, I was very worried that our chain would be halted by miners leaving to the S2X fork and the difficulty never able to lower because of those 2016 blocks to mine first. A new difficulty adjustment algorithm could have been implemented (had LukeJr something ready maybe ?) but it would have been a huge mess...

No hype (not interested in short-term price), just the way I see it. And, that's right, my surprise that this event is underestimated by many people.
LN has been developed for years by different teams which have always been very careful not to rush things but do them right. It is being tested for several months by hundreds of people, on testnet and even on mainnet without the developers' approval. And now we have this release which is the first to be officialy mainnet and real-life ready, i.e. for general usage, the only limitation is on the max amount per channel (still several hundreds $).
Of course it is still very young, much work still has to be done on the user interfaces for example and to develop the network itself, alts won't start disappearing immediately. 
But the fact that these very conservative developers release it for mainnet represents a very big milestone, the most important hurdles have been passed. And since it's a technology which has the potential to transform the whole crpyto-economy, this should be huge news to everybody. I think that bias may lie in the unwillingness to acknowledge it.

1800 new coins are created and sold everyday by miners, of course there is demand otherwise the price would be 0.
What we know for sure is that, even if demand remains stagnant, the price will rise in the coming year with the decreasing supply.

Let me first tell you that I respect your concerns very much but... No, I think that in the first place he should not have been given the control of this money, at least not alone. Decentralization (another Bitcoin value) of the political power is very important (and I must say it works great in my country, Switzerland, even if everything is a bit slow because of it).
But these ideas are all very much connected IMHO. One could say the venezuelan people should not have trusted him to manage their money.

So what is the price of something for which there's absolutely no demand ? Maybe not zero, but tending towards zero if you prefer.


Now that's something else.
Either way if demand (from adoption or speculation) remains constant in the coming years, the price will rise due to decreasing supply.

@_date: 2018-03-23 06:43:14
You should research it, it is extremely important for the price.
Every four years, the miner's reward is divided by 2. It is now 12.5 BTC per block and it will be 6.25 in 2020, we're approx. at 5% inflation rate and will be at 2.5%. Moon !

Censorship resistance is a lot more important than fee level. With a large block increase, fees would decrease but the whole value of the network and currency would crash to Oblivion because it would have completely lost its purpose. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:39:28
We don't know much about present and future demand, I can agree with that. 
What you don't seem to integrate is that, due to the peculiar Bitcoin rules, we know something about the other part of the equation, supply, and that is very significant. Decreasing supply is not a guarantee of anything but should absolutely be taken into account in the reasoning. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:10:24
Doubling in 10 months = recovering slightly ? Sure.
You tried to establish a link between low price and low number of transactions. Yet, in March, price was 8-10K with 150K tx, now it's 3.5-4K with 300K tx : welcome to my black list.

I did not check your comments history and will assume good faith.
It's just that you would not need to open a channel for that but simply use one of your pre-existing ones ; and it should not be very complex to implement thanks to the already available APIs.
I get your point that these service are already cheap and that "streaming" fees may not be very useful ; but on-chain tx fees may not always stay low, thus it would make sense not having to spend several bucks on the fees for a 1$ purchase.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:08:17
Of course you can always find times when you should have waited, but that is impossible to predict (unless you have specific information, which is very doubtful).
But it is mitigated by your other buys, in the long term you win.
I believe in Bitcoin fundamentals and therefore that it is at every time a little bit more probable for it to go up that down.

Hi there,
I said "private individual" because it is true that, if you're considered a professional trader, you'll have to declare your gains as a revenue and pay the corresponding income tax. But it's not true at all that you'll be considered a professional if you hodl for a long time, it's the opposite : 
\-you won't be considered a professional if you bought at least 6 months before selling.
There can be some additional conditions, depending on the cantonal administration in charge of your file, related to the total volume of transactions relative to your gains ; and if you're not a professional and not retired, you must have other sources of income. Unless you have negotiated, as a wealthy foreigner, a special agreement with them.
Personally I have mentioned the number and value of my Bitcoins in my last tax form, it was accepted without any question and I didn't have to pay any income tax on them.
I can try to answer other questions if you need.

The blockchain space is precious ; it is expensive for node's owners to maintain a huge blockchain and therefore its size directly impacts the network's decentralization (as small nodes'owners will have to stop if it gets too big).
Mining fees ensure through competition that only the most important transactions find their way to the blockchain and not big chunks of random data that are unhealthy for the network and Bitcoin's future.

Because of fierce competition, they have to sell almost everything in order to pay the electricity bill and keep running, after the halvening there will be even more pressure to sell everything whatever the price. If the price is not high enough, they will have to downscale, difficulty will then drop and a new equilibrium where they can be profitable again will be reached.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:13:45
Thanks for your answer. I agree that time locks are not perfect but it is also very optimistic to consider that having a decoy wallet will protect at least half of what you have ; if you imagine they are competent enough to wait several years and engage in a tx's fees bumping race with you, they would also certainly know that Ledger and Trezor have a secondary wallet option and make you unlock it. BTW the two tactics could probably be combined.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:56:37
Of course! I'm a big believer in the huge effect that the halvening will have on price through the reduction of new supply dumped on the market. 
It's just that I think it's not correct to say that what will happen is that miners will refuse to sell at low prices because they'll receive less coins ; they will be forced to sell even more than now but it doesn't matter much because they'll receive only 6.25 and already have to sell most of them therefore can't have big reserves to dump.

Yes, many people here. But not me though as I lost everything in an unfortunate boating incident.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:42:06
Yes, completely agree. On my side I entered the game in 2013, 100% BTC of course. In 2017 bought some coins of another big chain, "just in-case" and after that a speaker I appreciated for a long time (Andreas) talked positively about it. And last year I bought some other coins behind a decentralized stable coin because it was supposed to be the "stable coins" year.
But at the beginning of 2019 I bought a new chunk of BTCs and it definitely feels a lot better than owning those other things. They represent less than 10% of my BTC but I often wonder if I shouldn't liquidate all these in order to have more of the only truly decentralized, long-lasting and scarce asset.

I don't understand what you mean here. Everyday 1800 new BTCs are created and we know most of them are sold very fast because of fierce competition among miners, this represents 3.9% inflation rate. In May 2020, this will fall to sub 2% with 900 new BTCs every day. This is all we need to know IMHO.
Why would the cost of mining 1 BTC would anchor the price ?
When the price of gold goes up, so does the production because it becomes lucrative to mine more or in less efficient mines, this new supply effectively "anchors" the price somewhat. But this is not the case with Bitcoin since the difficulty adjustment mechanism negates this phenomenon. Thus mining will follow price and not the opposite. Am I missing something ?

I think it's great and the chosen perspective, scarcity/digital gold/stf ratio, is one of my favorite. 
You say "better money" but have only compared it to minerals, not the type of money we're really using now : fiat. I would just add something about fiat, the fact that it's not scarce at all, is currently "printed" like crazy, the dangers of inflation and the huge debt being created in connection to it. 
Ideally you would put it on a server somewhere for other people to download, translate, etc.

I hate it when I'm very insistent, this will be my last comment. Thanks for being a kind and open-minded contributor.


Because demand exceeds supply (people selling their bags+new coins), on this I'm sure we can agree. But with Bitcoin, mining capacity doesn't matter as the influx of new coins is fixed.


The spike will increase mining costs proportionally anyway, thus no reason price will want to revert on this basis.


BTC is indeed governed by supply and demand, it's just that mining cost has nothing to do with it, it's just a consequence of it. The reason is this :
Bitcoin is unlike any market because it has no elasticity of supply, i.e. an increase in price cannot trigger an increase in supply because of the difficulty adjustment algorithm, that's what I tried to explain in my first message comparing it to gold. A consequence of this property is that current mining cost doesn't matter. [Saifedean Ammous]( explains it a lot better than I do.


I would say that, since we know supply of new coins (mining) stays constant (until next halving), the only thing that will change the price is a change in demand. And the higher the price, the higher excess demand needs to be in order to maintain the price. After next halvening, we'll need twice as less excess demand in order to maintain price :)

OK thks, so let's imagine the price goes to $6K-$7K like you said you think it's possible, what effect could it have on the cost of mining 1 BTC ?
Miners' margin has now increased, what will they do with that ? At least a part of them will buy more hashing power in order to gain even more, thus what happens ? Difficulty increases. The miners who have not upgraded their operation now see less gains, they are incentivized to play catchup. Difficulty increases again. Now the cost of mining 1 BTC has adjusted in proportion to the Bitcoin price.
And the cycle repeats itself. Same logic on the way down. This way any price can be reached not matter the current mining cost.
All this to explain why I think that price is not determined by cost of mining but that cost of mining is determined by price.

@_date: 2019-05-19 09:03:21
There is a strong correlation because, in the case of Bitcoin and its difficulty adjusting algorithm, production cost follows price and not the opposite. 
Contrary to gold, there is not elasticity of supply in Bitcoin that's why production cost doesn't matter.

If you're able to transfer your coins, the wrench attack will most probably work on you because you'll really want to give it all to them (especially if you have a family). 
As you'll want to explain everything and help them get your coins, hidden wallets and multi-sig is not an answer and will possibly put other people in trouble.
The only good answer I found is to lock your coins in a multi-years time-locked contract, you won't be able to transfer your own coins before - let's say 4 years - thus it won't be possible for you to help them steal you.
Additional benefit : it's also a protection against yourself in the case of a pannick attack during the next bear market.

-Network effect and Lindy effect of more than 10 years of existence 
-Security through the huge current hashrate and multi-years cumulated computing power
-History of resistance to all kinds of attacks, resilience and anti-fragility

Some points :
* The mempool is healthy at the moment, similar to very early 2017
* We stil have a lot to gain with Segwit, 60% txs are still not Segwit and people will be incentivized to use it as fees rise
* There is no reason for exchanges to pause trading when the mempool is saturated, maybe withdrawals ;  they now have the Liquid sidechain
* We could very well have a very high BTC price with only high value transactions on-chain, that's the reserve currency scenario
* Second layer technology is developing rapidly (e.g. LN) as well as first layer optimization proposals
