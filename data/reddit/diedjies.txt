np, I didn't panic sell. D: I'm actually trying to do some daytrading with a small sum seperate from my other bitcoins. I thought the first dip was going to be it, then shit got wild. Lesson learned. ;-)

To bad I missed it, bought some when it came up again at 1040$.

EUR has lost a lot of value lately due to the ECB trying to keep intrest rates low by mass buying bonds.

They also give out unlimited cheap loans to banks, forgot to mention that.

I should more bitcoin.

If it follows the trend of 2013-14, we're going back to $500! Cheap coins please.

I don't think it will dip that low due to the steady uptrend we had compared to the insane boost of the last bubble.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:13:04
I thought the dip was reached around 11am CET this morning so bought at $1040. Went up to $1100 again and was going up and down for about an hour and then boom. Tradingview chat was hilarious.
Not panic selling since I'm certain it will go back up again, but at a slower pace.

Times are looking good again for us HODLers who bought in during the bubble hype.

I believe there is correlation between the bitcoin price and the amount of maymays on @_date: 2015-11-12 16:45:14

I heard you can buy tendies with BTC.

Its a popular budget formula mostly used by younger people, but its not one of the bigger telecom companies. They often do catch on to new trends before the bigger companies.

Mind giving his Localbitcoins name in PM? I also trade with a few dutchmen.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:31:31
Its obvious they are trying to find someone who has made a large sum with bitcoin for sansationalism. Absolutely no intrest in future possibilities of bitcoin.  Thats to be expected of Telefacts. I hope VRT will do a more informative piece in the future.

Wait untill the avalanche stops, then buy buy buy!
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:22:48
