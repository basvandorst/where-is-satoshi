Testnet miners have no financial incentive to mine the valid chain over the invalid chain so it will take longer for the chainsplit to resolve than it would on Main net.  Interesting to people who like like you or me, but not scary.  Traveling the world is fun and gets regular people’s creativity flowing.

I believe a chainsplit would occur leading to a blockchain reorganization.  Any miner who fails to upgrade may lose $80k or more worth of miner rewards if they mine an invalid chain.  If there is signs of active risk, some exchanges may increase block confirmation requirements on a temporary basis, making users wait more than 6 confirmations to access deposited money.  Uncertainty tends to drive price down, at least on a temporary basis until the issue is perceived to be resolved.

That's the funny thing about history.  If bitcoin ends up being big, history will decide it took down Hillary.  Otherwise something else.
If the markets crashed in early 2017, it would have been because of Trump.  If markets crashed in 2018, it would have been because of tariffs.  If markets crash in 2019, it will be because of xyz going on.
Humans have amazing ability to tape and glue whatever pieces they are given together in order to create a tapestry of -whatever-.  We see it everyday with 'journalists' trying to explain why bitcoins price goes up and down.  
But can we really blame them?  They are news people.  Everything looks like a nail when you are a hammer.  For me, a trader, everything is worth a grain of salt.  No one event is explainable, all we can do is attempt to identify trends, assess statistics, and act rationally.  Everything may or may not be a lie, it doesn't really matter if its a lie or not, what matters is we realize we do not know and we find a margin in what little knowledge we have.  Maybe my work has brought me too far in the opposite direction of the news people, but I prefer it here.  Less hateful and partisan.

In order for an attack to work, an attacking block must be mined, which cost the attacker $80,000.  Then other miners have to fail to notice the invalid block and continue to mine on top of it. 
Doesn't matter that some nodes would propagate a bad block.  Miners wouldn't continue the invalid chain.  No party would attempt an attack and risk $80,000.
Nodes will take a while to update because they have no incentive/risk/money on the line that drives them.  They are driven by love of BTC.

There’s a few Supreme Court rulings that say otherwise, but we are still waiting for a definitive ruling regarding online social media giants.
Edit: details: Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946), US Supreme Court PACKINGHAM v. NORTH CAROLINA, Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins all point towards freedom of speech being a protected right on major social media websites, ie TWTR YOUTUBE and FACEBOOK. Will likely get ruling in next 5 years, so can’t say for sure, but looks good for free speech advocates.
Consensus in Supreme Court is freedom of speech is protected in places where strangers gather, not only in places owned by the government.  Especially when there is no reasonable alternative place to speak.

Mining an invalid block that would be orphaned would only serve to show BTC is safe.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:19:20
Core 1.5.X would not know the blocks are invalid because Core 1.5.X is bugged.  So when the malicious miner mines the block (which cost them ~$80k to do) Core 1.5.X would think the block is valid at first (it is not a valid block, but the bugged client would not realize this).  
Other miners are not running Core 1.5.X so they would not build on that block.  Other miners ignore the bad block. 
 A longer chain would be created ~20 minutes later, and the Core 1.5.X client would switch to the longest valid chain.  Attacker would lose ~$80k.
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:25:53
I disagree.  Too many miners have already updated.  A fork may happen if someone wishes to forfeit 80,000$ but miners who have not upgraded would immediately do so as they don’t wish to waste profits on invalid chain.  Unlike testnet, which is not profit driven mining (testnets zero incentive mining is not representative of bitcoin).  It’s amazing how different things play out when thousands of dollars are on the line, suddenly miners accountability goes way up.

From what we can see the 1994 gay bomb was all incorrect.  Other conspiracy theories about the U.S. military experiments have been correct in the past, some that sounded just as crazy as a gay bomb.
There's nothing wrong with people having private media companies that host conspiracy theories.  I think its very mind opening to think out of the box and question everything coming from big government and big corporations.  People should keep their minds open and listen with healthy skepticism.
If that means some people sit around and humor the idea of a 'gay bomb', then thats OK with me.  Honestly there is something real to the gay frog stuff, indirectly.  Modern chemicals, common prescription medications, diet, lack of exercise, obesity, is having a real effect on the human body.  Male infertility is up.  Our observable behavior has been modified.  There is a lot to be studied about this stuff.  No gay bombs, but the train of thought is interesting to me and I wish more people would think about it.
Paypal is shit company, I knew already, not surprised they'd censor Alex Jones, along with Google, Facebook, Twitter.  Paypal had an opportunity to be the new payment network.  They could have replaced credit cards.  Huge early mover advantage during the tech boom.  They totally fell flat on their faces.  I thank them for that, because it really has left a big wide open gap for bitcoin &amp; the lightning network.
One right that U.S. citizens have always had is the right for people to go to places of public gathering and speak their mind, even if that public gathering place is privately owned.  This is good and bad of course, it has allowed for great social changes and exposing wrongs and making our country better.  Also it is the reason weirdo crazy people can stand on a box and yell as you try to walk by and ignore them the best you can.  The internet is now the city and google, facebook, and twitter are the town squares.  All 3 companies lean to one side of political spectrum.  The rights of the opposition is at risk.

Yes mimblewimble brings a lot of obfuscation to the table.  If someone were taking advantage of an inflation bug you could not review the block chain and see what was happening.  There would probably be a debate about if it was happening at all.
Well at the least, grin will make a good, lasting coin to live alongside bitcoin.  If shit goes down in Bitcoin (ie major social attack and blacklisting of 'dirty' wallets) we will be able to turn to girn.  But what I and others really want is mimblewimble to come to Bitcoin.  I believe there are some methods it could be brought to bitcoin as teir 2 still, like a sidechain perhaps.  I am not super knowledgeable about this.

That chart is really misleading, I did an assessment of short and long data compared to price very recently and it looks nothing like that.  I'm sorry I believe I posted it to somewhere other than reddit but it may be in my history.
Just because it lines up 1 time on a small timeframe doesn't mean it'll happen again like that.
If there were such an easy way to trade bitcoin based on short and long data I would have implemented it in my trading bot a long time ago along with many other traders until the easy play stops being profitable.
People like this chart because it makes logical sense and seems clever but easy to understand and that sort of confidence can be very harmful for a beginning trader.
Trading can be simple to some extent (ie you don't need to load in a hundred indicators and somehow combine them into a strategy) and make logical sense but fore and foremost should be based on risk management, which is what this chart fails to convey.

Coinshares are basically trading by betting against the people buying CXBTC when they feel like it or if they don't feel like betting against their customers they can actually buy the BTC.  The company decides.  Most likely they have volatility bots trying to skim a profit between the customers purchase price and the actual price they are getting.
Oh and if the company fucks up and goes bankrupt or gets hacked then you lose your $$.

I can't speak to stacked stop orders because I don't have the data, but it doesn't have to be stop orders.  Regular people who are sick of watching their investment disappear will panic sell if we start moving down fast again.  It doesn't have to be shorters, it can be some shorters + 'dumb money'.  I quote it because there is nothing dumb about securing profits or dropping a losing investment- I just recommend against regular people actively trading their long term investments.  Studies show new investors tend to over trade, especially young men.
There is more support in the 4k range, everyone knows it, so the question is are we going to go down and touch that or not?  
Knowing the answer is impossible, but statistically large triangles tend to continue the trend and that would mean a break downward leading to &lt;4.5k.  Bulkowski data shows 64% chance of breakdown.  This is based on historical stock market data, so you must assume BTC patterns behave like the stock market.  For a trader, if you wish to long or short, carefully enter your position and risk off a major level.  Have a plan for where you are willing to take a loss if the price goes against you.
The other thing I think folk on should know is the longer we go sideways the more bullish things become.  Time is on BTC's side.  There's a lot of development, stuff coming out, good fundementals that I am following and taking a small role in as a programmer myself.  BTC is deflationary and we have another 1.5 to the halvening.  Sideways is bullish.  We all love BTC and we love it for more than its price :-)

Not so many working-class vegans.
I started as the poor ass kind and somehow ended up the rich ass kind (hint: see subreddit we are talking about veganism on right now).

Bitcoin's value crashed, but it's deflationary status has remained the same.  Inflation of bitcoin has remained the same 100% of its lifespan, past, present, future.  By definition, Bitcoin will never inflate like the Bolivar did.  That is why Bitcoin will retain its value even through its boom and bust cycles.  That is why **every time bitcoin crashed, it stayed above its previous lows, and continued to be worth more on a long-term timeframe**.  The same cannot be said about any fiat currency.
Fiat is doomed to move towards $0 value long term because it is inflationary and the rate of inflation is decided by government or central authority.  That government could be benign for 100 years, but if it becomes morally corrupt or is pressured to increase inflation even 1 year out of that 100, it will move closer to failure.  Bitcoin cannot do that.

Technical analysis should be for finding places where risk vs reward warrants a trade, not to predict future price.  At any given time, most traders have no idea what price will do, but they watch anyway, and when that one tiny moment comes where the risk reward falls into place, that is when they take their trade.  Over time they will see wins and loses, but if their strategy works and they do not over-extend their capital then they will have created a career.
A lot of career traders will watch 50-100 tickers a day and only take 5-20 trades a year (253 tradable days a year).  If they execute 10 trades a year and look at 25,300 charts a year, they've only found risk/reward for a trade 1/2,530 times they look at a chart.  So they really only have an opinion about what a price is going to do about 0.4% of the time.  And they can make a profit if they are right 60% of the time, so much of that 0.4% they are still wrong.  And they make profit.  That is real trading.  Not very glamorous compared to what TV, youtube, and twitter feeds the public.
People who post predictions to their twitter or youtube shows are not traders, they are infotainment providers.  You are their product and source of income, not trading.  Your goal should be to find honest traders who are looking to discuss strategies and news with other traders without pomposity/egotism, or financial incentive- some exist on twitter, and I recommend WhalePool teamspeak.
Since every trade has both a buyer and seller, then yes, if you take an aggregate of what people's opinions are at any given moment, then the current price is the 'correct price'.  This is by definition how markets work.  Society as a whole will not be able to tell you which direction the price will move next.  If society agreed which direction the price is moving then the price would instantly move there until agreement no longer exists.
So markets by definition find the price that matches society's opinion as a whole.  The exception can be found on shorter timeframes.  When news first breaks (especially insider news) and during times of low liquidity (high volatility), the price sometimes does not adequately reflect societies opinion (or common sense).  This is why volatility is typically a traders friend, when liquidity is low the trader can come in and provide liquidity in return for getting a 'good price'.  A more obvious example of this is arbitrage in bitcoin.

Scaling Bitcoin 2018 "Kaizen"_day1_Part2
starts at 1:02:00
Forward Blocks: On-chain/Settlement Capacity Increases Without the Hard-fork
PRESENTER:Mark Friedenbach
@_date: 2018-10-06 07:37:35
This article never discusses the technology.  The talk referenced can be found on YouTube video "Scaling Bitcoin 2018 "Kaizen"_day1_Part2".  It is 30 minutes long and starts at 1:02:00.
It was just uploaded and has a grand total of 124 views right now.  It will take time for people to find the material...  but also very long to process the concept of "Forward Blocks".  
Edit:  Some thoughts after watching the video:
These changes are much more complex than segwit or anything that's been done before.
His idea of forward blocks should be considered separate from his other ideas... although he talks about them together. His ideas include sharding (wants 28 forward chains), proposed changes to the miner rewards (he wants to replace halvening with slow change over time to eliminate the 'event'), flexcap for block sizes (he wants to allow miners to change their proof of work target and in doing so increase or decrease size of block in a manner that would incentivize 'good block size').  So a lot of very ambitious ideas here that probably don't belong on BTC, at least not until they have been applied to litecoin and other altcoins.
It's a neat idea, hard to know if it can work right now, but sounds interesting.  It more complicated than I would like on Tier 1 BTC, and it breaks in-use functionality of bitcoin, such as time-locking (because the compatibility chain would be mined at faster than 10 minutes using a bug, and the forward chain would be mined slower than 10 minutes to 'increase security').  
Just that fact that he is exploiting a bug to manipulate the legacy chain into keeping up with the forward chain is grounds to say this is an attack...  And there are other things about his idea that make it sound like an attack.  
Personally I think any large change to BTC should be considered a potential attack, even if it does not involve exploit bugs, forks, and changes to the base protocol.  Especially after recent events where we found out bugs were introduced during very small code upgrades.  Imagine what a bad actor could sneak into a big upgrade like this.  If a change is adopted on other coins first, such as LTC, for very long periods, it is more palatable.

I first bought in 2011, just $20 messing around.  No sacrifice.
When I graduated school in 2014, I knew I wanted to buy a lot of BTC so i put my $210k student loans on graduated payment plan (barely paying interest).
I started working 6-7 days a week.  My claim to fame is August 2015 when I worked every day of that month.  I lived in a $500/mo place for 3 years (very difficult in california!!), and I lived lean in my regular expenditures.  I drove a car that broke down on me regularly (I counted 7 times in 2016, the year I finally replaced it).  I would (and still do) religiously keep an excel sheet with my BTC, monthly income towards savings, and my Net Worth.
Since then I have sold a lot of BTC for real estate.  I have a blessed life now.  As a true believer, I still feel driven to accumulate, but I don't work full time anymore.

Most likely: mining will become less profitable and stop occurring on one side of the firewall (Russia).  Transactions will become less reliable on that “bad” side of the firewall and require more time to confirm.
Alts without satellite infrastructure or with blocks that are large or frequent will have the same issues but much worse.

They are paying 1-3% gross profits to credit card companies.  They want something like bitcoin to replace credit cards.
But they don’t want to be the first to spend the money integrating bitcoin payments, lightning bitcoin payments, keeping it updated, figuring out security, figuring out taxes.  There’s close to zero demand.  The intermediaries that can make it easier aren’t well established or trusted.  The biggest companies have better deals with credit card companies and don’t pay the full 3% credit card fee that mom and pops do thus the status quo gives them an advantage.  Adding bitcoin may only serve to anger their banking partners (in theory, although right now things are so early that it probably wouldn’t matter).
But IMO the biggest problem is, the users are still struggling to use bitcoin, so it could cause failure to purchase at check out.  There aren’t public stats on this yet for bitcoin, but companies can see how many users go to check out with a cart of products and then fail to finalize the purchase.  I would guess failure rate would be higher with bitcoin as people are still not familiar with its exact use.  That is very bad for business.

No libertarian wants open borders with the sort of social benefits we are giving out now.  If there are some who are willing to compromise and give in to the dems thinking they will get anything in return then they are fools...  Open the borders and the dems will only have more power to increase social benefits.  They would never give libertarians anything in return for working with them on the border.  Opening the border will only stop them from any chance of a libertarian government.
There are a ton of libertarians who vote republican mostly because they think the libertarian party is ineffectual and cannot win.  The democrats have gone so far to the left that the republicans has consumed much of the center and become more populist.
Libertarians believe in social freedoms, but many libertarians believe in classic racial freedoms, ala MLK: "a person should be judged on the content of their character not the color of their skin", and reject neo-liberal programs that seek to designate a minority hierarchy, such as affirmative action and intersectionality.  Gays are allowed to be married, blacks are free, women are allowed to vote.  Social freedom has 'been won' on many fronts in the last few decades.  Many libertarians have turned their eyes on economic freedoms and they think the republican party and Trump represents them much better than Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or Joe Biden.

Here go argue with these people who called me an idiot for being skeptical that it is directly pegged:
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:23:54
They never announced what cost they will provide for it compared to any one currency.  They just announced they will provide a buy/sell price for several currencies.  The fact it isn’t pegged to one currency guarantees the price will not sit at .99-1.01 because currencies are always changing in value relative to each other.
They might start with cost of 0.10$ and slowly change it to 1.00$ next year, and so on, to mimic the appearance of gain in value, although FB would be the absolute market maker or “central bank of libra”.  This will work as long as there isn’t too many people selling and they don’t increase value too quickly.  FB has so much cash stored they could handle a sell run on Libra.  
They will say libra is backed by real assets, but they didn’t say if it will be 100% backed or if it will be fractional reserve.  Probably the latter, because people **don’t care**, and all that matters is the superficial appearance.
Government should be scared by this but politicians and banksters will be lobbied and bribed by the conglomerate.

Well written.  I was supporter of USAF and No2x.
But now I ask when2x?  The community should be discussing a timeline for increasing block size, voicing when they think it is necessary in terms of fees and time, and methodology (soft fork block size increase?).  I hope someday consensus is reached and blocksize can be increased responsibly to match the bandwidth and computing power increase that we have seen since 2009 and keep bitcoin open for use by regular people during its early adoption phase (which we are still in).
But I cant help but feel even if there were consensus and the community wanted a blocksize increase, it could not happen, because enemies of bitcoin would astroturf a controversy to prevent consensus.
I remember paying $50 fee twice during the peak of fees and price bubble.  I want there to be discussion and early stage consensus before this happens again.

We've shown that hard forks are stoppable even when there is much force behind them.  This is good but also potentially harmful.  If the community ever wishes there to be a hard fork, enemies of bitcoin may use astroturfing and fake controversy to stop us.  Consensus is hard to detect when there are bad actors with deep pockets who want to destroy the project all together.
So we won this time, but at what cost?  We have not laid the groundwork at all specifying under what circumstances the community would support a hard fork.  This should be discussed now before fees rocket &gt;$50 again or even more grave circumstances happen with bugs and mining attacks.

Links to an article that describes what a 'windows moment' is, which only confirms to me that Bitcoin cannot have a 'windows moment' because windows brought something of significant value to every member of society.  Bitcoin brings a store of value and way around traditional fiat system, but &gt;60% of U.S. population lives paycheck to paycheck and doesnt have $500 to spare.  Most people won't care about bitcoin until they have to, and that is OK.

Silly but it has not risen for seven consecutive weeks on all exchanges.  The week of march 18 was red for many exchanges.
I'm a mod over at if you like this stuff join us :-)  Here are more relevant and meaningful technical indications on the 1 week chart: 
1. We have now had 62% mean reversion from the break down from the large 2018 wedge to the yearly lows (see red circle on fib level).  62% is a very common amount of mean reversion.  Mean reversion just refers to the volatility or 'bounce' that stocks experience while trending.  So if BTC is trending downward it will still see occasional bounces upward, often 62% of local lows and highs.
2. Volume has spiked on the weekly last week but it still does not amount to large amount of volume from our last movement down.  (see red horizontal line on volume).  Lower volume indicates that our move up is simple mean reversion and not driven by changes in the market.
3. Tom Demark (TD) Sequential shows a bearish TD9 on the close of last weeks candle.  This is circled along the bottom.  I always take TD Sequential with a grain of salt but a lot of traders, especially crypto traders, really like it.  They believe TD 9 and TD 13 are both significant.  9 means that we have gone 9 weeks without a candle closing below the candle 4 weeks previous to it.  In other words, its been a while since we've seen a pullback and we are now 'overdue' for a pullback.

Bitcoin needs to make non-consensus-breaking changes.
Your immediate assumption that bitcoin cannot increase block size without making 'consensus breaking changes' is trolling at best, arguably malevolent.  You immediately dismiss any changes to the protocol as 'consensus breaking', as if you are the only member of the community.  If fees jumped to &gt;$1000 tomorrow you would still consider a block size increase to be a 'consensus breaking hard fork'.  If the entire community except for you thought we needed larger block sizes, would it be 'consensus breaking' to you?
Consensus to me means general agreement in the community.  It doesn't mean making every kid with an opinion happy.

Well that is dumb.  If fees were &gt;$1000 tomorrow then bitcoin is at huge risk being replaced by an altcoin that has bigger blocks.  Users do not want to pay &gt;$50 to put a transaction on the chain when bitcoin is still in its infancy.  It will create a huge distaste for bitcoin.  Enemies of bitcoin would love to separate the community across many altcoins and destroy bitcoin dominance in the cryptomarket.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:29:40
He critiques both, just in separate videos.
He would probably say we need multiple scaling solutions (unless a new magical perfect one were to appear), and slight increase to block size would be very good if consensus could be reached to prevent forking.
Consensus seems impossible now; even if whole community were on board enemies of BTC would drive artificial controversy to delay and prevent consensus.
@_date: 2019-04-26 06:39:08
I think that we need to keep fees below $50 at least until Bitcoin is understood and accepted globally.  We are in such an early phase right now, most people have no idea how to use or what bitcoin is.  Biggest threat is bitcoin losing dominance to an altcoin.  Bitcoin is so wonderfully decentralized, almost any altcoin taking lead over it will harm and split the movement.

Bcash is an altcoin forked from Bitcoin.  There was nowhere near consensus and anyone who says Bcash is Bitcoin is a scammer and a liar.  Bcash is not bitcoin because it did not have consensus, not because it doesn't adhere to the exact protocol standards that Satoshi hard coded into ver 1.  I feel it is very disingenuous for you to try and paint me as someone associated with or in support of Bcash or the scammers behind it.  I made it clear in my OP that I did not support a blocksize increase during that time.
In 2010 Bitcoin implemented an upgrade that required a hard fork, CVE-2010-5139.  It was successfully executed without breaking consensus despite being a hard fork that does not adhere to original protocol.
In 2013 Bitcoin miner running 0.8.0 mined a block incompatible with Bitcoin 0.7.0, creating a hard fork.  Consensus was that both chains were Bitcoin, and the community came together to reorg the chains back together despite 0.8.0 not adhering to original protocol.
These are examples of hard upgrades that were successfully executed with consensus.  Some of the top Bitcoin devs, including Satoshi, have voiced that upgrades requiring hard fork are possible, including block size increase, if community consensus is present.  Even devs who are strongly against blocksize increase, like LukeJr, believe strongly that updates requiring hard forks can and should be used in other situations.  LukeJr believes that a hard fork changing the hashing algo away from basic sha256 may be necessary to assert control over miners who manipulate BTC or harm the community.
So under what situation do you believe increasing block size would be appropriate, ?

You overestimate our ability to seperate dirty and clean coin.  Coinbase will take a little dirty coin if it’s mixed with mostly clean, as would anyone else.  
Most people depositing dirty coins are innocent.  Only FBI or other powerful investigative agency probably has the resources and time to track back dirty coins at all.  It’s more likely to start with a knock of the door of a KYCed Coinbase customer than with some high tech means.
The best thing for the community is to keep BTC fungible.  That means taking all coins right now and supporting upgrades like lightning and Mimblewimble that improve fungibility.  Bad experiences with dirty coins can interrupt and complicate the economy.

Big government creating fiat and stealing from tax payers to line corrupt politician pockets is both the reason we need bitcoin and it is what will drive bitcoin to greatness.  Socialism represents that evil much better than Trump's conservative populism.  
It is trumps deficit and excess spending that will drive Bitcoin to greatness, not his interest in re-negotiating trade agreements.

Yeah you actually poked right at the beast here, this is the dream that I mentioned.  This is what I 'always wanted' growing up.  I used to spend **all** my free time making games when I was in HS and college.  Now it just doesn't sound appealing because 1. I took 6 months off work last year to make games, and I found I wasted more time on youtube, etc than I did working on my projects. Luckily I didn't start throwing money at it, it was more 'exploratory'.  2. I feel like I cant succeed and make real money making games because I am not good enough, dont have good enough ideas, and the market is too saturated.  and 3. I don't even really want to make games because I hate who I am when I am programming, I wasted the best years of my life programming when I should have been making friends and living life in the real world, and I honestly believe video games are horrible in that they are used as tool in an epidemic of self destruction by a massive amount of young men, including myself (formerly), friends, family.  I actually have 4 different journal entries over the last 10 years where I swear off programming and say that it is horrible for me... excerpt: "Programming is really an escape for me it is not a true passion or love. When I program I am a loser.  I don’t work out, I don’t take care of the people in my life, I don’t feel good about myself, I don’t look good.  I feel terrible."  The indie game company sounded great in my mind until I had to face the reality of actually going through with it.  I'm just glad I didn't throw 1-2 million $ at it.

2017 He is going on and on about how great bitcoin is and its the future and hes so proud i bought it, I tell him that market is irrational and it looks like its about to pull back and there are serious hurdles to get over before bitcoin can be big and im thinking long term &gt;10 years its great but right now its crazy irrational.  I try to explain to him how it works and the pros and cons of BTC and he still doesnt want to hear it, all he knows is that he knows its the future!

The momentum has really taken me off guard.  I wonder if we are seeing some insiders getting in before a SEC announcement.  Two months ago the SEC extended its deadlines to approve or deny the Bitwise and VanEck bitcoin ETF proposals to May 16 and May 21.  The US gov just got their thumb firmly over Bitfinex, an issue that was raised with Bitcoin ETF at a previous meeting.  I’m still skeptical that they will approve the ETFs, because they are allowed to delay until October, but even if they use pro-ETF vocabulary it could be bullish and current buying could be insiders.
Or there are just a lot of people who don’t want to be left out of the next big run and refuse to sit on sidelines hoping price to revert to mean.

I totally disagree.  As price approaches zero, it makes it easier and less risky for a single party to buy it up and pump it.  When the coin is more distributed across multiple parties it is harder to buy up and pump, therefore more risky, and therefore pumping as a scam is not viable option.  So the coin will need to rely completely on market forces, real demand, and real use.
Scams are a dime a dozen, and Bitcoin was cool technology and perfect to use as pump and dump.
It will be MUCH MORE of a miracle if Bitcoin reaches real adoption and thus continues to move up in price over long period.
But it will, because good people know Bitcoin is our libertarian salvation from totalitarian fiat and they will keep buying it.  Digital gold.

Things moving slow is a feature not a bug.  The SEC exists to put a damper on things so everyone acts more rationally, less mistakes are made, less luck of the draw, less winners/losers, more institutional control, more predictable, less uncertainty.  They aren't interested in hurrying things along because it will only paint a target on them when things go wrong.  They want to create an illusion that they are doing something, being cautious, and protecting society.  That illusion in turn creates certainty and confidence in the US Gov and US Market.

For those using older versions, there was an easy work around for this using "Special" instead of "Currency" but I'm excited to change all my excel sheets to reflect the new pull down options :-)
