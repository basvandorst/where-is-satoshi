How would they regulate bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:46:06
There already are other exchanges though no?

Can you look up this info for any address?

Isn't that really more like getting 1000 BTC and 1.6k in gold?
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:10:57
I was just going to say, could be talking about gold just as easily it seems like.

Aren't most investments actually a pyramid scheme though if you really think about it?  I mean without someone to buy it a bitcoin is definitely worthless.  It's only demand that drive up the price above 0.  Anyone who got in when bitcoins first came out is definitely benefiting more than most people right about now.  I mean check out these exchange rates:   .  Imagine if you had invested $25 say on 12/17/2009 and just left it there.  You would today have around $2.7M worth of bitcoins.

I think it is possible to buy them with a credit card but there is an extra fee.
@_date: 2013-03-17 01:36:48
What do you mean by boosting?
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:21:18
I mean I guess I see your point but I think I'd try to burn ANYTHING else.  I mean the money may be worth something again someday.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:53:35
Does this not work anymore?
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:43:16
It seems about the same as cash.
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:26:52
I thought someone just said a few days ago it had a $1 billion market cap.  What happened to that?
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:26:36
Wouldn't really be any different than money in a bank.  If they don't have electricity they can't really give you your money...
@_date: 2013-03-15 16:54:13
I think this is kind of neat but what's the point of it?

I don't think people who have sex w/ prostitutes usually get caught because of the money though do they?  I mean it's generally not something one uses a credit card for.

Why not use firewood?
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:19:44
even just part of the address?  how?
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:55:29
I never knew that.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:12:56
I don't know if I could ever feel like it's really established.  I've used it, but I think I'd always be waiting for a crash.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:22:28
If this were ever going to happen it'd be whenever bitcoin has leveled out a bit.
