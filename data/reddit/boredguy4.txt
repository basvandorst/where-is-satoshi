Your delusions? Perhaps.

So they are using their position to paralyze the economy of private innovators. Trolling, as per textbook definition. Great. That's the USA we've come to know, I guess. Saving us from ourselves by doubting our ability to sustain ourselves via means which we were competent enough to invent on our own, and by the way the very things they are borrowing from us to now inhibit us with our own innovations. Sounds like the government is pure scum and I must reiterate that I am NOT ok with any dealing with them, as I consider them terror inducers who watch our actions and exist for no other reason than to stifle naturally occurring, God-given, human ambition. Label me something, quick, before it might be conceived that I am making sense.

because Bitcoin has nothing going for it and only angry crabs who live online and dream of $100k per Bitcoin are holding onto it now, doing a great job of scaring the general public away for good.

but why does he have the coke and is a Bitcoin enthusiast? oh yea, cause druggies and Bitcoin go hand in hand. fail.

Customers don't want it, haha, funny joke. They once said the same about personal computers. Omg rofl. Yeah, you know exactly what we want, don't you? We want to be slaves, yeah. That's what we want! Slavery! Wow, do you believe me? Can't you detect sarcasm? LMFAO, here I've got a gun dare me to use it LOL we'll see whether I'm being sarcastic or not. I'll get your mind correct.

I mind it. It starts off at 15, then it'll be 40% before you know it.

Why would being fought make you a winner?
@_date: 2014-03-26 11:06:52
Of course. The government is in the business of creating burdens. Whoever doesn't realize that is nothing short of a retard.

Bitcoin does something interesting in that it proves taxation is dumb. Insomuch that taxing Bitcoin is actually exceedingly fucking hard. If you've been following, you'd know that things that happen in the Bitcoin community happen not because of government help, but because people put in their own energy and resources to make it happen. That's called innovation and government will never understand it. IRS and Bitcoin should never be friends.

Is conducting a scam really this easy?

I'm pissed off that I backed out on placing a pre-order for the first batch of miners from KnC because they never responded to my email. Yes it was a dumb question but still, a response was all I needed. I was confused about how to pay with Bitcoin.

the irony is it will be. why do I feel like the regulars on are bagholders who want an epic run to $xxx,xxx per Bitcoin so they can be filthy rich?

Great, melt the internals and contribute them to superior chip designs. Also known as recycling.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:32:59
and when a scam appears, you can know it by this sign: that they do anything to play victim until they get what they want.

Or it could be worth the same and this forum could be stuck with the same endless drama.
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:11:56
How about no? How about we do whatever we want?
