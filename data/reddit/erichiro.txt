lol its denominated in Venezuelan currency. Who gives a fuck?

none of the money is going to help their solvency. It is being transferred to other customers

Yeah I don't know what these people are talking about. Classic economic theory is that when the fed raises interest rates the inflation rate goes down, not up.

The level of uninsured people has dropped significantly so what you said is just not true.

yes there are specific rules for "in kind" donations. However I have no idea what they are.
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:35:52
You would have to look into the legal concept of "necessity"

IANAL but I'm pretty sure Satoshi would have to prove the claim is false rather than the other way around.

You do not get to choose whether or not you are a public figure. If you do something that affects the public significantly, like creating bitcoin, part of your right to privacy is gone. When you are a public figure the media is allowed to pry into all of your personal details and is allowed to make slanderous and libelous statements about you without legal consequence.

But how does Satoshi prove he is not THE Satoshi in order to be covered by the right of publicity

khan's website is such a mess now. It used to be so easy, just simple lists of video links seperated by categories. Now there is a whole byzantine system to find the right thing.

Do you understand what HFT is?
Basically, a large organization, using super fiber-optic wires, will recognize another slower entity looking to buy a stock. Then the large organization will swoop in, buy the stock, and then sell it to the slower buyer for a slightly higher price.
It adds no real value to the economy, all it does is transfer wealth from ordinary traders to these organizations with the very expensive equipment.
This tax would be an effective deterrent because HFT works on volume that is orders of magnitude higher than non-hft. The tax would be very low for everyone except for hft traders.

the us dollar is partially backed by gold

you should be careful. Capital gains tax is part of the income tax system, not separate from it. A theft or casualty loss from either cash or capital property would be treated the same way.

that's certainly not something that con-artists say
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:33:27
basically how do we expand to the next level? Can bitcoin do anything else?
People use it for online black markets, gambling, transferring money across borders, and as payment for tech-nerd labor. We need something new and preferably legitimate to expand bitcoin.

they are not in arrears. Arrears is when you don't pay your debt back on time. Venezuela and Greece are in some form of "arrears". The USA, China, and Japan are not. The USA has paid all of its debts for over 200 years.

why was I not informed of this!!!

There is no country called nambia you ignorant fuck.

Lol at the TOR people (US government) they were all like political freedom herp derp and now its being used to sell illegal drugs and has the potential to be used for all kinds of nefarious things.   
@_date: 2016-10-23 16:24:41
yeah that's definitely against the law so I wouldn't recommend doing it.
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:06:19
its easier after the fact. Just look at what the returns have been in other investments, bonds, stocks, etc
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:53:02
Basically, the theory behind our military spending is to spend so much that other countries can't even dream of challenging us. And thus have no reason to invest in their militaries.
@_date: 2016-07-04 04:16:45
no you fucking moron its called public corruption and it happens every damn day in every conceivable [way] currency.

as far as I know "bankster" has no anti-jewish connotation. It is simply a combination of the words banker and gangster. I visit many liberal blogs that are certainly not anti-semitic and they frequently use the phrase "bankster"
