9 Characters at most. Mostly numbers. At most 2 letters.  Likely one of them is the letter a. At most one, special character. Likely !

No. At the time that wasn't a thing. It was just a password I set
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:25:34
Yes. I am. I have the wallet backed up
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:30:32
It was only about 700-800 when I got the coins
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:37:32
No you don't get locked out

Tried him once before. No luck. Don't think he put much time into it.

I thought it can be brute forced?

I haven't came across that in any of my research. Ill see if I can find it. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:01:15
I narrowed the pass down quite a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:41:54
Thank you

Tried it in the past. Value was nowhwre near where it is today and I dont think he had the time to invest in it. Looking for at home solution I can run myself and scale up with other devices or cloud computing if price continues to rise.

I have 3.3 in a wallet that I can't access. Wrote the password down 4 years ago and it got lost.

Why buy from another user? You can buy BTC directly from the Square Cash app. It's cheaper than coinbase.
