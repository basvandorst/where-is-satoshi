The mechanism is Bitcoin as the origination of value. If a conversion happens the conversion stems from bitcoin. So... yes you are paying with Bitcoin but the receiver prefers cash in this scenario.

It’s life changing. Really interesting! Just shared it with a co worker today.

I said “not about the coin” it will be pegged to three currencies. I said regarding 2.7b people being introduced to crypto. I think it’s a huge step in bringing crypto to the masses

It will be bought on exchanges being able to be converted into any other crypto.

Apparently they have been talking to five crypto exchanges to list their coin

I’m most interested in these two questions. It seems you have done your research on the topic. When will it demonstrate enough value in your opinion. When will you personally change your mind about the long term outlook? Assume answer two ties into question one. 
FB coin white paper is said to come out soon so we will see what that looks like. Your understanding of comparing it to miles doesn’t mirror the reports in regards to it being a stablecoin also sought to be on exchanges and used as a payment system globally 
Thanks for the response I do like to hear the opinions of others on the topic.

I would say the drive of mankind is efficiency that saves time. The web although long built brought that and also added new innovation and opened up new opportunity. 
Facebook is the first large institution that will show the profitably of an exchange which will not be deniable that there is a market for crypto. The variables in crypto are the coins themselves and what the offer. In my view they are like businesses that offer something to the world. Stability? Stable coin. Deflationary? Bitcoin. Anonymity? Dash.. Etc... 
I do believe there is a parallel to the web. Adoption has to be worldwide to get the full effect. And that takes time. The trajectory of adoption is important and money has to be made in order for it to attract institutions. (Exchanges)
The questions asked about the web help understand if long term success is possible. What would it take to bring it to Zero? The world and the whole market would have to agree that it’s useless and has no value thus stopping all nodes. Does this seem like the trajectory crypto is on? These are just questions agnostic to a particular coin but about the concept as a whole. 
If the  answer is no then where does it go from here.

It was a limitation that they have for transfers for the month. So I have “my money” that I’m not allowed to move. It was just a realization that ultimately we lend our money to the banks. Money in crypto is free to move without approval.  I don’t believe that it will always be this way with our current banking system.

She said she thinks it’s the future. She was reading about it online.. They want to invest in it cause they see the long term value and also in case of economic instability in fiat.  She loves the idea of peer to peer without a third party. she saw the vision of a global freedom with money. It was pretty cool to hear. When she asked me I was like uh where did you hear about this? I told them thanks for asking cause it just solidified my views that adoption is happening and it’s not stopping.

So all “money” entering the system is printed physically? Like a 4 trillion dollar stimulus package?

I remember seeing days like this thinking how bad the crashes were. Crazy this was just a year ago.

If crypto days were crypto years no one would ever sell
