This is a bit disingenuous.  Bitcoin in the public eye is a peer-to-peer currency where anyone can be their own bank.  Not a settlement system.  Of course in reality it's (currently) both.  But in the public eye it's a peer-to-peer currency and if that aspect fails, headlines will not resemble the example above.

Comparing it to any existing state-run lottery is a bit of a stretch, as you have such a low chance of mining a block that it might as well be zero.
Let's say you go on a daily walk up and down Main Street, USA.  Your odds of finding a winning lottery ticket on the sidewalk are about the same as mining an entire block yourself.

A site like [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( can help.  Note that you'll want to download that page to a computer that's not connected to the internet before printing a private key, though you can play around with it online to see how it works.
You should also use BIP38 encryption.  This allows you to add a password to a paper wallet.  So you don't have to store the wallet in Fort Knox, you can instead just keep a few copies here and there because only you know the password.

Currently miners are "spying" on each other to mine empty blocks before propagation, or using centralized solutions.
This is a nice, decentralized miner-friendly solution so they can continue to mine based solely on information from the Bitcoin network while a new block is propagated.  I like it.

If you're talking about mining bitcoin, no.  You need specialized hardware (ASICs).  Without them you won't mine anything.  Not even a tiny fraction of a bitcoin.

In case of any of the proposed bitcoin forks, nothing will happen to your coins.  Just hold on to them and they'll be fine.
It's possible (though very, very improbable) that, since hard forks can do anything, a hard fork could be released that invalidates coins.  But if that happens and the fork gains consensus on the network, your coins will probably already be worth next to nothing because Bitcoin will have jumped the shark.

**Interviewer:**  All right, so if the miners decide that we're gonna go with small blocks, Blockstream, etc.  What they want to put, right? And then through media attention, Jeff Garzik, and all them, they say, no, we're gonna go with Classic, and then there's sort of a split between miners and merchants and people that are running just full nodes, no mining equipment... what happens?

I think they are all committed to layer two scaling.  It's just that they prioritize the usability of Bitcoin in the short term.  You have to separate NYA CEOs with the average poster on r/btc.  I know that's hard to do if your only source of information is two subreddits.

Most of the bitcoin information online (Wikipedia, Youtube tutorials, etc.) is outdated and refers to Bitcoin as a peer to peer electronic cash where one can "be your own bank."
In the past year or so, Bitcoin has transitioned to a fee-driven settlement layer meant to be used between institutions, not common people.  It is expected that additional layers will be developed on top of this settlement layer that individuals can use, but those have not yet arrived.
That said, I still think it's a good investment to put 1% of your savings into it.  I believe its current issues will be solved eventually, and that there is enough infrastructure in place that it would have to fall A LOT farther to go completely tits up.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:05:25
Satoshi had a few good ideas but he was wrong about Bitcoin being a peer-to-peer cash.  When you send money to someone using your bank you don't access the clearing system directly.  You pay a fee and let the bank handle that.
Bitcoin needs to evolve to be the same thing.  Blockstream is making it happen.

If I dropped my phone in engine oil, I'd just get a new one and reinstall Breadwallet, then enter the passphrase and voila - my bitcoins are back.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:22:21
No, not a bank.  A clearing layer that third parties like Blockstream can build on top of.  So you never actually have to use Bitcoin, since you wouldn't be able to anyway because it can't possibly scale up to meet demand no matter how fast tech gets.  You just use the Lightning Network or offchain services to send money to others.

Yes.  No one is going to make the effort to scam you for a few dollars.
That said, deny all RBF transactions because that lowers the amount of effort required to levels where someone might just be tempted.  At least, when Bitcoin becomes more popular.  Right now I imagine the number of customers paying with Bitcoin will be so low that you don't need to worry, regardless.

Paypal payments can be reversed.  Bitcoin payments cannot (at least until we get RBF).  So it's unlikely anyone will exchange BTC for your Paypal funds.  Convert to USD first.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:49:28
However Satoshi was wrong about bitcoin being a peer-to-peer currency.
We are now much wiser than him and Bitcoin is actually a bank-to-bank settlement layer.

Let's say you're playing a game of tag.  The rules state that you have to physically touch another player to make them "it."  Everyone agrees to those rules and the game begins.
What's to stop a player from changing the rules, so that they can just point at another player to make the other player "it" instead of running, catching, and physically touching them?
The answer is, any player can change the rules - but doing so, they're playing a different game... unless the majority of other players agree to the rule change.

Unless he moves the coins from block  I doubt his claim.  I predict he'll move some coins from block  or something.
Of course all he really has to do is sign a message with the key for block   The fact that he continues to not do so is the most damning evidence that he's a charlatan.

The vendor will (in almost all cases) ask you to pay an amount of bitcoin that at the time purchase exchanges to a static price in dollars.
