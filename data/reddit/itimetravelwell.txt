Is this your email or a contact with counterparty? Asking only because the email looks a little bit sketchy

So would this be us creating our own "currency" but using Bitcoin for the backend?

Haven't checked the link yet but does it have where I can bet on the super bowl?
More of a basketball fan but usually bet on the big game.

Ah how cute, is this how you deal with debates and alternative views than yours in real life?
It must be projection because I’m neither mad or in any sort of rage towards you. If anything I feel like you are a child that is refusing help from anyone and yet crying about their predicament.
You are so transparent I can probably see your future.  Are you not happy with your life or something? You are in a bitcoin sub, on a post about John Oliver explaining the topic, and you are here trying to say explaining periwinkle or differences in colour to blind people are impossible tasks. 
But again, this is quite entertaining seeing someone’s head stuck so far in their...my bad the sand. 
How about you come back when you have any sort of argument or rebuttal?

For someone trying to call others “not sharp” you aren’t making a great case for your own abilities with each reply and edit.
Are you trying to say that people who were born blind can’t grasp the concept of sight?  Just because you can’t grasp the concept of using your other senses to explain another, doesn’t mean other would have such difficulty.
“Do you feel how the texture on these two cups are different? Well colour is like a visual texture, I’m going to pass you two cups that feel that same but visually are different”
Maybe that is your issue then, you might want to try thinking about things before saying/writing them down.  I know, it can be very hard because you want to get your emotional opinions out there, but try next time before opening your mouth or pressing send to step back and think about it.

So you don’t think someone could accurately describe colour, tones and shades to a blind person? You either have a low opinion of blind people or have horrible skills yourself in explaining concepts.
Has nothing to do with discerning myself or you explaining, you made a statement I’m asking you to back it up.
If you don’t have anything or which which is more likely you didn’t have a strong argument to begin with, maybe do some research before speaking or kindly STFU.

Hey I don’t want to clog the thread up, is there any articles or pages you can link or PM to find more information on what you were mentioning (profit and running a Lightning Node)?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:17:53
So you can’t provide the example that showed you LWT is propaganda, nor any example even a small one?
Sounds like you were/are wasting everyone’s time replying or commenting here.

Nice edit: even though explaining a specific colour type and what colour is are two different things, the fact you edited you comment to try and make a different question shows you are ignorant.  You’ve yet to respond to anything, nor the responses to your nonsense.
Really doubling down huh? This is a lot easier than just admitting you were wrong or ill informed?
Either way here we go;
First I would inquire if they were blind from birth instead of assuming one way or the other, seeing as I might be trying to explain colour who only recently lost their sight, and that would be embarrassing.
I would try and use something they are familiar with so they could connect to something foreign to them.
I could use other senses to showcase how things differ and explain that colour is like a visual difference along the same lines. 
Shit I could even break down what colour is on a light wave level, if they are familiar wth echo location.
Or the very least thing I could do is be ignorant of others and assume their is no point explaining to the blind or colour blind.

“This guy sucks. Anything that comes from him or his show is pure propaganda.”
So simple yet so far. Have a great day.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:02:41
Care to give us even one example?
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:22:27
You are the one claiming everything that comes out of John Oliver’s mouth and on LWT is propaganda and yet can’t provide even just one example, because I should be able to see it myself.
Sure buddy.
Are you asking me to provide examples of actual propaganda? Maybe you are asking me to provide proof of a negative?
It is pretty clear who doesn’t understand what propaganda is.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:10:39
I’d prefer not to watch propaganda as you are suggesting it is.  That’s why I asked for even just one example as I would assume upon learning that it is propaganda.
Unless you knew what it was from your first time viewing, which piece was it?
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:22:44
Yeah lol, didn’t want “another” as most of the articles I’ve read were just about the applications of the LN.  I’ll google it I guess.

“Like I said”
Well you went from periwinkle, to explaining what colour is, to now the differences in colour (which by the way would be invalid based on your own rule set of them not knowing visual stuff prior, so not sure how you describe the difference between two things they supposedly can’t understand but sure), so if you ask nicely I’ll explain your new one but I’ve explained prior, you might have missed it because it looks educational.
Because knowing a blind person from birth would impossible. Yes I do actually, being in interaction design requires me to be empathetic to all types of users. This specific comments bothers me personally because early on in my life I went to an art class taught by a blind man. And I couldn’t wrap my head around someone blind teaching me art, which in a lot of ways led me to where I am today.
But by all means, continue as I am actually enjoying this hole you are digging.
And no I haven’t “tried a blind from birth person??”

It does make sense and was a great read! I'm glad the country is at least making steps.
I'm truly excited for what the future of Bitcoin will bring, I know people couldn't even imagine our current world when internet and email were starting out.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:37:59
That's a little bit interesting, what are the thoughts on this in the Bitcoin community or you personally?
