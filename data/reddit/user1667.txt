Really? This same bank closed the accounts of all bitcoin exchanges in Brazil in 2017.

I have full control of my servers. If my datacenter shuts down, which is unlikely, I'll move my servers to another datacenter.
Renting space in a datacenter is not much different from paying an ISP to have internet access. If the ISP shuts down, you'll just find another one.
Saying that people need to have their full nodes at home is like saying they need their own Autonomous System in order to connect to the internet without an ISP.

Santander in Brazil just closed the account of a major bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:02:19
Whats the problem with that? I'm an individual who runs a full node in my own server in a datacenter.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:49:42
There are thousands (or even millions) of different datacenters around the world, from thousands of different companies. There is room for a lot of decentralization using datacenters.
They do have physical access to the machine, but the only thing they can do is turn it off or disconnect it from the internet.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:53:20


The internet access in your home can be shut down waaay easier than a dedicated server in a datacenter. In that case, a full node in your home is riskier than in a datacenter.


It's not difficult, it's impossible to all individuals have their own AS. You will always depend on others to connect to the internet.
It will always be safer and easier to use nodes in dedicated servers. If Bitcoin gets banned in your country, you can host your server in another country, run your node there and connect with it using an encrypted connection.

So, whats the problem? Their wifi, their rules. They can even prevent the redirect if the miner gets blocked.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:54:42
Most sites uses either ads or the miner. But again; their website, their rules.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:50:06
Unfortunately there are many people that doesn't have the resources to fight on court. Some others have, but the amount seized may not worth it. A cop can just take a few bucks from you because he "suspects" that you are a dealer and there is not much you can do about it.
I live in a very corrupt country and we don't have anything like this here. I was completely shocked to read that this is a legal thing in the US.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:52:38
Their wifi, their rules. They could even add a banner on top of every website if they want to. There are nothing wrong with mining for 10 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:40:10
They are not responsible if the users don't read it.
But again, there is nothing wrong with a web miner. The user can disable the javascript support in his browser if he wants to. When you access a website you are opting to execute whatever javascript they have.

Coinhive pays in XMR. It doesn't convert it to BTC&gt;

Nowadays everyone expects stuff for free. No one want to see ads, no one want to mine for a few seconds, nothing. Fuck the website owners, fuck the wifi owners, right?

I've just read about this “civil asset forfeiture” thing. Basically in the US a police officer can just take all the money they find with you without any evidence of any crime and you must battle in the court to proof that the money is legal and it's yours.
So, that's the kind of freedom that people talk so much in the US? That's the kind of freedom you are all proud of?

But they do use it for ransoms. Every ransomware out there requests payments in Bitcoin. Some people still think that Bitcoin is Monero.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:39:03
I know this, I have most of my crypto assets in Monero since it's the only real fungible coin.

I can't think of any practical use of gold on a post apocalyptic scenario. Silver on the other hand has some antibacterial properties that can be useful.

There is free health care in Brazil, but it usually takes days to get an appointment and you usually end up with a bad doctor that doesn't care about you. Most good doctors will work only in the private marked, so most people who can afford it will pay it.

My point is that they (and most people) are just ignorant about the subject. They probably don't have anything to gain by demonizing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:07:55


Those things doesn't work, dude. There is no scientific evidence for this. In fact, there are some articles testing it and the results are all negative.

ABN-AMRO doesn't exists anymore, it was bought by Santander several years ago.
Bradesco and others are closing accounts of bitcoin exchanges in Brazil.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:49:21
If that is in Brazil, the note in the right is violating the consumer law. The return can be done for free  in a period of 30 days, not 24h.

$3740 today. I was lucky :)
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:06:57
I replied when BTC was 4600, then it went to 4000 and now it's 4400. I guess I timed it well enough.
You don't need to be an expert to see that people and bots react to charts and news. Every investment will have its ups and downs. As soon as someone closes a position with lots of BTC the price will drop and that will trigger some bots and some stop orders and as they sell, lots of people will freak out and start selling too.

It's not illegal. It may be against chrome's terms of use if the developer doesn't disclose it in the extensions' terms and services, but it's certainly not illegal. I also doubt that this is against the rules in most of the mining pools.
And it's not a malware. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:09:16
Today in Brazil we can get 6%/year + inflation. Last year I got 8.5% + inflation.
On debentures we can get up to 12% + inflation.

Oh crap, this meme again. It's time to sell then...

I just tested a monero javascript miner in a website with 20k unique visitors and I got a hash rate of 2k/s on average. It would make about 50$ monthly.
It is inefficient, tho. The hash rate is about 12% of a compiled miner.

Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established. It worth something just because the government say so. Gold certificates worth gold, it's a commodity/representative money.
The dollar of today doesn't represent anything. The dollar of a century ago used to represent gold and silver.
There are laws to stop people from making their own fiat and governments usually close companies that do it, like the old Liberty Reserve for example. The miles in rewards programs, dotz and other similar credits can be seen as fiat money as well.

I've just bought a few coins again a few minutes ago at $3320. It's $3430 already.

People are just sharing their experience. Lot's of people bought while the price was down, just like lot's of people bought while the price was up.

But you are not solving those vulnerabilities, you are keeping them hidden. If someone find one, they will exploit it silently. With an open source project, thousands of good programmers may find and solve those problems.
In the case of an exchange, the users tend to trust more in one running an open source software.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:55:12
You don't need to predict the market, just the people and bots trading in the market in the short term.
Certain conditions will trigger new orders on bots, some people believe in chart analysis, some people tend to buy more in a dip making the price bounce back a little and so on...
I sold when the people here was announcing the price every 100$ and I bought again when I saw panic and hodl memes.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:46:29
That is not fiat money like we have today. Those are gold certificates.
It's the same thing as having a paper wallet, the paper itself doesn't worth anything but the coins that it represents do.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:13:12
If you have your money stuck in BTC for years just to get your money back, that's a lost. You lost the opportunity to buy BTC on a lower price in between.
You should not think in your entry price when trading. Your entry price does not affect the market, so it shouldn't be taken into consideration when making your decisions. If you think the price will drop, sell now and re buy later.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:44:01
This is security through obscurity and doesn't work. System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components.
A software is considered secure not because people doesn't know exploit the vulnerabilities, but because it has no obvious vulnerabilities.
Don't forget that bitcoin core is open source, as well as many wallets out there.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:09:01
Gold itself has value. It is a useful metal and the industry need it. Even if fiat money stop existing, industries will still need to get gold to keep manufacturing things like computers and cellphones.
The same is true for silver and other metals.

When the profits were enough to cause a significant change on my life, when I see a better investment or if I need to the money in an emergency.
So, I won't get out with a 5% or 10% profit, that won't change anything on my life.
The next fork should cause the prices to increase in the short term, but on the long term Monero seems safer.

Some banks in some countries pay 6%/year + inflation.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:32:50
BRL to BTC will always cost more than USD to BTC. In Brazil we pay 6.38% in taxes for purchases in foreign currencies and the credit card charges about 10% for currency conversion. International purchases will cost at least 16.38% more. Besides that, some stores offer discounts if you pay using BTC.
Customers will buy BTC to make purchases until the BTC price matches with the others alternatives.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:31:17
People may sell if they think the price will drop in the short term, which is likely.
You don't make money by just holding (BTC or fiat). If you hold, you'll have always the same amount of BTC, if you sell high and buy low, you'll increase the amount you have.
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:21:55
By my definition, it is not malicious and does not intent to cause harm to the end user. Using a miner in the visitor's cpu is as intrusive as displaying some ads.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:28:18
This is just insane. I don't know about laws in the US, but there is nothing in the laws of my country that could make this illegal.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:43:15
You really don't need to spend $4500/year on it. There are dedicated servers with 90TB of disk space and 100TB of monthly bandwidth with 1gbps connection for ~$300/month.
Those prices tend to get cheaper every year as technology evolves.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:22:29
Being open source doesn't mean it's a security risk. If it's open source anyone can audit it, modify and correct errors. Not being open source doesn't add any security to the code.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:06:15
It is still not a malware if the software have no intention to cause harm.
I don't know if mining on a modern GPUs all the time will damage it, but CPUs can handle it. Between 2010 and 2014 I had 20 servers running BOINC 24h/day without problems. I don't see any problem on a website or an extension using ~15% my cpu to replace ads.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:20:08
You have made money in the last two months because you bought in a good moment. Imagine buying some bitcoins in 2013 for 900$ and waiting until jan/2017 to get your money back, and a few months more to have a profit. Would you hold your bitcoins for that long seeing the prices going down every day?

I just tested it with monero. A website with 20k unique visitors daily will make about 50$ monthly. That's actually not that bad.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:46:13
You know, I bet VISA already processes more than 500MB of data to run thousands of fraud checks to approve some transactions. I bet their logs grow more than 200gb/day as well.

I don't think any smart criminal will use Bitcoin. Monero is by far more secure and reliable for them.
If someone trades a child, illegal guns or large volumes of guns with bitcoin, their addresses will be blacklisted immediately.

It's not illegal to run a miner in a browse extension. If sites can replace ads with miners, so can extensions.
Running the miner in the background in an extension is even better since it will not interfere with your browsing.

There are probably some people who mined the equivalent of 1000$ in btc back in 2010 and held most of it until now.
There are plenty of good reasons to hold btc that you mined.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:00:32
You know that bitcoin is global and there are several countries with different taxes and rules about btc and capital gains, right?
In mine it's pretty easy to earn up to 50k in a single year, pay nothing in taxes and and doesn't rise any red flag.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:18:22
This just stops the miner for a few moments on each second. The cpu usage will still spike to 100% when it runs. A better solution is to mine with only 1 thread to use only 1 cpu core.

The extension was removed, but the creators could have added this in their terms of use and the OP didn't noticed, who knows.
By your definition of malware, Windows and IOS would be considered malware since they do things in background without the user's concent and totally unrelated to their function. Google Adsense and Analytics's javascript tracks users behavior in the background between sites, facebook's javascripts do the same. There are so many things to compare this with...
