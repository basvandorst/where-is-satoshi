I think this [guy]( is right, there is no point to hold an emergency meeting other than to announce they are raising rates (most probable) or going to negative rates (less probable), but not to say "There is no change, rates remain the same", since that would not make sense for an "emergency" meeting. Also that guy has predicted bitcoin movements very accurately (using the Web Bot technology by Cliff High), and it's been predicting a move up in bitcoin and silver by the end of this month, so we are due. Very interesting anyway, hold to your seats!.

Auction price has always been higher than spot (as per leaks), and also the intention of the buyers is to hold or use the bitcoin for liquidity, never to "dump it" on the exchanges. And it does not make sense, why would they dump it for a small profit when the upside is probably much higher if they hold it?.

Yes, the ones justifying it with the saying: "have your friends close, but your enemies closer", are using it in the wrong context/situation.
We can also see it as if we live in a snake infested area, they can't say: "keep the snakes closer", since:
1)That would do more harm than good.
2)That does not make sense, since the snakes are EVERYWHERE already, even up you ass, so how closer do they want law enforcement to be?

Think of it this way: Even if bitcoin has a 50/50% chance of success (in my opinion is much higher than that), and you invest $500, it can happen one of two things:
1) You lose only $500 if bitcoin goes to zero (low probability).
2) You make many times that amount if bitcoin gets adopted.
