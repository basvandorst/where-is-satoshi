It's a public holiday. Few people are looking at the cryptomarkets in the usa today.

Ok Ma'am.

One possibility is the US government shutdown last night. Stock prices typically go down when there's a shutdown like this. So it's likely people moved back into cryptos, mainly bitcoin. The rise has also brought back some investor confidence. But the US cycle is over now and it will be interesting to see how Asia responds....
Also many new accounts got approved this week..

Mate. It's up &gt;5% in 24hrs. Calm down and get some rest. Don't stare at the depth chart all the time (have done that...). It will be fine. BTC is still following the 200 day MA. Give it a few months!

Don't day trade thoughtlessly. I know people who did exactly the same: bought high and then tried to recoup losses by day trading and lost even more. If you do day trade, use only a small amount of your total holding.

This thread is getting saturated with FUDers. This is getting quite annoying. Additionally, there are all sorts of theories floating around about price manipulation. People, you need to understand, everything as unregulated as this will have manipulators taking advantage. If you could manipulate the price, you would too. Regulations etc. are good for BTC in the long run. Also, bitcoin is by far the most distributed among all the cryptos. People are holding small fractions of it all over the world. It is the most difficult crypto to manipulate. As for the price, think of it: If you were a new investor looking to get into the market, would you be willing to do it now? Would you not rather wait? 
I am waiting for more countries to ban ICOs and all the shitcoins. There are those that have such low volume of transactions, that two people can transact amongst themselves and raise the price by 500%. Those need to go. Have faith in BTC.

Asia has offloaded more than the west. Asia wakes up to Christmas Day. The massive sell off is over. I’m glad this correction is happening. Just hodl.

Couldn’t get into a single bar in philly. Came back home and watching on nbc. Wonder how people will respond if eagles make it.

It was a calculated guess. Chinese typically start trading around 8PM EST. Europeans typically trade when Americans are sleeping. American east coast causes a rise in volume around 8AM-10AM EST and the west coast does it at 11AM-1AM EST. 
All of this is just estimates. No proof.

There’s a hearing on February 6th. Any ideas on how that will affect the market? Seems like they will discuss the monitoring of fraudulent activities etc., which would be good for the consumers in the long run. Any thoughts?

Just got paid for the month. What  a great time for a buy opp.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:35:21
No manipulation folks. A healthy way to go up is through regular corrections! Trade volume is still very high. I will feel more relieved if it goes down to around 7k before hitting 10k.

My brain and tech know-how developed a little more than a month back fyi.

Shitcoins are ponzi schemes. Just staying away from them is the best thing to do. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:48:52
It actually appears as though Asia has sold most of its btc.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:11:19
Of course it is. However, you should know that most/all hodlers of bitcoin were once day traders who realized that the best strategy is just to hodl. (serious answer). 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:15:49
Sure. All the pennies are yours. :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:43:58
No way it will go to 3k. The volume over the last few days have been too high. I feel like most of China has sold already. I suspect it will test 6k and then maybe 5k.

Money is just a concept brah...
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:29:41
Stupid people think the 5 people who read their posts can actually influence the entire market.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:22:00
I don’t think so. The number of new accounts being created is still consistent. Those who have sold out are still following the market. Many will reinvest once positive news starts coming in.... that’s my thought, which is why I am still keeping a long position. Just in August, the sentiment surrounding bitcoin was similar: all the articles were negative, but people kept following it and the volume of new users moved the price up.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:08:42
Waiting to see how Asia is going to respond. There was massive sale volume from china yesterday, which was matched by buying from the west. Japan is bullish on btc.

I drunk bought some btc last night. Sometimes good decisions are made while drunk.
