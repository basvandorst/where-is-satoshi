It used to be %100

Ok , I read transactions over $200 have a 99% fail rate, is that true?

At least provide a detailed rebuttal to how my comment is incorrect.  Why leave a comment if your not prepared for an intelligent debate?

Lightning network shouldn’t even be talked about.  That’s just Bitcoin booster crap.  Until it works, I don’t want to hear about it.

Yes it has.  Since it can’t be moved fast enough or cheap enough to compete with fiat transactions, there’s  no advantage to use it as a currency.  It is scarce with its low supply but with little useful utility, it may be hard to convince people of its value.  Not to mention wild price swings also contradict a store of value.

This will just show how little people will use BTC for small purchases when Starbucks issues their quarterly report.  Starbucks is just trying to look “hip” and get publicity because their recent earnings sucked.

We’d have better luck playing pick up sticks with our buttcheeks than betting on an ETF being approved before year’s end.

From what I’ve read the proposed VanEck ETF will cost $200,000 a share to appeal to institutional money.  This isn’t easy for people to withdraw their money, which was one thing the SEC listed as a requirement.  Another ETF is proposed by Direxion and will offer Bitcoin Bear ETF as well, up to 2X leveraged.  The ETF news sounds better when institutional money is betting on BTC, not against.
