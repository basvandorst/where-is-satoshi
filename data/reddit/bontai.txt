Don’t get so fanboy on bitcoin. Enjoy the cryptosphere growing.
Bitcoin is still and will be for the foreseeable future the hegemonic coin

What a wank of a post.
Like seriously this is just sad!

Your playing a dangerous game day trading. Bitcoin can bounce very quickly and everyone is preping for the bull run. Sometimes it's just eager to hold and wait especially at the price you bought in.

They are also broke and need as much of the economy backing local growth and investment including the Sri Lankan Rupee.

I skip nearly all money/ fomo articles,  these experts have no idea.  Just watch for adoption, upgrades and developments in bitcoin.

I have and it's over rated. Pokera was nice but very touristy and you feel a bit forced to follow the tourist program. I couldn't believe they had a 12am shutdown on bars all week.
Kathmandu a hole loaded with armed police and soldiers and an attempt to tap tourist on one section loaded with junk sellers and over priced food.
Mountains were all right though honestly goto India to visit a more isolated and untouched part of the Himalayas.
