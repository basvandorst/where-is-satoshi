I read your story and enjoyed it. =)
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:25:48
Yes, this is supported for all currencies on CB.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:24:07
Amazing. Cool new tech that could easily be adopted by BTC just immediately deleted. The code for this is all open source, but they choose to ignore it because it was developed first for Bitcoin Cash. I guess it wouldn't be practical due to the high fees anyways. Thanks for trying @_date: 2017-03-01 18:50:46
This is what I expect to be posted here. Informative, not full of politics and generally useful information on how bitcoin works. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:22:04
The message size in Bitcoin is 32MB. Logically the current change set in both Classic and BU can't go beyond 32MB.

I love how carefully you crafted that reply. Lets break it down:


Well they are connected at startup, so to say they aren't used is just intentionally misleading. Also Segwit 2X nodes are in the minority of nodes right now by a large magnitude. The amount of impact they would have even when they fork would be minimal, and before the fork non-existent. All this does is try to show how much the core team wants to split off from Segwit 2X even though miners and exchanges are supporting it.


Well how can they not influence it, but also be the startup and fallback mechanism. Pick one.


Yes. I obviously read that disucssion. The argument to disconnect ABC nodes makes perfect sense as they are not inter-operable. With Segwit 2X they will be perfectly working peers for 3 months. These are very very different scenarios.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:13:11
Which exchange? Several allow trading after just a couple confirmations. Also blocks were being generated a wicked pace the past couple days... sometimes more than 20 an hour. How did it take you all night?
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:45:54
Not everyone is here to troll others. =)
I am hoping the community can come together. I think there are good arguments on both sides of the debate, and can't wait to see multiple visions of Bitcoin compete on the open market.
Lets stay away from the infighting. Crypto is the future, but it will take time to figure out the best way to push it forward.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:34:01
This is fair. I believe that both on and off chain solutions should be available. I am not against off-chain solutions and think they will provide value. I just don't believe anyone should be forced to use those solutions and that it should be a users choice. =)
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:35:17
So lets look at the facts.
1) BitcoinABC is not developed on GitHub. This is merely a mirror of the last releases commits.
2) There is a CONTRIBUTING.md that clearly explains where development occurs. This is 
3) There is a ton of active development on that Phabricator instance. In fact there are multiple high quality commits per day.
I don't mind people comparing the dev teams, as this is healthy and people should know what they are supporting. But making it look like there is no development is flat out deceptive.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:22:41
This is incredibly short sighted. Some people have rent and bills that are &lt; $5. Should those not be on the main chain either? To those users, those payments are very important and not equatable to a cup of coffee.
Bitcoin is here to facilitate payments for the world. Not just affluent areas of the world where $2 is a tiny transaction.
How do you determine where the line is? What transactions are not supposed to be on the main chain? The ones you think are too small based on the monetary value of your country? Do you just disregard all the other users?
I hate seeing this argument used over and over again. It just makes it very clear how little people understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:21:17
Ahh they do require quite a few confirmations. I have been using HitBTC, as they only require a couple. Thanks for clarifying! Hope your investments do well.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:02:51
Maybe you should think really hard about what you said. It took you hours of waiting to confirm your transactions. You had to pay high fees. All to dump a coin that has neither of those problems and went up 50% while you were prepping to sell them.
I think there is a future where both coins coexist. Trading openly on the market, and competing with different ideas. Holding might just be a good strategy for both coins right now.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:06:33
You know this to be untrue, yet you state it like fact. The reality is that it will be months before the fork, and you have hard coded seed servers that can easily be updated with healthy nodes. There is no good technical reason for this change at this time.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:51:21
You actually got me to laugh out loud. Well done.
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:12:31
While I agree that the fees seem high, the mempool today was all over the place.
The OP also didn't include a time when this happened. So no way to know exactly what the mempool looked like when this transaction was attempted.
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:24:23
You are partially correct, but over exaggerating in a big way. The fee is required so they can move the BTC/BCH they receive. The fee is based on miner fees on the network so they don't cover high fees when sweeping the funds. Since BitPay does fiat conversion, they need to move the funds in order to sell coins and pay the merchant.
Right now the on chain fees for BTC and BCH are drastically different. BitPay can absorb a few cents, but not a few dollars. That is why the fees are so different.

You're welcome MayhemStark. Can't wait to see more of your minis!
@_date: 2017-04-12 22:44:38
I am happy to allow users to opt into UASF. However by default Electrum uses a random selection of servers. This means users will be using a UASF supporting node without being asked if they support UASF... there is nothing user accepted about that.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:21:05
That is exactly what I did for now. :) 
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:03:51
While I wish that were true, then botnets would be able to produce an amazing hashrate and create insecurity. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:06:14
Funded and controlled are totally different things. People can be funded because the investor believes in their idea. Many times the investor doesn't make business decisions, but just wants to remove roadblocks for the development team. Unless you can provide evidence that Bitmain is controlling the roadmap, or deciding development decisions, then this is an unfounded accusation.
From what I can tell the OB team are free thinkers and are in complete control of their project. I doubt they would let ANYONE dictate what they do with OB.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:16:40
This is just not true. There are many developers working on all crypto offerings at Coinbase. The segwit work was done by a team of developers. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:51:19
Currently on GDAX you can send to legacy, wrapped SegWit or native Bech32 addresses. They also use Bech32 addresses to send change outputs.
They use P2SH-P2WPKH addresses as receive addresses as most of the industry can't send to native Bech32 addresses yet.
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:18:14
What does any of that have to do with my comment? OpenBazaar literally builds a p2p commerce platform. There is nothing centralized about that at all. I didn't mention any currencies, just their platform.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:14:10
If you look at Coinbase segwit transactions you will notice the change is already using bech32, and sends are already supported for bech32.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:57:49
Wow, neat breakdown. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:22:46
Thank you for correcting the obvious misinformation above. This new product pays directly from the buyer to the merchant and the merchant has full control of their private keys. At no time does Coinbase hold funds. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:45:27
This is accurate.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:14:45
Segwit2X seems super rational to me. I have watched this debate for years, and the simple fact is that Segwit provides additional capacity, but it requires time before Segwit transactions are the norm. We have had issues with capacity for a while now, and companies who have a vested financial interest in Bitcoin's success are now trying to make sure Bitcoin can work for them.
This is not an attack, they are trying to save Bitcoin from itself. They want enough capacity so that their users have a good experience. This was amplified by many wallets having poor fee estimation, and this led users to a very inconsistent experience where some transactions took a reasonable amount of time, and others could take hours. Telling users to go check out the mempool before sending a transaction makes no sense. People just don't use money that way. Sending and receiving Bitcoins should be easy, straightforward and most importantly predictable.
Then there were serious side effects witnessed first hand by the fee market:
- Fees fluctuated between cents and over $5, making it difficult for users to determine the right fee for their use case.
- Confirmation times were very hard to predict, leading to many inexperienced users wondering what happened to their Bitcoins when they had a delay receiving funds.
- Many dust addresses became unspendable because the value of the address was less than a fee which could confirm on the network.
- A large portion of the world got priced out of bitcoin, reducing the overall user base. This means less customers transacting with bitcoin, and businesses being the first ones to see the signs of decreased use.
Now since the largest businesses are the ones that run support centers, and deal with the most actual bitcoin users, they have a VERY good perspective on what is happening. They need a capacity increase now, not something that gradually increases capacity to only 1.7x within a year or more. These are simple facts, and arguing that the companies are being malicious is just avoiding the facts they clearly see.
Now to top this all off, many companies have stopped accepting BTC this year. For the first time BTC overall adoption in stores for retail purposes has declined. Also, alt coins have shot up in value to try and fill the void.
The reality is most users want fast predictable transactions, low fees, and a secure network. The constant arguing on both sides doesn't help any of these things. Blocking 2X means that the network will get congested again if more people use BTC, and the constant fighting actually leads  to less network security, as the HF will be more contentious, causing wild swings in the hashing power. We have already seen one HF, this is going to be 2, mainly for the same reason. Had a real compromise been made, all of this would have been prevented.
Just my 2 cents. I hold BTC. I work in crypto, and I want a block size increase to get more people using Bitcoin without the side effects of growth I have seen in the past 2 years.
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:55:51
Yes because only a small number of wallets and exchanges support bech32. This is for compatibility.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:49:12
This is downright dishonest. Blocks have been far faster than 4 hours. 
It is true there are slow blocks, but no where near this level.
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:38:16
I would love for more users to begin mining. People who mine have a say in the direction of the chain. Proof of work is what Bitcoin is about. Users have a say economically by buying/selling coins and choosing their wallet/service providers, but if you want to enforce the rules of the chain, and vote in a way that can't be sybil'd then mining is the only option.
Millions of users mining even a little bit would go a long way to secure the chain further, and allow them to be part of the PoW decision making process.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:12:14
Sending to bech32 is already supported. Using bech32 receive addresses makes no sense as a majority of the ecosystem doesn't support them yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:43:46
Actually it still doesn't show up in search. This direct link is the only one that seems to still be around...
EDIT: I removed the comment from github, even though it was accurate.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:55:28
I am happy they got funding. They have an awesome project and are making decentralized commerce a reality. Judge them on their code, and their vision. Just because someone takes money doesn't make those things change, and if they do, then you have a real reason to not use their product.
Personally I am still super optimistic about OB. People can choose the crypto they want to use for their store, they don't force people to use things they don't like, they are just giving their users and merchants options.
Attacking innovators in the space doesn't seem productive to me. There are very few people trying to build what OB is building, their product is stable and constantly getting better.
The crypto movement is growing quickly, most new products coming out are multi-currency, and no amount of boycotting services is going to change this basic fact. Growing the space helps everyone, fighting and boycotting just splinters the community and has no positive value.
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:14:43
Finally a voice of sanity. Thank you for clarifying. The amount of misinformation in this original post was astounding.
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:40:12

Because it was when I posted it. The post disappeared less than 5 minutes after it was posted. Seems it is back, I will happily remove the comment.

Looking forward to seeing this happen: 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:27:54
Your blatant bias against Coinbase is showing. Coinbase Commerce facilitates payments directly from the buyer and the merchant and is non-custodial. The merchant always maintains their private keys and always has complete control of their funds. This is exactly what crypto is all about. This model should be encouraged and celebrated, not attacked with misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:40:01
Erik, again you have shown to care a great deal about BTC. The community is lucky to have people like you involved in the space. Good luck on 2X, I really hope it happens for the sake of BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:02:51
We are in full agreement on this one. =)
I want to see all the big semiconductor companies making miners. I want to be able to buy them at Best Buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:11:50
All this does is illustrate how easy it is to do a sybil attack by bringing up a ton of nodes. Basically says you can't use node count as a metric at all. PoW or bust, everything else can be gamed.
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:57:01
Which is why we should be encouraging more people to mine.
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:38:58
Why not use a pool? Even a small one if you don't want to contribute to the larger players?
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:51:11
Thanks, was wondering who the first troll would be.
