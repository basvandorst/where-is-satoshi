I mostly base myself on the MACD, stochastic RSI and Bollinger bands.

A lot of the technical indicators used to determine trends on financial markets are showing clear signs of bitcoin being a little overvalued. Not a lot, it has only reached this state 4-5 days ago, but a small drop to about 13k±1k is possible in order to correct this. From there it would likely to go back up again given the hype, only slower.
Of course nothing is certain and anything could happen, but there are many indications that we'll see a small downtrend for a few days this week. It could also happen in one day, who knows.

"maximum". I think we can all agree that BTC will be somewhere between $0 and $25k EOY. What is he even trying to say with that.

Noone can pick up a penny in a second, it takes at least 3-5 seconds. And that doesn't even take into account the time to decelerate and accelerate again if you're picking it up while walking, which also adds lost time.

No offence but nothing before 2008 has anything to do with bitcoin specifically. None of these things were created with bitcoin in mind as endgoal. It's like saying that a CPU is the result of 4000 years of research because that's when we learned how to work with iron. 
In your infographic you could take it back way more in time (cryptography was already a thing 2000 years ago, e.g. the caesar cipher) but it still doesn't mean anything for bitcoin. 
It can even be argued that all of these technologies will become irrelevant in the next 20-50 years as quantum computing will become mainstream and current crypto approaches will not be secure any more.

You expect to have internet or even electricity when the government collapses?

It's back! At least for me.

Most people don't buy bitcoin because they support the tech. They buy bitcoin so they can sell it at a higher price. It doesn't matter what happened in the past, if bitcoin shows signs of going up, it's going to attract hordes of speculators.

I bet the majority of queries was made in the beginning of 2018 though, which was still during the "hype" period.
