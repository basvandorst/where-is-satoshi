If every citizen does not have authority over that object, then it cannot be considered property of every single citizen. If we use the word property in this way, the term propert itself becomes meaningless.
Furthermore only a part of the people from who the funds come to create that property, have consented to the usage of their property. Therefore it is stolen from those people who did not consent.
And the fed is a private company.
Collective ownership is a concept that cannot be accepted philosophically, because people cannot have authority over an object simultaneously. It is a term that obfuscates the reality that the state has full control over 'collectively' owned objects.

Your single recovery phrase works for all coins you have on your nano s.

Their code is open source, so I am sure there would be a possibility of retrieving your coins. I also believe they use algorithms that are standard for hierarchically deterministic wallets, so you can use other applications with the same keys. You are not even dependent on their applications right now, since nano s works with many different wallets already.

I don't know where people get the idea that bitcoin gets its value from being traded. Bitcoin gets its value from the knowledge that others would trade for it, just like fiat

Women outperform men in education, they are being given easy access (compared to men) to a lot of positions and they are the primary consumers of resources which mostly men provide (through taxes or having a family). Inequity between the sexes is primarily due to men and women making different choices in life, because men and women are different. They don't need 'empowerment'. I want a society where every individual can decide themselves how they want to organise their life and selecting a group as if they were victims of some oppression is not part of that. (I know I'm putting a lot of words in your mouth, but this is a comment directed towards the general SJW mindset out there.)

Oh wow, where and how do you live? (If you want to disclose that.)
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:30:26
Yes, so it's correct

It would also create new demand from people that want to use btc to make purchases on amazon. The amount spent on amazon will be exactly the same as amazon will sell, therefore, assuming constant spending on amazon, the price will first increase from increased demand and speculation, then will stabilize when amazon start to sell their bitcoin.
No expert here.

If the scaling issue gets solved soon and if the dollar crashes, I don't expect to see a correction for a while. Otherwise it will bump back up when those things do happen. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:17:12
Isn't it logical that the BTC price would drop dramatically when the scaling gets solved? The BTC stuck now would become available causing inflation, if the demand does not increase a lot as well

Okay, thanks!

I thought the uasf and 2x versions of segwit were incompatible. Is this not true?
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:16:21
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:42:25
Yes. Fun ain't it?

How can the total number of bitcoins not be an integer or integer + 0.5?
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:42:02
I suspected so. Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:56:50
Yes, but I expect it to remain higher than before the increase because the increase was based on actual news
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:37:20
The dip will be as soon as segwit goes live. Same with litecoin.

Why didn't you listen to the people always saying that you shouldn't put money on exchanges? It's mentioned on like half of all bitcoin posts in existence. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:48:54
Why would you be gambling with someone else's money?

Hm, those two effects are difficult to quantify exactly

I wouldn't say that segwit activated on litecoin because of UASF. I think it was smart diplomacy of Charlie Lee.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:05:50


So bit 4 is not something that makes the code incompatible?
Thanks a lot anyway
