Ho boy, we got ourselves a Full on Class IV Fedora wearing Libertarian on our hands here.

You owe Uncle Sam .4 cents now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:24:43
Or use Litecoin and pay 6 cents.

This is a very cool project however the ledgers themselves are basically worthless (and there's not even really a point in having more than one.) It's the seed words that have to be protected.

This is a terrible method. If you forget your PIN you are screwed.

Real vets don't even notice the dip.... until I see these kind of posts... then I go look.

Have you ever sent money through lite coin? There's nothing complicated about it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:37:15
Bitcoin fees are *per transaction*, please don't say they are 25% of the transaction because it would depend how much you are sending, it's not good in it's current state for small transactions. Litecoin can be used for this while still allowing us to be tied to the (real) BTC blockchain eventually (post lightning)
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:44:44
So you are saying you dislike lightning?
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:09:34
You're in a cult at this point. I'll take my penny transactions thanks. All this kind of one-think is convincing me to sell.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:23:44
Litecoin is more widely available, already on CoinBase (therefore swappable with USD) and will in the future be atomically-swappable with Bitcoin. It's always been silver to Bitcoin's gold. It's even available at Bitcoin ATMs in my area.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:34:47
Looks like this can do it. Of course download, run offline, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:55:55
Coinbase uses Litecoin now (which is already a lightning enabled coin.) I don't see why everyone here doesn't use Litecoin for small transactions. It will be in-chain swappable with BTC once it's on lightening too.

This is perfect, thank you. Sentinel is a great idea, love the concept. This helped me better understand why and how HD wallets are used.
Are there any website versions of the tool which allows creation of the XPUB like a bitaddress or do you have to do it in an app/command line?
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:52:34
Use Litecoin, 5¢ transactions, already on lightning network and will be swappable with BTC on the blockchain once BTC is on lightning too.
BTC is your savings account, Litecoin is your checking account. Problem solved.

So that means you voted for Donald Trump?
Yeah, not gonna trust your judgement.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:29:46
This seems to be a very popular suggestion. Is there any reason so many prefer that to Keep Key or Trezor?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:03:56
Litecoin is not new. It's already on Coinbase with Etherium.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:06:03
Tedious: I think it's much simpler than keeping track of keys, printing and storing paper wallets. Also, I can put the answers with amounts freely online all day long, nobody can do anything with it even if they get the file.
Unproven: I agree (which is why I want critique)
Sketchy: Well yeah, part of the story involves the government kicking me out of the country with nothing but what I know. I'd have gone with 'unrealistic.'
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:04:44
this guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:35:30
Sounds good but I change my mind too often.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:51:19
It's already on lightening so guess we'll find out what BTC would be like on it but the technology is believed to leave fees low even after lots of users. If everyone is waiting for lightning I don't see why they don't come over to LTC for now so we can test the tech to see if the fees skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:58:53
BTC doesn't seem to mind, they are teaming with Litecoin.
If everyone is so excited to try lightning, why don't they diversify into the only one actually using lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:33:16
Yes, I was thinking you could possibly just do the question as the phrase and the answer as the BIP39 passphrase. Then it's all in one page, store public addresses, balance, and passphrase and you can keep in your head your "security question."
I'd still probably avoid doing anything found in a book, I'd also probably add complexity to the question by including some piece of personal info. Such as "Hey travis Where are you going to put your bitcoin today?"

I want to thank you for posting this. Unlike a lot of people here I took the time to read about Patrick and he's a real American who is trying hard to make a change in government. To all those saying "I hate politicians", the only way to hurt politicians is to put into office real people like Patrick and get the existing lot out of DC. 
To this sub I'd ask you all to stop being so cynical, that is the easy way out and it doesn't help anything. The system we have is a democracy and the only way to make real change is to put new people into office. Not many are willing to put themselves up to this kind of task, it sounds like Patrick is and that deserves some amount of respect.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:22:54
It's attitudes like this that means we'll never have anyone good in politics.

Could someone explain how to sign a message with a block key? I understand how PGP works but am curious how using a block key would work to encode a message.

As a UX designer with over 10 years of experience.. this is kinda stupid.
