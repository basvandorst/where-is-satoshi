This thing reminds me of people who sell "get rich quick" books. If they are getting rich so quick, why would they need to sell a book? If this company can mine so fast, making 100's per week, why would they sell the things? Wouldn't they just build thousands for themselves?

If you've ever dealt with labor exchange networks, you'll understand what he's talking about. I've been using them for 15 years. I do a job for a plumber, in exchange the plumber unclogs my toilet. There is paper scrip involved, to keep it fair, and its for labor only, not parts, but as long as we all use the scrip, there really is no value

That's true. mind blown

Should add 30% of all coins sold on ebay. I've been ripped off so many times (as a seller) thats its almost comical

Bitcoins are essentially a commodity, not a currency. Wish it wasn't true, but that's where we are. Need more people in it for the giggles and shits instead of for getting rich. (hope no "MC BTC" steals that line for a rap song)

Thats one of the bad things about PayPal, if use it, you have to get the money out as soon as possible, because there is always a chance of "investigation" or something holding up the money.
Thankfully, since they have the debit cards, makes it a little quicker. I just hate having to spend $3.00 to get it out at ATM or quickly going to grocery store to spend it.
Ideally PayPal would be stable enough where could just leave the money in there. I don't think they'll ever get there though

No via holes, no cap pads around quadpack, few traces and looking at side and inside mounting hold, doesn't even look mulit-layer. The few traces on there are for what I assume will be LED's ?? Couldn't be caps, what would be the point going straight to connector so far away  ?
this looks more like a mockup, or pilot run from a PCB manufacturer, to make sure mounting holes and positioning of pads for quad is right.
@_date: 2013-09-14 12:48:02
How would they convert the stolen coins into more money? Couldn't they do this now, since the coins are stored in their wallet, do they even have them. Do like a bank does, don't have all of everyones cash in the vault, just numbers in a computer and pray there isn't a run. :)
Heck, little late now, but once they found out about breach they could have changed everyone's account, saying they have whatever they had. May be a few weeks before anyone tries withdraw.
Of course THAT would be a conspiracy, and probably illegal. If it was an inside job, I don't think it was institutional, maybe a rogue programmer?

for real. Once arc gets that precise, you would have to correct course, since other variables would start to add up (wind, barometric pressure, air denisty, friction, hell, even gravity would change as got further from the earth).

You've obviously never worked in a electronics assembly plant. I've worked in 3, and all 3 do complete diagnostics on the boards. Basically its a bed of pins that the board is clamped down on, and tests are done. starting with shorts, then powers it up if passes that.
Its fast, pretty much automatic, and they have to do the test on the board, before put in the housing and connect everything, otherwise would be a colossal waste of effort.

How long has paypal been around? At least ten years. Ask 10 random people on the street if they know what it is. I'm guessing maybe 3 will. and 1 will have an account. 
Divide that by 10000 and thats how many people know about bitcoin. So by my rough, made up and obviously wrong maths, bitcoin will be where paypal is, in about 10 thousand years.

There has to be some centralization, otherwise would be a million small sites, with jsut a few bids/asks on the book. Would think ideally would be a centralized or semi centralized server with all the bids/asks.

2 to the 160th is a huge number, but you wouldn't have to do them all. 
even though its 1 in a quadrillion trillion or whatever, the chance is still there. theoretically possible to do it twice in a row. Randomness is, after all, random.
I know its built into the system to not have any centralization, but would think this is a flaw, a potentially expensive flaw.

I also deal in buying scrap gold. Been considering offering BTC instead of cash, just so I won't have to goto bank as often. But the dopers want the cash fast. Pondering doing Cash-&gt;BTC exchanges on site to public.

A separate feedback system is the first and most crucial step in Silk Road v2. It is basically the equivalent of piratebay using magnet links. If one "SilkLane" gets shutdown, another just picks up where it left off. OR sellers could use thier feedback on multiple sites.
Sellers would be registered into the system, using a PIN model, no emails or any of that.
For plausible deniability purposes, the rating system would also be available to legal purposes via api or something (forums, porn sites, etc)
It would be easy to reprogram another Silkroad and have it going within a few weeks. The trusted sellers, and all of that would take forever, even if it is possible. 
if anyone is interested, I have been working on just such a project, and need help :)
