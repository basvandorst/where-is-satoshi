Have faith in Bitfinex, they are one of the few exchanges left I personally trust tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:51:34
Bitfinex is worth it though lol.

Have you contacted their support team? If you have, allow a bit of time for them to get back to you. They can be quite busy at times, but rest assured your problems will be sorted soon.

I'm glad you actually see the fact that its a protest to our current monetary system.

Soon it's gonna be around $20k, the price is going up slowly cause of Christmas I guess.

Not a bad idea if you are going to hold for a few months more.

Used to use Bittrex but have grown to hate it with a passion. Bitfinex has worked for me MUCH better.
