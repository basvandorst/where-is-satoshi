What a weird way to write 15,600,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:38
The thumbnail made me read this “the Neanderthal man”.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:28:55
People downvotes me for asking. What do you think about that?
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:53:01
Hmm but not on iOS list. That’s weird.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:59:32
Out of curiosity ~ how would you store that much bitcoin? Across many Trezors locked away in bank vaults?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:27:37
How many do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:11:26
Oh ok cool thanks for the clarification. Only 600K hold a BTC or more? That's not that many.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:32:09
Mycelium isn’t listed at that link?
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:11:38
Awesome congrats dude
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:12:39
No fucking chance. Cat's out of the bag. Whole world is watching this dip and will buy in way before 2300.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:59:04
I'm trying to figure out how to get it off my paper wallet safely. Then I'm selling it with no ragarts!
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:54:24
I was talked out of $400. �� I will never listen to others again.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:33:12
The punch line is the US still doesn't have free health care in 2025.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:09:31
No, hodl ME!
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:43:54
Not familiar with the platform. Looks like could be a way to buy Bitcoin using PayPal?
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:14:00
Yeah if you haven't sold by now just don't. This bitch is going back over $4000 at some point so the only option is buy.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:01:24
I would probably do something like this. I have paper wallets in a safe at home with BTC amounts written on them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:59:59
Are you capable of texting a sentence without an exclamation point?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:40
Am I the only one that is seriously fucking pissed off about this?
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:26:42
Let’s do this. Good luck brother.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:48:28
Dude can you possibly buy a bit more tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:53:40
I thought BTC could only go to 8 decimal points?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:57:22
Start a YouTube channel about BTC investing on a shoestring. Probably could get some extra Steemit credit off the posts.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:13:56
Yeah I agree. I think the next ‘bargain’ after this upshot is going to be in the 7000s anyway. I’m buying more now too.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:04:04
I initiated a trade on local bitcoins and then the seller pretended to not see my messages. Because I had traded with them before I went ahead and deposited to their account and sent a copy of the receipt. They then came online saying ‘you shouldn’t do that’ blah blah blah but the real reason was they don’t want to sell below 10k anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:22:19
This is an attack?! Pfft. Wake me up if we go under 5k.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:03:22
But could BTC ever be worth a million dollars? Even if it replaced the value of all fiat tomorrow, that would work out to be less than one million per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:42:25
That's still a very stupid thing to do.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:11:33
How much did you buy?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:56:33
Get a job?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:20:09
I hope so! I mean, only a few weeks ago it went to 5500.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:39:23
Ok cool
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:43:22
Ok thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:52:51
Wow this is the coolest thing I’ve seen today. Just out of curiosity —and not asking for specifics— do you currently hold more or less than 10 BTC? Always want to ask you early believers that but it is kind of awkward so no offense intended! Cool YouTube channel by the way.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:54:55
Price here through Christmas going to climb. The dip might come afterward, but it will probably only fall to where is is right now or only a bit lower. I’m just telling myself that anything below 10k is a bargain. The 2018 version of you will be thankful you didn’t wait for a sip that’s never going to come.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:16:12
Because I wanted to buy more. GREED
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:11:54
I forced a buy at $9500, like as in I had to twist the seller's arm. Tells you something.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:50:54
Dude trust me you’d hate yourself more if you were a guy like me that knew about bitcoin but let myself be talked out of buying it at $400! Anyway it’s technically still early days but just not first mover days. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:30:22
Ah ok. Good luck dude. You’ll pull yourself up ~ just keep your eye on the prize.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:44:56
Lol thanks ‘Bircoin’ ��
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:03:20
Localbitcoins premiums always seem to be through the roof no matter where on the planet you try to find a seller.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:42:38
God bless you people that actually sell. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:34:05
Yeah I'm also not quite convinced by the poor hotdog vendor who's not playing by the rules. If anyone could sell anything in the streets, we might as well live in Dhaka.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:45:21
I don't understand. How could they prevent anyone from buying a coin after its ICO?
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:36:54
There’s actually a website to count it down 
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:21:47
Yeah I guess the main fears over China's news are over but there are still a select few Chinese exchanges to close so expect some bulk selling over the next month as people try to exit their positions.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:11:22
�� love it
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:01:48
Hi OP, I'm facing similar challenges finding a trustworthy provider outside EU. Have you had any luck?
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:01:17
China has done this many times before. It's not that they're scared of new technology. It's that they have the population to turn their own copy technology into the status quo. Why open yourself to Twitter when you can create a billion dollar brand by forcing everyone to use Weibo. Crypto is no different. The Chinese are going to choose and run with a coin and put it on WeChat - instant use by hundreds of millions of people. Yet another billion --perhaps trillion in this case-- dollar tech. The biggest mistake the Russians and Indians ever made was allow western internet access to their people.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:38:05
HK is a tiny blip in China buy/sell power. I think there's still lots of money to come out of these exchanges and their sell orders will likely push the price down in the days leading up to the exchange close.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:39:47
Why is that? I like hearing how much others have.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:21:38
I appreciate your comment and suggested reading. I know that text and will look into it.
I'm not arguing China's government or its approach to development is anything 'new' and I'm certainly not arguing it is not a dictatorship, but focusing a billion people on the worship of private wealth in an arena the state controls has worked wonders in a way giving everyone a voice has not. It won't work forever and that's not my argument, but it did pull 100 million people out of starvation level poverty.
A functioning democracy to me seems to require two things --the slow organic cultural growth and acceptance of democracy as part of a people's identity (i.e such as that enjoyed by western countries with the evolvultion of democratic ideas over a period of around a thousand years, arguably beginning with the magna carta) ...and wealth. If you don't have one of those things, you can't have a functioning (as functioning as possible) democratic system. Democracy in China is just as the Chinese government says ~ not an applicable idea for at least a hundred years.
Edit: 'magma' was a typo
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:20:08
Fuck that noise. I moved my Aug 1 pre-fork to a paper wallet and am still trying to figure out how to get my BCH. Had I just left them on Bittrex I would have automatically been credited the BCH. This time around I'm leaving my BTC on Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:49:19
It's a hard pill to swallow in the western world, where democracy is erroneously seen as a cure all. China's centralized take on development has pushed it light years ahead of whatever that 'democratic' thing is happening in India or Russia.
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:48:37
I don't think electron cash is available to us using Mac.
My plan at the moment is to send it to my XAPO account, which as I understand it is separating BTC from BCH automatically.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:41:13
Why do you say that? I think a lot of it is cash going into BTC to take advantage of BTG.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:24:33
Why not just use fiat to free up some space on a credit card and then buy on a site like CoinMama?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:48:13
Yeah we'd all be rich then!
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:06:39
Bought it then moved that two days ago to NEO. Not sure how to feel right now.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:49:57
But he's anonymous here.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:47:19
This happened because I sold BTC three days ago. You are most welcome, fuckers.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:44:01
I guess or just buy at a place like CoinMama. Also premiums but nothing like localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:08:29
�� very well meme'ed, OP ��
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:16:02
So moving to max automatically separates the bch?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:18:34
How about me?
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:04:41
Lol beat me to it
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:15:48
He's gonna start a fire!
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:18:15
But won't there still be huge sell orders in the weeks/days leading up to the close as people with coin in these exchanges try to gtfo?
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:40:23
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:44:35
Comparing apples and oranges. China's ban on crypto is a healthy one while it builds a game plan around it. When they launch or adopt a coin for use on the WeChat platform, Napoleon's 'when China awakens she will astonish the world' will be center stage once again.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:10:42
Haha great thread. Read the opening post aloud with confidence and pride.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:50:49
But what can you do with that? You could get that info from most people via an informal chat on that bus.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:49:15
WTF why is no one talking about this?!
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:43:20
I've been waiting for you, BTCYoda. ;))
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:39:18
Haha exactly. And I bet half the 'vitriol' the OP is referring to is just a bunch of shitposters trying to shake out the speculative money for price reduction and their own gains.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:55:29
That's what makes the site so edgy...
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:22:52
Agreed. Zyntho, take whatever you were planning to buy with and just pace it over the days leading up to Aug 1 (transfer everything into paper wallet before Aug 1 hits), then keep buying in the days after Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:38:33
Oh I thought he meant they were moving money from alts to BTC. Yeah I see what you mean.
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:09:48
74? I'm 92. On Christmas Day we kids would suck pennies, and can I just say they were a delight.
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:30:48
So true. WSJ are a bunch of cucks.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:21:05
Buy now. Put it all in paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:06:59
Don't get too bent out of shape. Most of the planet is a Bitcoin noob.
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:45:46
Not to sound snobbish, but I came from a well-to-do family, so every Christmas each child had a penny to suck. 'Pennysuckers' they used to call us.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:55:19
Thank you for that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:51:25
I do yes.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:28:12
Cool good luck with that! What is the profession that pays you in BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:09:57
Several people have said that. I'm a noob (please see name). Why do altcoin buyers need BTC at $2600?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:30:38
Lol why the black moon?
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:39:08
Yes! Forbes says so! GTFO now, this is the Titanic!
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:41:50
Oh coool. That makes complete sense. :)
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:07:20
Please tell me you're kidding. That drop is the most important part of the pattern - the extended final fang.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:41:52
Thanks for that. No I get it. I was confused because I thought the original poster meant people were moving to BTC from their alt positions, which wouldn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:13:11
Yes, I think you are the most right. The whole thing seems artificially bullish to me. People calling for 10x in the coming weeks when all that is pouring in is speculation money.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:43:25
But can you dance...the $2600 black swan??!
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:34:52
Wait, what? No one hates Seinfeld!
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:30:19
Ha! Nice. I This song always reminds me of that Summer of Sam movie.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:39:50
I can't help it!
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:03:36
More like from the bushes "psst, looking for your precious?"
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:22:25
Hey man no one would be happier than me if that happened. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:42:41
Lol this is such a shitpost. Well done! 'when I got my phone back from the evidence department' lol! Sounds like a line from whatever screenplay you're writing.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:42:53
But how do you use it to buy everyday items like groceries?
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:49:57
That was awesome. The QR at the end that no one has ever sent BTC to.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:14:39
Lol you just want me to buy in at 2600 to push your value up further you prick! ;) I've bought it at several prices over the years. 2300 was the highest.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:24:06
Oh Christ, really? Guess I missed that episode. He's got a few screencast episodes that are pretty good. I think the position to get out of Bitcoin is interesting, but I'm assuming most alts are going to also take significant dips through August 2, so it might just make sense to paper wallet any BTC holdings and plug back in after everything blows over.
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:58:11
Lol fair enough. If I could be that nosey aunt for a second: trading what?
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:17:41
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:31:56
Do you really need a Trezor? Wouldn't paper wallets work just as well?
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:24:14
But in a different post weren't you saying you don't use a crypto debit card? How do you pay without a card? I doubt too many retailers are QR code savvy.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:29:50
Quite the opposite.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:10:44
I guess, but that coupled with the uncertain nature of the scene at the moment - I guess I'm the only one that thinks it's a weird time to be bullish?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:11:52
So much speculative money pouring in. It might be optimistic times for the tech, but the current bump in price won't last.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:13:18
Jesus you and your 35 upvoters seriously have no sense of humor.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:40:03
(I'm not defending what's going on. Just saying that a lot of the emotional posts really seem hard to believe.)
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:50:47
1. It's never been higher than $3000.
2. I was under the impression Aug 1 and the short term beyond brings uncertainty.
These two items combined to me suggest it is an abnormal time to be bullish.
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:05:26
Finally! Been waiting for the skull pattern for most of this past year.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:08:24
Trading volume remains low. My guess is the party is over until Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:02:43
No no wait! I'll but some more, then you buy some more at the greatest discount of all time!
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:56:20
I hope I'm reading this right, but to me this excerpt just seems like another example of the old world trying to get its tentacles around new ideas that challenge traditional control structures. Any volatility in Bitcoin's operations will be ironed out organically in the coming decades.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:55:18
Try watching this: 
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:12:05
Ok in the last five minutes the price was adjusted. I swear I'm not crazy! It was 2700+ for hours I swear!
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:54:16
Buy another one, clown. Your grandchildren aren't going to notice unless you're the deadbeat granddad that never bought one. ;)
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:01:39
Ugh tell me about it brother.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:36:31
Cool takeaway point you sometimes forget: entry to a lot of the alts goes through Bitcoin, i.e. you can't buy most alts with fiat cash.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:05:27
'allo. Do you accept Beetcoin? Yes? Give me American burger and vodka. Speciba.

Haha Rick Rolling in the Bitcoin age. Well done
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:59:56
Sorry, I'm a noob (please see name). If a hardfork, would Bitcoin owners effectively own both new currencies (if holding on XAPO, for example)?
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:45:18
Lol nice work dude!
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:02:23
Just that bitcointicker.co site.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:54:50
I can't understand anything you guys are talking about. :'(
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:10:28
Except Ethereum. THere's correction, but it's not in line with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:16:29
Isn't it interesting that ETH correction is more modest than BTC?
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:11:36

@_date: 2017-06-26 17:51:43
This is totally going to be a cringe marker of our times in 20 years. Remember when people used to say 'Get the net' in the 90s as a cool way to point out how clueless someone was?
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:14:53
Yeah but good times picking up more on the ride down ;)
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:51:15
Thank you very much for this info.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:34:48
Wow awesome! And very much appreciate the baby steps approach for supreme n00bs like me (see name). Cheers!
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:58:50
Those exchanges you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:45:02
Yeah Long Dong Silver always gets his man.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:14:05
Ah I see. Yeah let's wait and see. Shanghai Composite is up. My opinion is that the Chinese money is moving back out.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:19:19
Shanghai Composite is recovering and all the cheap Chinese money is leaving, hence the plummet. This is compounded with fearful newbies that don't know about Bitcoin selling off on a loss. A good Bitcoin ticker feed is better than any TV series right now! This is supremely entertaining.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:42:07
Lol you don't know the definition of 'terrorist'.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:19:47
A dollar amount? What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:33:54
Exactly. Yeah the lack of a labeled X or Y axis is kind of suspect. I'm overly bullish on crypto in general but fad images like this are just more smoke.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:12:33
Your family won't think twice in 2025 when the price is $100,000+
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:28:12
Nailsun, I'd just watch it for a while. If you've only started as of last night, it's best to just read up on Blockchain and get a feel for Bitcoin before diving in too deep (unless you've got money to lose, and then by all means get your education through losing it). Everything is new and nothing is certain. Just interesting times for all of us. I remember the advent of pop use of the internet, and this feels very similar. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:45:06
I can explain why this happened: I just bought Bitcoin.
In my life anytime I buy anything its first reaction is to fall through the floor.
You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:39:50
Alright fair enough, but when I woke up yesterday morning it was pushing $2800!
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:34:34
The illuminati perhaps?
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:25:59
To discuss crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:39:14
'Crashes' isn't really the right word, but I guess accuracy doesn't sell newspapers.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:07:22
Do you have any other feedback for me? Thanks
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:04:35
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:43:59
Lol this is great
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:35
BTC holders' tears are the saltiest.
