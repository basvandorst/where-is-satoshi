Don't you think you are limiting this subreddit?  I think the questions that I posed can create a discussion, that was my intent. Why not let someone else answer the questions? why downvote it?

I have gone through the FAQ. The questions that I pose still stand. If you think otherwise, prove me wrong.

It seems you are competent stranger to answer the questions, why are you reluctant to answer?  I feel that the FAQs do not answer the questions directly, that's why I posted.

Well I found reddit.comI'll post these questions there, hopefully I will find more insight.

Thank you for answering. Did they call 911? Have there been known cases where people have involved the police? How did it turn out?

Congrats you are the privileged few in the world who had access to a computer and internet, when the rest of the world did not.  At that same time the rest of the world did have access to a viable currency that was easy to use and accessible.  
[HTTP]( that wikipedia site sure was easy to use.

Thank you, will do.

Thank you for answering. I think it is noble for early adopters in trying to build a new currency from the ground up, I understand why bitcoin was created, but like most have a ton of questions. Won't Bitcoin become taxed in the future when it gains popularity? When banks and governments set their sights on it? How will it avoid these taxes in the future?

well hopefully you can contribute to the post created in   if you change your mind

no I feel it's an opportunity for the community to address these concerns. If it's as easy as scrolling through the FAQs and copy/pasting them here, please do so and prove me wrong.

I am the majority of people... lazy.  The easier it is for someone to understand, the more incline they are to adapt to it.  Look at the rise of new technology that's popular today.  Is it more complicated, or is it user friendly?  You want Bitcoin to progress or become a niche for you and a subreddit? Won't you stand to benefit from Bitcoin becoming more accessible? If so you are approaching it completely wrong.

[Funfact]( I believe window 3.1 came out in 1992 right?
