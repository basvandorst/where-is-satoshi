All else fails, if you sell all the coins on that Ledger Nano S, you can sell the ledger for at least $60

Unfortunately, your btc is gone. Future advice, do alot of research for a good fiat exchange. Sorry you lost your btc, that's alot of money.

Try to wire it instead of an ACH withdrawal. When i first tried to cash out a small amount to see if my bank would accept it, it was first denied, coinbase sent me an email saying my bank denied the transaction, but then said in the same email that they cleared it up and to initiate the transfer again and it went through no problems.

They're working on adopting segwit but can't work on their system stealing and not refunding thousands of dollars and not replying to support tickets. Sounds about right...
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:18:37
Nah it's all the same account, just two separate ways to transfer. If it's not still working it may be on your banks side

I can't upvote this enough ^^^^

Not 100% sure if they'll accept it bc I believe it's on a bank by bank case but they should allow it, at least mine did

It'll be okay. In October/November (when I bought in) it was like 5000, the. By December it was up to 20k. It'll go back up

ACH withdrawal is basically just transferring the funds from your wallet/exchange. The way I do mine is I have coinbase, and my bank acct. Is connected to coinbase, so you just do a withdrawal and select your bank account. I think the fee is like 2% or something. You can also do a direct bank wire, which you can type in your checking/savings acct number and routing number and it wires directly to your bank. The fee from coinbase for a wire is like $10 but I'm pretty sure there's no withdrawal limit on wire transfers. Which exchange or wallet do you have?
Edit: nvm I see u have coinbase. Go to your USD wallet (If that's where your funds are)  and select withdrawal. If you've connected your bank account it should have the acct on a drop down menu, just select your bank acct and hit accept and it should transfer.

Nukecoin ICO presale!

Or they'll use IOTA,  just like maersk and Bosch and other major conglomerates.

That's weird because I have a Chase CC, and it let me buy on coinbase, it just charged me a cash advance fee, so to counter that out, you gotta day trade a little to make that fee back up, then HODL
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:13:30
Invest in all those cool Facebook Token ICOs. Those are the best. Some say you can even get 35% off presale. It's a steal.

Abra, which is still in early stages, but I've heard good things, or binance. Fuck Gemini and their highly long verification times, and fuck coinbase and their scammy as support/platform.
