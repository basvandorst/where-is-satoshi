That's why you always have to wait a few block confirmations to make sure ur txn is not in an orphaned block. After that, Bitcoin blocks are immutable with our current tech.

Is it illegal to do this with commodities though? There weren't trading company stock.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:33:48
No. The comment I replied to was projecting a common fallacy, saying that the OP has not yet lost anything. The OP has lost the difference in value of their bitcoin. Wether or not that loss is enough to prompt them to sell is their choice, but ignoring the loss is not a good move. I always purchase amounts I don't care about losing so I don't have to worry about this.

Sorry but you lose value when your assets depreciate. You can no longer trade them for the same amount of other goods.

You loose your overall potential to acquire other goods when your assets depreciate. You could no longer trade them for the same amount of other goods. Therefore your net worth has dropped.

It's with anything, if you have assets that lose value, they are worth less. You have lost value compared to if you had kept the value in whatever previous form it was in.

I'm no expert on it but from what I can tell it's corporate fluff. If it's publically readable that's a step up from current supply chains, but no reason to have a block chain with out a consensus mechanism (which seems to be proof of.. being a company we trust?).. I'll do some more reading.
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:38:04
Hyperledger is not immutable tho. The block creator and validator nodes are all controlled by companies in the supply chain, so they could all agree to change the blockchain. I don't really get the value over a shared SQL db to be honest... Where they all have backups of it.

There needs to be a better way than localbitcoins to do this. 
My parents live in Argentina and are unable to withdraw dollars and buy pesos at the real rate. They instead bring tons of usd in cash with them every time they come back from home. INSTEAD I explained that they could buy btc and then sell it for pesos (which is at the black market rate to the dollar). But... They are sketched out about doing it. I mean.. I would, but they wont. And most people wont.

I'm in Buenos Aires now. Its nice and hot out. The official rate for the the USD is 6.6. The street price is at an ATH of  10.4. Needless to say I brought a considerable amount of cash with me to change ;). 
On recommendation of a friend of mine, to exchange I walked into a specific ally and looked up at a camera. Upon seeing that I was not the police, a door opened to room with a grate and a person on the other side, similar to a bank. Pretty sketchy but I got my pesos. 
Apparently, there are a few officials that have the authority to convert back to USD at the official rate using the Argentine government, and are making a killing.
Electronics here are twice as expensive as the US, and people are buying new cars as a store of value, due to inflation. People with a lot more pesos buy or build apartment buildings, so there is a lot of construction, and empty apartments. It is not apocalyptic by any means, but most people see the situation getting worse before it improves.

Generate a wallet from a computer that has never and will never be online. Copy that wallet to multiple usb sticks to store in different locations and write down the seed. Then send the coin to an address of that wallet. Along with the wallets keep a copy of the wallet software version you used just in case (I recommend armory).

The internet was a government funded project. Initially ARPANET -&gt; NSFNET for universities to communicate and share computing power in the 60s. TCP came around in the 70s. Billions of government spending over the past 50-60 years has gone to creating the infrastructure and protocols that make the internet work, and let you and me watch cat videos. It is ridiculous that some telecom company should be able to just take it all and skim profit off the top like some mafia organization. The wires they own to your house were even subsidized by taxpayer dollars.
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:13:39
Very true
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:00:15
Why? Pseudonymous p2p transactions are perfect for adult entertainment, and many of these ladies were here well before you were.

Mining bitcoin is not viable, however if you want to explore mining you can mine alt coins and then trade them for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:44:32
hey thanks! what goes in comes out
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:12:42
It is traceable but they are not utilizing that yet. Unless it's a big deal (like Carl Force)
@_date: 2015-03-21 22:29:01
Its the bro thing to do. Also might get somebody to go buy some.
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:27:38
It shouldn't be given to a small group of corporations to ruin. Slow lanes ie: paying an ISP to get traffic going to your business not throttled, will hurt the internet and therefore our economy because it will cut out competition.

That risk is specific to the individual. Coinbase getting hacked vs the individual messing up. Some ppl would have less risk leaving it on coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:18:39
Good idea about the splitting. Will do that. Hopefully the complaints voiced are in the minority and it goes through.. And they don't steal my money as some people on here appear to be worried about. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:40:09
BECAUSE COINBASE WILL NOT VERIFY MY BANK!!! They still have not deposited their cents (been 2 days) so I can confirm. I would have otherwise bought at 330 right before it fell to 300.. But now its rising! THE AGONY
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:21:19
What do you reckon it will balance out to in a month or so? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:46:57
Yah it seems pretty high, I have looked at charts and I assume it will dip, (also tons of ppl selling right now) not as drastically as after april, but then I will buy in. Very excited though. Thank you for the advice. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:54:17
SSSHHH ayye yahhh thats the stuff
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:08:16
I worry that I will sell to the bubble.. And then it will go to the m00n
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:49:24
I'm 20% in right now. Once my investment triples I'll sell 1/3 to eliminate risk. 
Put enough so it would hurt to loose, but wouldn't break you. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:34:08
Also we need to USE our bitcoins. Add an extra $100 with the intent to buy $100 worth of goods with BTC that you would have otherwise bought using visa, mastercard exc. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:53:33
If you bought it at under 100 its not a loss.
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:34:32
yes. GODDAM MOTHUFCKIN 350 now and look at that beautiful wave thats happening
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:42:48
Its gonna drop in a bit, to bitstamp 360 or 370.. Then go up a bit more to 450+ depending. Then start descending back to whatever the actual floor is. JUS WATCH (over the next 1-2 days). 
This is 100% true, I am from the future.
But I still cant buy or sell because my bitstamp confirmation has yet to go through. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:57:41
I hadnt even checked my email in 2 days.. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:19:50
Do you live in BA? Have people started buying BTC? I hear its like 8 pesos to $1 now on the 'blue market' 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:21:15
"For a small (but vocal) group" lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:20:36
But for the semantics yes I suppose you are correct.

Oh my this looks very nice. I wish I had seen this before.. I just bought at 374 off of localbitcoins.

sweet. I converted to fiat up at higher prices as well. May steal your tactic!
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:56:27
As a noob it is actually reassuring to know what to do, not to get hacked. I know people get hacked, heres one! DO THIS INSTEAD TO BE SAFE. Thanks op for the post. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:43:06
THANKS OBAMA
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:19:50
Thanks, I have the bank. But I just read a bunch of posts about coinbase flagging orders and not returning money to people. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:30:48
Is that tattooed on your arm?

okdokie, here goes
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:40:08
Honestly I dont even have the coins from them from that purchase. (Due to the bubble). But they will come through at the rate I bought them at a week ago. 
I think it will improve as these growing pains become less and less and less extreme.

Just like the initial investors of any new tech. I don't think everyone's looking to make a 'quick' buck, just an easy one.

If you value your wealth in bitcoin why would trade in and out of USD, an inflating currency? Sillyness!
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:51:32
I just bought at 370, (btstamp) a record high, and I'm glad I did. If you buy and it drops just hold and wait a few months, not the end of the world. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:51:27
Majority of ppl now seem to be using bitstamp.. What is its reputation?
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:38:48
Honestly though, I just didn't think it would take so long.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:06:30
Referring to property gained or lost though, you only gained after your initial investment of 10 (at that sub 100 price). You just didnt gain as much as you could have, had you held.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:55:46
Can you mine it?

Hey there! Fellow recent adopter here. I was able to buy just fine from coinbase before the huge bubble that just happened. It took them a little under a week to make the two deposits and then it was seamless.. My advice: Wait a week or so for them to catch up and learn about how to use armory in the meantime.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:36:45
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:17:46
If you had a screen there showing the current price.. And you sold them for around that.. I would say that this is a good idea.
