It means you can't use the dollar currency without contributing to the death of innocent people. They are linked together, its not a case of it being a currency used for good or bad. Its value is derived from human suffering.

They should be stored as doubles.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:45:49
I suspect as much. When they began trading BCH they kept halting trade when the price was about to drop due to big sell walls.
They also opened USD/BCH first and have yet to open BCH/BTC or BCH/EUR to slow down the mass sale of BCH and it being short sold for BTC.

Yer man is Irish slang for 'that guy over there'. 
In this case it refers to Satoshi.
The first words of his white paper are "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". A lot of these Roger Ver supporters claim that BCash is close to this, but Satoshi himself removed the peer to peer functions and there are no peer to peer functions with either BCH or BTC. Saying BCash is closer to Satoshi's vision is ridiculous based on the first line of his white paper.

True, but for the moment Bitcoin is far more ethical than the dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:34:07
They want to sell BCH they've presumably gotten very cheaply rather than BTC.
The single merit of BCH is its lower fees due to low usage.
Without the high fees in BTC, BCH has 0 value. 
They're not paying the fees their users are and they don't give a fuck.

In the mean time until a scaling solution is in place you could use practically any other crypto for tiny amounts.

There's no denying that bitcoin has run into scaling issues as others will too, but there are also actively developed alternatives like Litecoin/Vertcoin/Monero etc.. that are distinctly different enough to avoid confusion. Litecoin being the first to market with a scaling solution. Cash doesn't fill a niche or market.
The valuation although I'm surprised it hasn't dropped to 1k again, doesn't indicate success on its own, there are also millions of coins that were not made available that have yet to be dumped.

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:26:24
I'd agree with that, an extra MB might be just the ticket. I think its important that any other scaling solutions are done first though and the size limit be the last resort, if the chain bloats up it can't go back.
I don't think the devs have ever said they would never scale up in blocksize, could be wrong though.

They could do one more massive increase to push away people running their own nodes and have big controlled master nodes and then have the freedom to fuck with it all they want, allow the rewriting and release of the genesis block, who knows. One dev and two psychopaths are not to be trusted.
Increasing the blocksize is obviously a last resort.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:51:51
I'd have to see it myself. 
They can either squeeze more into each block, make the blocks bigger or allow off chain scaling.
I'd like to see how they plan on compressing hashes as they are against off chain scaling and find the concept an offense to satoshi's vision and completely unsecure etc despite it working fine.
Other than increasing the size it doesn't look like there is anything on the horizon.
As for the future of the coin in general, nothing seems very long term about it all. Blocksize increase is a quick patch they'll have to do more often each year.
If they were focused on the long term rather than trying to fuck over everyone in a hurry they wouldn't just go for the easy way out and increase the blocksize.
Ethereum is moving to proof of stake, blocksize won't be a long term issue for them and their blockchain is a lot smaller I believe.

This is the thing about paying for shill accounts and twitter posts:
The difference is BTC is working on scaling before increasing the blocksize limit. Doing it in the right order is very important. High fees right now is a good trade off imo to protect against bloat.

Why wouldn't Roger Ver advocate another fork when it isn't the way he wants it?
The Bitcoin devs doing this would destroy Bitcoin, not sure his BCH followers would be bothered by it or it would be just marketed as getting free coins or something. That's assuming his inevitable super nodes aren't completely under his control.
He sold them on a bogus scaling solution, he can do it again.
Seriously, they are putting their faith in one guy who has proven to be nefarious. Its not FUD at all. BTC would be fucked if they tampered with the 21million limit.

When it was said to Roger in the famous interview he didn't deny it, just changed the subject.
Also asking about something is very different to asserting known inaccuracies about block chain.
Getting bigger isn't the same thing as dealing with scaling.
When 8mb isn't big enough are they going to make it 16? Then 32 then 64 ....
Where does it end?
A scaling solution would be one that mitigates this exponential growth factor.
The blocks being filled up is BCH getting closer to large fees.
Roger talking about MtGox days prior to its collapse:
You trust this guy with the development of a cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:40
I would fully agree. They're being purposefully destructive. There are tons of sock puppet accounts claiming that Bitcoin Core is an alt coin or a hijack attempt, its the classic blame your enemies for what you're doing strategy.
Check out this post where a guy posts a ton of links to reddit comments talking nonsense about segwit:
Puppets referencing puppets.
It'll be interesting to see what happens if BCH outgrows its pump and dump phase and they are forced to either implement actual scaling or just admit that its centralized and controlled by a guy who has a tantrum when people don't believe his lies.
As you say, the proof is there, if they had an improvement they wouldn't need to rely on the Bitcoin name and it could stand on its own.
I heard that Roger Ver runs his own sock puppet and account trading website, ever heard of that or know the url?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:31:10
That's not generally how forking is supposed to work, don't have to always fork the original. Why do you think its obviously that way?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:49:13
Calling it a fight over branding is being too generous to them. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, everything else isn't. If that was their actual intention they would make a better alt coin with its own name and prove to Bitcoin their ideas are better in turn forcing their hand to adopt their changes/improvements. They are damaging the whole crypto market with their nonsense and short term views regarding scaling.
In my opinion all currencies are ponzi schemes, just big enough to maintain a surplus while new people enter and old people die, so I'm not sure how to reply to your second point :)
Its phishing in that its made to look genuine in order to get users money in their system.
I agree though that such disputes aren't for Google or any old world company to sort out but that's the realm in which Roger Ver is trying to trick people. He's using Google to trick people, at the very least Google should know how their system is being abused.

Libra is infinitely printable money that doesn't require a printer. What is the exchange rate between Bitcoin and grains of sand?
Google tells me 1 grain of sand weighs 0.00000044kg
1 grain = 0.00000044kg
40kg of high quality plastering sand = $4
1kg of sand = $0.1
1 grain of sand = $0.000000044
1 Libra = 0.000000000004 BTC
Not even a Satoshi.
That's being generous as quality sand is very labour intensive and is an essential building requirement, really this should be compared to beach sand which is free. The only difference is its harder to trick people into investing in sand.

I think you've confused the term centralized with monolithic.

This is pure nonsense. Its strength is derived from it being the most decentralized.

From your other posts it seems you are intent on continuing to hold a misunderstanding of what centralization is which can only serve to confuse others. Good day.
If there's a chance you are being genuine.. centrality means there is an entity that can make changes to the protocol. In a decentralized system you need mass consensus as everyone has to make that change in order for the network to change as desired.

I don't know why but I'm going to try it again as what you are saying is plain wrong. You either don't understand the words you are using or you are actively trying to mislead people.
You don't need to compare it to forms of government.
The centre in decrentralised is ownership and control. In the case of a protocol is the settings of the rules defined in the source code.
Bitcoin is a protocol which is a set of rules, once everyone dances the same dance, or obeys the same rules the network exists. The protocol includes rules to enforce only interacting with others enforcing the same or similar rules within reason.
Not sure why you need to insist on comparing them to historic forms of government control. Its like you've compared Bitcoin to apples and are now trying to explain where the seeds and stalks are. The best sense I can make form what you are writing is that there is a single chain.

Prohibiting drugs artificially inflates the price, the same would likely happen to bitcoin. If the price of mining a coin isn't just the power costs but the risk of jail time as well they will be worth a lot more.

There are so many funny coins these days and options for mining on GPU they may not become affordable over night as quickly as they became expensive.

They shilled BCash for a while. Not a reputable source.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:17:19
So true, when they are taking about bitcoin they can't just state "x" amount was confiscated as it can be proven.
If they don't show public keys, assume they are lying outright.

Fuck CNBC. BCash and Tether shills.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:16:59
Nah, Coinbase should stop selling Bitcoin and fuck right off. 
If they believe BCash is Bitcoin they should sell only BCH and they may close and open their markets all they like as they go out of business. 
They tried setting the price of BCH to $9500 when they opened trading. Dodgy as fuck.
Coinbase are toxic.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:27:18
Bitcoin is not an ERC20 token. ERC20 tokens are not mined.
That hard limit in Bitcoin is dictated by the node software and would be very difficult to get consensus for everyone to change it. As far as I know it is an arbitrary number you could describe as being conjured out of thin air. Different coins have different limits in this regard.
If I created my own ERC20 token on ethereum I would issue as many as I believed is appropriate for myself to distribute them to whomever.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:24:35

I don't see how new types or names would help that and the public will figure it out no problem if it becomes so common.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:57:46
They still stink of Roger Ver, the owner and controller of BCash.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:28:12
Its free as in free beer. How is it licensed? 
They could change their mind like they have done before, hence the third E, extinguish.
They have burned any trust they are assuming they have.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:43:57
Their history is of copying others, EEE, breaking standards, lock-in models, closed source and publishing buggy unfinished projects.
I'd be cautious of becoming dependent on any of their tools and using any of their tools with crypto coins.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:34:27
Happy to help.
New users might think bitcoin.com is legitimate.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:53:07
Is that definitely locked at the point the contract is created? It does look that way after I've been googling it there.
There is also this part in the contract:
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Owner can transfer out any accidentally sent ERC20 tokens
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    function transferAnyERC20Token(address tokenAddress, uint tokens) public onlyOwner returns (bool success) {
        return ERC20Interface(tokenAddress).transfer(owner, tokens);
    }
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:06:19
Same reason.  An integer does not store enough data to store numbers with a lot of decimal numbers. Doubles shouldn't have the same problem with floats where a large number's decimal points are truncated to save space.
Was told in college that banks must always use doubles and round when displaying only. When I look it up, I'm getting confusing results, its possible its Long we were told to use. 
edit: Yea, I think its Decimal in SQL I'm confusing it with.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:25:34
How many BCH would it take?
bitcoin.com promotes fake Bitcoin.
Wouldn't you need to trade a percentage of the daily trade volume rather than being in the 'top 1%'?

Good for BCH only, they open and close the market to protect its value.

Without replay protection it is designed to replace bitcoin core. If it does a few companies will control the code not the bitcoin core devs.
Whether it is an upgrade or not(it isn't, its a version behind the core project) isn't as important as making sure a few millionaires don't take control of it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:41:15
People trying to attain control or influence over Bitcoin by distributing distorted news to their user base.
Bullshit merchants:
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:05:18
Banks should be using bitcoin rather than being in fear of it replacing them.
They could make loans possible and act as a user interface.
Its the central banks which are need of replacement and will be replaced by crypto.

The blockchain can't issue you a loan or mortgage and it can't insure coins and undo payments.

Bitcoin itself is no longer the offender for high GPU prices.

He is an inconsistent compulsive liar.
To believe him you would have to believe that Bitcoin Cash existed before Bitcoin Core took it over and at the same time believe that Bitcoin Cash is the solution to Bitcoin's fee problems last November/December. Its clearly nonsense and his community has a terrible time trying to keep it straight.
He doesn't have to convince buyers/users, he only has to convince a few that there are a lot of people that believe him enough that can be profited from. Hence the Alex Jones pump.
On rBtc they openly talk about strategy and talking points when engaging with other users while also sharing theories of 'Core' mass organizing sock puppets and propaganda and the occasional attempt to rewrite history.
At first I was annoyed by their fraud but I suspect now that the only people left holding BCH bags are people trying to fuck over their fellow man and make bank on pump and dumps same as BitConnect. Its hard to have sympathy for them.
He'll be sending out misspelled emails soon enough.
