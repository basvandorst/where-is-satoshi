It's funny. I went to USD to wait for some downside on BTC, and instead it fucking flew. My investment is safe in USD, but now i'm like "muh potential profits!"
My best friend told me to wait, too. Ah well. Enjoy getting rich without me, you fuckers

Why would you margin trade?
I flipped 0.04 btc that was gifted to me into 0.9 all through regular trading. 
Margin trading is too much risk for too little reward

You can't know that with certainty, just like the naysayers can't know that crypto will fail.
I admire your enthusiasm though. I'm holding on long term as well.
