To think, all this time, I’ve copying an address into a “to” field, entering an amount, and THEN I still have to swipe to send! 
Oh, wait.. that’s still only three steps, with no up front configuration. I think on-chain BCH wins this round.

She’s pro crypto because she wants to use it to charge negative interest rates on cash.

Maybe you could put a couple vertical lines through the S? Oh, wait.. that symbol has already been taken.

Now send a payment to “Iran,” and tell us what happens. I dare you :)

I’m a BCH fan, and even I wouldn’t short BTC. 
Never bet against Elon Musk or bitcoin, I say.

The irony..

I wish they accepted coins, as their name implies.

What does it say about the Bit license when the owner of the NYSE can’t easily get one?

If you want to buy something online without subjecting your credit card to repeat billing, bitcoin works perfectly in that case.

Bcash users be like, “Why bother with a second layer when our fees are less than a cent, and confirmations nearly instant?”

A far superior way would be to store this in an encrypted format. OSX lets you right click on a folder and encrypt it with a password. Windows probably can do the same. Use a randomly generated list of at least 4-6 words to generate your password (there are password generators that can generate words for you, or you can use Diceware- a numbered list of words where you roll dice to create a password in a truly random fashion.)
The irony here is that you’d be using a set of 4-6 words to encrypt a list of 24 words, but it’s still an order of magnitude more secure than your zip file.
But definitely encrypt it in some way if you’re going to save it in an email.
Edited comment to clarify that the encryption requires a password, and changed 12 words to 24, since I messed up my original response.

The reason you don’t want to keep your funds on Coinbase is not that Coinbase might get hacked. The more likely scenario is that someone breaks into your account. Posing as you, they withdraw the funds to a wallet they control, and you can’t get them back.
That’s why you want a hardware wallet.

Meanwhile, BCH is getting Schnorr signatures in about a week. Maybe you guys can catch up!

If it makes you feel better, they set bullshit targets for stocks, too.

So the market follows BCH now?

It seems like you’re asking two different questions at once.
If your coins are on an exchange, they are vulnerable to “hacking” in the sense that someone could break into your account- for example, if they knew the email address you used and guessed your password, or if you reused a password from some other site that got hacked, or you used a weak password. Most crypto exchanges will prompt you to use two factor authentication, where in addition to a password, you need to supply a code from your phone, but there are ways of getting around this as well. (People have convinced phone companies to move a person’s phone number to a phone they control. Probably rare, but it happens.)
For this reason, it’s generally recommended that you use a hardware wallet or paper wallet.
In the latter case (paper or hardware wallet) for someone to “steal your private key,” they would have to guess the 12 or 24 words used to generate the key. This is basically impossible, although typing the words into a computer makes them more vulnerable to interception than writing them down with pen and paper. 
A good rule of thumb is not to treat an exchange like a bank, because you don’t have the same assurances a bank could give you. Use an exchange to trade coins, either for fiat or other coins, then move them to a wallet you control. Hardware wallet is best. If you keep your list of words safe, your funds should be safe.
Hope that helps.
