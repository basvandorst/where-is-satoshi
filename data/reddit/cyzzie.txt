i'm happy that i live in a country where paypal wont be able to do this (germany) as you are never allowed to "auto opt in" someone just by ToS if its related to marketing

I totally endorse that people can stay anonymous in this world.
But you cannot have both, someone who wants to stay anonymous  - in my view - cannot win prices, so if Satoshi Nakamoto should be interested in being a nominate for Nobel prize (i would like that) he would need to come forward as a person first and stop being an anonymous entity.

the company running adblock plus is sketchy at best, google about it - supporting adblock plus is not the right way.
furthermore adblock plus currently nearly blocks EVERY bigger affiliate network - regardly of the way they are advertised, which blocks a major income of many websites that actually do produce awesome content, without using banners , popups etc - nothing that could annoy any user.

i'd rather compare it to real money ... you accept money, but dont check everything whether its a fake or real note ... you only start checking from a certain value, like 100 euro ... its the same with bitcoin, if you sell coffee you dont check every small transactions, if you sell more expensive stuff, you have to understand double spending and how to make sure you are not affected by it
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:21:57
thats actually a quipu afaik
we took the name qipu from "qipu road" in china which is a marketplace for cheap and (sadly) a lot of fake stuff :)
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:28:19
Yup since yesterday, BTC price for purchase currently fixed at 400 euro, awesome. Qipu.de is a sister company of quidco.com so maybe UK is lucky too at some point
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:02:25
in a way, i just dont know of "adblock"  when i talk about adblock i mean adblock plus, which is run by a german company.
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:24:21
i cannot judge for everyone, but i wouldnt buy at your site cause it looks like a joke ... i mean as a joke its quite funny with the 6 bottle, now we are talking stuff etc ... but if i am buying my money somewhere, i expect something that gives me this "secure" feeling - which your site does not at all. 
it might not matter, as a german i am probably not your target group anyway

the article is slightly wrong / misleading
thats the real source, its basically a "comment" on the legality of bitcoin, and crypto/virtual currency in generall, they are all illegal and HAVE BEEN long before that article, just because of the recent media etc the central bank thought they needed to clarify this,
but it affects all kind of ... well i dont know how to explain it, "surrogate" currencies, non-real-currencies, not only bitcoin.

lets instead use adblock edge:
and not support sponsored whitelists
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:01:38
okay i think we had a misunderstanding, i have it in "always on" mode too if you mean it that way, i just whitelist all pages that i think deserve the money, and that i visit regularly
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:54:31
is bitcoin working on a "mass scale" for english users in your eyes?
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:19:08
which is exactly whats happening here, a lot of people are calling it, a lot of people are ignoring it.
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:55:22
i dont know, since its existence i stopped using it,
google was reported to pay for being on it, maybe check their faq
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:27:28
i disagree, as i think advertising is a valid business model, it worked fine for magazines, i am totally fine with it for websites, but not with popups, popunder, things that make sound or hurt my eyes etc.
i agree that i rarely click on them - like in advertising it works best for branding or introducing new technologies ... not for get slim in 10 day programs.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:25:50
not if you pay to be on it. adblock edge has a community driven whitelist for that.
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:21:37
well, if you think that way you cannot wonder why a lot of merchants wont use it ... recurring payments are an imporant feature as really many people automatically pay then even though they might not even use the service, just because they forget about this, ~ this often makes up more than just a fraction of a business like 20% or so,
so recurring bitcoin payments are a really important feature if you want more service providers to acceppt bitcoins.

they dont accept any kinds of donations anymore, they used to have a donation button, which was removed.
afaik its some coders who do it in their spare time, not a company like adblock plus is
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:40:31
you actually dont want to dicuss, you want other people to find a solution for you, cause you are happy with the status quo
@_date: 2015-05-06 00:13:40
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:37:49
the fairness depends on your usage of it... if you just use it in always on mode - yes that totally isnt fair, if you use it in a way that you whitelist all the sites that you regularly use and that do advertising in non intrusive way that doesnt spam you with popups, sounds, flashing stuff etc ... then its totally ok
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:01:11
are they?
it would be new to me that a bank is legally required to report you if they know you transfered to another bank that is mainly used to buy illegal stuff?
i know they are legally required to report you if they think you're laundering money, but thats about it.
(my tiny wisdom is based on german laws though!)

i never liked blatant copycats either. even if they would handle certain things better. they are ripping of the functionality and even the design of reddit. 
it would feel wrong to leave one company for bad business practices for another company that uses bad business practices
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:18:53
sites like qipu and quidco work by earning and affiliate commission cause they send you off to a merchant where you purchase something, but instead of keeping the commission they pay most of it back to you 
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:59:54
no thats quipu
its named after qipu road, the place for cheap fakes :)

i agree on the 1% part, i dont think it would drive much either, - as i said it might lead do some people investigating about bitcoin.
and the rest of course was just my personal oppinion to help him, in the end finding the "absolute truth" about why noone is using bitcoin on that specific site might not possible
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:29:26
very misleading topic, fidor is not moving anywhere, they are just opening branches in other countries but the main instutition stays in germany.
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:03:03
but nothing does ... so i can just tell what MY reason would be to not buy there, and maybe the bitcoin community is just a bit more "aware" of these things cause they are usually more concerned about privacy issues, technology, scamming etc, they are certainly "in average" more tech savvy.
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:33:15
which of the two questions shall we answer?
quick cash? no
Little money? maybe ... you can try it out with cloud mining, for instance genesis-mining.com where you can buy mining power for as little as 15$ ... at the corrent bitcoin price and difficulty it should take about a year to get your 15$ back, afer that you earn something ... so in the end its speculation, you should do it more for the experience and for the fun ~ it COULD yield more money, by just buying bitcoins though
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:39:24
despite the fact that i dont buy soccer shirts,
i wouldnt buy at your site cause it doesnt look trustworthy - and i have a strong radar for that.
the fact that you post here tells me, that this is mainly a problem of your design and not about whether i should doubt you.
things you could change to make your site look &amp; feel more trustworthy:
- put your products first (your whole upper area is about discounts and what customers a saying - this is usually what asian scam sites do)
- dont use that many colors, it looks like it has been designed by an amateur
- detect &amp; greet international customers (i.e. if you see someone comes froma european IP dont select us dollar as currency)
- dont sticky the facebook/g+ etc crap
- rethink your target customer (Currently this seems to be either wholesale buyers or team-captains, as someone who wants to buy shirts just for him, i quickly feel lost / wrong)
thats just what comes in mind at first, surf yourself at some pages of big fashion sellers, and see what you can figure out yourself.
and as others say - if you are saving money for orders in bitcoin you might offer a little discount, and even if its just &lt;=1% - this might lead to some people gaining interest in bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:14:58
i would be interested in the exact opposite ... PAYING people in bitcoins
i.e. as an example (as the actual thing is much harder to explain) what about when people win money on some casino like website, and they can chose bitcoins as a payout method.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:00:06
yeah we give free drinks / coffee too, plus fresh fruit :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:14:10
your page is unusuable without javascript enabled (or Noscript whitelisting) yet doesnt give a warning to users that have it disabled, thus i tried to register and nothing happened
also what ever framework you use, allows to do a lot of url tinkering like calling this url:
(Very bad Routing)
which sets of a huge cascade of 404 erros (call the page with any addon that shows HTTP protocol stream like live http headers in firefox)
currently withdrawing funds gives errors with invalid bitcoin address? (tried wikileaks wallet) i suppose thats because withdrawals are just completely disabled on beta?
settings page doesnt let me chose my timezone but instead autodetects it ... but i still have to click / activate the only possible value in the settings page, which makes it pointless, either you let me chose ... or you autodetect.
last: as far as i can see you are using gmail / google for business as mail provider but havent added a SPF record for your domain yet, please do this to make phishing harder
exploit testing esp vs possible injection or xss attacks is far easier if you take a consultant for a day that can access code etc, given this might be the more expensive approach but in the end could save your ass
good luck! :)

 wow the title. rakuten is not only a japanese retailer. they already bought so many international companies like linkshare. they are huge

using bitpay theres little to no reason to not accept bitcoins,  so why shouldnt there be a big chance?
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:24:02
wait ... what?
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:29:32
you still can switch to a "remarketing" model and continue using paypal
just dont send paypal users bitcoins right away but build some kind of task/cronjob that checks once a week if there are any customers that purchased for the first time, and then sent them a
Did you know purchases come with free delivery?
Wanna try out bitcoin, heres your first 0.10 BTC 
as long as its not "bundled" with the purchased of btc direcly, paypal cannot do shit.
Also you got my respect for just stopping paypal right away - i wouldnt have done the same.
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:52:04
probably in the appropiate category photos/art or so and not under hardware
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:53:29
its a very general reason as this applies to ANY KIND of sale with paypal with a "user" and not a company with a reputation.
also charge backs can happen with nearly any kind of transfer, and when its between "private" entities, you will allways have a hard time doing anything, thats why usally // in most countries it isnt possible to do transactions between private users that allow for chargebacks.
if someone has a good reputation and then screws you, you're screwed, thats about it, either you misjudged his reputation, or "shit happens"
the only reason why you might not want paypal to use for bitcoin because the paypal TOS explicitly tells you to
not buy or sale digital currency with paypal, (check PayPal Acceptable Use Policy  3 h) you're not allowed to use paypal for transactions that involve currency exchanges or check cashing businesses
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:00:11
i disagree a bit, while the facts about bitcoin where correct it was stillt typical german bullshit tv , as they just went into ANY shop they found and tried to pay with bitcoin ... also the reporter guy acted as if he was 85+ and retarded most of the time.

do they still? in germany they dont anymore
@_date: 2013-06-17 17:38:37
why would it increase difficulty when they "run" products some days (or even weeks) ahead before the customer does it? it might raise it a bit earlier but in the end its no difference
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:32:13
so this is money that is now "dead" and taken out of the pool of bitcoin?  the bitcoin/blockchain doesnt really have a countermeasure for missing/unused/dead money right? or is there any chance that this confiscated money will ever go "back" into trade
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:33:35
typical (in smaller companies) would be not having snacks at all, but usually if anything except cofee and whater is available you have to pay for it (same price that you'd have to pay in a supermarket)
