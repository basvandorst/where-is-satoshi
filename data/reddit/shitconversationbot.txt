Sorry I meant there's no trusted centralized service offering customer service and protection. The bitcoin are held in escrow in a 2 of 3 sig wallet. The 3rd party is the  "trusted moderator" that offers their escrow service for a fee. The problem is finding a "trusted moderator" that consumers actually recognize and trust. You not only have to shop for the product you want, but also for a trustworthy escrow service to complete the transaction. It adds a level of complication/friction that an average shopper would not be comfortable with. I'm sure the assumption is that a reputable escrow service that provides the best experience will become recognizable and trusted if they provide better/cheaper service, but it would take many many transactions and positive reviews meanwhile I can go to amazon this instant and not have to worry about ANY of these issues.

Lol nope

Ok so if the buyer chooses the escrow service, what is there to keep an escrow service from always siding with buyers to get themselves better ratings thus more business &amp; screwing sellers even worse than a centralized shopping site?
 
Would this force sellers to start only accepting certain escrow services that are more likely to favour them?
Meanwhile, without having to worry about escrow services, I bought something on Amazon and it's getting here tomorrow &amp; if it breaks in a month I can get my money back
My point is just because it's decentralized doesn't mean it's efficient or useful or inherently "Good"
On another note I think this might be fine for an etsy like market but there's no way it can ever compete with a centralized shopping site in scale. Shipping and prices will always be higher than amazon and customer service worse. One off products like art, clothes, etc. could potentially work but I saw a seller trying to sell amazon fire tv sticks on OB for $50. $10 more than amazon. Wtf is that?

That's all fine and dandy for the sellers, but they have to have someone to sell to. No one is going to use it unless it's cheaper/easier/faster/more reliable than amazon/ebay/jet etc. Not to mention customer service. What if you buy something that turns out to be broken or not as advertised? There's plenty of good reasons to have to do a charge back on a PayPal transaction. There's no customer protection and no real incentive for shoppers to use it IMO. I certainly wouldn't buy from OB unless I know it's a trusted seller with lower prices and better service than any alternative site.

So shopping twice for buying one product. Seems like way too much friction for Joe consumer when it's already hard enough to get Bitcoin for those that don't already have it stashed.

They still have all your info after it's uninstalled

They deserve negative reviews if they do something shitty. Every company has to deal with PR. It's mine, and many other users' opinions, the way circle operated was shitty. Leaving a bad review is both letting the company know their users think they suck and a warning to any other potential consumers to avoid said shitty product. If the company doesn't like it they can change to make their customers happy or they can bleed out.

Wait so you actually work for circle?  . ... No fucking way. You have to be kidding now, that's too fucking hilarious if it's true. I gotta screencap this shit now
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:07:09
No, the company has to make a profit. It's hard to do that if the company turns its own customers against itself. 
So in your imaginary world companies could do whatever the hell they want without any regard to their own customers or public opinion? Yeah ok bud

Wtf are you talking about? I used the app to buy bitcoin several times and sent it to my own wallet address where I would spend or save it accordingly. I've never used it to send anyone else fiat, that's what other, better apps are for like paypal, venmo, squarecash, etc. This app was used by the majority of its original userbase to buy bitcoin, then they pulled that out. At first I thought you were just fucking with me, but now I think you may actually be retarded so I feel kinda bad for you
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:10:01
I "bought" the use of their service by giving up my personal info to them and giving them transaction fees. They switched their core service so now they still have my payment "info" but offering no useful service to me. If you can't understand this simple concept you have much bigger problems cluttering up your simple mind, like remembering to breathe.
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:22:10
I think them losing money is bullshit. They sold bitcoin with "no fees" because they rolled their fees into their quoted btc price so I don't see how they could be losing that much money. Kind of a shady way to go about marketing their fees, but understandable at least from a business perspective. 
Yes, users CHOSE to use the app,  but only because it provided very specific service. That service was taken away. You  still following? The bitcoin service was the bait and taking away that service and replacing it with another shitty fiat transfer app was the switch. Get it? I have uninstalled it, but that doesn't make circle any less shitty of a company. Now shut the fuck up troll I'm done with you.

This guy really doubled down on the stupid. He had it running for 2 years only got $5000 fine and a year probation

No it would be like leaving a 1-star review for yep yelp if they removed all restaurant reviews from their service.  The vast majority of circle's users installed the app for the feature of instantly buying bitcoins which circle advertised in the beginning, but removed it after they had already built a large user base. These users now have no use for the app and feel like they were baited and switched into giving up their info just to have circle become another shitty fiat transfer app that they would never use. I'm not going to remove yelp because they don't sell bitcoin *because they never sold bitcoin*, but if they took down all their restaurant reviews, which is my primary use for the app, then you better believe I would uninstall it and leave a 1-star review. 
Tl;dr you're shit-terrible at analogies
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:05:44
Because I provided it in exchange for their service, which they fundamentally changed. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:06:19
That's not really analogous since circle didn't close their business. 
 It would be more like if I gave all my credit card info to the Dominos app for online delivery. I order my pizza and all is good until out of the blue they started selling lemons instead of pizza. I don't have any use for lemons because it's not fucking pizza, so yes I would rate the Dominos app one star in that case.
They're continuing their business with user info they got from a bait and switch scam. It's shady af and that's why users are shitting on them in reviews. It's really not a difficult concept to follow bud

Except they're wayyyy outnumbered and scared shitless by all of us. This is is all an attempt to stop us from organizing into something they can't control.
