Yeah, trusting the "GPU cluster" doesn't make sense to me. It was really late when I was reading it, but I wave my hands around that point in my stream of tweets :D

It just sentences the current form of Bitcoin Maximalism to death. Of course distributed database research from the 80s-90s already did that. :|

Although you mention this in the paper, the way you phrase it here is much easier to understand.
Generally, I like how the blog post is written, I really like the code examples. I also like the PoW-feel to the whole thing, but that also works against it. I think the unusual trust model, difficulty of treat modeling and expensiveness of operating the timechain make its adoption unlikely.
If this could be done with a cleaner trust model it would be better, but I think that would require not relying on PoW/assumptions about hash power.

Even in that situation I can see a dramatically lowered TCO in a number of business cases. The goto example at this point is decentralized Uber. It's difficult to parse what you mean here, so maybe triple entry accounting is a better example.


huh. 


Sure, but there are many practical cases where entities have different security requirements; PoW is ludicrously expensive when compared to every other consensus system I have been able to find in the literature.

This looks like a scam to you?
Does it go all the way to the top? Are black helicopters involved? You can execute contracts on the testnet right now, how is that a scam?

I can run contracts on Ethereum right now, do you understand?

I can't really be bothered to follow most cryptocurrency stuff, but I take serious issue with the "whitepaper" trend as well, it needs to stop.

If these people can run contracts today, where exactly was the deception?

You should add an excerpt of this at the top of your paper, it explains a lot :D
@_date: 2015-04-13 01:21:42
This is misleading because other factors are what limit scalability, not the limitations of TCP/IP. (I don't know how to parse the client-server part so I am just ignoring it.)
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:23:21
Then why did they invest in a platform for running contracts? and what evidence do you have that these people were this naive?

How did you come to the conclusion that Ethereum is just about Ether? Rather, how did you decide that it's about anything besides decentralized computation?

It is not byzantine fault tolerant. Also, not all use cases are an optimal fit to MongoDB's concurrency model, which is why there is Riak/Cassandra.
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:21:49
You are correct, a smart contract system can be used to assist with adjudication, but that is an extremely weak version of smart contract. Ethereum based-systems use a stronger form. In fact, I think most blockchain[sic] based systems are stronger. Given the context, I assumed you were talking about system that can be used/played-with today, like Ethereum.
Can you provide an example, outside of DRM, where a smart contract was used as an aid in adjudication?

I am being particular about my language, because I think that's the root of the confusion I very intentionally did not use the word blockchain at any point.
I don't want to speculate, can you please explain to me how bitcoin escrows value? (I will anticipate your response with a hint to my answer:

There is no "machine judge", this is enormously important and the root of nearly all the confusion. Smart contracts are protocols, if the action is illegal, it never happens in the first place! There is no arbitration or judgment **post facto**, the illegal action simply never happens. So when the contract is signed and committed to a block that means everyone **already** judged it to be legal. This is why the transaction doesn't  need to be explicitly bonded. The entities "entering into the contract" use their Proof of Stake as a bond. (For the sake of completeness: that proof of stake can be external to system which executes the contract. The proof of stake may also be valued in such a way that there is no explicit mapping of bond value to transactions within the network executing the contracts.) 
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:19:45
It's really only half of a system because it doesn't actually provide a document or even a link to a document.
Also, there is no smart contract here, there is no assertion that those hashes map to anything. Staking things to blockchains like this very weak because you can't reference the actual thing. Gnutella is about as useful in a court case. (I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advise :)

I have read the actual manuals, and been thinking about these problems since before bitcoin (as evidenced by my patent in the space). Byzantine fault tolerant consensus systems are really difficult to reason about, that's why no one has actually put one into production before bitcoin and why you're having a difficult time communicating with Eris about their value proposition. Neither one of you is wrong per se, but they are offering an extremely valuable product in spite of their fairly horrible explanation of its properties. :D

Do you have any knowledge of cryptographic primitives or do you just know about "blockchain technology"?
What Eris is doing has more to do with distributed databases than it does with Bitcoin, this thread shouldn't even be in this subreddit.

Typos aside, you write like a child.
Can you make any assertions stronger than a simple negation?
Using the above logic no database makes any sense because it's not secured by 'something enormous'?
At first I thought you were trolling but what you're typing is so ignorant, it seems unlikely. Kudos to you if this is all an act.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:15:03
I am asking what is "impossible" in your above statement.
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:28:16


I am aware of no ~~popular~~ distributed database that is byzantine fault tolerant.


Sigh, this question doesn't even make sense. Smart contract operations do not require the escrow of value. in that one short sentence you deeply confuse computation with verification. "Escrow of value" is actually bonding of stake. Then that proof of stake is used to determine an entity's voting power (, their ability to contribute to consensus formation). In the paxos implementations I am familiar with all that is required to prove stake is that your address be in a majority of the config files on the network. There are many ways of forming consensus, there are many way of proving stake.


See above. Peter Todd's snark was completely justified, because we aren't talking about "blockchains", we are talking about byzantine fault tolerant consensus systems. There are many of these systems "the blockchain" is simply the most well known.

I have read his blog. Where is he credentialed as an Economist? Where has he trained, taught or worked as an Economist? If you have never met an Economist or spoken with one, he may appear to be one, I can't really say, I was raised by one. He does not appear to be an economist to me.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:38:41


Hmm, that's a tricky assertion.  I don't like the formulation of "blockchain" because it allows for confusing statements like the above quote.
*Bitcoin* is an economic solution. But it is important to note that it is an economic solution in two distinct ways. 1. The problems it is trying to solve are framed as economic problems 2. The model/system it uses to solve them is framed as an economic problem. But I am asserting that these are more allegorical than ontological attributes of this class of system.
Blockchains are more parsimoniously defined as a class of byzantine fault tolerant consensus systems. Another algorithm in this class is leaderless byzantine tolerant paxos.
In general, there is a confusion about which class is the parent. Because people heard about bitcoin first, they assume blockchain is the parent class. But in fact, Ethereum is more general than Bitcoin, and Eris is providing a system, not a protocol. Thus, what Eris is offering is far broader in scope than Bitcoin or Ethereum, consequently it has a very different value proposition. I am not sure an Economist would immediately appreciate the problem space, but neither would a Computer Scientist. :D
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:09:01
Dude, these systems work via bonds not escrows. The difference between the two is the whole reason someone would use such a system!
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:51:19
[Smart contract is a horribly confusing term for these systems and I wish people would stop using it.
I realize that some people will already understand what I am writing about and to those people it looks like I am wasting my time on idiots, but I figure it's worth a shot.]
From wikipedia:
"Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that obviate the need for a contractual clause."
That is a good working definition of a smart contract. How can a protocol, which is not an entity b a means of messaging between entities, escrow anything? It cannot. BUT! what a protocol can do is define a means of creating an irrevocable bond. Traditionally, we use escrows to make bonds irrevocable. But in the case of Ethereum et al we are using a byzantine-fault tolerant consensus system to ensure that the bonds made between any mapping of the system's users will be honored.
So, for starters we are discussing bonds which are peer-to-peer, not escrows which **require** an intermediary.
Secondly, this bond does not require a store of value be defined within the protocol. It may be that the value bonded is external to the smart contract system. It is true that this is a weaker form of smart contract, but it is still a protocol that provides the means of verifying the performance of a contract. (This is one of the things that make the term unfortunately confusing.)
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:27:55
Huh. That's interesting because I am almost exclusively looking at solution to factual ambiguity. But as one might guess from above, the whole point for me is to avoid going to court.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:18:51
Trust is not a black and white thing, there is some trust, but for any number of operational reasons internal to a business, agents within that business want to increase their level of trust. They can do this with a Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus System.
(I know it's kinda rude, but I have to reject the assertion that "centralized blockchain" is specific enough; it is misleading/confusing to categorize what Eris is offering in that way.)
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:57:18
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:20:56
Okay, provide a link. At this point, I understand the root of the confusion but the dialog is extremely immature and I see little value in the "arguments" against anything besides Eris' writing style. (Which I dislike more now that I've read this thread.)
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:04:29
Because you want byzantine fault tolerance. If the system uses Proof of Stake (this is one of its few legitimate use-cases), then it uses no extra energy when compared to something like Riak. The additional complexity is why we don't see these systems in production today. BFT systems are extremely valuable but before bitcoin, skilled developers weren't willing to take the risk.
