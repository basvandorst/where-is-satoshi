From Ross; Silkroad founder interesting how the community doesn't ever change:
"ok, I was waaaaaay wrong with my last call, but I'm going for it again:
The top is immanent.  An ending diagonal pattern has completed or is near completion.  This is, in Elliott Wave parlance, the 5th wave of the 5 wave sequence that started back in October 2010.  This entire move should be retraced with the most probable bottom coming in around 1 btc = $1.
I've liquidated all of my bitcoins and have $25k sitting in Mt. Gox with a 25k btc order at $1 per btc.
Once the rally renews from there, I can retire...wish me luck "

This is bullshit from the article directly:
"Once a home inspection is completed, the purchaser would be required to convert the bitcoins to U.S. dollars and put the full contract amount in escrow."
That's not "buying a home with bitcoin" that's selling bitcoin for fiat and then buying the home. POINTLESS!

Statistics say that when someone comes into a windfall of money they WILL buy a new car within 14 days (2 weeks) of the windfall. Don't be a statistic OP.

**Crypto Currencies Could Still Be a Global Currency of the Future**
It’s been more than a decade since bitcoin took the world by storm. With several thousand competing cryptocurrencies vying for investor attention, the world of “crypto” has gone through the first phase of the classic invention lifecycle, marked by early pioneers, followed by hype, followed by proliferation of newcomers and then a dose of reality. What comes next is one of two outcomes:
1) Either the innovation finds practical utility followed by years of steady and sustainable commercial progress and integration into the economic fabric (e.g., the Internet); or
2) The invention fails to achieve broad adoption and its commercial applications as medium of exchange are limited (e.g., the Segway). 
However, it is difficult to ignore the huge amount that investors, including some of the most sophisticated global investors, have poured into digital currencies in recent years. The invention itself is a tremendous demonstration of genius and creativity, and it deserves an opportunity to find a sustainable future in our economy. We would argue that two key ingredients to establishing a practical utility and a more stable value are governance and regulatory clarity – both of which are antithetical to the original intent as a decentralized, ungovernable global currency. And yet, as with exchanges, transparency and fairness are the keys to trust, and without some level of oversight and regulation, it is not possible to demonstrate a level of transparency and fairness that will build trust. At Nasdaq, we are working to help cryptocurrencies gain investors’ trust by offering our technology for trade matching, clearing, and trade integrity to start-up exchanges. We have also invested in ErisX, an institutional marketplace for cryptocurrency spot and futures. While this year will be another proving ground for cryptocurrencies, we believe digital currencies will have a role in the future. The extent of its impact will depend on the evolution of regulation and broader institutional adoption.

So basically they want to create a run on the banks. Unfortunately the banks have fail safe mechanisms to shutdown withdrawals so this won’t work. 
Crypto can’t be shutdown. These guys will realize that soon.
