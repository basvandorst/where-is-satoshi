I'm so confused. You don't "buy" btc on gdax. You buy it on Coinbase, then transfer it to gdax if you're wanting to send it somewhere else for storage or trading. So what exactly did you do?

yeah and about 3 years of your time.

Thats because you were late to the party. Missed the "Nice! Send me your litecoin address :D" post that has now been deleted. I am not a beggar, and probably the last person to ask anyone for anything.

Mainly toast wallet for xrp and exodus. I really needed one that would store brd and trx, and I'm pretty sure this will solve that issue!

So glad I sold at 19,500. Plan on buying more if it hits at 8k

Same. I wasnt going to buy one just yet as I have multiple desktop wallets for storage. This was a COMPLETE surprise christmas gift and I am more than thankful!

All good. Classic misunderstanding! Thanks, I cant wait to get home and play with it!

Yep. I'm not paycheck to paycheck, and I have the regular expenses (car, mortgage, etc..), but I only put it what I don't mind to lose. Normally its only a couple hundred here and there. I just like playing around with it and seeing if I can make it grow.
