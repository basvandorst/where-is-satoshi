You must've missed the part where Bitcoin is 100 dollars atm.
@_date: 2013-06-10 07:20:20
I very much doubt this is the person who dumped all those coins before. He dumped like 20k coins 3 sundays in a row. He's getting out and most likely will dump again this sunday. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:15:46
I'm not sure if you are smoking real good or real bad stuff. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:28:38
Ok. Sorry. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:09:30
Are you the same person who is posting this on the forum in every thread? 
Warning someone is one thing, you seem to have an agenda though. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:22:47
Calm down people. No need to get upset and go all downvote on me. I'm not attacking your precious Bitcoin. I am a Bitcoin supporter myself. 
I am just realistic and realize he is not in a position to do anything with the coins most likely. 
I noticed when it comes to Bitcoin people here get very emotional and anything that even hints at something negative regarding Bitcoin it gets downvoted right away. 
One can be a supporter and not living in fantasy land at the same time. You should try it once. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:24:00
And they also think this will happen by next year or so haha. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 10:16:58
Why would that make the Bitcoin price go up?
Or the Euro?
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:37:41
He's most likely collecting usernames and password to try them at the bitcoin exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:28:08
The amount you grow from this will last you a long time haha. I'd say 30 grams fresh or 3 grams dried will do for 1 trip. You will have many 100's of grams from 1 kit.
And the benefit? Way cheaper in the end. Compared to buying fresh. And it's legal to ship where shipping mushrooms aren't.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:49:43
Speak for yourself. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:06:59
Looks legit
@_date: 2013-06-12 18:42:00
What is it? One of the many worthless altcoins made for a pump and dump?
@_date: 2013-06-11 14:06:56
I just imagined it and came to the conclusion it would do pretty much nothing to the Bitcoin price.  
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:51:35
Who told you it's a safe haven??
@_date: 2013-07-03 19:25:26
Yup, i'm a tool and a retard for saying not every vpn will instantly move to Bitcoin. Because everyone knows i'm wrong and by next week every vpn will be using Bitcoin. 
Sorry, how could i have said something so ridiculous. I'm a huge tool indeed. Silly me. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:25:14
I totally agree with you. It's just getting silly. 
I love Bitcoin and i hope it will get big but the amount of people here living in fantasyland is scary. 
I'm surprised i haven't seen posts yet about how Bitcoin will cure aids. 
What's just as sad is that every time someone posts something realistic and sane the fanboys are extremely butthurt and will downvote as much as possible. Doesn't matter if they know you are right. 
They won't allow you to say anything slightly negative about Bitcoin. 
As i said before: it is possible to be a Bitcoin supporter without living in fairy tale land. Really, it is. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 18:20:16
Maybe because unlike him you are not hiding from the US who want to arrest you for espionage?
Just a wild guess of course. 
Seriously, i can not believe i even have to explain this. 
The guy probably fears for his life. And you think he can just go around buying credit cards or food or whatever "just like you can". 
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:24:23
I hope they ask for the banning of the Dollar as well as it can be used for money laundering and other criminal activities. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:01:03
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:23:49
Thanks for the feedback.
Did you check this page?
I'm open for more suggestions though. I will actually add more to the FAQ over time but the basics should be there.
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:18:01
How old are you? 16?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:47:21
Oh i bet it's not the first kit sold this way. Never claimed that :)
I honestly couldn't find any stores dedicated to grow kits and bitcoins though. Correct me if i'm wrong. Don't want to make any false claims.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:02:20
Yeah, i'm aware of those. That's underground, this is above ground ;)
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:36:18
Ah the good ol downvotes. "We don't want to read facts. We don't want reality. Quickly, go away". 
Haha hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:00:08
Obviously it's fake. He spelled Zuckerberg wrong. What are the chances that he owner of the wallet also spelled it wrong and he guessed it.
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:20:27
$110?? That's insane!
@_date: 2013-06-10 07:29:19
He's actually selling on sunday morning to cause as little panic as possible. He wants the price to drop as little as possible because he will sell another 20k the next sunday. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:03:40
I'm not saying they will never use Bitcoin. 
I'm just saying ALL of them won't instantly switch to Bitcoin as the guy above me believes. 
But just ignore reality and downvote me. That's the best thing you can do obviously. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 20:52:00
Come on, you have to be kidding me? I didn't dodge anything. I simply didn't reply to his question "which alternatives" because it's completely ridiculous!
But just for you here some of the TONS of alternatives"
Wire, ach, sepa, paxum, redpass, payoneer, american express, directpay eu, discover, eps, euro debit, , jcb, paysafecard, yellowpay etc...i could probably find 30 more if i looked for 10 minutes.
I didn't check the TOS of all those companies, some might work, some don't. Fact is most companies out there who want to accept money for their services will try out any of those options before going the Bitcoin way.
This fact will get me downvoted again, i know, because you don't want to hear this. 
Look, if it's up to me every company out there uses Bitcoin. That would be awesome. I hope this will happen one day because it's obviously easier than any of the methods above (once people actually have Bitcoins), but until then you have to face reality and don't get butthurt because someone shows facts. 
I'm not here to attack people, i just think that living in fantasy land will get us nowhere.
Downvoting people because they mention not every vpn will use Bitcoin if they can't use credit cards anymore is pathetic.
Not because it's me but in general.
9 out of 10 companies out there don't even know Bitcoin and if they do then 99% of them at this point in time won't want to deal with Bitcoin. You can downvote as much as you want, it won't change this. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-06-30 21:58:06
This is supposed to be a news site? What a load of crap. 
Sounds like gossip from a frustrated teenager. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:07:52
I predit your method will be useless. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 04:26:29
Ok, this is getting ridiculous. You must be trolling. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:20:33
Ok, it's been posted about 10 times now. We get it.
@_date: 2013-06-19 01:15:12
Looks legit
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:34:14
So that's the stage we're in now? 
Funny, how it's different every time when someone posts it (about ten times a day).
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:03:37
No no, there are quite some companies offering these. Usually payments via bank accounts as Paypal etc won't accept this stuff.
That's why i started a Bitcoin one. I figured there might be a market for it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:08:08
Ya ofcourse it's cheaper (as with pretty much everything) if you build it yourself. 
I never did it myself but i think that can be fun as well. Bit more difficult ofcourse.
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:05:38
Obviously he is totally clueless and making things up. 
He calls Bitcoin a company. Well then you know how much time he spent learning about it. 
Sad. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 19:17:21
Aww are you butthurt?
Fact is everybody who is realistic here will get downvoted. The only thing people want to hear is that Bitcoin will remove the dollar by next year, every company will use it and they will be worth 100k each. 
If you say anything else you get downvoted and called a retard. 
I kinda understand it though. The average person here is 16 and owns 1.3 coins and think they will be a millionaire in 3 months from now. 
They cannot handle anyone that talks them out of fantasy land. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 04:02:48
People who think the DEA just started a world wide advertisement campaign for a big online drugs shop really shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:05:30
Sure, i do.
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:15:16
I don't think anyone understands what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:35:22
No. It's a totally ridiculous idea. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:25:20
No money or person at the top is getting scared. They just don't understand it. Stop living in fantasyland. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 22:54:45
The worst thing to happen in the history of Bitcoin was the person who brought that pic up. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 15:44:37
Haha you don't seem to understand the situation he is in. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:05:39
Well, i will be sleeping soon. Thanks for all the comments and i will check back first thing tomorrow to answer any questions you may have. Ofcourse you can also use the contact form on the site to contact me by email.
Thank you and have a nice day/night where ever you are :)
@_date: 2013-06-24 03:48:06
Your topic title is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:18:07
You're right. Only credit card and Bitcoin exist on the internet as payment options. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:33:04
Gluten free? Haha i honestly can't tell you that. 
The info i have available right now is that it is rye-based substrate with a layer of vermiculite on top.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:21:57
Sorry, i missed your reply.
California, Georgia, and Idaho.
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:36:00
Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:17:27
@_date: 2013-06-25 04:58:33
Because of quite a few big dumps. That's it really imo. It started with the sunday dumper at $130 or so i think. And since we've seen big sells taking the price down every now and then. 
When we buy back up someone dumps another 7k coins, people panic sell and we're down 10 dollars again.
@_date: 2013-06-22 23:00:40
Yup, i'm sure he can't wait to go out of his hiding to meet up with random strangers to exchange money. 
Try to get back in to reality. It will make you look way smarter. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:28:08
Let's post the same 1 old month "news" 10 more times. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:07:32
Nonsense. Litecoin is going down as well just less fast as Bitcoin. That's why ltc/btc is worth more atm. Not because people are buying Litecoin. 
The fake "good news" about Litecoin lately is just silly. A bunch of kids trying to get people exited for a pump and dump on Mtgox as their leader Fontas told them to. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:57:18
Huh? I know it will be on Gox this month. 
Since they mentioned it all these kids are trolling the forums telling everyone how awesome Litecoin is trying to get the price up because Fontas told them to. It's sad. Yes all this good news is fake. Apart from it going to Gox nothing else has changed for Litecoin. Topics like this = trolling. 
I have nothing against Litecoin. I own Litecoins. 
People always seem to have problems reading here for some reason. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:53:19
Absolutely no one can tell you because no one knows what Bitcoin will do. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:34:59
I can find 100 different charts that will look similar. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:44:25
I understand it enough to know it will not help him out much. 
You would understand it too if you stop thinking emotionally and start thinking rationally. 
Bitcoin isn't some kind of magical internet currency that will solve every problem out there. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:16:03
That has to be the worst place on the internet ever!
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:26:35
Ya i will. I actually have a banner in the making right now so i can buy their advertising deal. Thanks for the tip though.
@_date: 2013-06-14 11:28:28
Exactly. The best thing you can do is ignore this muppet and educate yourself or ask honest people on the forum.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:34:12
Sure, and 10 other excuses why it isn't working out. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:09:50
What retail site would that be?
I checked other, similar sites before i added my price and i think i'm cheaper than most stores actually.
Do you realize that other stores add shipping on top of the 35/40 euro kits? Within Europe 40 euros in including shipping. Outside Europe 8 Euro is added (i pay a total of 18 Euros shipping outside the EU)
If i want to make some profit i simply can't go lower. After ordering from retail, shipping costs, even the boxes, future advertising costs and eventually taxes, i can promise you this won't make me rich anytime soon :)
Anyway, now i'm really gonna sleep. Any more questions will be answered tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:29:27
Ya good stuff.
I never did truffles though. I read that they have a slightly different effect than shrooms?
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:21:07
Right, well if you really want to know i probably can find out...let me know.
Edit: i Misread that. You already said it contains gluten.
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:36:07
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 06:20:15
Actually it's huge amounts of money leaving Bitcoin. As every sunday is happening right now. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:33:00
You want Bitcoin to lose 800 million dollars in value and go near dead, messing up 1000's of people their investments and businesses just so you can buy a few cheap coins?
I must be reading it wrong because nobody can be THAT greedy. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:11:42
His claim, so let him provide proof. That's not your task.
If he can't then that's all you need to know.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:46:31
Hah, thanks, that made me smile :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 12:05:30
2 months old news?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:03:55
Thanks! I hope it will do as well as my old shop back in the day. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:13:22
Sounds very promising. 
It might be buh bye MtGox. Which would be awesome. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:08:55
Well, i sell spores, not the actual mushrooms.
I will ship pretty much anywhere but i noticed from experience it's usually countries within the EU ordering. 
I suggest to anyone that orders to look up the laws in your country first.
With my previous store i sold MANY kits to MANY countries and i can honestly say i never had a single problem. Not one package ever didn't go through.
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:22:24
I wish people would stop giving that guy so much attention. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:25:56
Haha what?
You realize they are not the owners of Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:12:40
Right, thanks. I will check the vid tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:04:22
It sounds all really great and extremely easy money but for some reason i never see posts about the risks involved. Can someone with some knowledge maybe tell me about the things that could go wrong? And maybe even why i shouldn't buy any shares? Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 06:52:25
There are probably a dozen other solutions but people here like to ignore that for obvious reasons. 
I'm a huge Bitcoin supporter but things here can get a little silly every now and then. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:51:47
Hey everyone! I really don't want to come across spammy but i figured it might actually be of interest to some people. I just finished my magic mushroom grow kit site and i'm quite excited to say that i'm pretty sure it's the first site of its kind that accepts bitcoins!
I used to own a similar site years ago (growkitshop, maybe 1 or 2 people will remember) but after Paypal cut me off and finding very few alternative payment options i had to close it. 
I truly think that with bitcoins gaining popularity now is the right time to start accepting the coins as the main payment option (might add something else later, we'll see how this goes).
If magic mushrooms and bitcoins are your thing then feel free to check it out! 
Let me know if you have any questions about the product.
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:26:21
What questions??
Seriously, look at your posts when you're sober again. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:48:07
That's correct. There are 3 states i won't ship to.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:05:54
@_date: 2013-06-23 01:18:49
Ever heard of breaks?
Edit: ok now people might actually read it :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:11:36
Wow, that's crazy! Very cool though.
@_date: 2013-06-20 08:03:34
You mean all 86 of them? 
Yeah must be a massive problem in Thailand. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:20:54
Perfect time to show how worthless these charts are. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:16:34
Huh? The price actually went up since the Gox statement. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:34:50
How exactly is Bitcoin selling out? Nobody owns it.
@_date: 2013-06-16 21:03:41
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 15:16:16
And what exactly do you think he can do with those Bitcoins. 
It's nice that you want to help him but Bitcoin will be pretty much useless to him.
