Yes but the attacker is competing against the rest of the network right? So in this case lets say 1 attacker has a computational power of 5. The rest of the network, against which he is competing as a malicious node, has 400. In his current situation, the attacker would have to accumulate 396 more computing power in order to gain (approx) 51% of the network nodes.
Now lets say we divide the block time by 10 meaning a block per minute. In order to solve blocks fast enough the difficulty would have to be divided by 10 as well, meaning the amount of computational power could be multiplied by 10 (as it is now 10 times more efficient). That means the attacker now has 50 computational power but the network now has 4000 computational power. This is probably a very,  very flawed calculation because this makes me question if reducing the blocktime will in fact increase security of the chain, considering attacker now needs 3951 more power to get to 51% of the chain. this shits giving me a headache lol

Why does lower difficulty equal easier attacks? If difficulty lowers for attackers than it also does for honest nodes. So it would be equally hard for an attacker?

The block difficulty controls block timing which is tied to the block reward (rate of inflation) so averaging out to 10 minutes per block means that in this halvening we mint 1800 new bitcoins created per day. This keeps the rate of inflation steady. We wont hit a truly deflationary currency until all bitcoins have been mined.
I understand, but if we were to lower block rewards wouldn't that mean we would be able to decrease block difficulty in regards to inflation?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:12:57


Well for instance it would require much less computational power for a single transaction to be made considering the fact that difficulty derives purely from block time. If block time is lower we would save a lot on electricity? 


This I seem to understand. It gives the whole network a timeframe of 10 minutes to catch up with the latest blocks and orphan blocks I guess? But does it really need 10 full minutes in order to sync properly?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:05:06
Well, since it adjusts automatically based on the block time (averages out to a block every 10 minutes, right?), then why don't we adjust the block time? Why 1 block every 10 minutes? Why not drastically reduce the block time rewards, make them easier to solve by indirectly lowering the difficulty and process transactions faster?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:07:36
Yeah I guess your right. Just trying to think of a way that would make it more cost-efficient but I guess if that was so easy someone else would have thought of it already. Maybe invest in a better worldwide internet infrastructure so that all nodes can sync in faster. Anyway thank you for discussing, it surely answers the questions I had (I was totally unaware of block time (and indirectly difficulty) being tied to network syncing so much).
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:32:43


I understand, but why not just lower the block rewards? That way blocks can be solved faster (requires less computational effort and is therefore cost-efficient for miners, compensating for the loss in block reward). Let's say we let them generate blocks 10x faster than they do now but block rewards will be 10x less than they are now. It would relatively be the same, right? It wouldn't affect the bitcoin creation rate either and would even allow transactions to be processed faster.


I don't fully understand this. An orphaned block is a valid block but not in the longest chain. I understand it can catch up, but I don't see how this relates to mining difficulty or block times?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:00:50
I guess you have a point there. I don’t necessarily have a problem with it though, I’m just trying to understand. But yes, I would say in our current environment the power usage of the network could be seen as a problem. But thanks for your answer!
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:13:05
Probably because in relation to the computational effort costs it would still be profitable and generate income (if fees are not actually 0, but i dont see why they would ever be). And simply because people would want to contribute to the security of the network?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:19:52


















I understand all of this but my question remains why do we want blocks to be produced at a fixed pace?. I mean what do we protect by keeping that pace fixed? Because in the end, the amount of computational power required (which depends directly on difficulty) decides how much of our real-time resources have to be spent on it (energy). If anything we want to keep those costs as low as possible, right? So I guess the whole balance of the block pace must be incredibly important but I still fail to understand why.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:35:11
Alright, these are things I understand. Yet I think that if this is the main reason for block times to be this high, it is very cost-inefficient. I mean this is the reason Bitcoin spends about a countries totalled electricity bill each day. In order to protect some slow nodes. Must be more to it?
@_date: 2019-07-26 08:16:12
For anyone who is interested to understand why Bitcoin is the next **gold** and not **cash**, read and understand [what causes Bitcoin's scalability issues]( 
Why is the block time 10 minutes? Why can't it be decreased? Why can't the block size be *increased*? It all sounds simple, but those cogwheels are highly connected and dependent on each other and there are good simple explanations of why none of this offers a real solution. When you explain Bitcoin to someone, make sure you understand this.

So classic crypto again! It would be a perfect addition to [this story about the weirdest and biggest conpiracy exit scams in crypto throughout 2011 and 2012]( I recommend you read it.

Glad the Bitcoin price went up, but surely is manipulation. Something like [this]( perhaps? Or are we actually facing institutional whales, this time?
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:55:12
Yeah some other people said this as well. Its open for interpretation I guess but I think fungibility generally refers to if tokens are *technically* unique. In the sense of this definition for example, cryptokitty tokens would be non-fungible. Anyhow - Litecoins are *supposed* to all reflect the same properties/values, right?
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:04:05
You are entirely right. I am correcting this!

Right so when a **soft fork** applies, the rules *tighten* and therefore you are at risk of accepting blocks that could effectively disappear later because they might not be included in the *longest chain version*, aka the *tightened chain*. Right? 
So if I get this right, regardless of upgrading your node or not, your node *will follow the longest chain?* And in case of a hard fork, the rules loosen, so what risks are involved for upgraded / non-upgraded nodes here?

I was furious in december. Been all in on ETH since may '17. From there on I was watching all my moronic friends jump in every ICO they could find and see them go x100 even though those projects were so obviously scams or useless.. and I kept making the 'smart' and 'wise' decisions, do not go into these crappy alts. Half december I couldnt resist and jumped on some trains as well, lost 30 to 40% of my portfolio after it all came down crashing rather quick. Still made a fair profit in the overall ride but I cant believe ive watched the ICO hype go right by me from may to december '17. It was horrible.

 If anyone's bored, here's a good story about a few hacks in 2011 that caused a lot of drama in the community. I bet you if your a troll your gonna love it. Its called [Bitcoin down the rabbit hole](

Well my guess is you can assemble a part 2 out of the years that followed that is far more juicy than this one. Gotta look for the right ones though, and probably not as fun as the community was so tight back then that everything was constantly and clearly registerd on fora like btctalk
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:36:35
What do you mean by overtake? As in - they could switch their hashing power to your chain and 51% attack it, leaving their own chain - the original one - also vulnerable?
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:12:31


Can you elaborate why? Why can I only softfork safely if a large majority has my back? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:34:17
But with a soft fork - people will not accept your block, regardless if it matches the rules, if it uses a different previous hash, right? Let's say the softforked chain has tighter rules, and therefore needs to reject block 2 and 3 from the original chain
Original chain: Block 1, block 2, block 3, block 4, block 5
Softforked chain: Block 1, Block 4 (**where does this block fit in the original chain? it will be rejected, because it uses the previous hash of block 1, but in the original chain, this hash was already used by block 2. So how is still valid??)**, Block 5
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:18:00
I fail to see how any of the chains can keep supporting each other if both chain structures are completely different from some point onwards. Besides, they are two different chains. It must have something to do with upgrading or downgrading the nodes to match either protocol again, but I fail to see where as in both cases it would go at the cost of reversed transactions aka blocks that become invalid?
