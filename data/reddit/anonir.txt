yes you said your opinion as other people  :) thanks for sharing what is on your head...
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:16:26
yes we talk about that type of people don't trust windows or have FBI and NSA afraid or why Mark Zuckerberg tapes over his webcam?  also talk about bitcoin payment gateway and it's another option, you can use it that account at same time. 
Coinbase , Coingate , AlfaCoins , Shopify , bitPay , GoCoin , BitcoinPay , GoURL , SpicePay , Spectrocoin
Have you ever read the Terms of Service of those sites?
all of those site give you api to connect your website and make invoice to pay with bitcoin and they save all of your smallest behaviors and information but you never see same things on iran version website!
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:30:41
i can't, it's limit to internal usage only and does't have international version, you should have mobile phone number of iran and needs Iran Ip address to access.
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:26:31


You can not see the air, but you can say there is no air, because I do not see it? Trust me this is there.


as i said also have bitcoin payment gateway you don't need to use wallet! that simple js file can create thousand of invoice in seconds for your website? 


yes DNS is one way also they seized the server in data center like BTC-e.com


you don't use blockchain service,why? bc you have your personal reason for this. so maybe a lot of people like you don't want use Coinbase , Coingate , AlfaCoins , Shopify , bitPay , GoCoin , BitcoinPay , GoURL , SpicePay , Spectrocoin
all of those site give you api to connect your website and make invoice to pay with bitcoin and they save all of your smallest behaviors and information but you never see same things on iran version website!




maybe a lot of people like to use our service! Because we do not have restrictive rules &amp; don't keep the information from users, so don't give our users information to U.S governments because they can not push us. 


i can't! that's the reason this idea came to my mind and saw the gap and we can use it and make it to advantage for privacy! What is business? Use the opportunity and turn it into profit, right? so you can use this service or not!
We will not charge any fees for people who use our payment gateway but after one year they will pay % 0.1 with maximum $5 in bitcoin , trust me it's enough :)


sorry i don't know because i don't live in Cyprus or Malta
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:13:41
in fact they like digital currency and blockchain tech, but they didn't ban using of crypto , just central bank of iran make rules for buy or sell bitcoin with *IRR is't legal. they afraid similar to china about money go out of country.
*(IRR - The Iranian Rial is the currency of Iran)

html!!!! do you have any experience to build a website? we talking about fbi easy can with simple mail seized the domain and server from datacenter but they don't have this power in iran to seized domain or server , why btc-e server seized? what happend? fbi seized the server in data center ,in your vision fbi can say ok let's go to iran and seized this server :))


 also can have TOR version, if someone have panic to show ISP see about connect to a website with iran IP location. 
yes it's golden point because you know they not give your data to FBI.
do you read the term of service and privacy rules of blockchain? you never see same things on iran version website! also we not just talk about wallet my point is bitcoin payment gateway service.


it's possible and you can but we not have plan for this :D btw you can have payment gateway to accept bitcoin without anyone monitor you!
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:40:35


you don't use but a lot of people use, People are thirsty. We also give them free services for one year, but after that, they must pay 0.1% of the fee with the maximum amount $5
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:57:32
Your speech was completely political and irrelevant to our talkable subject, iran not that much dark as you explained it :)) btw we talking about a bitcoin and gateway without any restrictive rules maybe a lot of people like to use our service! Because we do not have restrictive rules &amp; don't keep the information from users, so don't give our users information to U.S governments because they can't push us. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:38:30


you never see that beautiful page about "Has been seized" as you saw for megaupload or BTC-e


Why did people go to Panama to open a bank account?


you weak against the rules, there is gap between technology and politics and we can use it and make it to advantage for privacy + Tor


its your opinion, maybe a lot of people like to use it! As millions of people use Tor every day. because they afraid about data always be monitored and saved and knows the owner of website or data center can't defend against FBI or U.S law enforcement so they give up easily and expose people information.
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:44:03
if you read our top conversations the point is bitcoin payment gateway. we don't have plan for USD
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:06:38


i'm happy for this conversations


we has little basic rules but nothing about mining data from you or push you for KYC or ban for illegal behavior. i was create a knife and sell it. But It's None Of My Business what you want do with this knife, maybe you go cut the fruit maybe go kill someone!


It might be hard for a foreigner


as i saw the views of my post understand thousand of people so much interested on this!


haha i know u don't need it , it's idiom ;)


yes but it's better for me to do this work in the place known well
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:41:54
of course we have cell phone! we not live in jungle:)) tell me Coinbase , Coingate , AlfaCoins , Shopify , bitPay , GoCoin , BitcoinPay , GoURL , SpicePay , Spectrocoin give you what as payment gateway? :)
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:12:34
we talk about a completely different subject! your words are perfectly correct at the right place but not in our topic, We do not want to sell or buy Bitcoin to circumvent the sanctions against iran.
there is Gap between technology and politics and we can use it and make it to advantage for privacy.we talking about bitcoin and online wallet with payment gateway base on the iran location, so they can't monitor or attack to our privacy.
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:37:26
still a lot of exchange website don't give shit and sell and buy bitcoin with rial, the gov one months ago and after 5 years make this rules to limit buy and sell bitcoin with rial and the flow of water continues :))
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:05:47
i don't want enter to talk about politics, i'm just talking about money and business, as i saw the views of my post understand thousand of people so much interested on this! people looking for some place to be safe to be sure those don't sell user data to U.S government :))
I suggest you read the previous conversations

@_date: 2018-06-26 22:06:05
Your words is reasonable and we have not asked for the contrary.
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:59:02
we talk about no limits :) not just 2 BTC and also you can but with $ :D
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:31:58


exchanger or payment gateway need, yes there are tons of wallets, but for wallet are you sure they dont track what address belong to what user?  are you sure government not force them to give your data to them?


its your opinion and we respect that BTW wallet is one option, our focus is bitcoin gateway and Exchange market
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:09:01
Your words are unreasonable and just want fight and argument, so my dear silence is best answer for you 
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:47:18
bitwallet at first is local project in iran untill we find a gap between technology and politics and we use it to make advantage for privacy :D if you have enough knowledge, build a better version :)
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:41:25
yes and we have come to make a great big change. we puts all of your sensitive data in very secure server located on iran. Everything encrypted by AES-256 algorithm and US law enforcement can't request your data or seized our servers. (as you know BTC-e server seized by FBI)
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:55:28
haha you are so sweet, its free world! you are free to don't use this service.
