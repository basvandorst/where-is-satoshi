This is simple, good design:

Steve Jobs' pancreas gave you cancer and then this post gave you even more? Lol.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:59:07
Just make a paper wallet and send your BTC there. Use Bitaddress.org. Research how to use it safely. If you are just going to hold for some years it's easier and cheaper than a hardware wallet like Trezor which you don't need for your case. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:56:46
Nothing new. The important part is that in the end you always return to the mean. And that's always growing. That's why we are HODLING!!
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:50:36
Wait a bit, it'll sink lower as soon as the SEC rejects the COIN ETF, and that is sure to happen in the coming days. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:18:30
This sounds so silly I would classify it as fake news if it weren't posted on The Guardian. AMAZING.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:39:30
Who cares about the processor, just think about the brain damage of doing that any longer than I did. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:50:03
Yes, I'm the OP. At the end I related those 3 years at this rate to USD$0.02.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:36:05
And there are a lot of newbies out there, so it's worth sharing this.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:31:47
But any concrete idea if any of them will ever process my request? Anyone has some recent experience?
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:13:07
And that is if such a thing as "eliminating bitcoin" were actually possible. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:20:38
Any publicity is good publicity. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:14:37
So you're still waiting.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:09:49
You think that's what made my earnings so miserable? It was supposed to be 5% if I recall correctly. I didn't even attempt to transfer my supposed income.
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:56:33
Thanks for the insights. So, in your case, how exactly do you store your BTCs?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:48:30
I have never used Trezor but out of feeling that might happen I have always felt paper wallets are the way to go.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:01:48
Thanks for the suggestion, I edited it and added one. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:42:17
I say any publicity is good publicity. All this BTC talk in the media just raises awareness and demand is demand. Even if it comes from crooks or illegal activities, higher demand will always lead to higher prices. Think of drugs. But BTC is intangible and thus beyond the control of any law enforcement. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:16:24
That's right. That graph shows that each trend raises quicker than the previous ones. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:46:23
My take is it is not getting any lower than this. It's already "corrected" and all those wanting to cash in at 2K already did. Now it's mostly holders so next Bear will be at 3 or even 5k.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:15:59
Incorrect. Even if you still own the stock/bond/whatever and it plummets you still haven't lost until you sell. I've been talking in financial and fiscal terms, not everyday terms. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:36:23
So that's a fact? I thought we didn't even know if he was real. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:30:04
Yeah, but in contrast, BTC value should be much higher after so long. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:33:17
Ok, thanks, just to clarify, the halvening is every 4 years. Next one is on 2020.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:18:44
So he's got 2 billion dollars worth of BTC and he's holding because somehow that's not enough money? :p
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:39:55
Just go with a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:39:40
I'll take a look, even though it sounds like something from Pokemon. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:52:08
They don't have a timeline. Last time it took them 2 years. Literally. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:35:29
I have held through ups and downs and intend to do so for many years to come. It's not greed nor fear, it's confidence in that BTC is the future. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:37:36
Don't assume everyone in the planet will eventually own Bitcoin. Gold is the oldest and most widely used standard of value and still the largest part of the population in history and nowadays has never owned an ounce of gold. 
As a holder I'm betting BTC will be very valuable but that is not dependant upon the illusion that everyone will eventually own some.
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:31:50
Then what altcoin and in which pool?
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:11:20
Scarcity is not the end all be all factor. Many things are scarce but they are only as valuable as people are willing to pay for them, and that includes other factors such as trust, liquidity, etc.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:22:43
Professional traders do all that because they have to report earning and justify their work. If you only have to answer to yourself there's no better thing to do than just hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:25:16
More like 10,000 pizzas for 1 BTC. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:57:20
I have even got the Kleenex close to me already.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:13:02
Are you serious 50 BTC per 10 minutes or are you exaggerating? It's a legit question because I know it was a whole different scenario back then but those earnings sound outrageous!
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:42:05
Never thought of downloading it (or figured it would work offline), that's a great way to backup the code generator. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:46:47
At least it's not an eye sore like the first one mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:56:40
I don't mean to disrespect you but there's a huge financial and fiscal difference between becoming wealthier and making money. Enterprises pay taxes on their revenue and raising value of their stock and assets is not revenue. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:17:38
Well, certainly. That remark was just me being silly. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:25:57
It makes me rather happy because I seize opportunities instead of debating for years over them. Even if they go wrong I know I took a chance and learned something. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:46:30
¿De qué?
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:29:54
That's not a good argument. BTC will keep having ups and downs. It is still very volatile. It might go very, very low before recovering. Never use it as a savings account. If you need to withdraw and the value is bottoming, you will lose a lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:50:06
Ignore. That's it.

Do you think a MacBook Pro would be up to the challenge of mining altcoins? Or you mean exclusively with antminers?
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:21:47
About a week ago. :(
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:04:41
Thank you very much for the explanations. I have been reading this community daily for some weeks now and had never come across the importance of running a node. You have gained my trust. I can google how to run a node. I hope it won't prove excessively difficult. I'm not an engineer or anything of the sort. But if I manage to begin running a node, what should I do with it in order to support what you are talking about? Any pointers will be greatly appreciated. I believe BTC is the future of mankind and I want to do whatever I can to help it help us.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:54:11
 Except for VCR, most definitely so. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:44:23
Yeah, who would've guessed they'd be going for 2k some years later. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:07:03
I agree, although I'm pretty sure even a top gaming pc would fare poorly for this monumental task. Even at 100x times better performance, the earnings would be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:36:39
Pretty much. We just call it Traveling the world, in order to get to know it, instead of just seeing pics of it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:24:37
Still that's a whole different universe than the current situation. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:41:21
You don't need a spreadsheet. Just jot down the BTC price of each purchase and average it in the long run. That's your buying price. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:20:17
You honestly thought about buying BTC 6 months ago and still haven't done so. Omg. You would have made so much money by now. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:21:14
What is the crime?
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:28:09
Except every day that goes by, the price is up, so you're buying less and less bitcoin. I say, if you are going in, go as much in as you can from day one. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:26:42
Totally right. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:52:47
Except Wannacry began 3 days ago and the trend uptake started about 6 months ago.

@_date: 2017-05-12 10:38:24
I agree in all you say. I just argue that whatever the value BTC may acrue isn't due solely to it being scarce. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:34:21
Abort mission! Our cover has been blown! I repeat, abort mission! They are much smarter than we thought!!

After almost two weeks I just got verified for Tier 1. Still pending for tiers 2 and 3. :|
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:24:21
If wanting to sell now is human psychology then I must be alien because I had never felt so strongly about hodling for 10 centuries straight. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:09:50
Coinbase doesn't give you a private key. If you want to manage your own key you have to create a paper wallet or a hardware wallet and transfer your BTCs. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:35:55
In some years it's gonna be: Hey Bitcoin boy, why don't you take us in your private jet?
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:07:41
Thanks for the insights. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:23:48
Sure thing. Please guys, let's keep things in the right perspective. 
KEEP CALM AND HODL ON.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:36:18
I thought miners were the ones voting. I didn't know anyone could run a node. Noob mistake. Sorry for that. So why and how should any regular non miner person run a node?
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:39:48
What's EC?
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:52:32
10%? Those fuckers. Then buy somewhere else!
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:34:36
I doubt so. A MacBook pro is perfectly able to run like I did for many hours straight. Its very common for a video rendering to take that long, and that's what they're designed to do. If it were a PC I'd agree with you.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:40:13
Actually, Bitcoin is Bitcoin. And you don't have more Bitcoin when it raises value. It is only worth more money. But you're not making money unless you sell your Bitcoin and thus, earn said money.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:19:42
Party LIKE its $1999 :p

@_date: 2017-05-11 05:43:49
Thank you all guys. I'm humbled by your support and your valuable insight. I really appreciate and I'm very glad to find such a cohesive community. That can only mean great things will keep coming for BTC in the future!
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:38:34
Well, now it isn't scientific anymore...
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:13:19
Except you are talking about 3% return as if return was usually measured on a daily basis. On yearly basis that 3% is about 1,000%.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:29:50
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:15:48
That's interesting. Particularly since Buffet has dished BTC in the past ...
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:53:16
If your investments increase in value you're becoming wealthier, but your are not "making" money. That was the whole point. "Making" money means generating a profit (and thus having to pay taxes on it). If you buy BTC for 1 dollar and it's value raises to 1 billion dollars you may consider yourself wealthy but you haven't made any money until you sell it and have to pay taxes on your earnings.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:12:47
Do you have a bank account? Then you're already trusting others to "hold your keys".
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:27:31
Nope. Wealth = Net worth. Or do you think Bill Gates is spending 60 billion dollars permanently?
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:28:35
I know Antpool isn't great but you cannot honestly believe any other pool would've yielded much better results. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:29:59
Indeed super simple but also very poorly designed. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:56:32
HODL! If you'd don't urgently need that cash now just HODL, for as long as you can. It can get up to 5k, 10k, even 500k is veritable. Just HODL!
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:11:12
Yes, undoubtedly. Since some years ago, planning to do any mining even with the right equipment as an individual, seems a clear exercise in futility. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:31:47
Thank you very much. I really believe we are at the dawn of a new era and it is in our hands to make sure it goes the right way. Otherwise we will end up with corporations running the game, yet again, and just look at where that has got us. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:16:25
That only matters in the very short term. Trust me. In a week, thousands more will be aware about the existence of Bitcoin and nobody will even remember about the HNS.
Ransomware will continue to exist but demonizing Bitcoin will get old, just like kidnapping and ransoms exist and nobody blames regular money for them. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:12:31
I don't even know what Bitcoin is yet. All I know is I'm holding it. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:39:25
We also have internet access, you know?
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:39:27
Why not store most of it in a hardware or paper wallet instead of carrying it around? 
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:00:37
You seem fun. 
And you don't have to answer if your privacy gets raped just by sharing your age range.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:59:55
Of course it's not worth it. It was just a fun experiment and would never do it again.

@_date: 2017-06-09 07:21:49
If I'm holding on a paper wallet, do I need to do something to ensure it will continue to work after the fork? Sorry for the noob question but I've read a lot about the fork and August 1st but it's very hard for me to truly understand that. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:14:52
Except Kraken will take forever to verify you and allow you to buy Bitcoin. And when I say forever, I literally mean you will never be verified. I'm dying of old age waiting and they took 2 weeks to verify me for Tier 1 (you need at least tier 2 to be able to fund), which supposedly, according to their site, should be almost instant.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:21:29
One thing though, it is "hedl" not "hodled".
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:29:23
C'mon guys! Let's upvote the hell out of this one, to Reddit's top and beyond!
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:55:10
When is Conbase signing up anyone? I applied for verification about a month ago and haven't heard a bip. Same thing at Kraken and everywhere else.

I'm just planning to hodl for some years so I hope this will be no issue. 
Whats that about your bitcoins being duplicated if a chain split occurs? Would you have twice as many BTC?
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:36:43
So you're pretty much safe if you have your keys before August 1st? If the chain splits could you have twice as many Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:50:08
Try to make a more descriptive title. Otherwise it comes off as click bait. And no one will bite. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:39:33
The century of total war also coincided with the century of automotive transport, women's rights,  the largest medical and technological advances, worker's rights, and many more things. I suppose all of those are evil like Central banks, right? 
I'm a hodler, but this argument is plain silly.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:39:48
That's all I think whenever people like Warren Buffet or Mark Cuban say that Bitcoin is not a real currency, that it's a bubble, or that it holds no value.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:43:15
I see now that's a good index. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:56:11
Well, it's at 2650 now...
