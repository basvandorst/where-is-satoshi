Also want to know this
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:42:24
What's hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:41:40
Is this a reliable way to consistently make money off Bitcoin? It seems to me if it was everyone would be day trader?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:52:12
What's stamp? (I'm new to this Bitcoin stuff)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:36
Why now? Won't it correct itself sometime soon? Then it'll be the time to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:08
What's arc 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:31:33
What is this 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:22:30
Can you explain why every exchange does not have the same price?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:37:03
You think a recovery to the same position (and then upward progress) will happen after the inevitable decline? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:06:50
IS IT TRUE RIPPLE IS BEING ADDED TO COINBASE?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:34:57
Why does the binance app have such a bad rating? Is the website better for those that have used it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:56:15
I saw other people talking about here on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:51:16
What are the pros and cons of Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:55:32
Which cryptocurrencies can I buy from gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:17:37
Where can I find the prices of the futures?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:23:40
If I buy on gdax, will the price I be higher than the actual current price of BTC, like it is on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:52:22
You can get on binance I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:27
Does hodl mean not selling your BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:50:55
Does gdax allow you to buy and sell in an instant like that? If I wanna make a quick 50 bucks, can you buy at 10,200 and sell IMMEDIATELY as it hits 10,250 and have that deposited into your bank account? Also what is the fee in this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:56:06
What's Bitcoin futures 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:57:38
So basically more people participate in LTC than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:07
So if it's not on Bitcoin exchanges, why does this effect Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:54:54
Like what altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:41:41
Can someone explain a shared wallet with multiple people? Is this where you can get multiple friends to contribute to the same Bitcoin wallet? I've seen this option on Coinbase and some other exchanges before, and was wondering what it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:23:56
Ok, that was similar to my though process. If I'm looking to invest a small amount to begin with (a couple hundred to start) would it be better to use it on Bitcoin, or something smaller like Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:24:37
What does the depth chart mean in gdax, if someone could explain it to me that'd be great. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:34:54
What's a sell wall? I'm new to all of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:36:55
Can I use binance if I'm in the US?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:24:20
New ath soon
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:54
So now is a great time to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:39:42
Can you explain what this means?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:24
Same thing happened to me, I asked the same question. From what i gathered, the value of the Bitcoin is changing as it stays pending and your investment will change with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:09:09
Also, where exactly does the money earned come from. If I try to think about it on simpler terms, it doesn't make any sense:
To make things a smaller scale, let's say Bitcoin is $10 a coin, and 10 people have 1 coin, which means $100 is spent total on it. From what I've gathered, the price per Bitcoin goes up every time someone buys into it. So if an 11th person buys a $10 coin, there's $110 split between 11 people , bit since someone bought in, the price would actually have gone up, say for example $1 per coin for simplicity purposes, which means 11 people get a dollar more, but WHERE does this $11 come from?
Or am I completely wrong in my thinking?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:19:49
Do you think IOTA will get big soon? Also why don't others support IOTA?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:06:03
So a large line on the red side is a sell wall, which makes the price harder to go up, but once destroyed, the price will be free to go up again. A large green wall is a buy wall which will make the price go up. Is that correct thinking?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:03
Same thing for buying? Also, if you sell at market value in gdax, will the price be the actual market value, unlike coinbase where it is lower?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:52:32
Will they add more soon?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:11:34
Why would they need that? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:32:53
I'm new to all of this, what do people mean by the term day trader?

What does cboe stand for?
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:39:48
What causes the price of Bitcoin (or any crypto currency) to fluctuate? What specific factors?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:04:30
What is "fiat-crypto", I see this term all the time?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:58:58
Where did you send your BTC to?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:47:32
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:34:15
What exchanges would you recommend other than coinbase and gdax which I bear everyone recommend all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:23:33
An alt coin, and if coinbase adds it then invest before they add it bc it'll probably blow up when they do 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:38:16
So crypto is safer in mycellium than in coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:11:04
At what date do you earn ethereum by mining with your GPU?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:33:07
Gotcha 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:56
Are there fees to sell on Gdax?

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:04:03
Do you think IOTA has a bright future?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:48:16
Can you explain further, the concept of futures, and why CBOE has the say to start them, and why they weren't started earlier? Will any the exchanges  start their own futures?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:20
This cannot continue for much longer. The bubble has to pop soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:13:10
I would appreciate anyone's opinion on this, I'm pretty new to Bitcoin in general. So I turn 18 in a few months, and coinbase and pretty much every other website requires you to be 18 to purchase Bitcoin. Should I open an account under my father's name before I turn 18 so I can get started with bitcoin, or just wait 3 months. Basically is it that big of a deal if I miss out on 3 months of investing or should I start now, and then transfer to my wallet once I'm 18. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:21
I've always heard "coinbase coinbase coinbase" , is here any reason I should switch to Bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:59
Watchu mean?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:25:49
So you must use your bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:38:23
But then you Bitcoin is instantly worth less after you buy it, that is if you $100 at a price higher than the all time high?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:37:09
Where to buy IOTA from the US?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:38:20
Why would anyone buy BTC right now, as in this moment when its close to 19.2k?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:51:04
So if someone tried to sell for say 17200 during this person trying to sell their 1000 Bitcoin at 17250, would that cause the price to go down to 17250 quicky before going back up?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:58:44
Where to buy Qash, USA?
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:34:28
Predictor for price by end of December? By the end of quarter 1 2018 and by the end of 2018? Also, is now the time to buy rather than wait for a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:26:48
Is the trade history for gdax for all of Bitcoin or gdax only?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:50:16
Lol why?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:28:41
I bought from coinbase with a bank account. So basically, say bought $100 worth, when it shows up in my account in 8 days, the Bitcoin value will be the same but the $100 will be different, right?
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:18:34
Can you explain what crypto market cap means exactly, I always here this term being used.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:47:09
Yeah that happens to me also
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:40:48
So a fork is when someone basically copies and pastes the code for a crypto and calls it something else?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:49:48
So it's possible to try and sell crypto but nobody wants to buy it so you can't sell, correct? And then when the wall is taken down, that means the price will stop going down so much?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:24:46
What's fomo?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:23:23
What's Bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:10:07
Oh gotcha 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:02
Ok gotcha. So on Coinbase I have to wait 8 days if I purchase with a bank, on gdax is it instant? But then I suppose that wouldn't matter anyways if I can purchase with a credit card for only .25 percent fee anyways. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:58:04
Are these good reliable secure exchanges? All can I buy in USD?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:43
Isn't a price job inevitable eventually anyway? And so that's what Bitcoin futures does, but what exactly is it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:36:48
What do people mean by whales?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:09
But say I bought 100$ yesterday at 12k, now it's say 14k, my 100$ is currently worth more than right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:36
What's the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:38:31
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:45:52
What's an example of a paper wallet, pretty new to this. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:51:23
Should I invest?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:34:52
How do forks work again?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:23:05
Best brokers maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:59:36
Like it says I purchased $10  dollars (not exactly that but something around there), and then I go to the dashboard and it says the all time high for Bitcoin is only 11,810.11.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:19
Is krakAPI the official kraken exchange app?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:22:10
Just bought some Bitcoin, it says pending, delivered in 8 days. My questions is, will the the money still fluctuate in value while it is pending?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:39
What's a good exchange to buy other cryptocurrencies from, like maybe iota for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:33
What's neo?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:13:38
I keep hearing people say "don't keep Bitcoin in an exchange, move it to a wallet" is coinbase an exception to this?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:38:50
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:14:45
Why are you skeptical of bittrex?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:50:05
What's the all time hight for Bitcoin? Because coinbase is saying I purchased some for a price higher than the all time hight is showing on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:19:39
What prevents more from being created?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:13:43
How did you know about this? You're comment over a week ago:
"There is going to be a small pump before Coinbase issues its bitcoin cash to account holders.  BCH to 3800 USD before December 19th."
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:14:15
How many bitcoins out of 21 million are currently mined?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:25:39
Could you share a bit about it, I've never heard about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:47:42
Have you bought any other cryptocurrencies other than Litecoin aetherium or Bitcoin on there?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:49:57
What do you used to buy anything other than Bitcoin Litecoin or a ethereum? I am on coinbase and may want to invest in some other cryptocurrencies. Also which ones would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:57:10
Isn't Bitcoin cash basically the Chinese knockoff of Bitcoin? And is this actauly confirmed? And when?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:33:38
What's the price right now? Must be pretty low if you bought 100k of them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:56
Should I move my Bitcoin from coinbase to gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:13
Are all exchanges implementing this?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:14:18
What do I do to get started at miningpoolhub?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:21
Whats segwit
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:45:12
Bitcoin seems too good to be true...you know what they say about that...
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:52:37
Who says everyone gets equal amounts of the original crypto though? I feel like the creators would rather not give away free crypto and have people actually buy into this?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:36:02
What's a dump? I'm new to all these terms. Also what's a pump?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:48:16
Can you explain what futures are and how they work?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:12:22
But now or wait?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:40:42
It's most likely gonna drop first. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:36:35
What's margin trading?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:26
I expect it to go down hard sometime this week
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:18:39
Is it gonna crash by then?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:23:55
Why is that? I would think it'd go down first like LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:20
What should we expect from Bitcoin when coinbase and gdax reopen BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:41:26
So on binance I can only buy IOTA with BTC I think? Am I seeing that correctly, or can I buy with USD, it just gives the amount in terms of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:25:34
What do you guys think about Gemini? Is it a good/ safe exchange to use? Also, where's a good place to buy IOTA? (I'm in the US)
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:42:37
What other coins do you guys recommend? If not ethereum or Litecoin, whats the best way to get it, because I am a beginner beginner and only have coinbase as of now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:55:06
Would it be hard to get verified on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:18:07
Who is this guy??
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:23:28
How do taxes work with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:31:26
What does that mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:19:03
Ok gotcha. I'm fairly new to this, but I keep hearing people saying don't store your crypto in exchanges, and move it to a wallet. Are there any good apps that work for good wallets, or am I misunderstanding and it has to be on a computer? Or is it fine to keep it something like coinbase or Bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:01:34
So the more people that are buying (and selling) into Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin goes up? So then theoretically, more and more of the world will get into Bitcoin and the value will keep going up?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:23:03
Do computers really solve math problem lmao?? In the beginning was it like 2+2=4-1 that's 3 quick maffs, and then congratulations, here's your 1 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:21:37
Is blockchain a good app for this?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:09:21
Do you use the Binance app, because it doesn't have the highest rating?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:25
Unless it pops
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:50:39
Yeah, coinbase is just good for me as a beginner that's why I started with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:54:19
Can someone explain what would cause Bitcoin to crash? It seems to good to be true for Bitcoin to go up and up and up to 100k to A mil and further like people are predicting. But what exactly would cause a crash, and would it recover to it's previous state?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:35:45
I think just a little under 20k
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:17:07
Buy now or wait?
