Only tell her the amount of gains that you've actually realized (cashed out)

Not you specifically but that's a common misconception that this sub has

I think that the *current* status of Bitcoin is a bubble, but that doesn't mean that Bitcoin or crypto currency itself isn't viable. 
The reason I think that it is in a bubble right now is that there are too many people that are invested in Bitcoin are just in it to make a quick buck. You can claim that the majority of bitcoin owners are HODLING because they think that it will be the currency of the future, but after this week and the coverage that Bitcoin is getting from the main financial news outlets I can tell you that this is no longer the case. The demand is so high to get on this train, and so few people are willing to sell, that the price is just skyrocketing. Eventually, the people that are in this for short term gain are going to be happy with their rate of return and cash out. These people know how risky this investment is, so I think there will be a mass amount of people that try to lower their exposure to Bitcoin as soon as there is a sign of trouble. 
I don't think this is any indictment on the feasibility itself, just the hype is getting out of control from people that are in it for the wrong reasons. I think that Bitcoin will crash hard, and then slowly creep it's way back up as more and more people buy in for the *right* reasons. Of course nobody knows when this will happen or how far the price will fall.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Are there concerns about the sheer amount of electricity it takes to mine bitcoin/sustain the network? As bitcoin becomes more popular, even more power will need to be consumed. Is this sustainable? Is it ethical?

Equifax already lost mine so what's the difference
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:12
hope you don't lose your job lol

You are braver than I am lol
There's no way I'm touching my 401k

or each week, or each paycheck. Any consistent interval, it doesn't matter.
What I'm trying to say is, don't try and time the market. Just put in a little money when you can
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:57:07
but the risk of losing the entire 5% is pretty high lol

The best method would be to dollar cost average, meaning put in a certain amount of money each month no matter what the price is.

Sure, right now. But that's only because bitcoin is so small. If bitcoin wants to become the global currency it is going to have to solve this problem.

Be patient. Watch the trading volumes. When the volume spikes, it means the market is showing support for Bitcoin at that price range, which would likely indicate the bottom of the dip

It would be a gateway for institutional investors to put money into bitcoin that don't want to figure out how to buy bitcoin directly and safely store it. It sounds ridiculous, but that's a big barrier to entry for a lot of investors.


I really want something like this. It would be an easy way to diversify yourself

Just because its a bubble doesn't mean that you can't make money off of it.

Sure there is. Yeah, there's many people invested in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology and that it will be the currency of the future and are in it for the long term. Unfortunately, there are many MANY people that have bought in (especially within the last week) that just want to make a quick buck. Eventually, the price is going to rise to a point where these people are satisfied with their return and they are going to cash out. This is going to lower the price which *could* induce more sellers to get what they can and sell more which is just going to induce more panic selling. There are too many people who are in Bitcoin for all the wrong reasons.
