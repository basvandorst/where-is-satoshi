Didn't the other post from today say he paid 10 sat and 100 sat for his two transactions?
BCH transactions with at least 1 sat/byte (so 225 sat) confirm in one block always, so we're at 2.25 to 22.5x cheaper, not 18,000.
If you convert it to USD (at current BTC prices), aren't you at about 3x cheaper to 3x more expensive?
And I believe there's talk at BCH to lower the minimum to .1 sat per byte, which would mean BCH would be 3x cheaper to 30x cheaper?

Whoa, at least right now, bitcoin is a pretty good way to send money to india (from the US at least).
It looks like after all applicable fees, buying on coinbase and selling on unocoin, you actually MAKE about 1% (based on google's current USD to rupee exchange rate) for doing the transmission.

You actually can.. sell them on bitcoinbuilder.com for "real" btc.. the exchange rate is about .8 now. Then sell those real bitcons on any exchange for ~60% higher and still make over 30% profit. If you want, take the $ and send them back to gox and buy more!

I'm a little late to this conversation but this is awesome.. I actually had exactly the same idea a few years ago. Basically, why do we think congress votes should be public when we know how important it is to have private votes for everyday citizens?
Special interests just wouldn't work if they couldn't KNOW for sure that their spending was working. If I were a congressman and votes were private, I'd be like "sure, sure" and keep taking all the money I could, but then when it was time to actually go vote, I'd vote my conscience. Why not? There'd be no way to prove what *I* voted one way or another, fuck those assholes trying to "buy" me! And close to immediately, it'd be the end of so many perverse incentives.
I had the idea when I was on a board of directors and I proposed we have a PRIVATE vote instead of a public vote on an issue. A few of the directors were like, "that's ridiculous, everybody here knows they can vote their heart without any ill consequences." and I was like, "well, sure maybe, but even if so, what's the harm in making it private?" And then they were like, "well, everybody has already said they're for (whatever we were discussing)!" I was still like, "sure, but let's just officially vote on it, anonymously." And so we did. And it turned out, once the vote was actually anonymous, the majority voted AGAINST it.
In terms of the "how do you know if your elected representative is representing your interests?" argument.. well, you still see overall how things go, and your representatives will still have to at least publicly claim to support some measure or policy, so if you're not happy with that stuff, kick the bum out. Maybe they'll all realize they've got to do an overall good job since now they'll all be held accountable together and can't point the finger at the other party's voting record.
I'm 100% convinced this would be a huge improvement.

For the record.. this interview was on Saturday.
Also, I have been and still am putting all "real" BTC profits from the site back into GOXBTC. I wanted to align myself with those taking the big risk on gox, just in case something bad did happen. So I have realized no actual "profit" from the site so far.
Right now I have about 8300 BTC of my own coins (plus $400,000 USD) and about 40,000 GOXBTC of bitcoinbuilder deposits trapped in mtgox.
In fact I emailed my lawyer (well, ePub Bud LLC's, my company behind bitcoin builder, lawyer) in Japan about bringing a lawsuit against Mt. Gox... my new job for the near-to-long-term future is getting the most value out of mtgox for bitcoin builder GOXBTC holders (which includes myself of course).

You really can't without using a service like coinbase, but with one like that you can just set a recurring schedule to send $9 (at current price) once a month to your (static) account deposit address. We don't re-use addresses and we check all addresses once an hour so that this would work.
Alternatively, you can just pre-pay for a longer time period. Not exactly the same thing though!

gox coins are stuck in gox, so if you buy them on bitcoinbuilder, we can only send them to your address if its a gox account address! I suppose you could theoretically make money without opening a gox account if you bought some gox coins at .7 and then sold them at .8 without ever withdrawing them though!

Since there's no tax consideration until the company either goes under or you get a payout, I assume this is just for your own portfolio management purposes?
I'd say start them all as $0 in your spreadsheet, but keep track of how much you put in (so you remember how much you've allocated)... then be very conservative about upping the value of any of them. Maybe put it up to the value you put in if it's doing very well, and only put it as more if it's super clear that a liquidation event is imminent.

I agree that miners would want to always have blocks be just small enough that the demand outstrips the supply for blockspace. I.E. they want the blocks to always be full, and it'd be great if they were also as big as possible, while still always being full. It may be hard for them to predict exactly what size that is though, so they may play it conservative and want to keep the block size where it is now, where they know the blocks will always be full.
The problem is, users (should) want blocks always not full.. full blocks always means an auction to get into the block, which means a high price and less value captured by the user (more value captured by the miners).
I guess maybe the debate should be reframed instead of simply small vs. big blocks, it maybe is more accurately described as full vs. not-full blocks (or low vs. high fee). Because I guess as a user I'd always want the max block size to be something large enough to not constrain transactions at all.. but a miner would always want the biggest block size that still constrains transactions.
I think the beauty of Satoshi's original system was that miner competition would always force bitcoin fees to be low (though non-zero)... they'd always approach the actual cost of mining. Low fees help spread adoption and create more use cases. The system where blocks are full is quite different though; it's now user competition instead of miner competition, meaning high fees, and negative pressure on adoption and usability.
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:55:20
Yay! Chunkhost rocks!
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:34:39
Fails in what sense?
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:08:43
But with no artificial constraints, mining fees should always be enough to cover miner's overall costs, which is substantial enough for any business to continue.
With a roof on the number of transactions in a block, the fee market will behave as though it were a monopoly (even though it's still perfect competition among miners)... only those who gain the most value from bitcoin transactions will be able to use them, even though there may be many other uses of bitcoin with a value higher than the actual cost of maintaining a functioning distributed ledger.
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:28:35
Huh? But the top post right now, posted an hour before this one is:
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:03:13
Just that right now fees are averaging about 10% of the block reward per block, meaning mining revenues are about 10% higher than they'd be right now if the blocks weren't full.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:26:33
The problem is there's a huge increase/decrease in fees when blocks are full/not full, it's not that a gradual increase in the blocksize equals a gradual decrease in fees... it's more like two states:
blocks are (even just barely) full: there's competition between users to get into the block, so the fees tend towards the highest possible where people will still use bitcoin.
blocks are (even just barely) not full: there's competition between miners to include transactions in their block, so the fees tend towards the lowest possible where miners can keep the lights on.
So I think as a theoretical selfish miner, your ideal situation is blocks as big as possible while still always full. But it's hard to know where that line is, so it seems like the safest plan could be to keep it right where it is, because right now at least they know it's small enough to keep the users in competition.
@_date: 2017-02-25 09:55:18
I guess it's not most miners... just about half then, which does make me feel a littttle better! Although it's a little weird to me the BU ones are apparently signaling for 1MB blocks right now too? I suppose they would raise that if it actually activated, but maybe not?
It looks like segwit support hasn't really changed in almost 3 months now, BU has only gone from 13.7% to 16.6% in 4 months, and I'm not sure how much bw pool (8 MB) has changed. But anyway, I guess we'll see in another month how the numbers have (or haven't) changed!
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:20:27
Yeah, I think that's actually what the bloomberg article implied.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:20:17
Ah, I see... in that sense. What use cases fail if that were to happen?
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:30:27
That's true, but I think as a miner I'd look at the situation as:
Right now: Bitcoin is near an all-time high, plus I get 10% more than  bitcoin than I used to get.
Raising the blocksize: Maybe bitcoin goes up even more? But it's already as high as its ever been... maybe it has no effect on price? Maybe it's a tiny effect? But for sure I give up 10% of my revenue immediately. And unfortunately there's also no way to A-B test what the price would be with or without SegWit adoption... we'll never know what the price would have been had it been or not been adopted to compare to whatever happens. E.g. even if SegWit does get adopted and the price goes up 10%, we'll never know if it would have gone up 10% anyway, or maybe 20%, or what.
The only thing a miner knows for sure is: bigger blocks =&gt; 10% loss right now.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:36:41
I think at this point the majority of miners don't want to do ANYTHING that may result in larger blocks. Why give up 10% of their revenue today? If they were in bitcoin for the long term appreciation chances they'd just be buying and hodling.
I'm especially worried if they get used to this extra revenue, the cost of mining will eventually catch up to it (since it's a zero-sum game), and then they REALLY won't want to raise the block size, because it won't just be losing extra profit, it'll mean operating at a loss for a while.
I think the community may have to literally force some kind of block size increase on them. It may mean BU and Core (and Classic!?) all teaming up and doing some kind of segwit + 2MB block plus some automatic increasing schedule (I'm also worried putting the block size limit in the hands of the miners means it will never raise it to a point where fees decrease.) combo software. And maybe even if 70%+ of miners don't adopt it within a certain time, the hashing algorithm changes...?!
On the bright side, it could re-unite the community!

@_date: 2017-02-27 18:41:28
I've actually been wondering, what is core's decision making process? Is there a formal one?
It seems like most of the time pull requests aren't really controversial, so they just sort of add some comments and if nobody strongly objects, some change gets integrated after testing.
But what do they do when somebody does strongly object? I assume most of the time they just don't do it. But what if somebody else is strongly for it? I assume they still just don't do it because it's controversial? There is no actual formal "leader" now to core, is there?
Is it just the contributors (or the maintainers?) on  who kind of informally discuss things and there is no actual final decision-maker?
I'm wondering who/when/why they took that "no hard forks" position. I'm also not suggesting you would know the answers to all this! :) Maybe I should make a new post..

I guess I'm saying if the majority of "users" of bitcoin (wallet providers, exchanges, individuals, full nodes) wanted to increase the blocksize, and the majority of miners didn't want to, couldn't the "users" all upgrade to a version of the software that allows bigger blocks and hard fork to a new hashing algorithm, which would then at least "reset the clock" on mining, making it profitable for new entrants to get in the game?
Miners with cheap electricity might get into it as well, but if they did, they'd be accepting the new block size limits. And they'd of course only mine it if the exchange rate vs. difficulty calculation was profitable. The old chain would still exist and be mined, but if the exchange rate of it dropped due to the higher fees and less support, miners would slowly abandon it (until an equilibrium between value of the old chain and lower difficulty was re-established), right?

Ah yeah, I didn't mean to imply you were nitpicking or anything! :)
Agreed, it was more than I had thought, but I also agree the jury is still out, and I'm worried a month from now we'll check and it'll be something like 28% segwit, 17% BU, and 8MB 7.5%!
If I only knew how to use that remind me bot!
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:42:27
I just posted this in another thread but it's probably even more on-topic here:
I think at this point the majority of miners don't want to do ANYTHING that may result in larger blocks. Why give up 10% of their revenue today? If they were in bitcoin for the long term appreciation chances they'd just be buying and hodling.
I'm especially worried if they get used to this extra revenue, the cost of mining will eventually catch up to it (since it's a zero-sum game), and then they REALLY won't want to raise the block size, because it won't just be losing extra profit, it'll mean operating at a loss for a while.
I think the community may have to literally force some kind of block size increase on them. It may mean BU and Core (and Classic!?) all teaming up and doing some kind of segwit + 2MB block plus some automatic increasing schedule (I'm also worried putting the block size limit in the hands of the miners means it will never raise it to a point where fees decrease.) combo software. And maybe even if 70%+ of miners don't adopt it within a certain time, the hashing algorithm changes...?!
On the bright side, it could re-unite the community!
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:36:26
Oh yeah, I agree... I don't think SegWit is likely to even increase the effective size much at all.
But I suppose miners may think there's a risk that enabling SegWit could possibly result in more transactions down the road going off-chain, which is another hit to their fees.
Overall though, I think it's probably mostly "things are great right now (bitcoin's price is high and we're getting more of it for free), so why rush to change ANYTHING?" Even if it were a no brainer, upgrading is always work, so it'd take a long time to get everybody on board anyway. When it's work and possibly even remotely against  their own interests... good luck?!

For 1, do thin nodes only ask full nodes for blocks, or do they also ask each other? I'm not clear on that.
How would an invalid block get into the full nodes that the thin nodes rely on?
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:52:33
If you could define what minimum number of miners/nodes is decentralized vs. centralized, I'd likely be willing to bet that raising the block size limit doesn't make it happen.
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:43:12
2 and 3 seem reasonable enough to me.. what's the thinking for 1?
(Although I guess I would say there's a difference between a nation controlling hashrate and a bunch of independent entities in the same nation controlling hashrate.)
Another subtle point about decentralization/competition... it's not necessarily how many competitors are currently competing in a market that matters for consumer benefit so much as how low the barrier to entry is.
Even if there were just one provider of a particular service, if the barrier to entry were low, they would have to act as though they were in a fiercely competitive market because if they got lazy at all somebody would easily pop up and eat their lunch. Essentially, just the threat is enough.
Miners find themselves in a commodity business with pretty low barriers to entry. Which is to say just because at times the system may find itself relatively centralized, the actors should generally act as though it were highly decentralized, because if they don't, others who will will quickly step in and make it actually so.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:06:35
How many nodes is it no longer a bank in your opinion, and why?
I like to think of bitcoin miners/nodes sort of like typical competitors in a typical industry... in general, how many true competitors does it usually take to make for a competitive industry? Or taken another way, when do anti-trust laws generally kick in?
I believe in most cases if there are at least five true competitors, an industry is considered very healthy and competitive, and consumers benefit. Imagine how great your home internet would be for example if even just five telcos offered you service! I know I only have two choices and even that is enough to get me 300mbs symmetric for $150/mo.
Of course I wouldn't be super pleased if there were literally only five bitcoin miners/nodes, but honestly, assuming those five were legitimately independent bodies (say for example: a Chinese miner, mit, Coinbase, blockstream, and roger ver.) bitcoin is in great, great, great, decentralized shape.
And the truth is of course that there are already dozens/hundreds of entities that could afford to run bitcoin (and would) even if the costs were &gt;$10,000/month. And if the network were cheap and fast to use, there would be more and more entities like that coming online constantly.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:28:52
Ah, okay.. so let's say your orphan risk goes to 50% when you choose to orphan the previous block. Assuming you get double fees for it (and there is no/a tiny block reward), wouldn't your expected return be the same? Plus as pointed out, you're destroying the value of bitcoin which is the very thing you're trying to get more of!
And if another miner came along and tried to orphan your block, for triple fees, wouldn't there be 3 "heads" to the chain, so they only have a 1 in 3 chance of being built upon, so again the roi is the same, and so on?

@_date: 2017-03-29 20:41:19
Interesting.. but why would the block reward matter at all? If you're going to replace the current block, you'd get its reward too, right... plus the extra fees?
In which case, did people try and do this when the average block size was less than 500K? If not, why not?
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:33:20
I guess I don't see how this enters into it then.. if we're okay as long as no entity owns more than 10% of the hashrate/full nodes, I don't see how the number of light clients matters at all?
I guess you're saying if some amount &lt;50% of full nodes "attack" the network, if you're a light client and happen to not be connected to any of the &gt;50% of full nodes not attacking the network you will believe the (incorrect/attacking) minority (if it was &gt;50% it wouldn't be an attack anymore, but the new consensus, right?)? But even if 99% of the network were light nodes, wouldn't you expect only about the same % of light clients to believe the attack as the % of full nodes in on the attack? So overall the attack would still have the same % of clients believing in it as there were full nodes attacking? Which would always be &lt;50% (or else it's not really an attack), and so you'd always have &lt;50% of nodes believing the invalid chain, no matter how many light clients there are, assuming their distribution and which full nodes they connect to are distributed randomly?

Maybe a good compromise between increasing block "size" but not encouraging centralization would be to increase block *frequency*.
If say blocks were set to be 2, 10, or even 100x easier to mine (but the reward was 1/2, 1/10th, or even 1/100th as big), you could solo mine with 1/2, 1/10th, or even 1/100th the hash rate of what makes sense to do it now... thus weakening the need to join a mining pool, and increasing decentralization.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:37:12
Since the point of DCA is to even out price volatility, more frequent purchases are better than less frequent. Since all bitcoin purchasing options charge a percentage-based fee, there's no downside to lots of little purchases (other than more accounting headaches).
Coinbase even allows purchasing every hour.. the smoothest option for you would be $4.17/hour!

Exactly... unfortunately a halving of supply != doubling of price. It all depends on the shape of the demand curve, which is unknown!
Halving the supply could have almost no effect, or could cause much more than a doubling of the price.

Hmm, interesting. I wonder how much it would cost to double spend in a situation where it's never profitable to mine. I feel like I, as a holder, would definitely be willing to spend 1% of my current BTC value a year on mining.. perhaps a bit more even. Why? Because of the chance the value continues to increase more than 1% a year. If BTC still had about a $6B market cap and hodlers on average were like me, that'd still be about $60M/year needed to execute a double spend. Assuming holders weren't willing to start spending more if a malicious party actually did start double spending.
But if it was $200, yeah it wouldn't even have a $1B market cap. Maybe like $20K.
@_date: 2017-04-30 16:04:04
I don't really think he's wrong... if the ~24 nodes or so are all independent and self-interested, you've got a pretty decentralized system.

At 50c transaction fees, bitcoin is already more expensive than credit card / paypal fees ($.29 + 2.9%) for transactions under $7.24. That's starting to get up there. At $1 transaction fee, bitcoin is more expensive than credit card/paypal for transactions under $24.48. That sucks.
@_date: 2017-04-17 12:31:10
I guess sometimes the backlog is still being caught up with it seems!
But still, with an artificially low block size limit, eventually the fees will increase to the maximum amount people value a bitcoin transaction at.
If that doesn't get too high, it just means people have stopped using bitcoin for more and more use cases.
Admittedly, that's not a problem for a random person who just wants to send money via cryptocurrency. It is a problem for "hodlers" though.. because it means bitcoin is (artificially) less useful, and hence less valuable, than it "should" be.

That's the thing, as long as there are bitcoin holders, there will be people willing to mine at a loss to protect the value of their bitcoin.
Imagine there was no block reward and that the total fees per block came in way less than the cost of running a full node. People mining only for profit would stop, and the difficulty would drop. This would only leave people who were willing to mine at a loss to protect the network. But as long as Bitcoin are valuable enough and the costs of mining aren't too high, people will do it. And the cost of mining will decrease as people stop doing it, so there will be an equilibrium. 
Bitcoin will still be distributed and secure as long as it has enough value. And what has more value? A system that is cheap to use or one that is expensive?
I personally think a (serious) fee market will NEVER develop naturally, and is actually unnecessary for the long term success of Bitcoin. Unnaturally forcing it on the system is a mistake and will only hamper bitcoin's usefulness and therefore, its value.
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:48:05
I dunno... I think I would? Although I would be subsidizing the security of everybody else, I'd also be improving my own security. I think I'd probably spend at least 1% of my BTC net worth a year to do that. I don't do it now because it's not necessary with the mining reward, but if I had to, I would.
That's a good point about just getting out of btc to one that was better. But I think it'd be hard for another crypto to compete with the network effects of bitcoin if it was the most widely used (as it is now), AND it had the lowest fees (as I'm suggesting might be possible). As long as the security kept working (I'm thinking a $6B cap would probably support at least $60M/year in "patron-mining", so I think it would), bitcoin would still be my choice!

@_date: 2017-04-30 23:38:50
Thanks for the thoughtful response!
I do see that attacking 24 different parties would be easier than attacking 5,000... but regardless, is it in the realm of plausibility?
You'd have to attack them all (or at least 13?) relatively simultaneously.. because if it wasn't in sync the one(s) compromised would be able to recover by re-downloading the blockchain from the majority others that hadn't (yet?) been compromised.
I do agree 24 may be a little low, but I don't think it's really off by an order of magnitude. At what number do you think there's essentially zero chance somebody could attack enough different parties to rewrite financial history? At 24 nodes I'd put it at reallllly small, but mayybe not zero?  At 100 nodes I'd pretty much say zero though..
In terms of not trusting anybody, I'd argue that being able to check if something is true with a large number of independent parties is really the same thing as verifying it yourself. E.g. if I don't see the license plate of a car that side swiped me, but then I ask 24 onlookers to (independently, anonymously, and privately) write down what the plate was and they all (or 13+ of them at least) have "7BAK091", am I really "trusting" these 24 parties any more than if I'd seen it myself? I would actually trust that result more than the one I wrote down myself if I had seen it (and it didn't match)! :)

Overall it's pretty good, but there are a few bugs...
If you have say $1 worth of Bitcoin in your circle account and try and send $1.50, it won't let you, it'll give you a cryptic error like "minimum amount is .00161526 BTC", which is because they apparently won't do less than $1 from a debit card, and in this case they would buy the last $.50 with your associated card.
Then, if you up it to $2, it'll go through, but they actually charge $2 to your debit card, leaving the $1 in btc in your account. Also, if you then cancel the SMS before sending it, your circle account will then have $3 of BTC in it, but no entry in your history showing they bought $2 via your debit card.
Anyway, this is really just a bug report for circle in case any of them are reading this thread! Overall, awesome!

Don't forget "I created litecoin."
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:31:30
Here's my theory: the block reward can be thought of as a  "bear whale" who every 10 minutes puts in a market order to sell 25 BTC.  The "supply curve" of the block reward is a vertical line at "3600 BTC/day" (the price doesn't matter).
Miners can be thought of as BTC retailers who have a way to buy BTC at "wholesale" prices (long term the cost of electricity plus hardware must be no more than the market price or else miners would just buy the bitcoins at market price). Miners then either resell their "wholesale bear whale" bitcoins to people who buy them at market price (arbitrage), or hold them (in which case THEY are the buyers from the bear whale).
Either way, for the price of bitcoin to stay at say $240, there must currently be demand for 3,600 BTC a day at that price. Some of that demand is from buyers on exchanges and some of that demand is from miners choosing NOT TO SELL on exchanges for that price.
So the question is, when the "bear whale" decides sometime around next August to start only selling 12.5 BTC every ten minutes, something everybody knows he's going to do (the supply curve shifts to the left from "3600 BTC/day" to "1800 BTC/day")... will that affect the demand curve?
If it doesn't then the price should go up, because the place where the supply and demand curves intersect has now moved to the left, which means UP the demand curve, to a higher price (though not necessarily double the old price).
Unfortunately, the demand *curve* (not just the demand) for bitcoin probably IS tied to the price. In fact, people may already be refusing to sell bitcoin in the expectation the price will go up at the next halving, and perhaps when it doesn't (or doesn't go up enough), they might decide $240 is the time to sell after all, changing the demand curve. Or perhaps the price starting to rise a little will encourage people to buy more, start a bit of a speculative bubble again, and cause the demand curve to shift the other way.
That's markets for you! I guess if I were a betting man I'd say the most likely thing is at least volatility will spike sometime within August-October 2016!

My thoughts on distributed systems reputation and escrow:
Reputation: each participant will have to use the same address for transactions to be able to build a reputation. A reputation summary for transactions in the system along the lines of:
* Age of oldest Transaction: 2 y (98th %ile)
* Number of Unique Transactions: 4 (20th %ile)
* Median Value of Unique Transactions: 1.4 BTC (86th %ile)
* Median Unique Feedback: 4.2 (80th %ile)
* Median Age of Unique Reviewers: 2 weeks (3rd %ile)
(The percentiles may be hard to summarize in a distributed system, but probably not impossible?)
I think it's important to only summarize unique reviews, because you don't want to give too much weight to somebody's reputation that's been earned only by dealing with one other (possible sock-puppet) party. And then the other most important thing is the age of the other accounts they've dealt with, again to fight the risk of sock-puppet accounts and astro-turfing a fake review.
Escrow: To sort of do "decentralized escrow", an idea I have, though I'm not sure how practical it really is, is what I called "Mutually Assured Destruction Escrow". Basically, both parties have to first put like 5-10X the value of the transaction in a 2 of 2 multi-sig wallet. If there's a dispute they can't work out, they are BOTH out 5-10X. So there's a pretty big incentive to work it out. If they really can't, they could always then mutually agree to use a trusted 3rd party mediator, both handing over their keys to that party and agreeing to abide by its decision.

The technical reason is that we can't limit your uber rides to how much you have left in your account. So we just wing it by saying you can't take a ride at all if you have less than $25 in there. That number may have to be adjusted up or down based on usage patterns though.

When you get a cut and are bleeding, do you reengineer the human race to have metal skin or do you... apply a bandaid?
The main revelation that allowed Satoshi to invent Bitcoin was that "hey, hardware is so cheap and powerful, and it's only getting more so... maybe we could just have everybody keep every transaction forever and it wouldn't be that expensive... and maybe that'll keep being the case as bitcoin scales." And so far, he's still right. So let's keep giving it a chance!

I would argue in general it's more likely my own code was wrong or I was compromised/hacked/whatever than &gt;50% of 24+ independent individuals.
Let's say I'm the most secure, best programmer, most careful individual on the planet, and there's only a .1% chance I'm going to be hacked.
Let's assume the random average user has a very high, say 60% chance of being hacked.
If I check 14 other users with a 60% chance of being hacked, and they all give the same result, the chances of them all being hacked is .6^14 = 0.0007836416 .. 30% less likely than the .001 chance that I've been hacked.
Let's say there are 200 nodes, each with a (super high) 90% chance of being compromised. The chance of you checking 101 nodes and them all being compromised is .9^101 = 0.00002390525 (or .002%) ... you would have to be 37,648 times more secure than the average node (in this example) to trust yourself over the consensus of 101 other independent nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:07:11
Exactly.. it's a controversial opinion, but I believe bitcoin would survive (and thrive) even if it had a hard-coded 1 satoshi fee per txn... not just because of the block subsidy for now, but because enough holders would spend 1-2% of their bitcoin value per year mining at a loss if necessary to support the network and the value of their horde. Which at the current market cap is $285-$570M a year ... plenty of defense against any imagined attackers, and I believe about as much (within an order of magnitude) as is being spent mining now anyway!

True, you'd want the nodes to be as independent as possible. So, different organizations, different geographical locations, under different regimes, all with competing interests.
I think if you have that you're really getting the max "bang for your buck", decentralization-wise. Each additional node isn't really adding much extra resiliency/trust/performance. Especially by the time you get to like 100 or so.

The problem with all these arguments typically are two core things they get wrong: 1. just because something is theoretically possible or optimal, the "bitcoin holder incentive" is usually ignored. That incentive is that everybody who holds any bitcoin has an incentive to make bitcoin more valuable.. which usually means: keep it decentralized (enough for all benefits of decentralization at least), keep the fixed supply of 21M intact, keep the costs of holding and spending low, and try and spread adoption. Miners generally are the biggest holders of all (especially since they can't even sell their "bitcoin" very easily, since they're tied up in mining hardware that depreciates rapidly). 2. they use a slippery slope argument where they argue that "just because it would technically work now, there's no way it would work when bitcoin is X size". But nobody can know that, and in fact, bitcoin was probably impossible before around 2009, because hardware and bandwidth WAS just too expensive. But now it's not, and it still isn't, and I dunno, there haven't been a lot of computer-based technologies that were affordable for a little while and then got too expensive, so I'm inclined to bet that the math will likely always work out from now on that just raising the block size will not be a problem because the cost of the bandwidth and cpu and storage necessary to run a full node will never get so expensive that the network is in any way meaningfully centralized because of it.


This is summarized as "ideally miners want their blocks to get to &gt;50% of other miners quickly and never to the rest (so their block isn't orphaned but as many of their competitors as possible can't start mining on the next block). The main problem with this is  above.. basically it's just a theoretical issue because essentially anybody already mining is going to have no problem with blocks probably 10-20x bigger than we're at now, so no miner would really be able to outspend other miners to even attempt this attack (plus it violates  above.. the biggest holders of bitcoin would be compromising the usability of the whole network ... putting their entire nest egg at risk ... all for a very-difficult-to-actually-succeed-at short-term small-potential-gain attack).


This paper seems to be based on a lot of assumptions on what kind of hardware people are currently mining with. The assumptions seem conservative, since you already need proprietary hardware to realistically mine, and anybody running a full node for more than a hobby likely has pretty serious hardware devoted to it. This argument is basically summarized by "if we had 8 times as many transactions per day as we have now, likely half the existing nodes wouldn't be able to handle it."
But, if we had 8x the transactions it may be realistic to assume we might therefore have 8x the users... or at least 8x the interest in bitcoin, and therefore possibly ~8x the full nodes. Even if half of the existing nodes drop off (and half of people who would have added nodes before don't now), we may just as likely end up with 4x as many nodes as we have today if we had 8MB worth of transactions every 10 minutes. (And a much MORE decentralized network.)


This one actually doesn't explicitly say that it seems... more like "miners with &gt;29.2% of the network should optimally withhold a block after finding it until they find another one or somebody else does" and "block propagation delays can help larger miners." The logical leap being made is that "larger block sizes lead to propagation delays". However, I disagree.. it seems exceedingly unlikely just based on the networking already in place by most bitcoin miners that bitcoin transaction usage will ever increase at a rate faster than the provisioned bandwidth of the network. The internet is REALLY fast these days and only getting faster and faster! Therefore I would say "blocks increasing at the natural rate of bitcoin adoption does not imply non-negligible block propagation delays."


There have already been vast improvements on initial syncing (the whole blockchain can now sync in 3 hours on a $300/mo EC2 instance ... probably equivalent to a $50/mo dedicated server on OVH based on typical Amazon markups!)
Nevertheless, the argument that people will never be able to even JOIN the network because of initial sync times is a little silly. With checkpointing you can pretty safely just verify new transactions, and you could even do those in parallel on multiple machines if it somehow got so out of control. No matter what though, people will be able to get over the initial sync and I think all that really matters is the _ongoing_ cost of running a full node.


This seems to summarize as "1MB blocks currently (Feb 2016) take 5-30 seconds to propagate across the network" and "some pools don't validate blocks so they can get a jump on mining." I'd be interested to see the data on how long it takes actual miners to get 1MB blocks (I think he says very fast), because most full nodes these days don't actually mine, and if you're not mining, and the blocks come every 10 minutes on average, I'm not sure what practical problems come out of blocks arriving to you slowly. If you're trying to profitably mine already today, you're probably springing the $50/mo for a good internet connection though. The part about not validating actually seems to play into my point  at the top too... miner's aren't validating because they know every other miner's incentives are aligned with their own. "Only publish valid blocks because otherwise you may fuck up bitcoin and all our hardware we bought is worthless!"


This one seems to be more or less the same as peter todd's math paper above. Interestingly he even says "If I am not thinking about the harm to the bitcoin price, but rather just how much money I am going to make this month or next week, I don't necessarily want the relay network to work because that helps my competitors." which goes to my point  that's a big IF. Miner's DO think about the whole picture, because otherwise they made a really stupid investment in that mining rig.
Also he says "When we talk about scale, I am talking about 5 or 10 orders of magnitude." Which means 100,000x to 10,000,000,000x. 5 orders of magnitude comes to 10 trillion bitcoin transactions per year. In 2015 Americans did about 100 billion credit and debit card transactions. So even just the 5 order of magnitude scale up of bitcoin would mean more than 100x the number of transactions americans (4% of the world population, but much higher a % of all card txns) made with credit and debit cards in 2015. So anyway, that goes to  above. Yeah, maybe just raising the block size today won't be the best thing if 100x the number of transactions americans made in 2015 were already going over bitcoin. But maybe if that ever happens (it'd likely take 20+ years at current adoption rates), computers will be ready!
Anyway, thanks for compiling that list! I keep thinking maybe I should make a repository of "myths about bigger blocks" as well as "myths about segwit" and organize all the various points and rebuttals for the whole damn debate! :)

Tragedy of the commons only applies in systems where there is less cost to an individual to use some of the communal resource than they gain from it. In those cases, of course the individual's rational self-interest results in the depletion of the resource and harm to the overall group.
The beauty of bitcoin is there are no tragedy-of-the-commons situations because everybody who owns any bitcoin is essentially an owner of the "communal resource" (bitcoin itself). So there's no way for them to use up the communal resource for their own disproportional gain... they already own it and are only hurting themselves. It'd be like if I could figure out a way to make $5 for myself while destroying somebody else's $10... except in bitcoin it's always MY $10 that would be destroyed.


what about my point that it IS still fast between miners (mentioned in the link you sent), and my main point 


I believe that article's whole argument was that new nodes won't even be able to join the network if the blockchain gets too big, which is pretty absurd, considering a full verification now takes 3 hours on modest hardware and you could always trust a checkpoint to get started and go back and verify at your own leisure. (Essentially, work in SPV mode until the verification is complete.)

Honestly, the easiest way may just be to use "physical" bitcoins.. that is, physical coinage/paper money with private keys inside tamper-evident casing. If the goal is to make them well produced as holiday souvenirs anyway, bam.. have them include private keys inside somehow and the public key on the outside. See  .
I'm not sure how many and granular denominations you'd need. Would people give change in the currency too? Maybe just give change in regular currency. Then, actually, I'd just make use of the stuff at  and design some pretty souvenir notes (perhaps in .05 (~$12.50), .1 (~$25), and .5 (~$125) denominations), print them, stick on the tamper-evident stickers, and give it a try!
You'd need to train the merchants who wanted to accept it: (e.g. go to coinbase.com to figure out USD bill amount in BTC. take local paper wallet money, open it, scan the private key QR code into the coinbase private key importer, give customer change in USD (or perhaps even some smaller local currency "bills" if appropriate), throw away spent paper wallet (or even give back to customer as souvenir!)

What happened is right as I put it up, I saw on hacker news that there was this new site shirts.io (from ooshirts.com) that is doing API-based drop shipping, and they do screen printing and the American apparel shirts and everything so I was like "awesome, I have to use them for the honey badger batch that just completed!"
Well, that was maybe a bad idea because, as us bitcoiners know, sometimes (always) being an early adopter means slogging through a lot of crap.
It turns out I was (still am?) their first (and only) user. I came across every problem in their API (incorrect documentation, couldn't ship to ca without a valid resellers license; which we have, but there was no way to supply one), unable to charge payment methods, unable to turn off test mode, doesn't work if you try and supply a PDF for a packing slip, doesn't ship internationally (even though they say they do), and their order status API (still) gives a 404 error)!
Nonetheless, I worked through everything (except I'm still waiting on the status API) with their lead developer (who was a DreamHost customer and recognized my name from there, ha!) and the honey badger shirt is officially the first real order ever placed with shirts.io! I don't know if that is worth it, especially for you guys, but it has been over a week since the order was successfully placed, so I hope they'll all start getting delivered this week! I was going to send updates on Tuesday but that's when I discovered their order status API was broken! I probably should have just stuck with vgkids.com, but I was too excited by the programming aspects, and the fact that if this actually works (and it more or less does, now), it should mean we can do at least lower batch minimums (likely 12) and possibly even no minimums at all in the future!
So, my apologies! I'm personally looking forward to the honey badger shirt as much as everybody else!!

And yes, it is the buttercoin logo, but we thought it was just a nice design and they approved its use!

Chunkhost does! (Exactly like linode but cheaper and with SSD drives).
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:11:42
Heh, maybe we should make it always say "1 to go" for each visitor! :)

There's also an easy-to-use web-based one that works the same way at  .. nothing to install and let's you choose your buy/sell matching algorithm as well as reports your unrealized gains and CAGR!

Once we're past the preorder stage, definitely!

If you decide to buy in over some time, might I recommend bitcoinbuilder.com? It's free, anonymous, secure dollar cost averaging on mtgox. I'm not just the president, I'm also a client. ;)

It looks like if you request USD via qr code it forgets and asks for BTC anyway (like if I request 5 USD the qr code is for 5 BTC).

And to do that, I recommend bitcoinbuilder.com!

I've been doing this with my office mate for the last year for (almost daily) lunches (he pays with credit card, I send him bitcoin).
He's now had a year of free lunches!
With two Boxters change!

We went for lunch today! The first people to pay with bitcoin!
It took her a while to figure out the blockchain app she had installed on her iPhone. She ended up calling somebody (I assume knackfuchs) and then finally came over with it and I sent her the 0.1758 BTC ($59.95) for our lunch (which was very good) to  !
First retail BTC transaction in LA?

Word... message heard loud and clear!
I guess I was just mimicking amazon's flow, but of course you're right, we're not amazon and you probably don't need an "account" with us!
We do need an email addres though, for possible order modification/change communication.
I'll make the change tonight and post here when it's done!
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:45:00
Sure, we ship internationally. Unless Brunei is in space. Well, in space past the moon. Because we're on the moon.

DreamHost founder Josh Jones here!
Ha, that's funny timing... I didn't know the newsletter was coming out or that was in it, I haven't been involved in over two years (and I'd been lobbying dreamhost to accept bitcoins since July 2010)... just yesterday I posted this here:
In honor of DreamHost's bitcoin-teasing stance, the doubling credit for bitcoins will be extended through Friday at midnight!
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:03:35
Thanks! You just covered 93 phone calls/text messages! And probably even more if I never sell it!

Also, you can choose to pay the hardware fee over two years... and our monthly prices are still lower than our competitors... plus after two years ours drops to $9/mo from then on! Bonus!

Let me check... it does! :)

It looks like there are 100,000,000 shares and the current market price per share is about 0.0064 .. which implies a market cap of 640,000 BTC and a February dividend of 13333.24628 BTC =&gt; 25% a year dividend yield.
Which isn't a bad return.. except for all the risks:
* a BTC invested in satoshidice is a BTC out of your control.
* they may stop paying (as many) dividends.
* they may lose business.
* they may be shut down.
Of course:
* your broker may not steal your BTC.
* they may keep the same dividend payout rate.
* they may keep the same level of business or increase.
* they may never be shut down.

also, you can send it to any mobile number in the U.S./U.K./Canada, not just a bitcoin address.
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:19:18
Actually.. yesterday I sent 10 to my coinbase account and it was sent to an external address 10 minutes later. I have 2fA also and am pretty sure I'm not compromised. I also had another 1.56 BTC already in the account that wasn't touched.
I wrote coinbase and am waiting for a response, but I *think* it *seems* like it may just be an internal bug they've got on their hands. "Just".
Hopefully they'll be able to restore the 50 BTC (and my 10 BTC)!
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:01:36
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:32:25
Agreed... I just meant those are the risks. Not "those are the risks as compared to other bitcoin companies." I would agree the risks are smaller for satoshidice than some other bitcoin companies, but I would also they are larger than say, almost any U.S. public company.

The seller better only accept bitcoin for payment, or bye bye casascius!
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:42:07
That was only a musing! You really did experience the fun, I promise!
Los Angeles, CA!
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:24:04
That too!
That shows up in things like satoshidice profit... last month it was 25% up in USD but way down in BTC. Which also means fewer BTC being distributed, so more up pressure on the price if you want to get some!
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:29:41
Oh well, just use chunkhost... 5% off when you pay with bitcoin and cheaper than prgmr anyway!

That is correct.. it should happen automatically, but if something goes wrong, let me know, and I'll manually credit you!

Very good.. we were originally planning on going above XL, but then took it out for launch. They're back now!

What are some of the reasons Bitcoin could go to $0?
The only thing I can think of is if the encryption is broken and everybody's private keys are revealed. That would mean it didn't actually hold the properties I mentioned though.
I guess my question is really, how would a material that does hold the properties I mentioned become worthless?
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:49:00
"2 weeks" is a bit of a running joke in the world of developers as well. Any new product/features/release will always launch in 2 weeks.

(Being in the top 1,000,000 out of 7,000,000,000 only puts you at richer than 99.986% of people.)

Sorry about that! It's been fixed now, let me know if you want the .002 sent somewhere!
