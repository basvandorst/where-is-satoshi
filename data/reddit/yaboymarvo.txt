Yeah nothing beats the old school iron blocks. Strong as hell.

Since I live in the south where we get no snow so that means no salted roads it’s pretty rust free. There are a few spots in the bay where the paint rubbed off and got some surface rust but that can be easily fixed.

Yeah the evo 5 and 6 are my favorites. I have evo 7 taillights now that look so much better than the stock 8 ones.

Yeah so glad I don’t have to deal with that even though it’s awd lol. Here’s a older video of it, it’s got a few more upgrades since this one.

It’s not too bad on reliability as long as you go with quality parts and a good tuner. I have a 6262 turbo on it with the stock motor and makes around 480Ish hp. Have had in on for about 9 years now/40k miles. It’s taken apart right now getting ready for some more upgrades. Hopefully bitcoin will let me achieve my ends goals with it.

Luckily for me in not a huge fan of flashy super cars, besides the R8. So instead I plan on buying a bunch of classic JDM cars. Probably wait till 2024 when the r34 is US legal.

Well I currently already have an evo 8. Definitely want a r34 skyline,nsx and a mk4 supra to add to my collection.

Shhh. Let us have our moment.

Just noticed that the site I use to buy car parts now accepts bitcoin. It's not listed on the bottom but when you goto checkout it has the option to pay with bitcoin. This is such a great option for me now!

You try too hard to be funny. Mocking someone's last name was funny in 5th grade.

I have two hdd's in my pc and do a backup to both drives after every transaction. Am I  going to run into issues later on or should I be ok?

That's state taxes. Federal taxes are different.

I guess getting a country to the Olympics isn't that serious.

You're allowed to cuss on the internet. No need to self censor.

Which makes sense because it's cash only. A lot of businesses have company's that come by in armored trucks to pick up cash drops ,not only dispensaries.

Armed guards and layers of security? When I visited Breckenridge CO a few months ago the only security there was a cool ass dog. Sure there was a waiting room,but there wasn't a guy guarding the entrance with a gun.
