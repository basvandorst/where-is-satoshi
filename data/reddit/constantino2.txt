size is only the start.  our grandparents had 1 set of dishes and a radio if they were rich.  now central AC and a flat screen in every room is the norm.

I mean.... all of 1 day ago this post got 29k upvotes for stealing just 3million...

Lets walk this one out.
how would this present itself?
they would what... unleash this torrent of capital upon the masses to spend and drive up prices as buying power remains fixed and money supply increases?
so... youre saying redistribution of wealth would be a *bad* thing for the masses?
though ultimately, this money is already spent, invested in assets in office buildings, warehouses, and factories around the world.  Its not liquid... so if you did redestribute this wealth to everyone, you'd have to find a way to spend 3 shares of apple stock and a small piece of your neighbors mortgage...  which might not be so easy.

history says yes, they would.  we've seen deflation before.
I would suggest the volume of people who are paid in bitcoin are pretty low at this point.  but theoreticly, every dollar anyone here has invested in bitcoin is potentially a dollar they didnt spend...
still, its very fringe, only .5% even touch the stuff, and I suspect the vast majority of them are just dipping a toe in the water at that.
as a primary form of currency, the equation changes.
One important point to make, its not just people, because your right in that people are irrational beings.  but business's are not.  and this applies to them as well.  they will not reinvest, if currency deflates, that means they might just fire you because sitting on your would be payroll is worth more to them then the value you would have added by working.  and the value you add is already under pressure as consumption drops.
its a downward spiral from there.

thats land value though... a very limited resource in some regards.  hell...  its basicly a commodity like gold... and maybe even bitcoin...
the cost of constructing a house on that land is ever decreasing though.

there is inflation, but its also intentional.  thats one of the important benefits of fiat money, the ability to exercise monetary policy to manage irrational market behaviors.
every historical example of doing otherwise has ended in disaster.

think of where you work, maybe your lucky and your a farmer...  but otherwise, your product (or the product that uses your product) is probably discretionary.  so if everyone saves, they lay you off.  well now your not saving anymore because your not earning.  
we all sit around with our thumbs up our collective butts.  
It would be great if we could stop buying useless deteriorating novelty crap and say.... invest in green energy or engineering, or something that produces a return (though to be fair, some of the R&amp;D for a gadget is furthering more meaningful endeavers).  but alas, in a deflationary market, your not redirecting that money into NASA and IBM, your just parking it, hitting the pause button and wasting the fruits of everyones potential labor if even a fraction of those efforts would produce reinvesting returns.

cant prove anything of course, but logically... if I was going to steal peoples coins, I would just go dark, miss payouts, maybe steal the mining power for my personal wallet by floating fake bids...  not only would I profit on the mining, but it would queue up more bidder deposits.  You could probably keep getting hash power for weeks after the community wisens up from small time miners that dont monitor the forums.
What I wouldnt do... is turn off my servers on a Wednesday when the weekly payout is on Friday and theres atleast 2 more days of money to grab.
Its not proof of course, but it does raise some doubt in my mind.

I know factory workers making $32/hour...  and not even talking about OT...

some of the stuff we "waste" money on is helping society.  that iphone might be pure entertainment, but the A11 chip that only exists because of your "waste" is meanwhile powering medical advancements and whatever else you consider "meaningful".
sometimes you have to sneak the medicine in a hunk of sugar.

not exactly building the same house today as they did in 1973 though, wouldnt you agree?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:55:32
wouldnt you have to have a huge amount of inflation for a relatively fixed supply of bitcoin to come to realize the total value of currency in circulation?
I mean... once its full converted, sure, deflation ends...  but thats a hell of a road to travel.

how is decreasing expense through engineering efficiency for the same product a destruction of your purchasing power?
