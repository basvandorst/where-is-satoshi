To be entirely fair, he does bring valid points. How *is* bitcoin's value going up uP UP? Why is circlejerking over an obviously fake story about the USPS handling btc? Why do a minority of you morons actually understand how cryptography works?

Nice to see you pay attention to economics well enough to know who the chair of the federal reserve is. 
Bitcoiners, ladies and gents.

jfc you guys are idiots
SMTP is a **terrible** protocol. It sucks in every possible way. Good thing Bitcoin is also a terrible protocol. It makes for a very apt comparison.

The nanny state, or, you know, the bank that guarantees the security of your credit card transactions (aka the free market)

no it is a perfect present it is the present of EDUCATION okay
education into a world of useless currencies and highly volatile markets. if you thought a free house was a good gift, but then thought better after the market crashed, boy howdy you're in for a treat!

I don't think that Minecraft really leaves enough CPU cycles around for you to do anything that computationally-heavy.

Don't worry! The free market will cause this site to go offline by tomorrow!

and then in a few years she'll be like "Daddy, why are we poor" and you'll have to answer "Well, remember Bitcoin...?"

protip: if your currency depends on electronics, and no one has electronics but you, it's not worth anything (not that it was worth anything to start with)

Or because they are too stupid/cheap/apathetic to scale to meet demand.

Herp de derp! Look at me! I don't want to make money because I have faith in my Internet fun bux!
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:46:22
Seeing as my local liquor store takes real money and not BTC, yes. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:37:59
Sssshhhhh! No one is supposed to know!
E: I wasn't serious... :(

But the adoption fee is usually $100 max; if that is OP's most expensive purchase to date I'm curious where he lives (his mother's basement, perhaps?)

The bitcoin faithful don't believe what you just said and will stick their fingers in their ears when you say it. 
Bitcoin is going nowhere fast until this problem is fixed (and the personal liability issues, but that's inherent to the medium anyhow). 
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:35:32
Yes, that will of course be a trivial action after all existing technological infrastructure has been destroyed!
