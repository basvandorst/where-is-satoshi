Very well done and useful! Thanks for sharing

I know someone, he had a bad experience but he never told me what happened LOL. For me this is called "free will" people have the right to like or not. Just relax and do not take things too serious. When we get rich they will be crying like babies.

Well I think they already have mate

Cool! I remember breadwallet but didn't realise was open source. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:37:07
Cool thanks! I just opened a tab with open transactions
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:38:07
btw, I was told that the exchange software one can be complex and not a one-man job. Anyway I'll investigate.

I just started man so I'm not giving mine :)
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:31:55
Nah not permission dude! It's more about ask for references, so far I got some pretty damm insights for the next days.
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:27:41
That's one good idea indeed! I'll write this down

Do you mean save like an insurance?
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:36:26
This is true "awareness" is very important.
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:26:43
Yup! Start with core would make sense, in the other hand I already did some work for Mozilla and Firefox and I know how slow the process can be, what I've in mind are more tools, but I'll definitely check the current projects. Cheers!

My level of knowledge on cryptocurrencies is not good enough yet for work on core, but all the links sounds very interesting, I'll definitely check all. Thanks dude
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:30:30
Man soo many information in the past two days LOL! Thanks for that! I see, not sure if everyone provides an API. I'll investigate. Cheers

I found interesting the idea of circulate the coins. Thoughts?
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:21:07
I hear you! Definitely sounds like a project for an intermediare/advanced, like you said too much for one man only
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:08:23
You nailed it!
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:54:44
Pretty cool! You have talent my friend :)
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:52:04
Good point!
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:38:39
Hmm the exchange is a good idea, what do you mean with manipulate the price (sorry for the silly question)? Also any links where I can find more references on write an exchange? Cheers mate!
