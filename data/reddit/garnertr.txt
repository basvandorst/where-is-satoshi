Yes.  I have invested in crypto,  it's not just BTC that went down it's the whole market.   So instead of crying,  you should be laughing at this wonderful,  beautiful,  stupendous opportunity it is to buy.  
Why are ppl so stupid in thinking this is bad?  If your favorite product goes on sale, you think great time to buy more at this CHEAPER  PRICE.   
Ppl are getting this wrong,  this should be making you EXTREMELY excited.

If you trade your are liable to track Everything.   Hold nothing.  
I really think these types of questions only ask if it's a buy one, sell one is it a gain or loss question. 
But if you are a trader and buy sell multiple coins hourly,  your tracking will be huge.  20 coins buying and selling and buying and selling over and over.  It will be huge to track each every taxable event.
Spreadsheet or not.  Bot traders, day trading,  swing, passive.  Will be huge.

Didn't and still dont give a plunk.  It's a buying opportunity,  its freaking xmas early.
Some of us have never seen crypto this low.  So dust yourself off, pull up those britches,  wipe up and train the brain, every instinct should say it's a buyer's market. 
If you can handle it, you've not listened to the hours and hours of podcasts. YouTube,  whatever saying crypto is chaotic, drastic swings,  so lessons learned,  move on.
If your gonna complain sell all your crypto, buy some bonds and think you are making a difference.
