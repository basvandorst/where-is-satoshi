How come you got to post after being a Redditor for 3 days? I had to wait a week to get my wings! Lol at Roger, I’m sure bigger boys came and led him astray.

I’ve noticed the telegraph writes lots of outrageous and blatantly incorrect headlines about bitcoin then puts the rest of the article behind a paywall. Fuck them, I’m not buying.

What I’m hearing him say is that the worlds greatest investor’s missed the worlds biggest investment opportunity and will continue to criticise it rather than admit that the potential of the technology. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 06:16:46
I’ve never understood the need to advertise that you hold a lot of bitcoin, walking target right there. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:27:31
I agree

He’s going to get fed up being asked about it everytime he is interviewed. I don’t think he’ll ever take the time to understand it.

Mate bitcoin is stable in Zimbabwe dollars, it is a legitimate use case of conserving wealth in countries with no stable currency

I’m not sure you get it...I’ve got power of attorney on my mothers account and I’m making payment to buy glasses. It’s the principle not that I’m hiding anything.

That’s exactly it, I put anything else  it and it gave me this big spiel about scams. It may seem a small step to take for added security but for me it’s one more step towards complete surveillance.
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:58:08
I’d love if there was a little box to tell them what it’s for 
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:50:23
Sure mate I see your point but I’m getting asked almost every time I go in asking for cash, and all this talk of banning cash to prevent ML and organised crime, that’s worth the sacrifice too if the bank and governments knowing exactly every financial transaction you make? 
Government oversight comes in very small steps and if we don’t stand up to this then banning cash will be next 
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:16:18
Whaaaa?? What did you tell them? 
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:05:32
I kinda want to pick whichever one will make them call me to verify the transaction so I can tell them it none of their business!  
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:04:03
It would be good for adoption in that it would lift the profile of bitcoin being s legitimate payment method

This isn’t a swift transfer, I’m buying glasses for my elderly mom! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:31:25
Yes but it’s my money and I have a right to spend it without having to tell them what I’m using it for.  This is for a payment less than $100 
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:23:47
It’s not even crypto related I’m buying f***ing glasses for my mom, it’s the principle and another invasion of privacy

I will not sell for fiat.  I will exchange btc for goods and services where available to encourage adoption but until then I’m using fiat as it is the least desirable currency I own.

To be honest I was a bit disappointed with the book because I’d watched a lot of his YouTube content first and he comes across MUCH better live. The guy’s a genius and his ability to articulate difficult concepts in easy to understand analogies is brilliant.

So they are blaming each other? You should send each response to the other party and request a conference call...see who blinks first

Yea of course the banks would never agree to that. When they tell me they are recording the call I tell them I’m also recording it

Yea agreed I must have a good bullshit radar, these guys probably never made any money in crypto, only seminars in how to get rich from them!

Not really, a national hyperinflation burns an indelible scar in the heart of any person that has experienced it. That fear of quantitative easing has been passed onto generation to generation and the young express that fear by finding interest in the financial properties of bitcoin. To me it’s no surprise. Merkel found it difficult to sell the idea of QE to bail out The more indebted EU nations. Germans are scared of inflation and bitcoin relieves  that fear.
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:25:10
Germany has a dark history when it comes to its monetary history. The hyper inflation of the Weimar Republic means many Germans are still cautious when it comes to trusting banks with their money, might be in part due to that

@_date: 2018-04-09 21:02:58
That’s too simplistic an answer. Some individuals may do that but institutional money, especially that fleeing a financial crisis could move into assets like gold and dare I say crypto.
The recent December bubble was based on hype, wait till you see the bubble caused by another banking crisis.
The world doesn’t NEED crypto right now, but when the fiat bubble pops it will, and the exits will be jammed.
Take your seat now whilst it’s still at fair value
