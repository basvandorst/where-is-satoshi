offer a bounty, whoever can get them back give them 50-75 % of the coins. you will get some hardcore hackers coming out of the cold
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:51:20
Shh, if they wise up then the free money well will dry up
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:13:24
Haha, bet they never thought they'd be begging their kid for $$. Theymad, bro. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:10:51
it is unnecessary, mt gox is already fine, they just need to get rid of the lag
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:34:06
Too busy picking out my next lambo from all these trading fees :)

100 %.....
cause I want to be a 
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:35:10
Just use mt gox, dont listen to the fools who keep spewing anti-gox crap. It is just a vocal minority. Most bitcoin users are fine with it and it is here to stay. The lag problem has been completely fixed.
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:23:38
gold and silver price are also heavily manipulated. silver should be $100+, and gold should be nearing $3000
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:38:17
he mad, he so mad

lol im lying guys sorry
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:29:43
Nice post and agreed. There is also the advantage of a no risk speculation bet. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:13:59
There was also no real need for the dot com bubble, it was based strictly on betting on the 'next big thing'. While with all that is going on in the world, bitcoin is an absolute necessity that has arrived at the right place and right time.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:22:17
1 billion is cool, but you know whats really cool? 100 trillion

HOLD, SPARTANS!
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:42:38
I was with you till 'didn't get a tip'. If you really wanted money you couldve stolen it then informed them anonymously. I mean either do it for the $$ or do it for the security of bitcoin, you can't have it both ways. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:30:25
of course im with mt gox, anyone who wants to deposit in their account can PM me directly :)

not even the bots can save this one
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:16:28
yep but theyre the ones getting rich. no one gets rich playing fair. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:38:30
i personally love the mtgox lag, it is the easiest way to make money off noobs
for all those complaining about the shit technology, that is the best indicator that you are getting a great value. once bitcoin is smooth, perfect and easy, there will be a hundred times more users. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:59:02
Sorry, bro. Ulost. Time to join the litecoin army.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:45:45
Thank you, I always thought I was the most underrated poster on r/bitcoin

@_date: 2013-03-26 04:58:41
They mad? Oh yes, they mad. They so mad that they mad.

Yeah it's like ghostbusters when the red haired guy fucked everything up and caused the ghosts to fly back into the city. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:10:18
yes, we truly are the chosen ones. the ones who through darwinian fate, have been chosen to carry in the next great wealth distribution. and we will not squander it. we will create a better world
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:00:34
Thats MT gox to you, sir
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:56:52
You are paranoid schizophrenic
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:30:02
The haters were having a field day trashing bitcoin and its users since the crash. Now it's recovered they've gotten bored and left. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:47:25
I thought about metals but bitcoin is too great an opportunity. With gold/silver you will own one oz out of billions of oz and more to be discovered. With bitcoin there will only 21 million. Considering supply and demand and exponential user growth, it is a secret hidden in plain sight.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:26:14
hold your bitcoins for one year and you will owe a lot less tax 
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:34:50
That is the same guy who hacked blockchain and abused his position to gain info on a member. He aint a hero in my book. I think it is funny he believes he can track this guy down though. Good luck with that!
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:49:00
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:10:51
That's on them. There are still people who swear that gold is in a bubble. The price is the price, bitches, you missed out then enjoy life as a hater :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:16:28
scammers. coinabullshit always do crap like that.

$5000 by June, believe it bitches!
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:39:29
20,000 is pretty small considering the implications. Wake me up when this subreddit has 150,000. THEN we're talkin
