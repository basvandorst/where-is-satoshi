Get used to sideways trading for a month or two until more lightning nodes are implemented and fees go down drastically. For the first time in human history, we have the advancement of something being an easy cheap currency and store of value. Until the currency portion is scaled properly, bitcoin’s full potential is not realized. 
Gold coins used to be that until they were over mined (we could find massive gold deposit in the deepest part of the ocean tomorrow increasing supply and reducing price) and than used as a store of wealth. Gold was rare and heavy (hard to steal) which is why they decided thousands of years ago to use it as currency. 
Bitcoin uses MATH and laws of the universe with precise calculations. It is not fully mined till 2140 so if we can get this payment solution solved finally, we will be set for hundreds of years just as when gold was readily Mineable. 
If bitcoin cannot solve this scaling problem soon where everyone can use it to buy things cheaply (commerce) than Governments will have an easier time banning it like in South Korea and China now. If the payment side of bitcoin was fixed and everyone could use it, no one would allow their governments to ban the way they pay for milk and eggs. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:27:02
When are fees going to stop being so out of control? What happened to cheap instant global currency or have the developers switched to a global store of wealth? So confused cause one is transferring wealth and the other is just holding it in times of economic downturns which the works maybe facing shortly. Stock market cannot continue on this pace.

Where is the competition!!!!???!!! Where are the real Brian Armstrong’s?!!! This is USA. We are stuck with a company that doesn’t believe in what it exchanges!!!! Enough! Adopt segwit!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:46:16
Warren Buffett was a genius in his day. He owns majority of Coca Cola which is literally killing people and he refuses to admit it. He is not able to adapt to new science and thinks his way is the best. His company Coca Cola has made health care so expensive for others cause he won’t admit the science. 
A person like him who is a nice guy, we met him, but is stuck in his ways and will not change and why should he, he made his family billions at the cost of he poor who since the 70’s are dying from diabetes, obesity, etc... and their kids and their kids. 
He doesn’t care. He dismisses the science. Let him dismiss this technology. He’s not meant for this century. Sugar needs to be taxed or healthcare will continue to rise. It’s so sad and buffet wants to pretend he cares so give bill and Melinda a billion after causing hundreds of billions in healthcare diabetes costs. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:53:58
Brian Armstrong will not implement segwit cause bitcoin cash is null and void than and coinbase loses all the transaction fees. It’s going to be years to recover if these forks and inside traders and no competition for USA citizens. Lightning could be ready tomorrow and the community couldn’t use it cause of the current greed and state of affairs. Hopefully someday when these people get rich and go away but for now, it’s an utter travesty to have this great technology that is going to waste. Roger and Brian. Damn
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:24:46
It’ll hurt bch and roger and Brian are best buds. Segwit won’t be implemented while coinbase is around. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:37:12
He also thinks Coca Cola doesn’t cause diabetes. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:19:09
Something has to change. Warren buffet telling everyone it’s healthy is hurting people and the healthcare industry. Notice buffet doesn’t invest in healthcare. He only invest in car and house insurance where there is cash flow. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:15:07
Sort my Hot? Stop dude. Stock market isn’t continuing on this pace. It’s back to gold for the wealthy or bitcoin is we can help the devs provide a quality product 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:49:28
Hope so or Brian will have nothing to work with. Segwit first than lightning. He himself can advance bitcoin instead of holding it back with fees and business days in this day and age. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:29:22
Also if segwit isn’t implemented cause brian and roger are budding up, it’s going to take years to clean up the mess they created. Segwit will make bitcoin cash useless. Brian doesn’t want that cause he gets transaction fees on all. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:00:45
It’s worrisome cause 2x would have worked with segwit. I’m glad the community came together but no one is using the technology. Segwit needs to be adopted for lightning and other second layer scaling solutions. We need to force coinbase and exchanges to use it. Enough already. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:55:14
He lost his keys I think. That’s why he’s embarrassed to come forward. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:20:30
So true but once one of them have all the users, they could implement Lightning and go on. We need to deal with problems as they arise instead of playing the wait and see Game in such a competitive field. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:18:06
They never will cause it hurts BCH?
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:29:23
bitcoin needs to be used as a cash system now, not later, now because like South Korea and China where they are trying to ban to a certain extent, if it was available as a cash system and used by all, no way could any government ban it and there is no reason for the delay. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:08:46
I’m just a very dedicated person who wants to help this technology. I worked in government, private equity, etc... I see the system broken. Fed just prints money for 12 banks. It’s sad. It’s not how preside Wilson envisioned it. Read the creature from jeckel island. This is the only technology I’ve seen that will give power to people instead of the .05%. I’ve seen it. I don’t need the $. I want to stop this. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:22:02
This guy maybe the worst ceo in history. He’ll be gone in a year while holding bitcoin back.

Gavin said he’s satoshi and Gavin talked to satoshi more than anyone. I agree with Gaven that he is satoshi but people know he’s crazy and mentally stable so they refuse to believe he is satoshi. Craig is satoshi but he lost his keys. Gavin is not a bad person. He knows satoshi and Craig Wright even told Gavin the inside joke they shared. 
Sorry all but like Gavin said, Craig Wright is satoshi but isn’t releasing his keys to the team Gavin claims. I’m devastated this mental case created this work of technological art but yet all artist are crazy. Sad fact for bitcoin and the future. Best we can hope is his team steps forward and he gets pushed to the back. 
I welcome any other options cause I’m so depressed this maniac created something so beautiful. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:59:15
Bitcoin needs lightning 1st quarter 2018. I understand it’s hard and only 10 devs working on it but we will all give money if that would help. It’s such ashame it’s taking years for segwit than no one is using it (12% highest) and now Lightning will suffer while the lazy big blockers are taking it easy, collecting money and waiting for the hard work of others to take their open source tech.

@_date: 2018-01-04 03:57:13
Yeah ok... let us know when more than 10% uses segwit. We really think Lightning isn’t 5-10 years away when we have a great tech in segwit that no one uses. It’s unbelievable. But it’s open source so we gotta deal with speculators. Lightning nodes need segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:32:39
Understood but this was expected. Andreas talked about it happening in China and having to bribe officials in his many talks. Even he didn’t expect the speed the community grew. His letter he wrote after we gave him bitcoins was beautiful and he even said he might sell some in this bubble era. Bitcoin’s infrastructure isn’t ready for the demand. 
We didn’t expect this till 2019 when more nodes could be setup specifically Lightning nodes. Just everyone be patient for two years which I know is hard for this generation. It will fall to where the network can handle and grow accordingly as Andreas and other community leaders have suggested. Too much too fast is never good. Good much to you all. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:14:13

@_date: 2017-12-20 08:09:04
Understood but scaling has taken longer than expected in a competitive market. Andreas admitted as much. This can’t continue with fees. It’s pointless. Defeats its own merits unless the fringe market of remittances. Bitcoin is not $18k because of that niche. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:09:49
Is it true that other alt coins such as bcash can implement Lightning once it’s developed as they have been saying today? From what I read, segwit has to be implemented first and bitcoin hasn’t even fully implemented that yet? Less than 10% of users have Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:54
Can roger go to jail eventually for all the scams he pulled ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:05:21

No sarcasm. I don’t understand why bitcoin is so slow while litecoin is free and instant. I keep hearing Segwit is a available it no one uses it so why would devs work on more advanced solutions if Segwit is ignored for 6 months now.

@_date: 2017-12-21 07:02:05
Just larger a Blockchain to download is why they are concerned? Technology will deal that naturally. Moore’s law. Question is, what will Lightning be second layer too? Bch has gained too much support already. And South Korea is its major supporter. It’s going away. Politics got in the way again. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:09:47
Thank you for sharing. We need that scaling problem solved, we agree. No one can afford those fees. It’s useless besides storing wealth but hopefully first quarter of 2018 will bring the technology to everyone not just the rich who can afford those fees and buy lambos as they call them. 
You’re story shows the real use and how we need to lower costs now rather than later cause it’s getting ridiculous. This technology is designed for the unbanked. They aren’t benefiting from it at the moment. Hope the community understands that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:34:28
At least Bitcoin Gold has Segwit and will have Lightning. I’m gonna hold onto them to see how this mining problem sorts itself out. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:38:12
Sell BCash and buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin price would go up. Simple supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:01:37
Thank you. Now can we get continuous updates on the second layers like what was done in 90’s with the Internet. Every year it’s next year. Each year people are stuck on the first layer which is proving costly and defeating the whole purpose. Steady updates would be great instead of “a few years from now”. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:15:16
Of course

Maybe but simple supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:29:13
No, cause it’s fast 2.5 minutes and no fees. Why would you transfer money using bitcoin with $34 fee compared to 2 cents with litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:03:41
Where can I get one of them?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:37:09
Because they have a majority of the USA users (richest country in the world) and aren’t implementing the second layer technology that would bring bitcoin to everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:57:31
Why should they? In 25 years, they’ll be out of business.

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:52:23
So it’s true? They are dealing with the current issues of fees that the unbanked cannot afford and can implement Lightning when it’s developed? If that is the case, I’m very concerned. The infighting in the community is hurting the user for no reason than. I had more faith in these people. If they can do a soft fork to implement Lightning, why are we dealing with these fees? No one cares about the politics other than the true insiders. World just wants a cheap online currency. We can deal with Lightning when they are satisfied it’ll work but right now, why? Why pay the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:04:03

@_date: 2017-12-13 06:17:54
No cause litecoin has better speed and cheaper fees. Bitcoin wouldn’t last long unless litecoin did the same. Bitcoin needs to speed up second layer solutions and force miner adoption in the code.

CNN hates bitcoin. They will only publish the negative cause they don’t know the positive. It can’t be uninvented as Andreas says. It’s here to stay forever in the Internet age. Maybe cnn staff want to lower the price to buy more cheaper. It would make sense why they only like to talk about the bad. If so, those are smart staffers.

Anyone notice all the articles going negative this last week of 2017? It’s like they purposely want to scare off people so it drops along with their tax bill.  Andreas was right with his bubble comment but only because it has come so far too fast as seen via the fees. Not even he saw this and editors are trying to bring it down before building it up starting next week till all 2018.

Good point 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:55:46
Who is stupid enough to do that. The transaction fee alone could buy 40 burgers. Bitcoin needs lightning first 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:18:38
Just read a great article that gave an update on Lightning: 
“A successful implementation of the Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to operate as a high speed transaction system as it was meant to. This means that further forks like Bitcoin Cash won't be necessary for solving the problems of bitcoin's scalability. In the near future, we could very well realize the dream of paying for morning lattes (and everything else) with bitcoin. Accordingly, large increases in bitcoin's valuation would accompany widespread adoption.”
We can once again hope!! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:39:10
LTC is even more advanced than bitcoin with Segwit and Lightning network. That’s not going anywhere. It’s the perfect compliment to bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-09 02:39:34
Unbelievable. Everyone PLEASE only support exchanges and wallets with Segwit so we can advance bitcoin to its full potential. 
Tell coinbase YOU demand Segwit. If we don’t, we will lag behind when the technology is right there. 
Why Brian Armstrong wants high fees is mind boggling. We can’t understand why he won’t activate it. We tried media figures to question him and he says users don’t care about Segwit. What? We care about bitcoin and without it, there won’t be a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:56:30
Because he’s the only one who ever claimed that status. He’s crazy. We don’t want him to be the genius behind this. Gavin screwed up. They exchanged emails daily. Craig told him an “in” from one of the emails and told Gavin to go public. Gavin did as told like he always did when satoshi summoned.

Isn’t that math just based on two open channels? She said more than one channel can open on the same channel (I know she also said it would be here by now so it’s kinda hard to know what to believe)?
So it would be numerous channels using the same one.

Amen. Running a node also if this technology can change the world for the better than I’ll give it my all. Setting up a second one next week. Hope lightning is progressing as fast Elizabeth Stark said yesterday or else all for nothing.

That was written into the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:37:45
Coinbase implementing Segwit would speed things up and reduce fees but coinbase likes their fees. Don’t support exchanges without Segwit. We need that for the lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:22:02

We can’t even transfer to our hardware wallets without these fees. This infighting is getting bad. Do you see him on CNBC today. Unbelievable. Than Elizabeth went on and made a great point but it shows bitcoin isn’t ready for prime time just like Apple, amazon etc....wasn’t. Someday though. If everyone comes together on short term and long term solutions to this problem.

Thank you answering my questions. There is so much confusion right now. Per your answer, can bcash implement Lightning when it’s developed like he claimed? I understand the bitcoin community is worried about one part such as miners having too much power but the average users really don’t care. Can they really just implement Lightning if everyone starts using it over bitcoin in the future? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:45:25
Cause if they are lost forever, than only 20 million coins will exist which would have to be re-worked into all forecasting models.

We need the usage up from 14% to 100%. Do not support wallets or exchanges that don’t use segwit. Enough is enough. It’s going on 7 months. Use the technology.

Is this true: Ryan X. Charles, founder of a startup working on micropayments for content called Yours, and a former engineer at Reddit tasked with working on blockchain tech. He has argued that Layer Two solutions like the Lightning Network will suffer from centralization, and raise the possibility of increased fees. He contrasts that to bitcoin cash: “Bitcoin cash will have low fees indefinitely. On-chain scaling is fundamentally better than off-chain scaling in every way,” he says.

Are you asking me those questions cause I have no idea. I’m not a young guy. I don’t know all the technical aspects just the broad concept which is fascinating and can change the world but someone like you who seems like you know what you’re talking about, is saying lightning network isn’t possible, I want to hear it. What exactly are your concerns in the broad sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:48:01
Always play dumb. 
Let them think they know more than you and learn from all the mistakes they make and than retire while they are still trying to buy 1.
Sorry but I work at place that thinks it saving the world and they are cocky assholes. Law makes us report all investment but not bitcoin. We can’t wait to till we can leave while go on pushing paper. These people are the lowest of the low. Profiteering on human misery. It makes me sick how effective U.S. propaganda is that they can’t think for themselves. Bitcoin is our way out.

@_date: 2017-12-16 02:52:12
I understand we don’t want miners to have too much control but is the lightning network which keeps pushing back years just going to give more power to nodes with less security. I know on-chain will always be better security than off-chain if buying a house or car. Why can’t we just simply increase block sizes? Is this just a power struggle which will ultimately destroy bitcoin with promises that the lightning network is coming soon? Please! Someone smarter than me reply. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:27:35
How? That’s the biggest issue right now. If you don’t, explain so we can enjoy this benefit also. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:34:24
He did a Q&amp;A. They asked him about Lightning and he said it will be implemented but that it first had to deal with rising fees first while Lightning is developed than will do “a simple soft fork” to implement. He claims the problem is bitcoin is “ideologized” and not dealing with the current issue, just the long idea. I don’t like the man but he made a point. If a soft fork could implement Lightning in the future, why are we paying fees for no reason now? Is the power struggle within the community worse than we know. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:59:11
Well ladies and gentlemen.Bitcoin has once again had the eyes of the world on it and it responded with high fees and slowness once again.When there is no need for it cause Segwit is fully operational and some of the best minds are working on lightning Network.Why?If bitcoin is not going to adopt it!
The fees are once again breaking prior all time highs. 
Why is this happening? Where is the common sense? Early adopters are supposed to be the smartest who lead the population forward but we are ignoring the second layer technology. 
Why? Please explain the logic? 
There will only be so many times the world stops to look at a new technology. The fees are up to $45 and are hidden. First time users will never come back. 
Why?!! Implement Segwit!!!
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:06:12
It can’t be implemented till 100%? Asking cause most software isn’t but this is money and any bug will be exploited. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:10:11
No merchant takes bitcoin at $30 transfer fee. Pure speculation and hope for the future at this point. Hope that Lightning will finally come through in early 2018 and settles this huge debate once and for all time. 
It’s our yearly Christmas wish and is getting old but we can hope. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:40:05
There are so many people willing to contribute money, bitcoins to hire more than 10. You see what’s going on. Bitcoin is failing. Roger is gaining support everyday. Bitcoin is in the wrong hands with him but people want an online currency and he’s providing that cheaper and faster. 
I believe in bitcoin and the Lightning Network but it’s going on 3 years and every time bitcoin gets the worlds attention even in places that are unbanked which is where the niche really is, they don’t want to pay high fees and wait while roger is offering the same but cheaper and after these unbanked which we are trying to help see both products, patience is not a virtue when they need that money to educate or eat rather than pay high fees for a better technology “eventually”.
Please be more open with Lightning development time,willingness to accept help and let’s get the real bitcoin back on track or we fear all this work will be “left on the back burner” so to say

Roger did and is gaining support cause of the simple fix in the short term. He can not be allowed to succeed. He said today he will implement Lightning when it’s a available in “years”.  Is that even possible without segwit or is trying to manipulate more people to his product.

I ain’t buying it. Sorry. Too many good people want to help. I just talked to 57 people who each pledged a bitcoin each to get this Lightning network running finally.

Hey coinbase!!! STOP holding back the technology and activate Segwit. We need the Lightning network or bitcoin will drag for years. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:27:48

We just want lower fees and speed. If a simple block upgrade solves that, why not? Lightning just have its yearly promise. They are 3 years away at least. It’ll be dead by than. They finally admitted only 10 people are working on it. Are you kidding me? We have Andreas money for his work. I’ll gladly give Elizabeth 50 bitcoins to hire more devs. They are certainly out there wanting to help. I do not understand the delay. More market cap than Apple! Less than 0.00001% of its workforce. Let’s pay them so we have bitcoin by 2019. We need lightning or block increase. I don’t see why we can’t have both but the powers that be don’t like China controlling mining. Than create green energy in USA and mine ourselves. It’s not complicated. 
It’s human nature getting in the way and hubris. The solutions are simple; the delays are now inexcusable.
