So GG the whole market. "Just wait for the audit." "I'm sure they have $2,250 million banked" This shit is the worst thing that could happen to btc, it's going to set us back months/years.

2 billion is estimated to be 1/5 of all usd value in bitcoin, it's a very big amount. Don't be a shill. Fear is healthy when you're risking your money, the only person protecting your investments is you.

For the cheap price of 100m I could buy every btc on gdax between 10k and 15k and instantly raise the price. That would change the market cap by 85 BILLION, instantly. What a deal.

Tether is supposed to be 1:1 backed by usd. So if they don't have 2250 million dollars in a bank somewhere, they are buying bitcoin with fake money, this pumps up the price.

I still don't understand why HODLers care about the price. In one breath they boast that they know the tech is solid, they hold for the long term and never spend their coins. So why even pay attention to the price? 1 btc is always = 1 btc, they should be praying for more crashes right?

There is nothing wrong with being fearful, the most important thing as an investor is protecting your capital. If you're worried then sit out of the market for a couple weeks until things clear up. Might miss out on 20-30% gains, but also protect yourself from 70% downsides.

Actually dollar cost averaging is just a way to ease people into the market without triggering their psychological fears of investing. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you're sitting on a pile of cash, your best bet is to dump it all in at once and take advantage of long time frames.

You probably beat off to Peter Shiff talks.
Would you rather live 100 years ago so your dollar could buy it's "full value" of inferior goods or would you rather live now with your useless fiat, smartphones for everyone, computers with high speed internet easily available, cars, food from around the globe, the list goes on. 
Anyone can beat inflation with minimal effort. Even my savings account gives me 3%, risk free. 
If you lived in 1910 USA and bought sound money instead of holding filthy fiat you would have bought gold @ $20 and oz. that is about $500 today, gold is around $1200 so you got 2.4X return on investment over a 100+ year span. If you bought the S&amp;P500 instead it would cost you $8.91 to buy an index of the top 500. That is about $230 in todays dollars. If you held it just like gold for that 100+ years, it would be worth $2,920, or a 12.7X return. 
Sounds to me like hoarding "sound money" would have been a shit plan for building wealth.

Stay salty my friend. 
I'm a big fan of bitcoin and finance in general. That doesn't make me blind to all of the problems that crypto faces.  rule of investing is to not lose your money. You do that by being critical and not just following the hype. I want crypto to rise on fundamentals and not fraud. Hence why I talked shit about bitconnect when it was around and why I spoke out about the price when bitcoin was about to burst.

Houses only keep up with inflation over the long term, they are not a particularly good investment vehicle. Buying a house also limits what you can do, you're now chained down to one area. If you lose your job and cant pay your mortgage, you lose all the value you put in over the years. If you rent and the roof leaks or hvac goes out, you call the landlord. If it's your house, you're on the hook. Buying a house is a lifestyle choice, it's not a +EV choice.

You seem to think that selling bitcoin means they will never rebuy. In your scenario they aren't upset that they sold (that was the correct move in hindsight) they're upset that they didn't buy again. Though true believers will see the obvious pump in December as an opportunity to sell some coin to rebuy more later when the price inevitably dropped down. Good day :)

Billionaires wouldn't chose to play someone else's game. If they want to gamble they can go to high stakes casinos. They wouldn't want to enter a space that's already highly centralized (in terms of % of coins owned by % of wallets). They're better off buying the companies that support the system and making money off everyone else playing the game. Own the electric companies, the mining pools, the miner manufacturers. Billionaires would rather own assets that produce over digital commodities.

OFC being rich will make living anywhere better. But there are few countries I'd rather be poor in. In terms of upward mobility, the USA is still a good choice. Sure it's better to live in Denmark, Finland, or Norway if you're poor, but GL moving there if you're poor.
Those medical breakthroughs become cheaper over time. You can get access to medical care and live and be stuck with debt (which you can bankrupt if need be) or you can die. Tough choice. 
In terms of GDP the USA is still waaaay head, nearly 19.4B in 2017, compared to China's 11.8B, next up is Japan with 4.8B. 
Also China is only able to have such a high GDP because the USA buys things from them, China NEEDS the USA to have a higher GDP to continue to support it's (China's) economy. 
If the USA wasn't the strongest military force in the world, would you really want somewhere like Russia in charge with little to no oversight? Americas military force is what allows the majority of countries to live the way they do. They know that the world police will step in if another power steps out of line. It's difficult to conceptualize how bad the world could be if America wasn't in power, but it would be much more unstable without the USA leading the world.

You have only a basic grasp of what you're talking about. Other people have already pointed out that bonds do not rise with inflation.
But did you know that the USA cannot default on it's loans? The USA's debt is based in USD, which America controls, so at any time they could print money and pay off the debt if they wanted. Or they could use some of the $100T+ in mineral/oil/natural resource rights that the USA owns to pay down debt if they really needed/wanted to. Our national debt is a non-threat peddled by fear mongering gold shills.

I just said that it's difficult to conceptualize a world without america as the  superpower. But based on our ideals vs the ideals of the next in line, it's safe to say we're better off with USA as the top dog.
USA is not in massive debt to China, that's some straight up Peter Schiff gold shilling nonsense. China holds about 1.2T worth of debt, which is right around 5%. Japan owns about 1T, again, no big deal. 
The vast majority of debt is owned by the USA's own citizens and the gov itself. Also the USA is sovereign in it's monetary policy. Meaning it's debt is based in USD, which the USA has control over. At any time the gov could pay off all of it's debts by printing the money. The USA is not at it's highest debt to GDP ratio either. If anything you should be worried about the 100-200T of unfunded liabilities instead of some paltry 2T owed to China/Japan. 
Those health benefits are available in Germany because America did the muscle work and discovered them. The USA produces about 4x the amount of medical research and innovation that Germany does. 
Being poor anywhere sucks, but in America you still have great opportunities to get yourself out of that situation. Nobody forces student loan debt on anyone, sure it's a major problem (to the tune of $1.5T) but there are still thousands of community colleges and programs that provide marketable skills without going into debt. 
I'm not saying our healthcare system is optimal, but the accessibility is certainly there. And again, would you rather live in a country that doesn't have the services you need or would you rather get treatment and live to see another day?

USA's national debt is 21T. The USA has plenty of money to service this debt, IN ADDITION TO 100 TRILLION $ worth of oil, mineral, and other natural resource contracts. The USA is sovereign in it's currency and debt, it could print and repay 100% of it's debt at anytime, bankruptcy is not a threat.

Tell your job you're willing to take a significant pay cut to be paid in BTC. If you tell them they can pay you 10-20% less by paying your wages in BTC, they'll be interested. 
It will increase demand from companies, incentivizing them to accept BTC instead of having to buy it off exchanges. It'll also stop them from just accepting bitcoin and instantly turning it into fiat.

An increase of less than 10% of the monetary supply is not hyper inflation. The USA has the ability to service it's debt which is all it needs to do. It also has the backup plan on printing to wipe out the debt if need be, places like Greece don't have the option.
The gov borrows money and pays back a small % interest because that's indicative of a long term strategy. Printing trillions yearly and devaluing savings is going to be more detrimental than having a slow but consistent growth. If you had the ability to pay for a house right now but it would increase the cost of everything else you buy by 10% forever, would you do that? Or would you prefer to pay the house down over time and smooth out the payments/inflation?

That essay reiterates that the initial price pumps were due to speculation. The end goal is to create widespread demand so you can actually use BTC regularly. If adoption takes hold then there wont be such wild price swings and pump and dumps. There will be more incentive to spend instead of just hold. 
But ultimately it's still demand that gives something price, not holding. If the holders run out of fiat to buy BTC, and no merchants accept BTC, then it's got 0 demand and thus not worth anything.

It would have to be the employees who initiate this. True believers should be willing to take a short term loss for long term adoption and profit. 
As an employer, would you be interested if your employees came to you and asked to be paid in BTC if they took a pay cut?
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:00:39


I agree
But just buying and holding as individuals is not creating demand. If you want merchants to start demanding (and holding) BTC then it's up to individuals to kickstart the trend. Tell your employer that you'll accept a 10% paycut if paid in BTC. Since holders are confident in the long term, 10% is a small price to pay, and it's a win for merchants since they get to reduce costs. This will also increase adoption since merchants will be more willing to accept BTC as payment and then hold it.

Since bitcoin isn't illegal most of your points are irrelevant. People have rights, but if they break the law, they forfeit some of those rights. People are locked in jail for life over non violent drug charges just because it was their 3rd offense, it doesn't matter that it was 1 oz of weed, its jail for life. If the USA outlaws bitcoin transactions, then they are full within their right to detain people who break the law. That's how laws work. 
Again bitcoin is public and all transactions are traceable, meaning businesses wont be accepting bitcoin. Your option is to then leave the country.

Gold was used for many reasons, it's rarity being one of them. Another being the fact that it is immutable. It's used in computers, in space to protect against radiation, it looks great. Gold doesn't increase in value, it is a hedge against inflation. 
A currency can be a store of value AND lose purchasing power, they aren't mutually exclusive. If I have $10k in cash and I lose $200 a year, it's not going to have a meaningful impact, especially since I can cover that in a savings account. Low inflation keeps money moving and being productive. Inflation isn't a bad thing. Even bitcoin is inflationary, both in it's supply and in it's purchasing power. Bitcoin is shit as a store of value, but that's okay. Bitcoin has potential but people have to be realistic, it's not going to replace fiat anytime soon.

I would expect the dollar to actually gain strength during this next downturn. Since the federal reserve continues to increase interest rates, it makes it more expensive to borrow money. This tightening of the faucet (so to say) means that it's more expensive for companies to borrow money to flood into stocks/real estate. When people are fearful they want to cashout into safer stores of value. So in relation, USD should gain purchasing power against most asset classes. Just my amateur thought process, either way it'll be interesting to see how this all pans out. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:28:26

On average, real estate only keeps up with inflation over the long term. A mortgage can be a good investment for some people because it's essentially a forced savings plan. But it's primarily a lifestyle purchase, and not an incredible investment.

It's because of bitfinex failing to complete fiat withdraws and suspending fiat deposits. People are trying to get funds out of bitfinex, and bitcoin is their best option to do so. This means that people are willing to pay a premium (in tether) just to get their money out of bitfinex, where they believe it is at risk. 
Tether is currently trading at .98 usd to usdt, this is showing a lack of faith in tethers backing, in addition to a lack of funds to support the price peg. 
The last part is important because it doesn't make sense that bitfinex would allow the price to stay below a 1:1 ratio. If bitfinex could buy tether for 98 cents and instantly (and risk free) make 2% profit, they would. 
So yeah, usdt is losing it's peg, the 500k buy walls on kraken are gone, and people are starting to worry if bitfinex is actually as legitimate as they like to act.

You seem to think that the price of an inflated good stays where it's at even when the pumps have stopped? If I was bitfinex I could type in 500m in tether and instantly create it, I could then go and buy bitcoin, people think tether has value as a 1:1 with usd so they accept. This is the net same as someone with usd buying bitcoin, supply stays the same, demand goes up, price goes up. Now it turns out that tether is just made up and not backed by anything, this means all that demand that was driving the price up, is fake. Demand is down, supply is the same, price goes down.

i was thinking the same thing about you. If there are billions of dollars worth of value pushing up btc, and that all disappears, the price goes down.

Yiu could trade 2b tether for 1 btc but that doesn't mean the use price gets stronger

If the govs are actively squashing mining farms by looking at power usage, that allows them to create and run a centralized mining farm which would easily be able to run 51% attacks.

Let's use a more accurate number of 1.2T so the gold shills don't get too wet. 
China lent the USA 1.2T over the years by buying government bonds.
The USA sells the bonds to China, China gets bonds, USA gets USD. 
USA pays out interest and principle on the bonds. So sending money back to China, and reducing the debt burden. Does that make sense?
China holding doesn't matter in this situation, China might own 100k apple phones but that doesn't mean anything.
China bought gov bonds for 1.2T because they are safe. 
The USA gets to use that money however it wants, while paying out interest.
China holds an asset and receives a stream of money until the debt is repaid. 
China can hold USD if it wants, but that doesn't make any difference to the gov debt.

Eh, inflation isn't such a bad thing. Bitcoin is inflationary and will be for the entirety of our lifetimes. 
Printing money is a tax on cash savings, but thats it. Yeah usd has lost 99% of it's value since inception, but wages have outpaced that for the majority of history. In addition to that, would you argue that people in 1918 got more value for their money? Or are we living vasty better lives now despite a decrease in savings purchasing power?
Bitcoin has potential because it has inherent qualities that are desirable, a fixed supply is not one of those qualities. It's the cherry on top, but it's not the sunday.  
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:41:22
It's not even a contest.
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:11:52
Can't save money if you don't have a job because all of the rich folks just closed up shop because they don't need you anymore. Why run the risk of running a business if they can just hodl their wealth and be guaranteed a risk free increase in purchasing power? 
Advances in technology have 100% increased the quality of life. We have access to fresh foods from around the world, regularly. Most people have cars, nicer homes, increased education. The opportunities have never been greater. But keep trying to play the victim and see how that works out.

Tether is the number 1 reason why I don't go full force into BTC. It's also a major reason why I cashed out a good amount. 
Just because the bomb hasn't dropped yet doesn't mean all is well. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:33:43
Think of it as incentivizing reinvestments. 
In deflationary situations, money is worth more as time passes. This is good for people who already have money, and devastating for those who either do not have much, or are in debt. 
Someone with money has to put their money to work to ensure that it continues to increase. If a person has a billion dollars and knows that it'll be worth 970M next year, they'll put that money out in the world to try and outpace inflation. That's providing jobs and innovation. Meanwhile if he had a deflationary currency he could just sit on cash knowing that he'll be able to buy more RISK FREE in the future. 
Holding onto cash does not provide jobs, nor spur innovation, or do anything productive.

Deflation is terrible for the economy. It leads to stagnant money. Stagnant money is unproductive money. So unless you're already rich, deflation is going to shaft you much harder than inflation does.

In terms of a purely monetary standpoint, it 100% gets more difficult.
When there's 1m coins each valued at $1, a single rich person is able to double it's value. If you want to go from $20k to 40k (with 10m+ coins) it's going to take a whole team to double the price. Going from 40k to 100k is in turn more difficult, you need whole countries and mass adoption to boost up the price and keep it there.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:10:00

Most salaried workers have COLA (cost of living adjustments) in their contracts. It's really not uncommon for a worker to get a 3% raise annually.


Average inflation is 2-3%, yes in some areas housing has gone up, just like college tuition has risen. I'm interested in hearing your "real rate of inflation" regardless, it's not difficult to outpace inflation.


Literally anybody who has been in the workforce for more than a couple years knows about getting COLA. 


It's call the free will of the employees. If the company they work for isn't giving them a good deal, they'll leave for a better one. Just like how companies offer benefits, COLA is a very common request from workers.


Or, you know, just lay off workers. 
With a deflationary currency, there is less incentive to actually run a company, to take risks, to invest. If I have 100M why would I put it at risk and start a company when I'm guaranteed a decent increase in purchasing power with 0 risk? Why would I hire workers knowing that they'll cost me more and more money each passing day they work for me?
Deflation is one of the worst things for an economy, it slows down innovation and production. If you think the wealth gap is bad now, deflation would severely widen it.

A full audit would provide information about liabilities, not just assets. It would provide a timeline of deposits, to ensure that tether hasn't been commuting fraud.

I mean yeah by that logic you should just buy fiat because 1 usd = 1 usd right?
We're talking purchasing power, bitcoin now costs 4x as much as it did at the start of the year. Sure you may have the same number of sats, but you have just lost 75% value to inflation.


It's honestly not that sudden, bitcoin went from 1200 to 200 and didn't break 1k again for 3 years. Regardless, the past isn't a predictor for the future. 


You're still gambling, you're just taking the other side of the bet, the one that lost this year. 
By not selling at any price you're speculating (gambling) that the price will be higher in a reasonable about of time. 
Don't fool yourself otherwise :)

Another great question is how do you charge interest on a deflationary currency?
Since there is a maximum amount of BTC in existence, you could never charge interest (in btc) on any loan since that would require the total amount of BTC to increase.
Interest would need to be in a secondary currency. Which brings us back to inflationary fiat which everyone here hates. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:31:30
Easy when you sold weeks ago, the market gave you plenty of times to sell during a rebound. Live and learn. We'll be in a bear market for a long time, so your best bet is to just ignore BTC for at least a year.

Bitcoin is not a guarantee. Aside from the fact that it's not capable of meeting the demands of being a global currency, it requires that...
1. Fiat currencies around the globe fail.
2. The bitcoin network is still strong enough to avoid attacks, during a global economic meltdown.
3. Bitcoin is what people decide to use, over anything else that is available today or could possibly be available between now and a hypothetical collapse.

Bitcoin hasn't been around for the long term, it hasn't even been around a decade.


1) Long term? Work as much as possible and bank as much cash as possible. Push my savings rate up to 65-70%, live frugally and simply.  In addition to cash, I buy crypto and precious metals in small amounts, as insurance. As QE winds down, asset prices should reduce in price. I'll be looking to buy stocks and other income producing assets during the next economic downturn. Index funds, crypto, precious metals, and a high savings rate are my investment plan.

How much value do you think you're losing? If the average american household has a funded 6 month emergency fund, they've got about 20k in cash. Inflation is going to cost that family $400 over the year, that's an absolute yawn fest.


It's 100% speculation, AKA gambling. Bitcoin is insurance incase of a complete global monetary collapse, you should hope you never need your bitcoin. 


Holding during a pump expecting it to go higher is also gambling :)


*if* and you better hope it doesn't because the world will definitely be worse than it is today if the global economy fails. I'd rather be middle class in a thriving world than a king in a fallen country. 
And if it makes you feel better, you can replace price with value.

@_date: 2018-11-21 05:35:18


The original line is, "don't gamble what you can't afford to lose" which is why it's applicable to crypto, since it's a 100% speculative gamble. 
Calling it investing is an attempt to hide the risks, it's gambling.
You're SUPPOSED to INVEST more than you can afford to lose, that's how you get ahead. People close to retirement with a 2m portfolio can't afford to lose it, but that doesn't mean they pull everything out.

You missed the point. Interest is a form of inflation. BTC has a maximum supply and is deflationary in nature. Once the maximum has been hit, you cannot repay all loans in BTC since that would require more than the maximum supply of BTC.
For a hypothetical to illustrate the point. Say all 21m BTC get lent for 1 year at 5% interest. Now at the end of the year, the 21m BTC needs to be repaid, and also 1.05m BTC in interest. Total of 22.05m BTC needed, thus making it impossible to repay. Interest is a form of inflation.

According to common sense too. I hate to break it to you, but inflation is bad for bankers, and good for the loan borrower. Inflation makes it easier to repay loans, while making the value of those loans worth less. 
Low inflation incentivizes money to be put to work in the market, creating jobs and innovation. If there was 0 inflation (or deflation) the 1% with most of the money could just sit on their wealth with 0 risk and know that it would constantly be worth more tomorrow. 
Who do you think inflation hurts more? The guy with 10 billion or the minimum wage worker with $200 in savings?

Avg household income in the USA, 60k, let’s assume they have 6 months emergency fund, that’s 20k cash. Everything else gets used or put into investments.

Debt to GDP ratio is fine. The USD has been in more debt before and recovered just fine. 
It's better to have an asset that produces value then it is to hold a speculative "asset" which value is only based on supply and demand. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:51:52
Because the vast majority of exchanges don't use fiat, they use sketchy tokens instead.
USDT is supposed to be pegged to the dollar. They've never shown proof, so it trades at .975 usd = 1 usdt
So any exchange using tether is automatically going to trade at 2.5% higher.

Let's examine how much money a person really lose to inflation.
Average household income in the USA, 59k, lets round to 60k.
Let's assume they don't do anything fancy with their income. No traditional IRA, no HSA, no tax advantages at all. 
Assume a 25% tax rate and that family takes home around 45k/yr
Traditional advice is to have 3-6 months living expenses as an emergency fund. Let's give them a low savings rate and say they sock away 5k/yr into savings, the rest is spent. 40k/12 months =$3,333/Month
It's a family so they'll want the full 6 months funded, so $20k cash.
At a 2% inflation rate, they lose $400 a year in purchasing power. 
That's it, $400, less than half a weeks work for this family. 
That 20k means that a person can lose their job and not be homeless. If something happens they know their money is good, anywhere in the world. They won't have to cashout accounts and pay hefty fees for breaking the terms of the accounts. It's insurance, it's peace of mind, and security. $400 is a small price to pay for those kind of advantages. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 07:26:50
Hate to burst your bubble but bitcoin is inflationary too, and will be for your entire life.

The network can’t handle it anyway. We’re years and years away from mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:15:28
This is more inline with bitcoin and an open ledger though. 
Imagine having all of your transactions public? Your holdings public, every transaction recorded and held against you. Imagine countries blacklisting coins from specific countries/companies/people? That’s more possible with bitcoin than cash.

You don't seem to understand what a speculative gamble is and how it's different from a traditional asset. Bitcoin's intrinsic value is unknown, it is a speculation. 
A farm can produce X amount of corn on it's land and continue to do so, it's fairly predictable. Yes you might have a bad year, or few, but the farm has intrinsic value, the land, the animals, the machines. 


Faith based investing will burn you. 


Bitcoin won't prevent a collapse, it's not supposed to. It's there as a lifeboat after the collapse of the global monetary system. The global economy failing would be terrible, bitcoin isn't going to swoop in and STOP the crash.

But in a deflationary currency people will spend less. Making it harder to service those loans. Why would people willingly spend above and beyond what they need to if they know their money will only be worth more tomorrow?
By your logic the people who have the BTC and are making the loans will constantly accumulate BTC until there's nobody else that has any of substance. So then everyone is working for the lender just to repay loans. Sounds like the system people hate today.

I don't think you understand what you're trying to argue, I admit I find it difficult to understand what you're trying to say. I'm not arguing that quantitive easing hasn't inflated the price of many asset classes, but to say that there is no safe store of value just isn't true. Farmable land, tools, shares in companies with a broad range of assets are all great ways to hold onto what you've earned. Even if the dollar crashes, that doesn't mean having land with it's own water source is now less valuable, if anything it becomes more. If you're trying to point to examples and say that nothing is 100% safe and secure, that's a worthless argument, yeah a super-volcano could erupt and coat the earth with ash and put us into the a seemingly eternal winter and that would make your farmable land worth less. Are you arguing a defeatist/victim mentality of spend everything you earn and more because there's no chance to get ahead?

It would most likely crash hard. If people start losing their jobs, they're less likely to keep money in a very high risk speculative asset. 
BTC has only ever known a global bull run, fueled by easy money looking for any kind of decent return. BTC isn't widely accepted so it'll be tough to keep it. You can't buy your groceries or pay your rent with BTC (in the vast majority of cases) so people will sell for safer, more stable, investment vehicles/fiat.

Alts are only worth what the market determines them to be. Tether is tethered (hence the name) to USD so it's value is supposed to always be 1:1. There's nearly 2.3 billion USDT in circulation, which means that there should be a bank somewhere with $2.3B chilling, as a tether for these tokens. If the money isn't there, it means that BTC has been pumped up with $2.3B of fake money (roughly 1/5th of all money pumped into BTC's price)
Tether has never given an audit so everyone has to just hope that they aren't committing massive fraud.

It's unrealistic because BTC hasn't been around long enough to establish a true average. The 2k% is heavily skewed towards the beginning, and the easiest % returns. It's much easier to go from $1 to $20 than it is to go from $1m to $20m

No.

Bitcoin has not proven itself and it is too young to make meaningful predictions 20+ years out.


It's 100% advertised as a way to get rich. That's why 99% of people are here, to get more value out than they put in. Nobody gets excited about a store of value. Put in value today to have the same value 20 years from now, wooooooo.

Interest is a form of inflation. You can't charge interest in a deflationary currency.
Lets say there are 10m total bitcoin. Now lets also say that all of them are being lent out for 1 year at 10% interest. At the end of that year you would need 11m total bitcoin to repay the loan. Understand how that can't work? 11&gt;10

Inflationary can refer to either, a decrease in purchasing power (like we've seen for the past year, -% YTD and YOY)
Or an increase in the supply. Bitcoin's supply increases every single time a block is mined. Miners will continue to mine bitcoins for our entire lives, the supply will continue to increase until 21m are mined. 
It is increasing it's supply at a decreasing rate, but increasing none the less.

An exchange could "sell" bitcoins to it's customers and run a fractional reserve on the exchange. 


You can borrow bitcoin and misuse funds. A country can borrow bitcoin and be unable to repay it's debt.


Again, exchanges or 3rd parties running fractional reserves. Consensus could be reached later that allows an expansion of bitcoins supply. Forks could be streamlined into UI's all compiling to one currency amount. 21M is not set in stone. The code can be changed.

These people didn't set aside taxes from their profits in 2017. 2018 crash happened but they still owe taxes on their 2017 gains. Now their coins are worth 50% of what they were, so they are stuck having to sell off a major portion of their holdings to cover their tax burden. I'm sure many are waiting and hoping that the price recovers in the next few weeks so they wont have to sell off half their stacks.

Another nice attempt.
BTC/USDT is not bitcoin to fiat, no matter how much tether would like it to be. 
Bitfinex trades USDT and calls it USD so that's another 10% knocked off.
So really we're looking at about 10-20% of all bitcoin transactions are against fiat. 
Trading against fiat on exchanges isn't the same as cashing out that fiat from the exchange. 
Volume is cute and all but a lot of that is bots trading against eachother, while keeping money in the system. Gdax has a 24 hour volume of 300m, yet selling 100m worth of BTC would bring the price to below 2k instantly there.

"Negative interest on excess reserves is an instrument of unconventional monetary policy applied by central banks to encourage lending by making it costly for commercial banks to hold their excess reserves at central banks so they will lend more readily to the private sector.[1] Such policy is usually associated with very slow economic growth, deflation, and deleverage.[2][3]"

 Missclicked saved.
Bitcoin really needs to come up with a solution for it's deflationary aspect before it can be ready for mass adoption. Until it's price settles it's going to have a very tough time getting mass adoption. I'm interested to see how the devs work on this throughout the years.

@_date: 2018-03-24 02:07:15


That wasn't me. But I'll play along. Gold is historically a great hedge against inflation. You also can't easily spend BTC on anything aside from a few niche things. You can't buy your groceries or pay your rent with it. 


They just want a currency that is stable, not necessarily bitcoin. Again the risk of being your own bank is even higher in impoverished countries. 


That would be great, but BTC still has problems after that. If there are no (or low) fee's what incentive is there to mine and confirm transactions after the last BTC has been mined? Also the environmental impact is still a major problem that needs to be overcome.

Don't like debt? Don't use it. Live a frugal and minimal lifestyle and don't spend more then you make. Lead by example and maybe within a couple generations there will have been a complete shift in mindset. 
There's a great freedom that comes with living a simple life, most people aren't exposed to it so they don't even know it's an option.

Correct, the QE over the past 8 years has gone into stocks and real estate instead of inflation of daily goods. 


RE is a lifestyle choice instead of a speculative investment vehicle. Mortgage literally meaning death pledge. Many people buy houses for the wrong reason, or they buy too much house, and it does become a curse. 


Not over, people still need somewhere to live. But the prices definitely will come down if there aren't enough buyers to buy the baby boomers homes.

Certainly, but in a bull run from 1k-20k in 1 year, it's safe to say there's going to be a major correction after that. like bitcoin had done 7 times before. There was too much hype, too much tether being printed (700m+ in like 10 days) it's unsustainable. Now we still don't know how big of an impact tether has had on the 2017 run, so it's incredibly risky to be holding btc at all. Hence why selling at 15k+ was an easy call for me. If tether proves they have 2.2 billion, sitting in an unknown bank in an unknown part of the world, then I'll be interested in going in full force.
Tether was a major factor bringing the price up, and now it's a major liability keeping bitcoin from being more widely accepted.

Since it is impossible to foresee what the price will be next week, let alone 1 hour from now, a right/wrong move is all subjective. To some, it is the right move to sell, for others it's to buy more/hold. Since we don't know everyone's situation, I just want people to be able to voice their concerns/actions without fear of being attacked for having a differentiating opinion/action.

Because we are in one? The past 3 months of tanking prices = bear market. Last time it took 3 years to see a new ATH, I don't expect this to be any different.

What a useless sensationalization of bitcoin donations. 
If they received 1 beanie baby last year and 100 this year that's a 10000% growth of donations!!!! 
Total of $69m (in crypto) donated this year.
"According to a statement from the company, the cryptocurrency asset class falls within the broader category of non-publicly traded assets, which accounted for $1 billion dollars-worth of donations last year. That, in turn, fell within an even broader pool of $4.5 billion-worth of total donations."

And HODLers want the price to go up so they can have more fiat value. They might get REKT very soon.... They kept trying to find the top and we all know no one EVER finds the top successfully. The moment it really begins to crash, they'll have taxes to pay from 2017 and have to sell at a low price lol. See how you sound?
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:55:19
We're talking purchasing power. Knowing how many coins are out there doesn't help you when the value crashes 50% in a month and your bills still stay the same. Now you're spending twice as much as you would have a month prior. 
Again, how are people supposed to repay loans in BTC? Since there is a fixed amount, you can't ever have interest on a loan made in BTC, so what is the incentive to lend? How can you borrow BTC and hope to repay it if the value always goes up?

You can't chose to interpret the laws differently and hope the law enforcers will just agree with you.


Chain analytics in capable of mapping out millions of transactions. The more bitcoin is used, the bigger a web of information it forms. You might be able to dodge taxes for a while, but that data is in the public ledger forever. They will likely find out and fuck tax dodgers by the lock dick of the law.


If bitcoin is outlawed and you're proven to hold bitcoin and refuse to move it, they can put you in a cage.




It's about integrity. You live in a society where people pay taxes. If you take advantage of the benefits of living in that society, without providing your fair share, that doesn't make you a good person.

Nobody is investing in emails. Email isn't trying to be a global currency, it's a product that works better than snail mail, so it got adopted. If you had the option to "invest" in email today, and keep that money locked up for 60 years, would you? 
Do you honestly think that you can predict 60 years out and be confident to say that email will still be rocking and rolling and we won't have made any advances in tech?

Plenty of people were saying to sell for weeks/months, those people got downvoted and told they were spreading FUD and that it was "just a dip"
Then BTC gave them many more opportunities to sell when it bounced a bit, and people wanted to believe it was going to go back to 20k asap.
This is why it's important to take profit as it goes up so you can afford to buy the dip. Live and learn.

No worries! Great vids too haha! The national debt is definitely a big deal, but it's not unmanageable and all doom and gloom. Most of the national debt is held by it's own citizens, we're not owned by foreign countries like most will claim. And the USA is sovereign in it's debt, meaning it's debt is based in the currency it controls. This means we can never go bankrupt. IMO what's more concerning is the 100-200 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities that the USA owes. That's a big problem to face.

As the saying goes, you can shear a sheep many times but only skin it once. for less then 20k btc you can crash the market to less then 2k each btc instantly (on gdax).

Debit/credit cards are not a currency, they are a tool to use a currency. You can get crypto debit cards. We're talking about the underlying currency. USD cash is almost 100% anonymous, while bitcoin has a 100% traceable path from it's inception to today. Sure there is plausible deniability, but that's the case with all currencies. The more the bitcoin is spent, the bigger of a profile it creates. If john Smith bought viagra in a certain location and there is corresponding video evidence at the pharmacy, that's a ping. If the coins are hacked and used to buy something online and shipped to Madagascar, sure you can probably deny that. But if John keeps using bitcoin, his profile gets larger and larger, and thus, reasonable doubt becomes less strong.

@_date: 2018-02-09 17:25:39
I've got to disagree. Generally when there is a recession, people (and companies/banks) want to protect their assets and loans are harder/more expensive to obtain. In an economy where everything is going well, loans are much easier to come by because of the positive growth. Why would a bank want to loan money to someone if their job is at risk? Or if a company's profits are down and are projected to continue to lower? Since 08/09's start of the last recession, the federal reserve has lowered interest rates to almost 0 in an attempt to support the economy and keep it from crashing even more. The problem with that is they have nowhere left to go, except up, with interest rates (they have considered negative interest rates but I wont go there). When money is basically free to borrow, there are going to be more lenders/borrowers even if there is a recession, but this isn't how it normally works. The next economic downturn will be much worse than the last because the FED is running out of tricks.

I'm not going to argue that I am the  authority on btc, but I do enjoy studying finance in addition to crypto. You're coming off as upset/bitter which leads me to believe you didn't cashout in the 20-17k range. Sure you might have bought coins cheap but loosing out on gains still hurts. And if you're calling me a no coin, you are correct. When bitcoin reached a point where I wouldn't buy it anymore, I started to sell and ultimately got out at 15k+. I don't mind where the price goes, but I do expect it to go down. Complaining that others on reddit are selling their coins is wasted breath, these aren't whales dropping 5k coins at a time. I wish you well.

Federal and state taxes get spent on different things.

State taxes are used more on things that the average person uses, roads, firefighters, etc.

Tether is estimated to be around 20% of all value pumped into BTC. If it turns out that tether does not have a 1:1 backing, then it means they have been "printing" fake USD to buy bitcoin. This pumps up the price of bitcoin, artificially keeping it at higher levels.
Tether promises regular audits of their holdings, THEY HAVE NEVER DONE THIS. So it's up to faith that they have 2.2b+ USD/EUR in an unknown bank in an unknown part of the world. 
If it is discovered that tether does not have the 1:1 backing, it means people are holding tokens worth nothing, so they will try to sell for btc/whatever. USDT/BTC prices will rocket up as people try to dump their worthless USDT. At the same time, USD/BTC prices will plummet as people recognize that their bitcoin isn't actually worth it's current value (since it was inflated by tether)

Again, you don't seem to understand what a quick buck/easy money is. Your average stock buyer isn't trying to make a quick buck, hence the whole 7-10% a year point. People are piling into crypto because they see the high returns and think "hey! I want to buy a lambo quick!" People look at the stock market and think "I can double my money in 7-10 years." People look at crypto and think 5% returns is a bad month. Crypto is chasing easy money and a quick buck.

For BTC to really be great are guarding wealth then it needs to be stable, it is terrible at being reliable. When your savings loses 70% in a matter of weeks you're fucked if you actually need to use that money. What about when it went from 1.2k to 200 and took 3 years to get back to 1k? That's not the sign of doing very well. You can't retire on that.

Everyone already uses digital currencies in the form of online banking, credit cards, automatic payments and whatnot. Using decentralized cryptocurrencies isn't just about which individuals would want to use them, but which companies, utility providers, and big corporations would also accept them. There needs to be a full circuit for there to be true adoption, not just a few pizza joins taking BTC and then instantly selling it for fiat. 
We're definitely overdue for a major recession, it'll be interesting to see how BTC fares.

Fiat incentives investing and innovation with a modest rate (3%) of inflation. People need to stop pretending like their USD is dropping at 20% a year. You only need a 6 month emergency fund in cash anyway, the rest is put into investments. An emergency fund is insurance and isn't supposed to make you money. When it relates to BTC, why would anyone spend a deflationary currency on anything more than their basic needs? How do you even begin to pay back a loan in a deflationary currency? This is a serious problem BTC needs to solve if it actually wants to be a currency.

You don't seem to realize that the USA cannot/will not default on it's loans.
Did you know that most of the debt is held by the USA's own citizens? Only a small part is held by foreign countries.
The USA is sovereign in it's debt, it's debt is measured in USD, which the USA has control over. At any time the US gov could print USD and repay all outstanding loans. Default is not a threat for us.
Debt to GDP might be high right now, but it isn't even the highest it's ever been. Please do more research on monetary policy and how the USA operates. 
At least bring up the argument of unfunded liabilities if you want to make a case against debt.
Tether represents about 1/5 of all money pumped into BTC, the potential of it ruining this market is huge. All these other tether replacements will still face the same problems that tether does, mainly banking, since there whole purpose is to circumvent government regulations.

I guess I'm still caught up on the goal (or belief that this is the goal) of BTC being the 1 biggest and best crypto that everyone wants to have, in addition to it being a currency. With the global population continuing to boom and with demand for BTC growing (assuming the above goal) I can't wrap my head around how it would work in the long term. I can see it working as an asset class, but as a truly finite "thing" I can't see how it could work as a global currency for now. Again I'm interested to see how the devs handle these problems over the years.

How so? It's a public ledger so we can easily see the amount of BTC in each wallet. And the fed is not autonomous. 
 &gt;Right, but when equities and bonds start tanking and the credit union sends you a letter saying they are having liquidity problems, then where are you going to invest/hold you money?

I don't know where you're looking at, but there are TONS of ares where you can purchase a home if you really want to. Factor in that more baby boomers will be retiring soon, which means downgrading to smaller houses so that they can use that capital, so that's more houses on the market (price goes down). 
Also we've been at near 0% interest rates for the past 8 years so inflation has been mostly in stocks and real estate, as interest rates adjust upward, home prices will go down (though interest rates on loans for houses will go up)
If houses were such incredible investments, all of them would be owned by banks and only rented, not mortgaged out. 
Save up some cash and you'll get a great deal on houses during the next recession. OR you can play the victim and act like everything is out of reach. TBH there's nothing wrong with renting in most areas either. A house is a lifestyle choice more than it is an investment.

There is 0 proof that they either have the funds to support a 1:1 backing. So it's possible they are creating tether out of thin air to buy bitcoin and pump up the price. They have come under fire over the past months about their lack of transparency. They say they will have regular 3rd party audits to provide proof of funds, and they have NEVER done this. So the whole crypto market has to just hope that they have $2.3+ billion (roughly 1/5 of all money that entered the market) in an unknown bank in an unknown country. They stopped accepting new users months ago yet are still able to pump out $1 billion+ somehow, again with 0 proof whatsoever. They hired a legitimate audit in September but recently that relationship dissolved.   So everyone has to just HOPE that they aren't committing massive fraud and that they wont bring down the whole market. The only thing that can solve this issue is a 3rd party audit, which like I said, has never happened.

You don't bounce after a drop like this, btc is still trending downward.
:edit to add couple points:
You need to study more about markets and why market cap is not a useful metric. The tether/bitfinet subpoena was on december 6th but was only recently made public for the first time. A reporter and a whaleclub member is not a legitimate source for what tether is supposed to have. The only way to know for sure is to get a full 3rd party audit done. Tether has never done this.

Literally one reply up...


Any loan with interest would increase the supply (inflation). This means that all loans could never be paid back.

@_date: 2018-02-22 06:29:27
Relatively fixed and finite amount are not the same thing.
Fixed supply = 0 interest, not 0 lending. If all 21m BTC was lent out at 1% interest, that means you have to pay back 101% in 1 year. So where would these new BTC come from? And before you say "all btc wouldn't be lent at the same time" it's an example to easily show my point. Interest essentially creates new quantities, but since BTC has a fixed limit, it wouldn't be possible to repay.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:36:12
That's the thing about the public ledger, it's there forever, every single transaction. So you might not be able to draw the connections today or tomorrow, but the world has years to piece together this puzzle and make the connections. When BTC becomes more widely accepted and people start to use it to buy things, it'll be much easier to narrow down and focus in on wallets.

Bag Holder
An investor who is on the wrong side of a stock for an extended period of time, with the consistent belief that he or she is in fact correctly predicting its direction, despite strong evidence to the contrary. Typically, this person loses most or all of his or her money in the process. 
The term comes from people in soup lines during the Great Depression, who held potato bags filled with their only possessions.
"All the retail investors who bought priceline.com in early 2000 saw their investment value shrink 99% over the following year. They were the bag holders the smart traders unloaded their shares onto."

And if they can't? Nobody buys houses anymore? Or cars? or starts new companies? Fixed supply means no interest charged ever. Interest would be adding to the supply, thus creating inflation in a deflationary currency. Why would fiat value be a thing if it's failed as money? Why would any BTC holder lend their coin for fiat value if BTC guarantees better returns by just holding it instead.
This is a major problem that BTC is not able to handle. One of many.

Price is relative value between a currency and anything else. It’s not limited to usd. A currency can have a limited supply and still crash, just like we’ve seen over the past year. The price of anything in bitcoin has gone up 3x since the start of the year.

Also, where has tether been for the past 2 months? They pumped out over 700m in a week when the price was 12k+ and yet we're supposed to believe that NOBODY ELSE wants money in crypto at 6k-9k? Smells fishy.

Purchasing power (price) of their country currency is crashing, so they look for something else that has more stable purchasing power (price)
They wouldn't want bitcoin if it was crashing faster than their national currency, so yes, price is a motivator. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:32:15
And my point is that fiat is predictable, if you have 100k today, you know that you'll have roughly 97k worth of spending power next year. 
BTC could be up 100% or down 90% in the next year, that's not helpful if you're trying to live off your btc, if you get sick and need to cover medical bills, a whole range of scenarios require dependable purchasing power, BTC does not offer this.
Gold isn't promoted as a global currency, it is a physical asset used to hedge against inflation.
Sure things need to get built, but they will be built at the bare minimum since holding BTC is more profitable right? Why would people lose value for the sake of building more things?
If Bill Gates could have 2x as much value in 1-5 years just holding BTC why would he keep microsoft if it only provides 6-10% return a year?
Again, how do you repay a loan in a deflationary currency?

@_date: 2018-02-22 03:52:08
I understand compounding interest, and again 3% is very manageable. You're not supposed to have all of your wealth in cash, a 6 month emergency fund is plenty for most people. An E fund is insurance, and 3% is chump change to pay for that peace of mind.
You can put your money wherever you want, it doesn't have to be wall street. 
You can call it a casino but investing your money is one of the major contributors of building wealth.
How are people supposed to pay back loans in a deflationary currency? Why would people spend more than they need to if they know that their BTC is always going to be worth more the next day? Deflationary currencies are stagnant, would you really want the richest people in the world just hoarding their money in cash and never using it? Or wouldn't it be better for them to be chasing profits? Making businesses that innovate and create new tech?

I'm not talking about the ethics of the funds but the amounts. I don't believe that world powers are going to accept a crypto and create a new super-wealthy group of millennial men just because BTC is scarce. The amount of resources available to the people in power is immensely greater than the tiny marketcap of BTC, they don't need BTC and could easily squash it if it was seriously a threat. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:59:56


Current interest rates are about 4%, not that much higher than inflation. Houses are very safe investments for banks to have, they earn PMI until 20% is paid down, and if the person stops paying their mortgage, the bank gets the house back again and again if need be.
Unlike credit cards or student loans, the house/land is a tangible asset that isn't going anywhere.
Bankers would love deflation. Since they hold the money, and get to loan it out, they get a double whammy on profit. They get to fractional reserve lend, and all of the loans are getting harder and harder to repay, so it takes longer to repay = more profit for banks.
That being said, lending money with an interest rate creates inflation. So for a true deflationary economy, there could never be lending for profit, only lending for free. Any interest charged increases the monetary supply. 


The 10b guy is taking on risk by running that company, sure it might be making a profit now, but that company constantly needs to stay ahead of the curve or it'll get left behind. If they could just sit on their pile of money, risk free, and still earn a good profit, they'd do that.


COLA is pretty common for most jobs. Sure you might need to ask for them (most companies wont offer to spend more money voluntarily if you're a bad worker), but they're still incredibly common.
100% there should be living wages to any adult working over 40hr/wk, but inflation is not the cause of this disparity.

Tether pumped fresh money into the market so that always helps. 71.5m EURT pumped in on the 6th. Kinda strange that buyers want 750m USDT when the price is 9-13k but only 71.5m EURT when the price is 6k.

1st. The creator has had full access to the wallet this whole time and looks to cashout in some fashion. Prior deals are arranged and he buys massive assets with a few trades.

The USA CANNOT go bankrupt, since all of it's debt is in USD, and the USA controls the creation of USD.
The real concern for the younger generations isn't the 20T in debt we're in (we've been in worse debt as a % of our GDP before). The big concern is the USA's unfunded liabilities, that's 100-200T that we need to pay, be worried about that instead of the 20T we can wipe out at any time.

Of course taxes could be lower if we weren't funding a war machine, and didn't have literally hundreds of bases around the world, but that doesn't mean you can pout and just not pay your taxes lol. 
If you're so apposed to wars, what are you actively doing to change it? Are you writing to your senator/congressmen regularly telling them? Maybe starting meetups in your local community to brainstorm ideas on how to stop this misuse of funds? Or are you just complaining and want an easy copout?

Financial literacy and basic financial knowledge aren't taught enough so people end up getting stuck in rough situations where it seems like theres no way out. I enjoy helping people see that with proper budgeting and goal setting their dreams become a lot more attainable. But yeah, I believe robo advisers are going to be the biggest hit to finance jobs.

You may not have said they sky is falling but you made the point of "Fiat punishes HODLers by reducing buying power over time." which is exaggerating the downsides of modest inflation. People don't have 100% of their value in cash all their lives, so your point of people being punished isn't accurate. As I said, 6 months emergency fund is all you need in cash, and it's insurance so inflation eating at is is a weak argument.
How do you invest if you cannot save money? Savers are investors. I don't see you as the enemy, just misinformed. If you don't like the loan question, then how about...

Tether pumps up the price with artificial demand. 
1 guy takes $400 out of the market (chump change by USDT standards) and the market tanks 70%

You said you ditched fiat a a long time ago, implying that you no longer deal with it at all. I assumed you were from the USA and rightfully believed that this would be impossible. Checking your posts I was able to see you are not from the USA. Maybe being in crypto is a good alternative to being in your national currency (see Venezuela). Whales 100% are able to manipulate the market. Many whales share a common goal of gaining the most money (value) as possible, they work in groups to pool their power. In an unregulated market they are able to do things that would be illegal in traditional financial markets. Wash trading, painting the tape, spoofing etc. If you truly are a whale I hope you have diversified your assets and are not sitting in near 100% crypto. There is nothing wrong with pulling out profits and protecting yourself. Again going back to my cashing out at 15k+ point. Though it could be buying property/precious metals/solar panels etc.

If you want to talk about cheep manual labor sure. Let's not pretend that those exported jobs aren't appreciated though. Many of the countries we outsource our labor to have little to no options for work, and being able to make clothes is greatly preferable to having no jobs. 
And indeed we have been at the forefront of innovation in many sciences, including robotics (which increases productivity as well).
I know it's popular to shit talk America but let's not pretend it's all terrible.

"The Fed currently has its benchmark rate pegged at 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, which could be seen now as too low if the inflation pace is sustainable."
""The worry of the markets is not that inflation is becoming a big problem, ... it is that the Fed is now forced to play catch up at the same time they are shrinking their balance sheet," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. "If the Fed wasn't so scared of their own shadow in 2015 and 2016 and hiked rates three times each year, we wouldn't be having the same conversation.""

For BTC to charge interest it would have to be in a 2nd currency. BTC would also have to be incredibly stable for this to work as well.

If gasoline went from $2.49 to $1.99 that is a plummet in the commodities market. In crypto it's a bit more palatable. 
People get very emotional about crypto, when it goes up 5% it's headed to the moon and everyone is getting lambos. It drops 15% and people get scared and exaggerate. Nothing to be upset about. Not everyone has been in BTC for years and is up 1000% so for them a 70% drop from an ATH is eating into their initial deposit and not paper gains.

My wording is fine. Again, we're talking about comparing an established global commodity that is used in every single part of the world, to a niche product. BTC went from 1k-20k in a year, a 20% drop is more palatable (acceptable) than a 20% drop in oil.

Moron. 
Inflation creates additional amounts of the currency, all loans could not be repaid in full. Just like how people like to shit on fractional reserve banking because people could never withdraw all of their cash, that would be the case with BTC lending. Nobody could hold all the money owed to them from lending.
Interest = inflation.

Wrong again. One of a kind was connected to my pinky, which is still true. I have 1 left pinky, and 1 right pinky, each are unique. Pubes, as a plural, by definition, would not meet the criteria of unique. 
Again you seem to have trouble grasping the snowflake example. Snowflakes form as ice crystals, the common saying is that "no two snowflakes are alike" thus unique. Snowflakes are not valued on that uniqueness. 
For an example of something that is truly scarce and worth little to nothing? Your time.

First of all "profit" isn't correct because it's not a private corporation with shareholders. It's a government agency collecting TAXES to fund public services. 
You reap the benefits of taxes every single day, from the roads that you drive on to the internet infrastructure, sewage lines, firefighters and police. You get to feel safe in your country because we have a strong army, you get to go to hospitals, receive SNAP if you're broke. The list goes on.
Try moving to a country without taxes and you might find that just shelling out a little bit from your profit is actually a great deal.

Trading with .5 btc and trying to making a couple % isn't nearly the same as trying to trade with 10k btc and trying to make the same %. Large amounts of money move the market too much.

Bitcoin is deflationary in nature. Lending money generally isn't free, there is an interest rate attached to the loan. That % is a form of inflation. Bitcoin is not compatible with traditional lending. 
Encouraging savings is all well and good, except it leads to wealth hoarding. Those people will billions of dollars that are putting their money to work (giving people jobs, creating new tech, general innovations) now have the option to make money risk free by just hoarding their wealth. This would further widen the gap between the haves and the have nots. 
You can encourage savings in other ways. An environmental approach to consuming less is one way. Teaching general financial literacy is another.

If OP has any debt that isn't a mortgage, then he doesn't have the money to gamble on bitcoin. I'd rather be debt free than be owned by the banks. Those 0% cards are 1 late payment away from adding on a years worth on interest. They also setup a payment structure that wont pay off the debt in time to qualify for the 0% rate, then they hit you with interest for the total amount of the loan.

Lets not forget, though, that other countries get to spend more on social projects because the USA spends more on it's military. If the USA wasn't top dog, that would leave Russia and china leading the world, which could be arguably much worse. America has the means to intervene, which is why we do so often, out of a moral obligation (and sometimes out of profit seeking, which is no bueno and should be fixed). If you saw your neighbor and their children getting attacked outside their house, and had the ability to intervene, you kinda have to. 
America continually leads the world in medical advancements, it's no contest at all. If you want medical research or most of the best doctors in the world, you come to the USA.
Cops get a bad wrap, but that's media sensationalism. At least where I live, the cops DO protect and serve, they don't become cops to piss on people. There are over 300m people in america, of course you'll be able to find cops that aren't good people, but they are far from the norm. Cops have a very stressful job that can mean literal life or death situations daily, most people have no idea how that can wear on a person or alter how they see the world.

What makes you think the middle class are harmed by 2-3% inflation? The middle class generally get COLA (cost of living adjustments) each year to ensure they have the same purchasing power. 
Inflation eats away at cash savings, and since the vast majority of wealth isn't in cash, that's really not a problem. 
The average person/family needs 3-12 months worth of living expenses in cash as an emergency fund, this is insurance. Any wealth over that emergency fund is put into productive assets to build more wealth. 
Your cash emergency fund is insurance, and insurance costs money. So you have 20k in cash and that costs you $400-600 a year to protect yourself and your family from cashing out investments that bring you a higher return/would have penalties for cashing out.
If anything, inflation hurts the working poor that make minimum wage and don't have access to competitive wages to get COLA.

You do know that gold is only a hedge against inflation and doesn't outpace it right? Buying gold is fine for keeping the same amount of purchasing power, but never getting ahead. 
The last decade of easy money went into real estate and stocks, not into daily goods. You can still save money by living below your means and finding ways to earn more money. There are lots of opportunities to be more efficient in life
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:27:03
It also wouldn't be as good as everyone here thinks.
You can't make loans with a deflationary currency, interest is a form of inflation. 
People will billions of $ worth of value need to invest it to not lose value, if they have a risk free option to increase their value by just sitting on their cash, they'll do that instead of putting it at risk. Stagnant money is unproductive money. 
Deflation would lead to slower rates of innovation, less jobs, less discretionary spending.

Access to money 100% helps an economy grow. It allows people to start businesses, buy homes, buy goods that improve productivity. 
Maybe your a farmer with tons of arable land but are stuck working it by hand, thankfully there are banks that will lend you money to buy tractors and other wonderful tools to improve your yield. 
Maybe you have an idea for an amazing product but don't have the funds to pay for 1,000 of them to be made, banks are there to get your business off the ground.

Bitcoin is a deflationary "currency/asset" meaning that it's (if all goes according to plan) going to continue to rise in value, by having BTC pegged at a certain price, it locks in a price and doesn't allow it to move up or down.
BTC wont need a peg once it becomes more widespread and has ironed out the price fluctuations.
BTC is still in it's price discovery phase, it would be detrimental to adoption to lock in a price so early on.

That's a small problem that bitcoin has, but it illustrates the bigger problem of coins being lost forever. People die prematurely without wills all the time, so there is a very high potential that coins will continually be removed from circulation. Which leads to the main problem, deflation is not a good model for a currency and hosts a ton of problems for the broader economic landscape.

So you shouldn't be throwing out advice that could potentially make people waaaaaay worse off. It's better to err on the side of caution AND PAY YOUR DAMN TAXES. If the IRS says that the trades are indeed like-kind, they'll send your money back. If you knowingly hide income/commit fraud, the IRS will fuck you royally.
