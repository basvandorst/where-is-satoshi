No worries. You can't be too careful. There are many snakes in the grass.
Cheers for the award!

ha.. i promise im not. I'm just interested to know if there is a reason... Like for example if lightning network is leading to fewer transactions
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:08:30
Transaction volume hasn't increased since April. Does anyone know why? It seems to struggle to get above 400k...

Bitcoin was designed so that it would be the most secure financial network in the world. It has to be. If it breaks through centralisation of miners then everything is lost. It may have been the most minuscule of risks to increase the blocksize but even that was not worth it because the security of the network is the most important thing. *Any* increase in centralisation is negative to security.
A solution to scaling has been created in the form of LN . It has taken a bit of time to develop and will take a little more to become mainstream. But does that matter? We now know that small bitcoin transactions will be essentially free and instant while we can continue to store the main bulk of our Bitcoins on the most secure network on earth.
I dont believe it is true that miners in China chose 1MB because of the Great Firewall as my understanding is that Bitmain, the largest miner, actually backed BitcoinCash but, even if it was true, surely that would be another argument for smaller blocks if it means the Great Firewall is less effective?
Bitcoin is for everyone: poor, rich and everything in between. It is decentralised and essentially unbreakable. In a few years time, when everyone is making micro payments using LN, this whole block size debate will be a thing of the past.

The reason it was not increased was because there would have been *some* increase in centralisation. It was an unnecessary risk to take. The onus of proof was on those that advocated for larger blocks not on those who wished to keep it the same. It is not necessary to justify English over Esperanto and, as with language, so with currencies: if you wish to speak in BitcoinCash and larger blocks, you can, but most have gone with BTC.

Hold on to it. It's good to have your foot in the door. Don't worry about the fluctuations. This is a long term project. Cryptocurrency is a better form of currency than anything that has existed before so will surely become the thing that measures value. Currency like language is the ultimate network that tends towards one winner. The Bitcoin network is larger than all the other cryptocurrencies combined. It will probably win; if it does, one Bitcoin will be worth more than $15m. Hodl

It's potential value per coin was best summarised by Hal Finney at the very beginning:  ([

I don't think it can become stable until that point. As new markets start accepting it, it should lurch upwards. I suspect the big moves will be associated with a commodity exporter accepting bitcoin as payment and a central bank diversifying its holdings into Bitcoin. The moment large cross border trade starts being done with Bitcoin, its price should naturally tend towards that global wealth number, as realisation sets in that it has become the global reserve currency.

fair enough

Got it. Thanks

Global wealth is about $300tn so if Bitcoin succeeds in becoming the global currency then it should become stable at about $15m per bitcoin:  $300tn divided by 19m (21m bitcoins will eventually be produced but at least 2m have been lost).

At minute 51:32  ( [  ) Bill Gates says that with quantum computing you could issue as many Bitcoins as you want. I dont understand how. Could someone explain what he means?

From 1800 to 1900 the British pound was deflationary. Britain did fine in that century.

When investors elect to receive scrip dividends, they have to pay tax as if they had received cash. Is it not quite similar?

At the very beginning, on the launch of Bitcoin, Hal Finney said it could be worth $10m per Bitcoin based on world wealth at the time and supply cap of Bitcoin. The only thing that has changed is World wealth, which has gone up...  [
