miners already vote on difficulty - if they want a difficulty increase they increase their hashing power, if they want a difficulty decrease they decrease their hashing power.  The more decentralized that mining becomes, the less likely it will be for anyone to game it.

If it is related to the adjustable block size then yes there does seem to be some work to figure out the right time period.  When did they publish this?  it looks really good.

coinbase is good if you want to accept from coinbase users.  bitpay does a better job of accepting BTC from all the wallets.

^ this.  stop trying to by coffees.  start solving the real pain points.

another proposal?  how is this different from UASF?

can you please buy Coindesk and replace their writers with people who actually know something about bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:42:34
what they added from bitpay is actually bitcore - so yes you can spin up a full bitcoin node on azure.

raising the limit does increase throughput.  But, it does not improve efficiency (which is what I think he meant).
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:09:25
so unexpected, but so cool at the same time.

while software patents are difficult to enforce, at least they are applying to counteract the massive filings from banks and IBM

Their Copay wallet is really good.  I had used blockchain wallet for a long time but finally dumped it for Copay.

ah, I gotta wait for Apple

This was a message from BitPay CEO Pair. Pair was CEO at the time of the theft and he is CEO now.  Looking at your post history you constantly troll Tony.
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:15:06
that would explain the price rally - if they fired their trader then they aren't dumping coins on the market.
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:44:06
where?  not in the app store

Oil CEOs comment on the price of oil. Gold Mining CEOs comment on the price of gold. commodity price != company stock price.

how do you connect a trezor to your iphone?  trezor only works over USB.  so this feature would only work on desktops.
