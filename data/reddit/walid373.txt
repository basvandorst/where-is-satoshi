Can confirm, in Belgium also had to verify a second document.

People might call you stupid but we need pioneers like you.

You guys can use [this visualization]( tool from blockchain.info and [follow the BTC like so](
Pick the cluster by address option, orange dots can be expanded even more by clicking on them.

This just looks like a christmas sale to me

What do you mean by "entry level rig". Need some GPU specs or something. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:16:38
Watch aantonop on YouTube instead.

Where can I follow in somewhat ELI5 what Core is doing, updates etc?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:21:33
Feels more like a rollercoaster for me

Are there other coins that already have something similar to "Lightning Network"? Sorry if I'm asking a dumb question, I discovered Bitcoin not so long ago. Altcoins is atm completely out of my scope

I believe you can check Mycelium source code on Github if you're into that. About the 12 words, of course you can use it in other wallets.

If you plan to hold and not sell I would recommend putting ur btc on a hardware wallet so you safely control the keys yourself.

Segwit address starts with a 3. Unlike normal addresses staring with 1. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:41:07
Website doesn't have anything about "Lightning Network" or whatever. Github is all code, don't understand anything. Mailing list might be more interesting but still not like a subreddit talking about the development etc

Deposit money on Coinbase, go to GDAX, import that money from Coinbase (same company) and set a limit order, (maker fee 0%)

Am I safe with €150 om Mycelium?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:55:40
What are the differences, just the screen and interface?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:45:55
How did you go about explaining it?
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:23:59
What you need the cash for? Try to pay everything with Bitcoin and save yourself those taxes.
