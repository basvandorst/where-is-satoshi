Sorry, but I don't know what you are talking about. Of course every member of the SD team is allowed to post a comment when I put the announcement up. Those are no fake accounts, but none of us ever had to do with Reddit before, so I spread the word. Oh, and the StillDragon Community Forum is indeed a world-wide community forum not identical with our company, we are just participating there.

That's right, though our equipment is not limited to distilling alcohol, there are endless possibilities.
