Yep, this is your fault, take your lawsuit-crying ass elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:55:08
I'd have to agree.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:59:04
And Paypal too, fuck them.
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:46:17
My response: cool no problem, I've no issue with you losing 5% off the top of my payment. *swipe*
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:03:12
Huh he must have edited it, that was not there originally. Or I'm blind.

Currently a 3TB drive can be had at Microcenter for $85. 54GB is less than 2% of that drives capacity. You're using roughly $1.53 worth of space. How exactly is this a problem?

Edits within 15 or so minutes do not show asterisks.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:01:27
Nowhere in his post is that mentioned or even hinted at. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:49:57
The fundamental security of Bitcoin is a problem? Well fuck.
@_date: 2015-08-31 16:19:45
Sure would be nice if I could use the exchange here in Ohio though...
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:31:42
Yeah around March this year. Bought into ETH at around $19!
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:43:28
I didn't. Got an unexpected check for about $1,500 and wanted to invest it. Opened Coinbase and saw the addition of ETH and had no idea what it was but it was cheap! Figured if CB was supporting it the currency had to be good! Bought and just watched it rocket.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:26:13
Same boat! I lost 23 BTC!
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:20:36
Sadly this is not the case: 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:02:36
Please post here when you do! The only thing that stopped me from ordering right now was the lack of risers. This is an awesome and much needed product.
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:33:54
Yeah I'm just screwing around having fun with it, but I was pretty shocked to see those results. I didn't think such a well established site would do something shady like that, glad to know they aren't.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:32:10
No I'm afraid I don't see what you're referring to..
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:29:47
Holy. Crap. We're beating *Paypal*? That's just unreal!
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:15:07
Valid point. However, Gox has such serious issues with withdrawals and always-higher-than-any-other-exchange that this site trumpeted their "Ignore Gox" button.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:59:10
What happened to the ignore MtGox button??? :(
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:48:17
Great explanation, thanks for that! Quite satisfied with it being gone now.
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:37:42
I actually have zero interest in football, American here :D
Now betting on American Football, that's fun!
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:17:57
Yeah seems they're all fucked up about my account
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:41:04
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:49:59
Wow thanks a ton, this is great info! I shall use this method
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:51:41
Any chance you guys could also start selling powered PCIe x1 -&gt; x16 risers??? That would be a must have addon.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:50:50
I started jumping up and down squealing, while my girlfriend just rolled her eyes. She thinks I'm insane. Well who's insane now?!
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:30:10
Nope no idea.. had no idea they had a queue posted somewhere..
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:41:24


Thank you :/
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:49:48
Instructions not clear. Talk about crypto all the time to my gf. Dick stuck in computer.
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:29:22
Thank you for that information, I know nothing about football. Not accusing them, just wanted some clarification. Thank you for clearing this up for me.
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:04:57
Wow good info, nice to know.
@_date: 2013-10-15 17:54:21
It's reportedly in the works
