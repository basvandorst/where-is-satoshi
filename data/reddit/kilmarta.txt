If you had funds offered that were not lent out. have those offers been canceled? Can we cancel them when site is back up?

If you sell eth to buy btc that will cause sell pressure for eth and punish eth twice despite no eth been stolen

What about ETH used to fund BTC positions? I realise that the btc/eth market was fairly small compared to eth/usd which was small again compared to btc/usd. So the amount may be negligible and therefore not worth the effort involving another asset class.

Will tgat eliminate the loss of value? No it will create separate value
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:11:40
As far as you know are you still leaning that way?

To continue your analogy, pooling losses would be like.  10 out of 100 cars in the garage gets stolen, so the hotel sell the remaining cars and give everyone a 10% haircut.

It an eth conspiracy, btc holders will get eth as composition.

Where will you get 64% of the total btc? Sell eth? 
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:25:08
Is there a timeline to release the breakdown of the assets involved in the haircut?  And will there be a fund set up that backs the BFX tokens?

I dont really see the settlement of positions only affects some users and I would guess is small compared to the hack.
Without more info about the shareholder options I don't think it is fair to use that as an example of bitfinex contributing.
While I do accept that a major shake up of the ownership of a large company will take a lot of time, you can't take credit for what you think you will be able to do.
Do you expect the site to still offer p2p lending on the site?  I will likely be withdrawing everything asap but if the site is still up in a month and the info that comes out is transparent (doesn't need to be good news just honest news) I will likely continue to use margin funding in the future

@_date: 2016-08-08 12:05:56

Both forks are the original, that's how forks work, an unbroken ledger to genesis

Wtf that is a copy and paste of my post. Posted on steemit and on bitcoin marketplace.
Am I flattered or offended? I'm not sure.
Proof

Cool, as an apple investor that gets equal share of the new company I am fine with this
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:22:49
Price would fall short term but many believe would greatly increase long term. And the opposite with no fork

I'm bitcoin might secede as a payment method for stuff, but it's biggest current use is money transfer across borders, a multi trillion dollar business

as the 0.02% could come from any number between 0.015% and 0.025% could the total bitcoins not be anywhere between ~38 btc and ~63.3btc
