how is bitcoin in canada?
is it easy to buy/sell BTC for fiat in exchanges?
is it easy to find venues that accept it? are there ATM/BTM?

hummm that's a problem then. :(
I'll study in canada for 2 years, so no exchanges for me?

My country's exchange is just 0.25% for transaction and FIAT deposits are free. Destination country transaction fee is 0.5% and money withdraw is free. Full of win! 
Full transfer for 0.75% and the exchange rate is better than if I used banks or wire transfer.

Yes, that's usually not a problem for me because the exchange rate in bitcoin usually is lower than the banks' FIAT exchange rate. Also I move small amounts of money per transaction, usually the top of the offers book is much higher than my transactions.

OK I got what you mean. No, spread and slippage are not included in the 0.75% but but still, the bitcoin exchanges have considerably high liquidity and I always wait for a good moment to exchange FIAT for BTC, ie, both bid and offer books tops are close to each other and as I said the offers volume usually are higher than my transactions. I don't have to buy out several offers. 
I'm comparing to banks because that's the only option I have to transfer money from my country other than bitcoin, paypal, wire or other electronic means.
