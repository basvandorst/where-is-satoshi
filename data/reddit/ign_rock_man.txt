I don't gamble. So my anxiety is nil
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:11:14
Why is it sad?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:13:27
How long are you going to tell yourself that before the anxiety gets to you?

How could such a fool proof plan of buying at the dips fail?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:14:58
It's really not..

Stop being ignorant, where is the floor if this isn't the start? You don't know, so stop acting like you do. That's risk.

When it's higher you could make one that says "sell sell sell sell sell" hahahahaha :)

Lmao, listen to yourself. Do you think you sound like a logical "investor"?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:17:35
Buying during the start of a crash is monumentally stupid and risky.

You would have better odds are the casino honestly if you think 50k will be realistic in your life time.

@_date: 2018-06-29 17:37:29
How do you know I'm not a 98 year old man? Stop being so ignorant and short sighted.

What made you think prices were expected to be 10,000?   Do you have any analysis to support this idea?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:38:37
