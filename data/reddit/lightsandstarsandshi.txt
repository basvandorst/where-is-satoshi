It's 12.5% to do 3 rolls of the dice, even or odd.  It's not terrible, there is a reason lots of people gamble


I mean, you can call it safe - but you are trading in the biggest bull market of recent history.  
You also are clearly not a HODLer, so you aren't the kind of people that are going to get absolutely fleeced in this thing.
If you think what you are doing is safe, you are very wrong.  There has been tons of market manipulation in the Crypto sphere and even if it was regulated by the SEC, FX trading is not considered safe by any means.
I believe in blockchain technology, and I'm glad you are making some money off of trading.
That being said, BitCoin is a bubble.  No asset appreciates that much in so little time and no currency does either unless the currency it is pegged against is going through hyperinflation.  I've seen some people argue on this sub that fiat is indeed doing this - but they can't explain why gold isn't skyrocketing as well.
I have an answer - it's the fucking USDT.  Over the course of the past year over a billion dollars worth of tethers have been used to purchase Bitcoin. 
Those tethers are not backed by USD, in fact, they probably aren't backed by anything.

See you aren't actually buying things in BitCoin either.  You are buying things with a VISA card purchased by bitcoin.
The article explains exactly how the IRS taxes it - it doesn't say anything about the rest of the world.

Because if they can encourage new buyers, the price of BTC goes up and their holdings go up in value.
The more people that get into BTC, the higher it will go (in general) 
What is scaring risk averse people like me is the kind of people that are now getting into it.

Well, the odds of winning three times in a row, which would have brought your .5 to 4 is 1/8.  Not that far fetched

Ding Ding Ding
The warning signs are starting to get pretty large
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:21
True! 
That is a 50/50 gamble - it's pretty damn good odds for Vegas :)

It's not me.  I'm just parroting comments I've seen in the daily discussion thread
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:00
You can't.
There needs to be futures - which are coming in a few exchanges over the next few months.
The only way to "short" is to not buy - and that is obviously not the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:52:40
No, the exact opposite.  I keep reading about people with absolutely no experience in markets putting money in and asking really ignorant questions (no offense).
Markets are cutthroat, and this is a completely unregulated market.  There is a reason the SEC was created...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:46:05
Yes, but you are failing to address my point.
You don't "invest" in currency.  You make money through arbitration and speculation.
So is it a currency or a store of value?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:58:14
Dude, Classic Beanie Babies are deflationary.
I mean, they are technically worth SOMETHING, just not even retail of when you bought them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:01:10
He's talking about stocks...
You can't invest in BTC - you can speculate in it right now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:44:11
Stop repeating this - it's just wrong.
You can't do this.  Companies don't even own every share of their stock - that is what stock is...
Even a hostile takeover is not this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:28:01


I mean, what these "to the moon" types seem to be ignoring is exactly this.
Let's say it does go up to 100k a coin.  That's relatively conservative for this sub (which is fucking crazy).  At that price point, the market cap for this thing would be bigger than most GDPs.  
It would cost so much to maintain the network that 90% of all power generated would be used for bitcoin transactions and mining...
It would mean that the US Dollar would have completely collapsed and with it, modern banking.  
How are you going to buy a lambo with your BTC if your neighbor is shooting you over drinking water? 
Like, these "evil bankers running the economy" are can't be all powerful and yet super incompetent.  Why would they LET this happen?  They have no incentive for a bunch of nerds to get stupid rich and for all their wealth to evaporate in the demise of the dollar.
I mean, fuck...
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:54:30
So you pick a very specific example of CCG to use.  There was something very different about it and there is another use for the cards that make them valuable - you play a card game with them.


I mean, yes it actually is.  It has different rules and again, it's a game you can play with the cards.


What are you talking about.  I never implied pirating is OK - and you cannot play with those cards at official tournaments.  I mean you do realize one of the reasons why these are worth so much is due to the fact that people need them to play in tournaments that they can win money in, right? 


It's very special.  There is no other card game with the same rules.  There is no other card game with as large of a tournament scene.  There is no other collectible card game with as long a history.
BitCoin has none of these. 


Just like Beanie Babies amirite?  Or maybe Baseball Cards?  Those were supposed to take off, but really the only ones worth anything are super, super old.


I mean, this literally cannot happen.  If this happens, the entire world economy has crashed, 99% of our power infrastructure would be in mining bitcoins and approving transactions.  The market cap of BTC would be so high that our economy would cease to exist.
I know some BTC evangelists think this is a good thing, but if you honestly think TBTB are going to give up complete control on the money supply you are delusional.

Lmao - he gave his money to someone for a service and they are not providing the service and not returning his money.
They are also not responding to inquiries regarding the issue.
That is literally theft.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:56
No it doesn't.
Just stop.  There are many options for the squired company's shares, none of them are "they drop to zero"
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:20
No, not necessarily.  It depends on how the buyout is structured.  Usually companies negotiate a spot price for the acquisition so that the retail value of the stock doesn't change as the stock transfers are taking place.
Why do you keep commenting about this if you don't know what you are talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:34:04
No they didn't.
How old are you?  Might I remind you, the dot com crash was real.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:22
Yep, you knew the end was neigh when soccer moms started "investing" in beanie babies
Most of the people involved in this have never seen a speculative bubble before.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:16
Sports betting is gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:21
But this doesn't make sense.
What makes it a good investment makes it a bad currency and what makes it a good currency makes it a bad investment.
ForEx trading isn't about buying a currency and just holding it - unless you live somewhere with hyperinflation
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:46:45
I'm saying it's the same as speculative asset trading.
You think people who speculate on Oil actually hold it and pay taxes with it?
If you are actually curious, the IRS has already made it clear regarding BitCoin:

DING DING DING
Imagine I'm 40 year old dad looking to get in on this thing that is all over the news.
I do some research and decide I'll invest some.  Ok, I try to open an account and I need to verify and give them my bank info.  Well that is a little weird, but OK....
All right, I bought my BTC - now where is it?  I don't even get my BTC for 2 weeks.
By this time I'm getting nervous.  I put a couple hundred in a few weeks ago, it's gone up 15% and I want out, that's a damn good return.  
I try to sell my coins, and I'm hit with a huge transaction fee.  I still don't see my transaction go through for another 2 to 3 weeks and I finally get my dollars back - but my gains are pretty much eaten up by the coinbase fees and I'm still supposed to report my gains on my taxes.
I come here to ask if normal.  
Yes, yes, yes, all this is normal - just never sell...
As someone who has been around the block long enough to have been an adult during 2008, 1999, maybe even aware of S&amp;L in the 80s - I know something is just off.
That experience is exaggerated and doesn't describe me personally, but it's too realistic.

Not legally
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:25
OP was specifically saying "gambling," you decided to interject "Casino" which doesn't make any sense either.
Properly played Baccarat or counting cards in 21 will lead to higher than 50% returns.
I'm assuming you mean slot machines.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:19
lmao, do you know anything about markets?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:05:59
As someone who played MTG for about 10 years - I do think it's objectively better than any other CCG
Much deeper and the meta is so fluid.  WOTC have done an amazing job with it.
Let me put it this way - how much are your Highlander CCG's worth? 
edit: and I don't think people are rational
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:15
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:21:03
It's based on the belief that Bitcoin is a bubble - which in terms of mathematics/past asset history it looks to be.
Typical stock "corrections" are much less movement than we see on a hourly basis in the recent bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:41:20
That is not at all how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:23:56


I mean - it actually does.  
Or something like this:
The fact of the matter is that BitCoin is not trading on any sort of fundamentals.  If it was a store of value, other stores of value would be rising as well.  If it was a new adopted currency, we wouldn't see volatility and Steam and other vendors starting to drop it.
It is going up at this point, because more and more people are throwing money at it hoping to get rich.  
I think blockchain technology is important, but that is present in basically all cryptos - so what makes BTC so special?
The answer I keep coming back to is - Nothing.  Nothing makes it special, so why has it gone up so much?  It's current market cap is around the size of Walmart, how much higher can it go before Market Makers decide to cull it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:46
The market cap of BTC is now larger than JP Morgan Chase.  
The current cap is: 275,625,982,400 
Walmart is 286 billion.
Let that sink in, it's currently worth almost as much as Walmart.
It's ripe right now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:14:23
Lol no.
If you live abroad and make money in a local currency, you are still required to pay your taxes in dollars.
It's one of the things people here tend to forget in all the fiat propaganda.  Not only is the dollar backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government, but it is also the only currency you can pay IRS tax obligations in.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:38:56
It doesn't matter what it is...
You could be selling and buying magic internet money (which this literally is) and you would still be taxed on it.  
If you are buying and selling goods and earning income, you must declare it.
It's highly irresponsible to tell people not to pay taxes on earned income - regardless the source.
