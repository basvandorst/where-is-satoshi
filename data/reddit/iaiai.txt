Thank you dbvbtm.
Did he say that via a public post, if so where? 
Any idea why he stopped updating the website?

Certainly possible. 
Just completely unpredictable, no big deal. ;-)

Thank you BashCo!
How did you do that? (Or where did you find that?)
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:49:25
Note: the timescale at the bottom-right is missing.
Also would be great to add more horizontal price lines. (Log scale is not obvious to many people.)

Anyone know how BashCo did this or where he found it?
And thanks to tekto:

My interpretation:
No. 
I would say that when the price leaves the rainbow it's just darker shades of red (keep selling) or darker shades of blue (keep buying). 
Of course the price is completely unpredictable, no big deal. ;-)

You wrote, "should not have bought any bitcoin (blue zone)."
My interpretation of this chart: 
1. Keep buying anytime the price is below the yellow average zone. 
2. Keep selling when the price is dark orange, red, or above red.

I think that CoinDesk is quite good though.

Ok so only a sufficient consensus of the nodes has the power to update the network rule. 
Correct? 
If so, what percentage of nodes constitute a sufficient consensus? 
Now it seems to me that running a node is somewhat of an altruistic thing to do. Running a node takes some (not a whole lot)  time/energy/computer resources and people do it to contribute to the overall health of the network. 
Correct? 
What if some miners got together and offered to pay the nodes some percentage (maybe 15% if that sounds fair) of the extra fees they earn after the nodes update the max block size (say 2MB).
Now a lot of nodes would be happy because the network is more healthy. 
Then miners and users would be happy as well?

Thank you pb1x. 
Why would a miner/node enforce the 1MB network rule when it goes against their own financial interest? (Their financial interest in mining blocks large enough to include all fee-paying transactions.)

Thank you Erumara. 
Are some blocks above 1MB making it onto the blockchain? 
Why would a node/miner enforce that rule when it goes against their own financial interest?

Ok I'm just talking about financial interest: Money on the table available to miners right now. 
Is there a simpler way for miners to update the network rule with just the most basic change to allow larger (say 1.5MB) blocks? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:30:23
Thank you again pb1x. 
Okay I now understand that part. 
So it's currently in the financial interest of miners to update the network rule and allow larger (say 2MB) blocks, so that they can start including all fee paying transactions into a valid block which gets a 12.5 BTC block reward as well as more fees. 
Correct?
