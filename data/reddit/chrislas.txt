I've never mined under Snow Leopard, but under Lion I've just started.
On my 2011 MacBook Pro with the 6970M in it, I'll get 55MH/sec under Win7 with bootcamp I'll get 71-72MH/Sec. 
I hate having to reboot to mine, ah well.. If anyone has tips to improve hashing under OS X I'd live to hear them. I'm using DiableMiner.App!

This post helped me put together my thoughts on this same topic, and helped me understand the observations I'd been making RE: difficulty going up, but the BTC price not.
@_date: 2011-06-07 23:46:34
I've only been using Diablo Miner on my 27 inch iMac for about two weeks. No issues yet.. I tend to get around 56mhash/sec on it's ATI.

There was a post on Quora as to why bitcoin was a scam and doomed to failure.
If you read the comments, you can find links to the same authors various follow ups, where he nearly changes his tune on every single major point. Really a great (long) read.
I'd like to give a bit of a self plug for my Podcast we just did recently on bitcoin, I'm proud of it at least: 
It's worth a visit for all the epic links in the show notes alone..
I've also kept a pinboard.in tag feed going of the best-of-the best on bitcoin that I come across:
And the last bit of fun, is there are a few good discussion threads in this forum:

Thanks! It makes me excited to see the response, I'm really getting pumped about doing this.
I've been wanting to try out the tip bot, so you win! I think this could be awesome in our show subreddits too, so I want to kick the tires.

Zoe -
I look forward to the episode, I have it downloading right now.
You might want to check out that bitcoin tip system, I think its a great example of how a currency built for the Internet can be used in some very new ways:

How did they get the email addresses? I got one, and the URLs in the email are not legit, don't click them. They go to some hosted app.
Since they have our email addresses, it might be worth changing your Coinbase password right now. Maybe turn on two-factor authentication too.

Thanks for posting our beta episode! 
And thanks everyone!
I'm Chris, one of the co-hosts. My buddy Drew and I are really excited about this show. We launched a little early before everything was ready, but after a day like yesterday we felt like we just had to.
We should have Drew's mic troubles dialed in by next episode, I felt like it was good enough to release our beta episode. But we want to make it even better.
We're hoping to feature interviews, discussion, news and incorperate tons of your suggestions and ideas. So please let us know what you'd like to see from a show like this! :)

How far down this path are you?
Do you have the hosting infrastructure and setup to do this/host this?
I run [jupiterbroadcasting.com]( and have also been thinking about starting a bitcoin podcast.
Maybe we should chat some more!
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:29:38
Ohhh awesome, have you ever made a deb before? Or checked out the OpenSUSE build service? 
I think there are a lot of folks that would love that!

Right on you sound like just the right type, I'll keep an eye out for your submission. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:37:56
I have 28k people ahead of me, and re-submitted today. Make sure you include what they ask, I miss-understood and thought I could submit a utility bill in stead of a state issued ID. I was wrong, they wanted both. 
So I got kicked to the back of the line as I re-submit with my ID.
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:04:58
That is such a great one, you really don't mind if others use it?

Don't forget we talk about Ubuntu, iOS, Google, and BlackBerry more then we should too ;)
Lets talk, fill out the draft form. I'm also kicking around the idea of establishing a short list of folks who would see the topic list each week. Having then toss their hat in the ring ifthey'd like to be in the show that week if they have something to bring to the table on the topics at hand.

Lookin really good man! We gave it a plug in our recent episode of [Plan B](
It's really awesome if that new json feed could be used to build historical charts to track who goes up and down and when/how/often. Could be useful in tackling the ddos problem. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:42:49
What chat program is that?

Hey thanks! We work really hard on it, nice to see it enjoyed.

I really like libsyn for audio podcasts. They charge by storage, instead of transfer. So you don't get dinged if you have a popular episode.
I've used them for six years or so, been great!

I run my business about 40 minutes north of Seattle in Marysville,  we do a weekly Podcast called [Plan B]( on Bitcoin that features interviews, news, tips &amp; howto. 
I'm looking to meet folks in the area who are involved w/bitcoin too! 
@_date: 2013-03-23 03:52:57
Well done sir, by the time I was armed to grab this it was gone!
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:42:42
I was really surprised at how many places I could get a card for. When I first heard the news, I was interested. After playing with it, I think I'll be taking the family out to lunch on bitcoins this weekend!
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:27:38
Ah man still do your show! There is a serious lack of bitcoin podcasts. The advantage to the round table idea, is if your busy that week with your show you can pass. Beisdes its all early days, try it out, and see how it goes!

Very cool, is there a site that generates this? I'd love to run it on my subs.

Hey thanks!

It very much is interesting. Buying Bitcoin is still the great technical wall around bitcoin. Once solutions like yours can handle more demand, things could really kick up.

Thanks man :) 
I'm a *long time* lurker in in but I did not want to spam my own stuff. I'd love to hear what people want from a bitcoin podcast too, it's early days so input is very helpful!
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:49:24
This looks like a great idea. Seems notifying the webmaster they have received a donation is the tricky part?

I know things Amir says can be controversial in these parts, but Libbitcoin looks impressive. I think it could help a ton of developers build apps and services around bitcoin. So we called him up to chat about it.

Ya if we did a show on my network, I'd cover the hosting and distrobution. I already do all that, so all the stuff is in place.
One of my co-hosts runs a fantastic CDN, that combined with Libsyn has Jupiter Broadcasting covered.
