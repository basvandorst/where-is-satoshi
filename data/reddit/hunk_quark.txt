IDK , lightening network ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:21:27
Because Satoshi's white paper clearly called out Bitcoin as peer to peer electronic cash.

With average transaction fees of $5 and rising, chances are by the time you move it to your wallet and try to spend it, transaction fees will eat up your entire balance.

Because segwit coin is not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:42:07
Technical discussion hub already exists. Its r/btc

Incorrect. Here's 2 links with description of lightening network payment channels for bitcoin from mid 2013 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:05:09
Its been 18 months for several years. 
This is core's 'mañana'
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:08:22
Lightening channels work without segwit too. Do more research. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:20:50
The discussion there is about updating an unconfirmed transaction not a lightening network. Funny how hard people are arguing about this. Even if Satoshi ever made a vague reference to a payment channel, he never said that precedes a block size increase. Lightening type payment channels might be an option in 2020. Until then a block size increase is an easy fix to scaling. BTW, satoshi was a clear supporter or larger blocks as you can see here

Said the guy who misspelled learn, lol

i thought we dont talk about altcoins on this sub? Why is this allowed to trend to the top u/theymos ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:22:13
let me help you with your research 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:09:25
Here's the answer to when lightening network's coming from the electrum guy at breaking bitcoin conference last month. Hint: It's nowhere in sight. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:03:20
I thought altcoin discussions were not allowed on this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:56:10
satoshi never talked about lightening network or payment channels. If you're going to make a claim, please provide references. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:22:51
its only a matter of time before people start realizing he's the real satoshi in hiding. Dont believe me?
-He started paypal to fight the banks, but lost that battle. ---He suffered major setbacks to Tesla in 2008 due to the financial meltdown.

Stop believing in fake new. 
Get It? No? 
Then get a brain transplant and think again.

Here's a link to Nathan's EOS commits  
As you can see he's the most prolific EOS code contributor

with prominent mining pools pulling out of segwit2X over the last couple of days, the chances of another chainsplit have reduced. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:53:37
I agree. I sell on amazon too. 
However the fact that they are cutting out third parties, puts more skin in the game for them. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:51:08
Buy smaller items through purse that add up to MacBooks price. Return these items back to amazon to get amazon credit. Use amazon credit to buy your MacBook. Tada.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:28:46
i can tell you with absolute certainty that this may or may not be true. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:00:48
more popularity is when the network's effect come into play. Metcalfe's law!
We are no where near saturation here, 99% of people in the world do not own any BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:50:00
I think it has something to do with the block size restriction
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:16:49
You can get it with 15-20% discount on purse.io
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:23:48
Would you know who benefits from the store of value narrative and how?
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:38:07
So you sold real money to get fake money. Then you gave it to the bank that just got caught creating 3.5 million fake accounts? The happy merchants salutes you!
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:08:52
look at the URL. This joker gets his own 'blog' on nytimes. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:13:08
I agree. However weather you prefer 2nd layer solutions or large blocks, both strategies strive to enable scaling necessary to use bitcoin as digital cash. So to me, this cash vs store of value debate is absurd. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:47:38
you're making no sense
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:38:12
you just got lucky bro, average fees is &gt;$3
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:42:42
just do localbitcoins.com man. Or search in google maps for a bitcoin ATM. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:39:46

you should post this on r/btc forum to get real answers, because on this forum all counter arguments will be deleted. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:35:52
so it's meaningless to talk about the very motive behind invention of bitcoin, on the bitcoin subredditt?
