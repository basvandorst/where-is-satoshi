The fifth "do" is extremely important.

My kid chose, "Which popcorn brand pops fastest".  :|

We did conduct a very thorough analysis of the top five major brands. Orville Reddenbacher Original was the fastest and had more kernels overall.  However, they were much smaller in size and weight.  Pop Secret Movie Theater Butter was slower, but gives you significantly more size and weight than any other.  
TL;DR -  Orville Reddenbacher Original.  But go with Pop Secret for the quality.

It's like an industrial park or business park, but caters to young upstarts or potentially trendy entrepreneurial-type businesses.

How dare you accuse him of lying about his favorite author F. No Banks!

It's all relative and depends on the scale.

Lol.  Oh, but there was sir.  Hell of a game all the way around.  Probably the best I've ever seen.  Maybe we'll meet again for the crystal ball.

I, too, need to know this. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:29:11
I was wondering where you went.  Wish I could've gotten a better picture man.  Good on you for getting out there.  Let's raise some more awareness. To the moon, guys.

That face is GMA weatherman Sam Champion.  It was his last day so they were doing tributes to him.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:57:44
Yeah.  I kept trying to get a better pic of it.  I missed the first hour so he may have had a better one. Also,  Today Show?? No no no no no. GMA all the way.

I was at the Auburn game Saturday where this trend exploded.  When I saw it in person, I immediately knew I missed a huge opportunity.  Was getting ready this morning and saw Santa. I have a feeling we will be seeing these for a while. Hopefully this trend brings awareness to our beloved BTC. What do you guys think? 
Edit: My sign at gameday was the reddit alien.  Wish I had thought of the Bitcoin idea.

Hate I missed the opportunity to meet bitcoinsignguy. You may have sparked quite a movement. Planning to go to Atlanta on Saturday?

Alabamian. Can confirm. You should have seen the looks at Thanksgiving as I was attempting to explain.

As long as this is the case, I love the idea.

I guess I did it wrong.  My decoder said, "Drink Your Ovaltine".
