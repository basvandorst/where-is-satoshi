Yeah, a great way to get wrecked during altcoin season if you don't set any stop losses. When bitcoin collapsed, almost every altcoin plummeted to close to zero and it was an amazing day to scoop up cheap altcoins. Just a matter of right place right time.

Not really relevant, but yeah. If you didn't pay taxes expect to. I didn't because I didn't want to pay a service the money to go through several different trade logs and give me a profit/loss.

I think you can use nicehash, and have it sent to any wallet. Super easy, basically no work involved.

Oh wow, just remembered about their recent issue! Thanks for the reminder.

To be fair, someone seeing their first investment turn really bad can cause some strong emotions. I'm looking forward to a cheap buy, but we must also help those that feel deep regret. At the end of the day, those that make money on Bitcoin trading are exactly the people that are diminishing the value of those that made a bad buy. It's a sharks investment environment for sure.

Thanks. I'd better educate myself now before I get left too far behind. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:02:50
Could you elaborate on what's happening? I'm totally out of the loop here.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:59:00
Superb explanation. I know nothing about bitcoin beyond basical ideas, but that concept seems simple when you put it like that. Is it possible to never use something like coinbase and keep control of my wallet at all times? Does coinbase use my wallet and out only in btc or can it also exchange into other currency like Euros or USD (similar to what any brick and mortar bank can provide)? Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2016-11-24 06:29:45
Okay... forgive my ignorance, but what's the advantage to a big blockchain versus small? More secure? You can own your own wallet outright? Cons? Transfer speed/storage size?
I guess the software side of bitcoin confuses me?
@_date: 2016-11-24 06:12:33
Man, I'm trying to follow this, but I'm so uneducated on bitcoin I cannot tell if this entire comment chain is real terminology or not.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:34:57
Thank you for the really informative post.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:39:04
What happened to Circle? I signed up a few months ago, but never used it.
Edit: wow, saw in another post that they stopped accepting bitcoin buy and sell starting today. The investment didn't pan out for them.

Someone I know ended up having a few hundred dollars from leftover change after a silk road transaction.

Miners verify transactions, and get rewards for finding a new Bitcoin. It requires multiple computers to mine a bitcoin so everyone gets their proportional piece of the pie. Without the computer mesh network running the transactions (if there were no rewards of Bitcoin), then it wouldn't work.

You don't even need lag with a market order. If your purchase is big enough to eat up a thin wall, and the next sell order is $1000 more cost, it will buy part of that too, to complete the purchase.

Doesn't seem to be lead with someone who can maintain good morals or ethical practices.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:23:11
Yup, made that 3.99% down to 2.49% for me. Also, lots of CCs are now treating it as a cash advance according to Coinbase. This is a mess. Crypto is treated as an investment, as money, etc.

I'm just saying it was a brazen attempt to cripple BTC temporarily and artificially inflate BCASH transaction speed and value. There's also been an attempt to brand BCASH as the real Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Twitter was compromised to support BCASH.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:32:35
I just want them to provide GDAX cost basis tool.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:58:46
Oh no, really? I used to get fraud alerts, but they went through. No need to FOMO buy in lately though. Bank deposit is quick enough if you have some spare fiat sitting in GDAX.

A term that encompasses all centralized paper money, like USD, CAD, EURO, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:27:54
It also involved a temporary reduction in difficulty for BCASH mining, spam transactions on BTC to slow transaction speeds, and organized selloff of BTC and buying of BCASH. It was manipulated and was planned in advance. The plan was posted on Reddit.

Can confirm that I went on a ride in a Lambo VT and my uncle's boss gassed it up. It idled a while and took my brother out for 15 minutes, and I think my dad for 10. He had to gas it up again before me, and that was just ripping through the hills in NJ not going over 80 more than likely. Usually 30 to 80.

He does tend to be charming, concise, and humble too. He definitely reminds me of some classmates in engineering class. Someone that has figured out how to present themselves.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:56:00
Yeah, I didn't know that Lambo was going under... Scoop them up cheap! ;)

I'd hope at least Coinbase invests in software that crunches it for you. They are going to have a lot of inquiries for the coming months.
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:58:19
Damn, you know I actually considered it today. The restaurant offered 15% off with BTC, and inside had an Ethereum sticker. I forgot, otherwise I meant to ask how they actually accept payment in those methods.
@_date: 2017-05-03 07:39:45
I wonder if you'd be better off setting that money aside and spending it as value warrants it?
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:08:51
True, so true.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:48:12
I like cash. It's tangible.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:13:07
Come on... Ex cons?  That's pretty prejudicial.  Many of them work circles around other people.
Edit: I've worked in food service in many tiers of dining.  I have even cooked for Vince Carter of the NBA.  The man loves his Shrimp Scampi and Linguine.  Subway should err on the side of caution and shoot for 12.5"+ subs.  Stretch it a bit longer.  The company is known for having thin subs though so I could see how this could complicate things.
