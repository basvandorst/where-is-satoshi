The family probably knew nothing about any of this except that he is a nice guy.  
I can confirm.  He is a remarkably nice and intelligent guy -- enough to stand out in a group of other nice and intelligent people.  I didn't know anything about Silk Road -- I just knew he was a good guy.

There was a time when all Ecstacy was MDMA, but in the late 90s there was so much adulterated and ersatz crap being passed around that people started calling "real" ecstacy Molly.  It was a calculated decision made by a lot of people out of necessity.
That's never been a need with marijuana.  It's impossible to fake.  It's not just a pill that can be any color and any size, it's a very complex plant product.

It's really interesting the space between your "We know" and my "I know."  I'm sure you have read many things on the internet and I'm sure your mind is made up.
Whereas I know Ross.
Not well, not really.  He's just a guy I know.  But he's a real person, he's really my friend, and he's really in a lot of trouble. It's nearly impossible to reconcile the things that people like you are saying with the real person.  I'm cautiously not going to try.  
The things that people like you accuse Russ of doing that are incompatible with the person I know, those things I do not believe that he did.
I don't think he was the only DPR by any stretch.

I am looking at the evidence, and I don't think he was the only DPR, and I don't think he tried to have anybody killed.

Yep, here it is:
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:58:43
Ross didn't try to kill anybody.  This is not a surprise to anyone who knows him.
The charges were dropped.  The person they said he tried to kill apparently never existed. He says he didn't do it, his family says he would never do it, I've been saying all along that he's one of the least-likely-to-murder-people people that I've ever met.
I know Ross.  When he gets out I'll be happy to welcome him home. You're not going to convince me that he's a murderer, so give up.

Ross is one of the nicest, most engaging people I've ever met in my life. I had no idea he was DPR -- he was just a guy who played soccer with us and came to some parties.  It's insane that he's locked up and I sincerely hope he can come home soon.  Please donate if you can.

"We know?"
It's really obvious, to people who know him, that people on the internet *don't* know.  The same geniuses who identified half the city of Boston as the mad bombers used their crowdsourcing crime powers on Ross, and it seems to be the same GIGO.
I sincerely do not want Ross in jail for decades.  Maybe you do.
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:19:21
Here's why I think the charges were dropped (and apparently they're still pending in Maryland) -- because he didn't do it.
I think the indictment is full of shit, full of shit that they threw at the wall to see what stuck, full of shit they threw to get themselves a bigger story that would get further into the news.  That's my "theory."  If there's anything to contradict my theory, I'd like to see it proven in a court of law.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:49:12
Remember from the family's point of view they've been saying "he couldn't have done that" for a while now, and they've been vindicated. The murder-for-hire charges have been dropped, haven't they?
The family and the people that know Ross are not necessarily bitcoin fans or programmers. He's just a person, who we value and miss.

This is fascinating.  I expect prices to drop all day as people over-react to the news, then slowly recover as people realize that the Chinese have no choice but to invest in Bitcoins.  They do not have any other investment options that I am aware of, and with the one-child-only policy meaning that there are eight grandparents to every child that means they have an aging middle class in desperate need of investments.
This is going to be a problem for the Chinese government eventually, and I expect them to shut down Bitcoin at some point, or at least try.  When that happens it will depress the value somewhat, but it will be resilient because it doesn't affect us.  Sad to say, when it happens, the Chinese money will be trapped in the system.  Their loss will be our gain.  
Or, to be precise their loss will be everybody's loss but much, much more their loss.
This can't help but be chilling to the Chinese people who were reminded this morning that their investment can be taken away with a simple government fiat, but they have no choice. Their only other investment options are bank accounts that earn less than inflation and real estate developments in Mongolia.  Bitcoin is a gamble, but China is known as a gambling culture.  They will continue to invest heavily in bitcoin right up until somebody in the government realizes how much money is sneaking out of the country, and then there is going to be a serious problem in China.

Thoughts on FREEDOM
by Ross Ulbricht
July 5, 2010 at 10:32pm
In light Independence Day, I have been inspired to write down my thoughts on freedom, about a page in length. I hope they will stimulate YOUR thoughts, which I would most enjoy hearing.
What does it mean to be free? This word has been used to describe many things, including feelings, states of being, political and social arrangements, mental states, and physical states. Like something beyond the power of words to describe, freedom exists, but only as it occurs to someone experiencing it. Is it possible for someone locked in a cage to be freer than someone who isn’t? What if they are free from limiting beliefs and can imagine experiences without limits, while the other limits themselves to a prison of dull routines? Can freedom stand up to inter-personal comparisons, or is it a wholly personal experience?
Because of its vague nature, it is useful to make further distinctions. One way to identify freedom is by what one is free from. For example, social freedom could describe freedom from limitations imposed by others. Physical freedom could be freedom from physical restraint either imposed by others or by nature. Personal freedom could describe freedom from beliefs one may have about one’s self, others, and nature that limit what one believes is possible. Always, freedom arises in the absence of limitation. When someone is not limited by others, their physical environment, lack of knowledge or skill, or their own beliefs about what is possible; it is natural for them to expand how they express themselves in the world until the next barrier to their self-expression is reached.
One’s limitations can be difficult to identify because they are not always in plain view, especially the self-imposed ones but also the ones imposed by others and nature. For example, death and taxes are widely agreed upon to be inevitable, but are they? While one may have a choice in how they respond to external limitations, this does not negate their existence. Death and taxes are still real and observable, but inevitable? This is an interpretation. It is an extrapolation from the past in an attempt to predict the future, is not the truth and therefore limits what is possible.
That being said, it is my observation that far too much attention is directed, by people in general, toward limitations that arise out of a lack of skill or knowledge that could be better directed toward eliminating self-imposed limitations and one’s beliefs about seemingly inevitable external limitations. This is understandable because, for limitations in skill or knowledge, the problem, solution, and benefit are easy to see and predict. For example, I know I will have more freedom if I know how to play the piano and that all I need to do is learn to play and practice. However, the solution to and benefit of ridding one’s self of a belief such as “I’m shy” or “telepathy is impossible” are not so apparent. Imagine how rich and fulfilling your life could be, well beyond learning a new skill, if you could let go of the beliefs you have that limit you and live your life to its fullest potential. Imagine what could be accomplished and experienced.
Are you free? Yes and no. Freedom is a relative and unquantifiable thing. The question is, “How can I be freer?” and the answer to that depends on YOU. For me, I could be freer by letting go of beliefs like “life is hard,” “if you want something done right you should do it yourself,” “why try, I’ll probably fail” and so on. I could also be freer by creating and acquiring more resources that allow me to express myself in bigger and broader ways, both physical in form and in the form of relationships.
Let Independence Day be a reminder to us that we live in a most unique time, and are freer, as a generation, than any that has come before us. Let us be thankful for our freedom, and build a world where we, and the generations that follow us, will be freer than any that have come before!

I was still under the impression that we were in the early days of Bitcoin, when faucets actually worked.  My bad.  I've been aware of Bitcoins for years but just got around to getting involved in the last few months.
FWIW, the faucet I linked to above does not ask any info besides a captcha.  But it does not pay out, so I certainly will not visit it again.
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:17:15
thanks so much!
Okay, here's what I do.  I went to btc-e, went to finances, went to funds, hit "deposit" in front of BTC, and then copied this from the bottom:
That's the deposit address (and I understand Bitcoins, it can only be used to deposit, right?  I'm nearly 100% positive I'm not doing something insanely dumb by posting that, but please let me know if I am).
Then I went to the Bitcoin faucet I named above, put that address in, filled out the captcha, hit send.  Nothin'.
So maybe that faucet's not working?
Man, now I feel dumb.

He's not a figurehead, though.  I drew him twice because somebody asked me to.  It could be anybody.   The point is that you can draw your own money and put your own heroes on it, not that this bill that I drew somehow detracts from the...intellectual purity of Bitcoin or something?
I want to say that I don't know why you are all worked up about Stallman, but I do know why.  To me, he's just a guy.  He has some smart ideas, some dumb ideas.  He has nice eyes and a weird habit of parting his hair asymmetrically.  Looking at his face I'd say he's a kind man with some bad habits.
To the community of Bitcoin, this is somehow a referendum on his economic ideas -- when he doesn't even claim to have a clue what Bitcoin is about.  He seems to think it's about evading taxes?  But he also seems to not care, not want to know, and not even use a web browser?
But it's just a picture of a guy.
As an artist my job is to find the moments of maximum emotional potential and exploit them visually for money, and believe me if I had known this thread would have this effect I would have done it on purpose.  But it's sort of out of left field.  What I want is commissions.  What I got is a fight over a celebrity.
Sticking to logos defeats the purpose because this is hand-drawn currency.  There is by definition only one copy of these at a time, unless I draw another, and then there are two.  Every single bill should have somebody new and interesting on it.  No two bills should be the same.

Spider Man has the single greatest costume in the history of comics.  He's the only truly iconic hero invented after WWII, and his costume is brilliant from the artistic, production, and even economic points of view.  It's the highest expression of the House of Ideas and contains a wealth of information, from the anatomical to the sexual to Ditko's speculations about chakras and his interest in bondage.
Here's just one unintended economic side-benefit of Spider-Man's costume.  You know those little web-lines all over him?  Before computers, those were all drawn by the background inker.  Most people have never heard of background inkers, because they aren't credited, but all production comics had a few.  It was the lowest of low positions, the very first rung on the ladder, but more famous artists than you can imagine began as background inkers.  They were mostly necessary for buildings and star fields, the two biggest hassles before computers, but they were also used on Spider-Man's weblines.  It is no exaggeration to say that Ditko's decision to include those lines lead directly to the employment of two generations of struggling artists.

@_date: 2013-10-02 20:33:38
I'd be happy to, but it would be very short.  I'll do it right now.
He's a nice guy.  He is polite and well put together.  He is very good at soccer. I had the impression that he came from money, that he had money, and that he worked in tech, but he was not real specific about what he did.  I have a lot of friends who work in tech and they never describe what they do, so I thought nothing of it.
We used to have really epic parties over at my place on Exposition.  He came to a couple, as I recall he brought a date.
He wrote me a couple years ago about starting up a book drive for charities, other than occasional Facebook likes and comments since I haven't really seen him much. It seems that when we were hanging out, in 2010, Silk Road had not began yet.
I honestly like the guy a lot.  He was one of many people that we don't have a good word for yet; not a real friend, but someone that I thought I'd be good friends with if we ever happened to spend some time together.  He was a facebook friend that I had bookmarked for real friendship at some point in the future.
That's pretty much all I know about him.  I'm terribly sorry for his troubles and I wish him all the best.

Seriously, this is not an endorsement of Stallman for President of Bitcoin.  It's just a cartoon of him on a piece of paper.
That said, I'm not actually horrified by any of the things you accuse him of saying.  I've been called an "open Statist" before and the insult does not really sting.  When I'm called a statist it's usually by a haughty Libertarian, and I don't take them too seriously.

if someone writes the private key and the public key on it (and then deletes the money so it doesn't get respent) then they can transfer it to someone else who can write it into a computer.

I'm interested in Bitcoin as an emergent technology, and I can't decide whether or not these fraudulent fools are good for the "movement" or not.  
After all, "there's no such thing as bad publicity" -- these people are bringing attention to bitcoins, and they *are* providing objects that can be purchased for bitcoins.  Sort of.

I'm glad you have so much invested in Bitcoin that it bothers you that I'm drawing these things, but you aren't following your own assumptions.
The point of Bitcoin is that these little paper bagatelles are meaningless.  The value does not lie in the bill, which is only an art object.  Even if I drew these, they could never be mass-produced.  Even if they were mass-produced, they could never be official.  Bitcoins are a digital entity and this is every bit the affectation that listening to vinyl is.
But you obviously don't really believe this.  Not deep down.  You are still confusing Bitcoins so much with actual paper governmental fiat currency that you think what I'm doing in some way affects the whole project.
What I'm doing only proves that there are possibilities to Bitcoin that were never dreamed of before.  What you're doing is continuing to not dream, trying to shut me down, trying to shut other people down, and, to be blunt, sort of being a jerk about it.
Don't fucking tell me to learn to read, buddy.

I think of bitcoins as, essentially, shares in the bitcoin enterprise. It's not a currency, though we wish it were.  It's a little bit like a Kruegerrand, or an infinitely divisible work of art.
Bitcoin is no more a ponzi scheme than buying stock in Google is a ponzi scheme.  But that doesn't make it a currency either.  It's more or less a stock that is easy to sell and does not require a stock market.

Yeah, I think there's been tremendous penetration into the general populace into 2013.  This is the year it really broke through.
We get obsessed with the dollar value of bitcoin and we lose track of the fact that it is a very viable, very useful invention.

Its theoretical value as a currency is the same as Namecoin's theoretical value as a DNS system.  But they're commodities right now.
There's nothing wrong with that.  You can't take silver bullion into 7-11 and get a slushie, but it still has value.
The cryptocoin network is providing an outlet for the aging Chinese middle class to invest in the world, which is the economic equivalent of the Three Gorges Dam collapsing.  Cryptocoins are plenty useful and important without being fully functioning currencies.

are you saying that me drawing a picture of Richard Stallman is somehow dangerous to the Bitcoin project?
@_date: 2013-08-01 04:55:08
I'm actually working on much the same project, but it's well beyond my programming capabilities.  Basically I want to create a cryptocurrency that is backed by art.  You peg the value of your currency to a ringtone or a desktop wallpaper or a panel of a comic, something like that.

"I had tinkered with the idea of sending one of these bills to RMS himself with 1 BTC attached to it"
I actually had that thought myself.  I've gotten much more than .2 BTC of enjoyment out of this project and thread and would like to share with the man who inspired the ruckus.
I also have to say that I did not take your commission of a picture of Stallman as an endorsement of all his ideas, any more than Jackson's picture on the $20 is an endorsement of his policies.  Currency is a place for heroes and thought leaders, and those folk are rarely right about everything.
Frex, I'd cheerfully draw Charles Lindbergh on a bitcoin bill, but that doesn't mean I support some of his dumber politics.

Yep!  Did all sort of research.
I bought one too.  We'll see.  Part of my research is knowing the internet and being sorta okay at doping out real things from the haters.
I didn't spend more than I can afford to lose, so I'm not too worried.  Took a chance.  All of Bitcoin is a chance.  
Not terribly sorry.

To get this result you have to assume that the people are in charge of the State and not the currency.
The truth is that the state is in charge of the currency and the people are not in charge of the state.

It's certainly the farthest thing from my goal.  I'm into Bitcoin as an artistic and elegant economic solution.  I'm neither for nor against taxes in this circumstance.
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:37:07
How would that matter?  The fact that so many people have to go to coinbase to trade their bitcoins for local currency is a sign that it is not a currency.
I make comic books for a living.  I own my own printer. Any time I want to I can go downstairs and print out a book that I drew that I will be able to sell for $5.
So it's like printing money.
But it is not actually printing money.
My comic books are very much like currency.  They will become currency some day.  But they are not currency.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:04:08
The Chinese news is definitely bad, if you want BTC to be artificially inflated right now.
And it is definitely bad, if you are Chinese.  Not that the particular laws will particularly affect you, but the knowledge that your life savings can be wiped out with a memo from the government is going to make you very worried.
If you're not either of these things it's no big deal.  Our value takes a temporary dip, but will recover, because the Chinese have nowhere else to invest but BTC.  Until their government realizes this and takes it away from them.
But we'll get to keep their money when they go.
So life is unfair, but we're on the unfair side that's winning this one.

It's more about bitcoins being awesome than the particular icons drawn on this particular bill.  
Personally, if it was up to me, it would be Spider-Man, John Constantine, and me.  I think I'll draw one for 1.618 Namecoins and put myself on it.
But this was a commission, so I drew who they wanted.
The point is that you can do this.  You can draw your own money now, and it's great fun.  You don't like it, draw a different guy.  All this conversation in this thread is about Stallman, whether he'd like the bill or not, whether he likes Bitcoin or not, whether he has gross habits or not.  Who cares?  My interest in Stallman extends to reading XKCD strips.  I'm drawing money because it's fun to draw money.  
This thread has turned into a referendum on the economic ideas of a guy who doesn't even claim to be an economist.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:15:16
I'll believe it when I see it.  Right now Bitcoin's basically just a new way of trading stocks.  I'm not buying the global panegyrics until they start to happen.
