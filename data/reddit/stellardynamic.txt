Regardless some of the pools have too much power. Something must be done.

That's entirely inaccurate. Vertcoin is still no where near profitable for cpu mining. The coin will be highly distributed by the time cpu mining/botnets have their chance to make headway against vertcoin's newest wave of defenses.

The uses you described sound a whole lot like Reddcoin. Most of this stuff is already being implemented in it.

More merchants accepting Bitcoin means more pressure on payment processors like Visa and Paypal to reduce their fees and improve transparency. Bitcoin may not be the complete solution as it stands but it certainly makes other payment processors look quite primitive. Here's one more factor: Chargebacks. I bet if you add in all lost money from credit card and paypal chargebacks from small businesses Bitcoin sales look alot healthier.

Reddcoin's upcoming platform will do just this. Combine name registration at the blockchain level with browser extension wallet and you have the perfect decentralized tip platform.

I wouldn't tip my Bitcoin especially with fees. Reddcoin and Doge fill this niche a whole lot better.
PS If bans other tipbots thats pretty shady.

Reddcoin is the real deal I'm convinced. Congrats to those guys!

Bitquick.Co or Coinbase are reputable options.

Reddcoin is developing a similar idea completely decentralized.
Read about the development of Redd-ID and social X. Much more pure than this netki project.
