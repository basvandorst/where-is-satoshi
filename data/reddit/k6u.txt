You're in don't expect to get upvotes for promoting dogecoins.

Once again, that's not my question. All I am wondering is if these settings are safe for my computer. I've made .05 BTC in the past few days with these settings, and I only plan to stop once the profit amounts to very little or none. I realize it is going to become hard to produce many Bitcoins once the ASIC miners come out.

Its possible that you downloaded a malicious remote administration tool, which is like a keylogger but with the addition of being able to do literally anything to your computer if its on. With remote administration tools, you can open any application or file in the background of your computer without your knowledge, which can easily send bitcoin transactions if its on your computer.

We have solar panels, we sell our extra energy we produce back to the power company. Even if I did pay for electricity, I would still be making a bit more than I would be paying for electricity. Currently the rate here where I live would be about $.11/kwh. And with the amount of energy this rig is taking up, it would amount to about 1/4 of the price of what i'm making. But, since we dont pay for our electricity, this is irrelevant.
Edit: Anyway, as I said, I realize this method of making money will not last long, and I know doing this with a GPU will be pointless in the future when ASIC's take over.

We produce our own electricity, that is not a factor in my situation. That doesn't really answer my question...
