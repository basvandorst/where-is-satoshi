I love when lawyers make legitimate cases... It sucks that the judge is going to tell Dratel he doesn't care about his motion to dismiss because it's as witch hunt.. Maybe not in those words though...

Do you really think it takes them 5 minutes from receiving the money order to driving it down to the bank? In business it's called turn around time. I don't know one business that would priority rush a small money order to the bank before closing. You paid for priority shipping, not priority handling. My guess is your money order got put with a stack of checks and taken to the bank the next day to cash. Chill the f out and stop acting like a 12 year old

Lol bro chill the f out. First of all you didn't use BTC, and instead sent money order.... They need time to take it to the bank and cash it. Did you discuss the timeline before sending a snail mail money order? Me thinks you are troll or incompetent
