That's so irrelevant if you'd have some basic understanding of economics you'd never even care about that... Just the fact that this get's so many upvotes makes me a bit eery about the Bitcoin community and what kind of grounds they stand on.

"thats not the how it works... **the number of buyers increase exponentially the lower the price gets**... so around 40 USD per BTC you have a lot more buyers than at 19k. "
Well, I agree on that, in *some* **normal** market.
It seems like the number of buyers haven't increased exponentially when Bitcoin dropped from 19 000 USD to 9 000 USD.
But no, I don't believe that Bitcoin will drop to 40 USD once those 166 000 BTC is releaseed on the market.
But it's hard to deny that it could cause at least a 50 - 90 % drop.

I like crypto but I hate the bubbles and hype. They inflate the prices to ridiculous levels where you can't hold it because you know there's *very* high chance it'll lose 50 - 80 % and stay like that for years.
Just look at the 2014 bubble. Then I'll have to wait for another hype to not lose money, what if I need the funds before next hype?
Gay shillers...

They sold off about 16 000 BTC out of 16 000 000...
a sell off of 0.1 % caused a 70 % drop... That's a joke guys.

I am gay, hence I can call you a gay shiller if I want.

Lol, a few delusional ones hanging on to their cryptos at these insane prices with almost zero adoption even though their precious little currency have existed for almost 10 years.
Soon the final panic will set in.
I'm a blockchain bull, but the current solutions suck big time and it's 99 % vapor, back to reality guys.

Well... They sold of 34 000 coins, what will happen to the price when they release those remaining 166 000?
If those 34 000 caused a 70 % drop we look at a potential drop of **current price * 0,3^4.5** which would give you a price around 40 USD per BTC...
*And yes, this is a very rough calculation with a bunch of assumptions, but still, you get the point!*

I see a lot of bitcoiners getting triggered. 
Good luck with your investment mate! :)

I rather just use Nano, Eos or even Ethereum if I need a fast transaction. No need to "try" Lightning, I do not want to spend time upon how to use it. It should just work. 
Bitcoiners are delusional, period.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:37:00
Okay, that's why.
Do you know if there's any statement from HitBTC regarding this?
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:06:42
What makes you think Bitcoin will become the dominant crypto currency?
It's technology is 10 years old and Lightning Network does not work.
It's semi-useless.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:18:35
Lol at triggered bitcoiners. 
Please make coherent arguments if you're going to oppose. :)
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:07:13
You know that Bitcoin is one of the most useless crypto currencies out there, what makes you think it will be the winner in the long run?
