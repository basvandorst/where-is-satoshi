You will have to go through this process with any of the big wallet providers. A small price to pay for knowing that your bitcoins wont be disappearing tomorrow...

Brings a tear to my eye.. i remember when we were celebrating the 1k mark :)

The guy from Xapo made a post yesterday that explains the difference between gold, fiat and gold. May give you some good pointers there:

I am not the creator of the video. He's replied below at @_date: 2014-12-15 23:40:37
Smells like BS to me...

I think the PIN works to get newbies to bitcoin started. I think once you transfer or buy btc it brings up the option to add a password and set up 2fa. 
havent heard of anyone getting bitcoins from xapo stolen despite the 4digit pin

Sorry for the ignorance but can anyone point to where I can found out more about this GAW deal?
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:28:02
uhhh and a satellite in space??? That is fucking cool!

Oh noes the world is ending!

I blame Ripple for this "blockchain without bitcoin" bulls**t
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:33:17
Yes I think so. Although I'd never recommend keeping everything in 1 place. 
Btw, you can see a copy of insurance for Xapo when you send funds to their vault. They have some pretty legit insurance backers that I dont think would rip users off if something does happen.

You should really keep your day job of spamming links about your Shift card...
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:53:42
Oh yea? When was the last time Blockchain.info or breadwallet did any sort of marketing campaign to bring in new users to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-07 23:06:57
Please tell that to Visa and Mastercard.

Care to back your claim? What has he lied about?
@_date: 2015-04-03 02:48:14
So where are these metrics from? How did you obtain them?
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:40:41
How naive are you?!!?? High profile bitcoin integrations and partnerships will bring in more new users than you will ever have a chance to speak to ("convince") of getting into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:51:03
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:29:11
Right! Who cares about making bitcoin mainstream?! That's not important at all!
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:02:06
Got it. That's interesting. So do you lose anything additional for conversion to your home currency? In total you lose 4% or more?
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:04:41
stop feeding the troll bro

usually what percentage of your paycheck does Paypal take? 5%? 10? 15%+?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:21:48
Very interesting! Thanks!

I'm pretty sure you are the one to add your date of birth when ordering the card :S
In the US they use MM/DD/YY instead of DD/MM/YY as with other parts in the world. Maybe that was your problem?
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:51:34
This is great news. People can no longer use "no merchants accept bitcoin" as an excuse to why getting salaries in bitcoin wont work. 
I've been using the card for a few months now and it works great. Not sure why all the hate for Xapo. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:30:11
Winklevoss where are some RESULTS! enough of this fluffy press BS!
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:59:47
Nice! Way easier to onboard new users with an email than to copy-paste a new wallet address from somewhere else!

RBF is something we all need to be aware of. As a community I truly believe we can make the right decision...

yawn... enough planning. would love to see these guys actually pull the trigger and facilitate operations for btc companies. same goes for luxembourg, gibraltar, ireland, etc... etc.. etc...
