Lmao at bitcoin defeating capitalism and the 1% 
If anything it exists to usher in an era of intense personal responsibility, powerful people, and the most pure capitalism to date

I’ve been following this stuff for years and I have a solid background in computer science and the more theoretical side of things - I just don’t understand what litecoin offers

Coinbase has it's frustrations but this re-affirms my belief in their quality as a service.
Won't be switching from them any time soon.

The 401k invests your money into stocks/securities/all that good stuff. 
The more people who want to buy the same stocks/securities/all that good stuff you already own, the more money you make. 
Since you can be sure the market will grow over time, you can safely put your money into your 401k.
Now replace 401k with bitcoin and you may understand why we're excited. Bitcoin of course doesn't have dividends, and is it's own thing. It's price is currently growing for fundamentally the same reasons your 401k does though.
