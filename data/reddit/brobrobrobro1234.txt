Sure, buddy.

Quick and easy question.
Who is Satoshi?

And then you wake up.

Regulation doesn't only apply to banks.

More like bullshit.
The French have tried to herald new technologies in the past only to suffocate them with regulation and bureaucracy.
I look to the US and South East Asia for innovation here.

Opie and Anthony?
Hopefully this turns out better than they did.

Back to brass tax, please.
The reporter is a solid 6.8, while Ms. Bitcoin seems to be a stable 7.8 in the power rankings.

You have folks on this board pushing for regulation of Bitcoin as well. A large enough slice of people to have me concerned. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:57:41
Nice try kid, but you can't be on the cutting edge of monetary innovation and beg for stultifying regulation. 
That's not how this game works.

This is not true, and the fact that you say this reveals your ignorance on the matter.
I've seen a great deal of French talent flight among small ventures headed to the US... and parts of South East Asia..

I thought Bitcoin people were pro-deregulation. Or are they only pro-deregulation when it suits them.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:18:09
Banks are just financial institutions, and those aren't necessarily going away with Bitcoin. They may become less influential however.

I love this sub for these threads alone.
