No it's not?
It's actually really good if you ignore the financial problems and, as a tourist, you are not touched by the capital controls.

There are lots of things you can debate about, but let's start with the first word. Theft act 1968. 
To dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. 
Was this "theft" done dishonestly? No? Then it wasn't theft.

Shhh.. You are not supposed to think.
You are supposed to keep buying bitcoin, so you can increase the price.

Name it "5th amendment" (or any number for that matter).
They won't be able to put news titles against it.

Most legal systems do not care if it's encrypted or locked. If they believe that something incriminating exist (and they should, since they arrested you) you are required to supply the unlock keys. If you don't, you are found guilty of an offence. In UK, for example, said offence is punished by two years in prison. 
People tend to forget that CP is a really old story. People have used every excuse imaginable in order to be found not guilty. The courts have evolved.

Protip: You are more corrupt that 90% percent of the population. You just didn't have the opportunity to take advantage of it.

I believe you are still not gasping the legal problems. A company has your personal information tied to a specific account. If there is a problem with that account, they can disclosure your information to anyone that might request it. They are not in danger because they can prove that they don't own the files and that they only store them on your behalf.
Storj is running on the bitcoin network. There will be nothing to suggest that person "X" owns the illegal file and you go got paid by "X" to hold the file on their behalf, since everything will be either encoded or anonymous. The prosecution will not have the identify of that "X", so you will be held responsible because there is no evidence which suggests that file was owned by another person.
You could argue, in your defence, that a person unknown to you paid and encoded the file, but it is unlikely that the jury will believe you.

Actually it can't help them at the moment. There are alot of "features" that the bank is "selling" that cannot be offered with crypto technology.
Consider what would happen if a client made a mistake on a deposit. These things happen thousands of times daily for big banks. You wouldn't want to tell him "sucks to be you". 
Maybe in ~20 years when the old generation is technologically savvy.

I am afraid it's slightly different. The internet provider can prove that they weren't responsible for the illegal material and can provide the details of the person who was. This advertised method of storage has no proof of payment, no proof of ownership and no names attached to anything. In most countries the very fact that you can't provide the key to unlock the file in question, is an offence by itself. The only thing that is different in the US is the 5th amendment, but it's currently a matter of debate whatever if extended to computer passwords (all signs point to yes)

This is exactly what I am trying to say. People suggest that in a US-like environment the OP would have a gun to protect himself successfully. My counter argument is that the criminal would also have a gun.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:13:47
Yeah, same here. But that is unrelated to the point I am trying to make. 
A bank offers protection for 99% of their services, and more than half of their customers are in actual need of said safety nets. With a bitcoin-equivalent technology this would turn in a nightmare.
Yes, you could argue that banks could hire persons to help customers / issue creditcards that in reality store the wallet keys / find a way to overcome wrong or unlawful money transfers / whatever, but all these cost money. This is counter-productive  to the main idea of using bitcoin-equivalent methods to lower costs.
I do believe that we will be the first human generation that won't be left back by the progress of technology. Which is why I said that in ~20 years, when most of the old population will have moved on, something like what OP's article suggests would be way more feasible.

And a responsible criminal , you know one that was willing to try and steal 7k in plain view, would probably own a gun himself and shot you before asking questions.

Come on, you can't blame communism for that. It was designed under the idea of trading potatoes. Money is way above its capabilities.

Your bias is showing. Like, Trump's fiscal year hasn't even started yet. How can he "reduced billion" when he cants influence budget yet?

9K memes too strong to ignore.

Also "legal" doesn't mean it's 100% safe to use. In Greece, for example, bitcoins are "legal" but they have not agreed on taxation.
If you sell your coins you might end up in prison in 5 year's time.
