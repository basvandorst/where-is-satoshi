Nailed it

It’s not a matter of it not being safe,  but what most people don’t like is the fact that you can’t move any coins off of RH... you’re merely “investing” in BTC and you don’t really own the coins. Pretty sure there are no fees though.

“Yeah I’ve heard of it but never looked into it”
“I don’t really trust that stuff”
I know almost nobody in my personal life that owns any.

I mean probably but honestly I would just try it, at least try one bill. If anything, it’s gonna spit the bill back out, you won’t lose it.

Yeah that’s the most reliable and steady way for sure

What is your preferred way?

I was just referring to when you said an address should only be used once. What if someone sends me BTC multiple times, my address remains the same for every transaction right? I mean, I’m a noob obviously, but my focus will be hodling

That makes a lot of sense. Honestly I was just thinking about it in a narrow minded way. I’ll just keep track of my own gains/losses. Thank you!

I appreciate the honest advice! ty for the info
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:38:58
Very cool, thanks for all those details!
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:41:10
Oh wow - which country?
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:34:28
Hurry for what
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:38:34
ty for the heads up
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:35:19
Yeah actually I might check one out now too. Humor someone who hasn’t bought from an ATM before: this one takes both cash and cards? And how does an ATM dispense BTC in general / how to even get it to your wallet?

What’s the best way to leave Coinbase? If I send all my Bitcoin from Coinbase to a wallet, how do I go about selling my Bitcoin in the future if it’s in my wallet? And how could I prove how much I bought my Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:32:58
Don’t most wallets keep the same address though?

Yeah he’s purposely trying to rile people up online... and is also terrible at it lol
