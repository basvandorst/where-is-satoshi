If credit is expanded and if credit makes contact with human labor, new wealth is created. That is not an inflation of any money supply. That allows you to you know, actually have something to buy with your money? In a deflationary economy the vast majority of resources are idling because creditors are attempting to turn sterile money into actual wealth. The so called 'knowledge and reason economy' we are living in is actually believing in magic.
What you want is your previously accumulated money to continue gaining in value. How exactly is that suppose to work? How do digits that do nothing produce new wealth? They don't. The only answer is someone else must be on the losing end. 
I just explained earlier the short comings of the fiat system are namely that there are no restrictions on *usury*. This creates the scenario that most people are fed up with, namely 90% experiencing a shortage of money while 10% experience an abundance.
Also I have zero resentment as I myself bought btc 'early'. I'm just not blinded by the demented ideology that is being promoted in this space. And no buying early on is not taking 'risk'. 
Early adopters are rationalizing away any of the enormous moral shortcomings of bitcoin by coming up with buzzwords. 'Pump and dump' is now 'speculative component'. No different then when the federal reserve uses 'fedspeak' as cover for it's schemes.

I'm not suggesting demurrage. You absolutely do not need money to 'lose value' over time. Money is a medium of exchange used to facilitate trade, it does not create value on it's own. Any belief otherwise constitutes a defacto promotion of magic. All the wealth in the world has been bought and paid for by human labor not by gold coins or colored pieces of paper. Money is simply used as a means to coordinate activity. 
Bitcoiners believe that money itself creates value.
On you incorrect bond statements.
Bonds increase in value when interest rates decline. Bond pricing 101. This gives the bond holding class massive capital gains and makes it more difficult for previously issued debt to be repaid. Bonds do not pay less than inflation, infact interest rates over the last 40 years have consistently been ABOVE GDP growth. This has concentrated the majority of the wealth into fewer and fewer hands, which led up to the 08-09 crisis and every previous and future crisis. The bond holding class now demands austerity on the entire economy just so their precious contracts are fully repaid. The reason interest rates have to be near zero today(which they aren't for 95% of the population) is because debtors cannot afford anything higher. 
Yes those buying bonds believe that money breeds money. Money should copulate and have children, those children are called interest. No productive power exists that can keep up with the inexorable grind of compound interest. The economy ends up getting killed literally as population falls due to the inaffordability of raising a family by a huge debtor class.
Does bitcoin solve any of that? No. It simply makes 1 group rich at the expense of another while pushing all sorts of absolute delusions as rationalizations. We are at the point where bitcoin thought leaders are rationalizing away how good pump and dumps are.

Bitcoin does better *without* VC's. That is fact. The quicker these companies go bust the faster the shackles can be removed.
Most 'bitcoin' companies have no incentive for people to be even using the blockchain. Why would Coinbase want people outside of it's internal service? 
This subreddit has persistently attacked anyone and everyone who brings up an undisputed truth. The majority of VC funded business's are anti-thetical to bitcoin. We are now reaching a point where blindly pumping any business that says blockchain or bitcoin is not helping to boost value.
The rabble behind the blocksize are bagholders who think changing computer code will somehow multiply the userbase and allow them to get out of their bad trade with a gain. That is always what this has been about. People want changes in code to transmute themselves into new users and a higher price.

Then the opposite happens, those with longer term bonds sit on unrealized capital losses unless they hold out onto maturity(which most will). In effect the bondholders will just reinvest their interest into higher yielding bonds, setting up the foundations for permanent crisis. 
Remember Greenspan raised interest rates 500% while telling everyone to take out teaser-rate mortgages years earlier. That's what blew out the entire housing bubble. Nobody talks about that? They just say interest rates went from 1% to 5%, that's like a 500% increase, but 1 to 5 sounds conveniently lower. Notice when interest rates are talked about nobody ever stats the total percentage increase.
Interest rates cannot rise for that very reason. The majority of the commercial banking system borrows on the short end and lends out at the long end. If interest rates rose the entire banking system would be insolvent overnight.
Interest rates like bonds are a legal fiction. 
The Fed economists refuse to acknowledge practical reason, which is another term for the moral order, as the only sustainable way to manage the economy. Why? Because that would put into question the activities of the Fed's constitutes, the bond holding class.
@_date: 2016-04-05 10:27:33
The fed has been dead wrong with it's inflation projections over the past 4 decades. They have been persistently overstating inflation and keeping interest rates *too high*, that is why we have an economy loaded to the hilt with debtors. I just explained to you, interest rates have exceeded GDP growth for decades. The federal reserve has been loaded with monetarist hacks who believe the supply of money has a direct influence on price levels. That is completely and utterly false as proven by QE. 4 trillion of QE and oil prices are 90% lower than 10 years ago.
The same monetarist/austrian errors are hardcoded into bitcoin.
If you buy the 10 year bond today, odds are the yield will be EVEN lower a few years from now meaning you will capture a HUGE capital gain. The smart money knows this hence why *declining* interest rates have been a boon to the rich as it increases the value of the previously issued bond.
Bonds have been one of the best bets in town. US 10 year bonds have delivered huge returns over the last few years, and even higher if you price in other currencies. Bonds have killed equities over the last 2 decades with almost none of the volatility. 
You are parroting clowns like Peter Schiff while being utterly clueless to how money or the economy works.
@_date: 2016-04-05 09:51:42
Inflation occurs when credit isn't prudently allocated and instead is squandered as no new goods/services are produced to back the issued money.
If credit is prudently allocated than you have no inflation while the money supply increases. You can increase the money supply as much as the productive capacity of the economy allows. Prudence is the only limiting factor in money supply creation, not a random hard limit picked out of a hat.
Bitcoin monetary theory says that those with *previous* wealth should be capturing the new purchasing power created by present and future labor irrespective if the hoarders add value or not.
So you can see how bitcoin is based on defacto theft. Purchasing power is transferred from a group of parties into fewer and fewer hands. Success in bitcoinland is measured on how high the 'price' is. What utility is being provided is irrelevant. Who benefits? The large stakeholders.
Precisely because of this mechanism bitcoin has no mass adoption, because a 'rentier' tax exists. In order for large adoption to occur a premium has to be paid to large stakeholders for no real reason just because they 'took risks early' even though they took the least risk out of everyone.
@_date: 2016-04-05 11:19:37
No I'm not saying that.
When surplus value is produced it tends to benefit a wide range of individuals. The question is, who should be rewarded for *producing* that surplus value?
In bitcoin that answer is clear. Those who previously stashed away sterile computer digits. 
In regards to your technological leap statement. The absolute vast majority of technological leaps have occurred through the financing or *risk taking* of the public purse. The gains from the new value are then siphoned off through various means by the 'private' sector.
Bitcoin is no different in this regard as well. You are using government sponsored encryption, government financed communication technology(internet) etc.
Infact bitcoin benefits from government imposed restrictions on what products can be bought/sold and government imposed restrictions on the financial sector. People are using bitcoin as a conduit to get fiat money because other avenues are blocked off. If they weren't, would bitcoin be used or have any value? Probably not.
That is precisely the irony of the bitcoin ecosystem. It exists and has value 100% due to the ignorant benevolence of government.

I think you are confused. 
The role of money is to act as a medium of exchange. All wealth in the world has come from human labor. When you reverse that, it is a perversion, because you are now attempting to claim that money itself creates wealth. You want your hoarded stash of dollars, gold or bitcoin to SWELL in value. The only way for that to occur is for the price of labor to be pushed down down. Essentially you want the wealth you currently have to magically transmute itself into even more wealth in the future. That is called magic my friend.
The only way for more wealth to exist in the future is if present wealth in the form of credit makes contact with *human labor* to produce new surplus value.
Money is simply used to facilitate that transaction. If money which represents credit, which is another word for stored labor, is poorly allocated than no new wealth arises. The represenation of credit(money) has no value whatsoever in and of itself.  
In the bitcoin world we have an upset down view of that. Where people are suppose to go out and 'innovate around the edges' so existing hodlers can watch their digits swell up in value. How is that working out so far? We have a huge pool of people with massive losses, ideologues who are jailed, while a tiny early adopter crowd is rich. Where is all the disruption?
The bitcoin ecosystem is a microcosm of what occurs when deluded theories are put into practice. A predatory ecosystem full of frustration as a large group of people sit on mounting losses.
@_date: 2016-04-05 13:15:14
Savers should be rewarded when their capital is efficiently allocated and risks are shared. I'm not talking about that. They should not be rewarded if they assume ZERO risk and just want their money to multiply itself via compound interest. That is anti-social as it grinds the person on the wrong end of the equation. People don't even question where the interest they are earning comes from, it doesn't matter if its from an activity considered immoral(war) for example. 
In modern societies the state has been stripped of any ability for practical reason ie morality to exist. In it's place, private interests namely corporations dictate what is good and what isn't. What is good in America? Being a 'impulsive shopper' and acting out on uncontrolled passions. 
The role of the state can be confined to *limiting* the dead weight the rentier class places on the economy. Even Adam Smith understood this. This requires the existence of a clearly defined moral order. What we have is the exact opposite, where the state promotes the rentier class as being holy and sacred. The bond holder's usurious contract must be enforced at all costs. 
I agree an individual can achieve financial freedom, however bitcoiners promote it at the expense of someone else. That is what you do not understand. The only ones who have achieved financial freedom in bitcoin are the ones who 'got in early'. For everyone else the experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, this includes the ideologues like Ulbricht, Shrem who are now jailed. For every bitcoin millionaire there exists multiples upon multiples more with losses, realized or unrealized.
Let that sink in for a bit. There are more people with bitcoin related losses both financial and psychological than those with gains.

Because most miners 'dropped out' meaning you had huge centralization occur. Bitcoin halving cuts miner revenue, concentrating hashpower into fewer hands making bitcoin less secure. Who cares if hashpower is trillions if 1 guy owns all the equipment?
Bitcoin artificial supply constraints are antithetical to what money is. Money is just a medium of exchange that has *no value* of it's own. It's required to facilitate trade of things that actually have value and allocate resources for future value.

Bitcoin is just a rehash of old errors, namely the old errors of the gold standard. Bitcoin carries with it the ideology of deflation and a disdain for labor, this ideology is inherent in the 'Austrian school of economics'. Those with gold shekels should see them swell in value. If you look at behavior in this ecosystem you see how everyone is expecting top tier products while offering near zero wages. 
The current fiat system is perverted because it also rewards a rentier class who add no value but watch their 'assets' such as bond holdings swell in value or 'breed money' through compound interest.
The end result is what we have now. A paradox situation where 90% of the population is starved of money while 10% has an extreme abundance of it even though no theoretical constraints exist on the production of money.
Bitcoin solves absolutely *none* of that. Bitcoiners think somehow artificially constraining supply and concentrating it amongst 0.01% of an economy is 'progress'.
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:12:02

Exactly why deflation is a form of slavery.
Bitcoin hoarders whose profession is idleness are able to siphon off the surplus value other people create.
Suppose a developer works 1000 hours and comes up with a new innovation that boosts the utility of bitcoin. Does he get paid? No. Those hoarding do via the 'money becoming more valuable'. Did bitcoin create the new utility on it's own? No, someones labor power did.

Absolute bullshit that money developed in the market place.
Money has always been tied to a specific state. Just look at old coins being dug up. Do you think Ayn Rand and Roger Ver met on an island to barter and that created money?
The Austrian school keeps claiming that money arose from barter and organically when no historical evidence supports that claim. We have state issued money going as far back as Mesopotamia. Most 'tribal societies' were based on mutual gift exchange, not commercial trade.
One of the most successful monetary systems in history was the 'tally stick credit system' which lasted about 800 years, also sanctioned by the sovereign. 
Credit based monetary systems can work as long as rentier activities are discouraged, this includes compound interest which over time wrecks every economy it has ever been tried in. Classic economists clearly understood this. 
Bitcoin theory is to put all blame 100% on government while completely ignoring the rentier class because bitcoin itself is based on the creation of such a class. What's the first thing early adopters did? Setup exchanges to be able to funnel money to bid up their coins. What's the second thing they did? Start shilling to get people onboard.

Because we live in an usury based economy where the surplus value people create is being siphoned off. I explained that earlier. Alan Greenspan said debt creates the 'terrified employee' whose 1 paycheck away from poverty, this prevented them from demanding higher wages. So what you've had over the last 40 years is rising productivity while wages remained stagnant. That difference has been captured by the rentier class. 
Bitcoin once again solves none of that, what it does is encourage the formation of rentier classes. This ecosystem is a prime example. Vice is actively encouraged and promoted here as some sort of freedom. Yep, nothing like drug/gambling addicts perpetually buying bitcoins.

Clean what up exactly? What is the POINT of the foundation? The original foundation was setup in order to defraud the general public and launder money. That's called a scam and it's blatantly obvious what occurred there. Vessenes ran a scam operation from the get go with a bunch of criminals. It's not my opinion, 60% of the founding members are jailed or under arrest.
The Bitcoin Foundation is fully responsible for wrecking bitcoin's reputation. Having guys like Gavin Andresen effectively accept salaries from an organization that was milking donors just shows us the type of characters that this space is plagued with. The good news is most of the 'old timers' are out of money or have seen their reputations crater.

You don't finance projects with 'printed money'. The banks are the largest debtors in the economy, just pull up any bank balance sheet. They borrow from creditors and lend to those who need credit in order to produce future value. When you get a salary and 'keep it in the bank', what you are actually doing is *crediting* the banking system with the surplus value your labor created. This system only works if you have trust which is based on prudence. Hence the fiat credit system can expand the economy at a much faster rate then 100% gold coins or 100% bitcoins, only if there is a high level of trust. Guess what, prudence is a moral virtue! So an increase in morality corresponds to an increase in potential economic sophistication. Without morality as a form of regulation this system goes into extinction through boom bust cycles and reverts back to more primitive forms of money. This is the situation the world finds itself in at the moment.
Bitcoin represents monetary regression. The lower the amount of trust the more primitive the economy becomes. Think it through. The least trust is needed when you have barter, after wards more trust is required to use a common barter good(money) and the most trust is required when credit money comes into play. However credit money allows the most economic sophistication. Bitcoin is a throwback to a 'common barter good' meaning the majority of the economy would be frozen or in a state of deflation as those who labor for a living watch the value they create get siphoned off by bitcoin horders.

Now he wants the entire world using an American approved bitcoin, while totally ignoring the delusionality behind the idea. The market doesn't need a system where millions of watts of power is spent confirming coffee purchases and 'bitcoin faucets' for beggers.

Bitcoin attracted burnouts from the dot-com era and a shitload of confidence artists also from that era. This subreddit has established certain cults of personalities without ever verifying reputations and track records. Vessenes and his band of crooks(3 of whom are in jail) even claimed Satoshi was a founding member in order to gain legitimacy. People actually thought this was some sort of governing body and just handed them piles of money which were burned up.

Major VC funded firms are burning through fiat very fast to stay alive without producing the numbers they need to generate a profit. There is a high chance companies like BitPay and Coinbase actually wind down their operations over the next 36 months. Without fresh VC capital Coinbase is gone.

Capital that can be 'downloaded' anywhere by anyone is the killer app that people are overlooking here. It's a game changer.

The majority of properties in Canada are liened against by mortgages, so no you cannot transfer real estate easily. Real estate is an *illiquid* asset, I know that concept is difficult for you to comprehend since you live in a society that worships houses.

Equity replaces interest because it allows for shared risk in a venture. Interest is risk free profits which are enforced by a post-revolutionary state. Economic liberalism as defined by capitalism is state sponsored usury. Interest rates are a made up legal concept enforced by the state. What is the natural rate of interest? Is it 5% which after 2000 years equals the wealth of 10 planet earths? Interest is against nature itself as money does not breed money. Money is merely a medium of exchange to facilitate interaction between humans which is governed by moral law. All wealth in this world is a product not of money but of human labor itself. The belief that money breeds money or swells in value is contrary not only to nature but to human reason. Money is sterile. Interest has absolutely nothing to do with savings. Interest rates today are near zero despite a savings also being near zero. 
Time value of money is a made up excuse to justify the charging of positive interest.
Compound interest leads to demand destruction because money ends up in fewer and fewer hands. We are in a paradoxical situation where because of societal delusion, ie acceptance of compound interest we have both monetary scarcity and abundance at the same time. Money is abundant amongst the rich while scarce amongst 99% of the population. That is an economy defacto built upon economic liberalism which is a permissive use of usury.
Any economy that accepts a liberal use of usury ends up in poverty for the overwhelming majority of it's participants. Central banking refuses to acknowledge the moral law as premise for economic activity because they would have to refuse USURY which is a refutation of the made up 'rights' of bondholders. The rights of bondholders enforcing their immoral contracts is enshrined in the US constitution.
This is the precipice which modernity finds itself at. Either return to the moral law or face complete collapse. Outside of the moral order there can be no progress, think about that for awhile. Bitcoin is a defact rehash of old errors as are most of the theories being promulgated by the internet. If crypto would understand that human labor is the source of all man made value than we can begin a discussion of what money is, however crypto just rehashes the failed arguments of the gold bugs. A substance kept artificially scarce for no real reason. Why does bitcoin have value? Because of the completely ignorance of moral law by fiat authorities and the completely ignorance of prudence which is the basis of all sophisticated economic transactions.

Projects can be financed with equity. Short term self liquidating credit is morally acceptable too. Usury is the root cause of all of the problems in the economy including the welfare state having to redistribute wealth to those on the wrong end of compound interest.
Inflation in a fiat credit system occurs when credit is not prudently allocated and no new wealth is created. The credit units(dollars) than chase none existent goods causing inflation among-st the goods that do exist. Compount interest *forces* credit allocation even if it may not be wise to do so, this is why a compounding debt system requires perpetual inflation to function. Money has to be created no matter what to pay interest.
Credit based monetary systems require a high degree of trust, which requires prudence, which guess what? Is a moral virtue. So you cannot have a sophisticated economy absent of morality or the end result is boom bust cycles. The less trust in an economy the more primitive the trade. Bitcoin is a more primitive form of money than credit based systems. 
On you question about people still entering into usury contracts. Well yes of course it will still occur, but if the state is not actively enforcing those contracts because they are illegal than it remains only in the fringes. What we have today is the STATE actively sponsoring and enforcing usurious contracts.

Coinbase is a glorified bitcoin vending machine.
The primary reason this subreddit shills for Coinbase is that people on here believe Coinbase gives bitcoin 'legitimacy' because it is government approved.
Bitcoiners want everyone to see that a none shady business actually exists, so Coinbase fits that illusive narrative. The same bit-coiners who actively defended Mt.Gox are now actively shilling for Coinbase.
Coinbase is and always will be ant-thetical to bitcoin. Coinbase has no incentive for people to use the blockchain in the first place.
Coinbase is a bitcoin vending machine that doesn't care at all about anything but a FIAT denominated buy out that makes the senior stakeholders rich.

Those days long passed but Gavin continues to remain bitter.

Im buying JPY with my US bank account through a middleman(VISA) and than spending those JPY. 
Bitpay and Coinbase are just over-glorified exchangers. Why would I waste computing and economic resources using the blockchain when I can buy occulus directly with dollars?

Gavin owns almost no bitcoins for it to matter if he leaves or not.
Gavin has no influence in this space, he wasn't even able to get 1% of miners to shift over to XT.

It's primitive because it's a barter good. The less trust the less sophisticated the transactions.
Credit money allows you to finance a ton of activity simultaneously by linking creditors with debtors. One of the biggest monetary innovations is the ability to run an economy on money that is not directly tied to some limited supply commodity. The innovation in money is that we run a 60 trillion dollar per year economy world wide on only 1 trillion USD of 'base' money and no need to link up with precious metals.
In a credit based economy people are indirectly financing trade *at all times*. Think about it. You get paid in dollars(liability), that means you are *crediting* the banking system with your surplus value. If that credit is prudently allocated more wealth is produced and your dollars(liabilities) can be used to purchase that wealth. 
With bitcoin you don't have that mechanism, you get a sterile computer digit that is artificially constrained in supply just because an algorithm said so. 
Bitcoin is kind of a credit money when it's first emitted because miners require someone to give them electricity/computers etc before they can 'make bitcoin'. So in that sense bitcoin is a permission slip to use what the miners secure(blockchain) as a reward for crediting them with the tools they need. The problem with bitcoin is it's supply algorithm not being tied to anything other than an linear algorithm.

The Shift card is a prepaid US dollar debit card. This subreddit is pretending this is new technology.
Coinbase is running out of ideas how to boost their user count. The sad part is they are bragging about 1 million spent on their cards over a 3 month period. That is just pathetic. A chain of grocery stores does that volume in a week.

Yes it would. Gavin never invented bitcoin, he's just hell bent on destroying it. Gavin is bitter that he became obsolete as the bitcoin project grew larger. Now he want's to be back at the helm of the ship and is desperately attempting to do it with a hardfork into a new altcoin.
Why is it that any critism of the personality cult worship on this subreddit ends with bitcoiners claiming 'What have you done'? 'Why are you afraid of Gavin'? It's like the church of Scientology members on youtube.

Ton's of evidence. Bitpay laid off staff, downsized. Coinbase burning $3 million per month and is looking at every option to get revenue.
Bitcoin startups cannot even afford to pay booth fees at prominent expos any longer. 
Let me make a statement that will make you froth at the mouth.
What do I mean by that? No startup in this space has managed to turn a sustained profit enough to cover cost of operations and legal compliance.
There has been no legally sustainable bitcoin startup in 7 years.

Why would the layman have any use for bitcoin? Like this is a question that is never answered by this subreddit. 
Why do people hire bitcoin? Why is this subreddit so intent on targeting random people by any means available? 
So far in 7 years every bitcoin related business that has targeted the masses has gone bust or is in the process of failing. 
Maybe it's time to make actual improvements to bitcoin like enhanced privacy in order to attract quality users vs constant embarrassing shilling attempts.

Compound interest wrecks any economy it has been tried in. Interest rates have to be at zero and the beneficiaries of compound interest over the last few decades need to have their bank 'balances' erased. That is the only way out of the debt bomb. Remember a positive bank account balance represents a debt.

'With bitcoin' so does that mean they will directly accept bitcoin or will it be instantly converted to dollars through BitPay or Coinbase? That's not buying with bitcoin then as I can sell my BTC on any exchange and buy Oculus with dollars and say I paid bitcoin.

50% of daily transactions are balances under $1 of bitcoin. The cost per transaction is $7. You want to use the blockchain as long as other people are covering the costs to run it, classic libertarian.

Berkshire growth slowdown was due to the consequences of compound interest. At some point debt increases faster than the available productivity to service it. This kills the economy and kills profit. Berkshire in real terms has decline for the past 17 years.
Bitcoin can't increase indefinitely because alternative bitcoins are easy to make. During the late 2013 bubble litecoin captured something like 11% of bitcoins market cap.

The banking system can handle negative rates what it cannot handle is if the 2 and 10 year bond curve inverted. That would bring about immediate insolvency of the entire system.

Half of transactions taking place are under $1. A significant portion is also fake transactions.
Bitcoin has stalled in terms of user growth. That is evident by nearly every single startup in the process of failing in this space.

The problem is the higher the price the higher the cost to run the network because of the subsidy.
Running bitcoin costs $1.35million per day. Hardly cheap for a network that is barely used.

What do you mean 'artificial'. Compound interest is the root cause of the dead economy. Money breeding money causes all the wealth to accumulate into fewer and fewer hands.

Bitcoin is the most traceable form of money ever created. Governments want a 'cashless' economy so people are forced to prop up insolvent banks. Holding physical banknotes means you are not a creditor to a particular commercial bank. 'Cashless' is being pushed because authorities are aware the majority of fiat banks are insolvent. Look at Deutsche Bank this week.

Decentralized development would lead to nowhere as nobody would be able to coordinate anything. Bitcoiners are never able to define what decentralization actually means and in what context it plays out. What are the limits to decentralization? It seems nihilistic that we constantly hear 'freedom from' something. So based on bitcoiner ideology absolutely no organization can exist. It should be poorly paid developers scattered all over the place 'competing' against each other for the popular opinion of penny shaving holders.
Bitcoin development has stalled years ago, there have been no major changes because none are currently warranted. 
How are developers to be paid for their work? It seems nobody in this space wants to pay for quality. The result is developers are forced to get 'hired' by outside interests and develop inherent bias. Then thousands of conspiracy posts flood the bitcoin news outlets.
Does a community really exist if nobody is willing to contribute any financial resources? Who decides who is a developer and who isn't? Does reputation matter in this community? What are the limits for a decentralized community? Is it just scattered individuals with no attachment to anything? So basically a repeat of the chronic failures of liberalism?

Inflation is directly corelated to high interest rates because new money has to be created to pay off compound interest. Every single country experiencing high inflation right now has high interest rates. Coincidence? The reason there is no inflation now in US is because interest rates are almost at zero. Interest IS inflationary in a fiat money system, until it reaches a point where so few hands own all the money you get massive debt deflation. Interest rates were double digits in late 70's and have come down along with inflation over the last 3-4decades. Compound interest requires expansive monetary policy. The creditor class has been killing the economy for massive short term gains since the early 80's.
