Dude this is false.
I downloaded the wallet myself a week ago. Both options are clearly available on the main screen.

Thanks, I was aware they claim it’s “closer to Satoshi’s true vision” but I wasn’t aware people straight up claim it is bitcoin....
That seems odd to me as you can clearly distinguish a fork from a main chain afaik.

This ^
Even more so because bitcoin is perfectly durable, you’ll never “wear out” your bitcoins and need to replace them, which creates even less of an incentive for miners to get back into the game.

As a newcomer to crypto does anyone have a TL/DR resource on why there is so much animosity around BCH/BTC? I for one feel like there’s no problem with having a fork between these currencies, they just have different uses based on the transaction speed. Is it really a problem if they exist side by side?
If you downvote people who are here to ask honest questions it’s only gonna hurt adoption.

This is a fallacy; you’ll sell bitcoins below the cost of acquisition if you lose confidence that they will appreciate back to that value in a reasonable amount of time. This is what causes stock flights. When people see the value of an asset begin to fall, they often get out as soon as possible regardless of their purchase price to maximize gains or minimize losses. Plenty of people will still sell below acquisition cost if they think the asset’s value will continue to fall and never bounce back.
I don’t see this happening short of a major technological flaw being uncovered in BTC or a major advance in an altcoin that makes BTC obsolete, but you never know. It can be better to sell that $1K BTC at $900 than $0.05, and lots of people will make that calculus, further driving price down.
There is no floor.

I can only provide you my personal explanation; price swings like these are the aggregate of many decisions. I pulled all my crypto into fiat USD last night (from BTC and BCH) because I was sitting roughly where I started in terms of capital gains/losses and was concerned about what the fork might do to my BCH holdings, and ripple effects in other coins. I imagine the drama is just undermining a lot of people’s confidence.

This is deceptive and uninformed :(
