Everyone at r/btc told me that you guys could be afraid to talk about this but you are not.  I really appreciate this.  You have good answers.  
I can't appreciate your time enough.  Decentralization is beyond important to me.  You're obviously a smart guy.  
If the fees are the current price to pay for long term decentralization then I think it is worth it.  
But still .... I can't believe that r/btc and Bitcoin.com are making up all the things about censorship and Bitcoin Core people being afraid to talk about these issues though.  You seem to not be that way at all, so maybe they are wrong.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:29:03
Because you're normal.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:50:00
Can you go into more detail on this?  From what I understand is if Bitcoin lost 50% of their hashrate tomorrow, it takes time for the difficulty to adjust.  It seriously might be a week with no transactions.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:00:03
In a couple months what will happen?  LN?  They've been promising that for years, no?  Now you think it will be done in February?  I hope you're right but I would bet against it.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:19
Made me laugh
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:55:06
I'm sorry, I am confused.  What are you saying?  You're saying miners can't deal with the bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:02:35
This has never happened, so how do you know?  There has never been a case like this.  
All I know is Ether has 3x the transactions of Bitcoin and is much more usable.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:47
Maybe forever.  This is crypto.  Who the hell knows.  I know if Core fixes the scaling issue Bitcoin Cash will die and Bitcoin will reign.  I wish they would before it is too late.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:08:14
Exactly.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:50:14
I like alts too but this may or may not be true.  We had six weeks were all alts went down and only Bitcoin rose daily.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:01
That message has been there for months.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:48:49
Instead we got $30 fees.  How long is this sustainable?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:58:10
But many many people on r/bitcoin are promoting Litecoin and that seems ok.  No one is being banned for promoting Litecoin anymore.  Maybe I am wrong but everyone is saying to use Litecoin.  
If you say to use BCH they will get super angry though.  
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:02:33
Of course I care about fees.  Which wallets do you suggest?
I think it's crazy you don't want coinbase, blockchain.info or bitpay in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  These companies have helped make using Bitcoin a reality for tens of millions.  Without them the number of people using Bitcoin will drastically go down.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:53:58
You realize even if this improved things 50% (which it wont) that there is still a major problem.

Don't be logical.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:54:55
I believe Bitcoin is stronger than a few people out there arguing.  Their main argument is the fees are too high.  Which they obviously are insane.  We fix that and they all go away.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:32
Just that one day actually.  Otherwise it has been going up since it opened at $300.  People don't like the fees of Bitcoin.  
I wish core would fix it.  I will be the  person to leave Bitcoin Cash forever.  But until they fix the fees a huge portion is going to leave.  All they have to do it up the limit to 2mb and Bitcoin Cash is toast.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:51:55
You've owned Bitcoin Cash this whole time and just now this put you over the edge?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:47:27
Exactly.  Fiat may work for you but it doesn't for me.  Crypto is a much better option and I have been using it for years. 
If Bitcoin isn't usable, and fiat is a better option, what is the point of Bitcoin?  The original purpose and it still shows on Bitcoin.org is that it is a simple and easy and cheap permission less worldwide currency.  
You're basically agreeing that anyone who wants to use crypto needs to pick something other than Bitcoin.  I think this will hurt Bitcoin in the medium term once more people figure this out.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:39
Why? I'm confused 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:01:59
**I want Bitcoin to rule.**  But it won't unless we fix fees.    
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:55:12
50% ?   80%  ?
Even if we went down 80% the fees would still be an issue.  And we both know seqwit is voluntary and never ever getting that kind of adoption unless it can immediately show results and it must not be.  Otherwise people would implament it.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:52
What?   So many comments without explaining.  Why do you feel this way?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:59:10
Easier for them to switch to BCH or Litecoin that works instead of wasting time doing the work that the developers are suppose to do.  
And even if everyone gets Seqwit, what does that do?  Maybe 50% less fees?  We're still WAY over.  
I actually use Bitcoin.  I don't let it sit on Coinbase and then talk about it.  You obviously don't use it because it is not usable.  Which means it has no utility and this scares me.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:02:56
Wow.  Is this a real comment?  I got two things to tell you.  
**First -&gt;**  If everyone adopts Seqwit, fees will only go down 50% at best and fees will be too high. Even if they dropped 80% the fees would be too high in my mind.  1000 sat/byte lowered to 200 sat/byte is reasonable but still higher than everyone else.  
**Second --&gt;**  Why do companies have to rush to adopt Seqwit and you give them no slack at all and even get mad when they don't.  Do you get mad at the LN developers for taking years to get their product out?  Or does LN get all the time they need and it will be ready when its ready?
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:49:34
At least they're trying.  (I Agree Ripple is centralized, and I would never touch it but that is one crypto only)
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:49:58
Crypto is here to stay.  If Bitcoin makes it is on us.  If we make it work it will work.  Don't ever think it is Bitcoin or nothing.  
Bitcoin is an idea and Core and Adam Back don't own Bitcoin.  The community owns Bitcoin.  It is an open source project.  
Bitcoin Cash is the same exact code as Bitcoin.  They stripped out SeqWit and then increased block size.  
Now they have plans to do other things but if they have security issues, so does Bitcoin because 99% of the code is the exact same.  
*(By the way Etherium has about 3x the transactions of Bitcoin and they just increased the block size and it seems to work for now)*
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:02:57
Lot of coins are.  Unfortunately this could be the end of us.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:07:43
Lying is a little harsh.  I obviously mean LN is taking a long time to get done and every supporter says to "be patient" but no one is "patient" with companies who complain about the fees or who switch blockchains due to the fees.  (aka Bitpay, the devil in many's eyes)
The companies failed in their 2x takeover.   Do you want coinbase and Blockchain.info and bitpay to leave the Bitcoin ecosystem?  Would that make you happy?  How long are you going to bash them.  
Seqwit ain't simple to implement and many have said so.  
Seqwit will come to all major wallets.  I use Blockchain.info and copay so I hope to see it soon there.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:58:45
I hope you're right Segwit cleans up fees.  If it really works, I suspect we will start to see soon.  I will be the number one fan and I will do my part to switch.  
I don't get this one.  So companies can't complain about the fees because they don't do anything, but the LN can tell people not to complain about the fees and be patient when they're not doing anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:00
This article says Bitcoin Cash was $9000 when it never was.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:39
Like you say it was so fast last time.  This time is already longer.  If Core would just fix the scaling Bitcoin Cash would be smoked in 5mins.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:07:44
Awesome!  But what is the time table?  I would be super pumped if LN comes in, we're for sure going over 20k too.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:39:41
I think Ver was a moron when he rage quit due to someone saying BCASH.  He made himself look moronic.  Moronic, but not evil.  
I just don't get why you'd think a guy doesn't like someone that he specifically says he does like.  And also why so angry and emotional.  I feel like no one can have a normal conversation about the issues without blowing up.

@_date: 2017-12-27 19:04:15

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:50:42
What are you saying?  You can't steal open source code.  That is the point of open source.  The definition is that it is open to anyone.

Anyone who thinks insider trading is a crime and is pro Bitcoin needs to rethink their philosophy.  Roger Ver is 100% right.  Don't ask the government for help on every little thing.  
Nothing to do with anything else but I am with him on this issue for sure.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:03:20
People have said this.  Is this the insider trading to pump up BCH ?
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:42:42
What is significantly?  50% or 80%  Either way it is still huge.  Either way fees are out of control.  No one thinks Segwit is the answer.  Maybe it is one piece of the pie but not the final solution.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:54:08
BashCo, I love Bitcoin to death but you need to rethink this. 
You might be right years from now but not today.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:12:04
1TB hard drive cost less than the average transaction fee on Bitcoin right now.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:04:25
Maybe we should lower the block size then.  You need progress and they've done many hard forks before and it worked fine.  Many other coins have done hard forks and no issues at all.  Bitcoin Cash just did one and zero problems.  
The only reason this is contentious is because they made it so.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:54
They don't allow you to sell.  Nice lie though :) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:56
Why?  People keep saying this but no one explaining it.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:05:55
OK, I can see how this helps the insiders.  How does this hurt Bitcoin?  Why does this have anything to do with us?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:58:49

Good comment.  If we don't we're gonna get surpassed.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:11:08
No its not.  The fact that one exchange has this much power hurts crypto.  When Kraken launched Bitcoin Cash, no one reacted this way.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:14:16
The information he's talking about has been out for a long long time.  Nothing new has changed.  If you are offended now, you would have been upset before.  Trying to see what is different. 
It just seems to me we should focus on Bitcoin and ignore other coins.  What they do should never effect us and if it does it says more about us then it does about them.    
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:45:19
You must not use Bitcoin on daily basis like I do.  Paying $100 for an item and paying $25 in fees is just not reasonable.  
If you leave the Bitcoin on coinbase, sure it doesn't matter.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:53:11
All companies should only care about their bottom line.  That is the definition of a company and they have an obligation to their investors to do this.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:07:02
That is a good thing for sure.  I'm 100% behind it.  I don't think it is enough fast enough but anything is better than nothing.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:55:52
I get it.  So Litecoin knows their place, so they're ok.
1--Who do you think is the "true" Etherium?  Etherium or Etherium Classic?  Who do you think the majority of people would consider?  Has nothing to do with the fork or that Etherium Classic is "first".  Has to do with where the community. Right now that is obviously with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash people can say whatever they want, it doesn't matter.  The community decides.  
Now...the followers of Bitcoin Cash.  To say they are not true Bitcoin believers is tough.  Many founded Bitcoin like Gavin Anderson who is basically the  Bitcoin Developers next to Satoshi.  He supports Bitcoin Cash.  **Do you think Gavin Anderson is not worthy of being called a Bitcoin follower?**  Bitcoin Cash follows another path.  Let them.  Who cares.  Let's worry about ourselves.  
2--No one should be aggressive or malicious.  Civil debate makes us all smarter and more intelligent.  
3--Talking about the block size should not be considered altcoin pumping
You sound like you have serious issues with Bitcoin Cash.  if our community spent half the time we spent on bashing Bitcoin Cash as we did on focusing on the fee issue, Lightning Network would be done by now, and Bitcoin Cash would be gone.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:04:27
OK, but right now it is 800 sat/byte.  So with SeqWit I pay over 400 sat/byte still?
I mean doesn't seem like a solution even if everyone is on it.  I mean it is better but I don't get why everyone acts like it is the most wonderful thing ever.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:06:21
I can see how this helps the insiders.  How does this hurt Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:06
Well, things are slowly changing.  I think it makes good sense to hold 80% Bitcoin and 20% BCH.  I know both sides will hate me, but I am just trying to make sure I pick the winner in the end.  
Seems like both add up 20k regardless of the day.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:03:28

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:11:27

So many people think Coinbase is the only exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:02:31
Wow.  wow.  that is how we argue here?  Someone asks questions and your method is to say I'm a troll because you can't explain it?   Wow, you are so sad.  This is not how an open discussion works.  FLAGGED?  Wow.  You're pathetic.  You probably love safe spaces at college where no one can ever hurt your feelings.  
Seriously one of the most pathetic comments I've heard and you're everything wrong about the community.  You love meme's and slogans but don't want to talk about tech and real issues.  
Now, I've seen insider trading as an argument.  Is that it?  I've seen the fact that Bitcoin Cash was opened at $9500.  I've seen people say just the fact that they list Bitcoin Cash.  Others say they are not using Seqwit.  
None of these reasons to me seem like a reason to leave an exchange.  Is there something I don't know about?   
I'm sure you won't respond because you cannot.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:09:29
You're 100% wrong.  People in Bitcoin love liberty and don't look for the government to save them from everything.  I understand many of you are new in the last few months but this is pathetic.  
Bitcoin is censorship free money and freedom that no one can stop.  Insider trading is none of our concern and does not harm Bitcoin in anyway at all.  The more open we are, the less we have to worry about insiders.  
Worrying about something that happened on an exchange with another coin, not called Bitcoin, is something I don't understand at all.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:06:54
No it would not.  That is now how Seqwit works.  It is not the end all be all.  You're 100% incorrect and need to do some research on this.  
Even the supporters admit maybe a 30% decrease in fees AT BEST.  
Not to mention full adoption will never ever happen.  People use and do what is simple and Seqwit is obviously not like pressing a button.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:01:04
All those can be done by other currencies like BCH and Litecoin better and cheaper.  The best thing we have is liquidity and adoption and we need to make sure we're usable or we're going to lose those advantages to another coin.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:22
If one person can kill Bitcoin, I think we got bigger problems then worrying about Brian Armstrong.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:07:56
You can't define something by using itself to define it.  What is Bitcoin?  What makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Gold, not Bitcoin?
Can you define it?  It sounds like you can't.  This is essential to deciding what Bitcoin is and isn't and if they have a real claim to Bitcoin.  
In most open source projects, the community decides what the real Bitcoin is.  So in this example obviously the community is following Bitcoin overwhelmingly compared to Bitcoin Cash so I would use that as the definition.  
**I would also say Market Cap, number of users, number of transactions will all decide who is the real Bitcoin is.**  Do you disagree?  If you do disagree how do you define it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:05:32
OK, I can see how this helps the insiders.  How does this hurt Bitcoin?  Why does this have anything to do with us?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:25:32
Bitcoin Cash was NEVER $8000.  Do people seriously think because Coinbase puts up a number that means its true?  It's only a real number if there is actual commerce at that number and no one traded at $8000 ever.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:09:22
They've known about this problem for at least three years now.  This is nothing new.  When you say "time" how long?  Might be enough time for everyone to leave to another blockchain unless we do something.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:54:18
Assume you're joking.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:48:19
The case for Bitcoin Cash is zero.  Bitcoin Cash is toast if Core does this.  You nailed it.  But why they don't is anyone's guess.  They've said they will in late 2015 but then just never do anything.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:29
Why do people say this?   You asked them to leave and they left.  I am confused why the hate.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:01:48
But it does while we fix it.  And if you're right then lets lower the limit to .5 mb.  Why 1mb?  If on chain is so bad lets go to .1 mb.  
Move to 2mb or 4mb fix the issue then we're all good.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:12
Why are you leaving Coinbase?  Everyone is assuming everyone knows what evil they did.  I don't understand.  They launched another coin.  Why does this matter?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:02
That is the entire comment?  Why can't we trust Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:57:39
I still don't get it.  You keep making comments but not explaining why you think this way.   
So you're for Seqwit for bigger blocks but not for a block size increase that Bitcoin Cash did?  Why is Seqwit superior to the Bitcoin Cash option?
I'm trying to learn this stuff, and everyone just has slogans I feel like.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:03:44
That is a lot to reply to.  I will say I've never said to focus on the short term vs long term.  I think we should do both.  Make it work in the short term while we find a long term solution.   No one will support LN more than me.  I actually use Bitcoin daily, and I doubt many others on this subreddit do.   
PASSING OFF AS THE REAL BITCOIN 
The major issue "passing themselves off as Bitcoin"  begs the question, what is Bitcoin? 
Is Bitcoin the core team?  Is Bitcoin the community?  Is Bitcoin the actual blockchain? 
The Bitcoin Cash people say they feel they are following the original Bitcoin's vision.  They think that someday they might be the top Bitcoin coin.  That is possible.  **Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin today.**  Two different versions and now the marketplace and community gets to decide.  But if Bitcoin Cash market cap and community is much larger than Bitcoin's then yes, I do think it will earn the title of the real Bitcoin.  
**Or you have to explain to me what the real Bitcoin is.**  I would LOVE an answer on this more than anything.  You can't blame someone for saying something you think they are not until you can define what it is.  
BITCOIN CASH PUMP 
Bitcoin Cash launched at $300, and today is 9x that.  I don't think that is so bad.  *(You mentioned they didn't pump it well)*  Not to mention the acceptance of Bitcoin Cash in less than five months is basically unprecedented and never happened before with any coin.  Almost all major exchanges except for Gemini trade the five month old coin known as Bitcoin Cash.  
GAVIN ANDERSON doesn't matter
There is no one on the planet that has had more connection with Satoshi than Gavin Anderson.  Gavin Anderson was the lead Bitcoin Core developer until 2012.  How much more closely connected with Bitcoin and its founding can you get?  There isn't another human on Earth like that.  This guy supports Bitcoin Cash.  And you think there is no legitimate connection at all to Bitcoin with a guy like Gavin Anderson on board?
ATTACKERS and TROLLS 
As far as "attacks" and "trolls" which this community loves to blame all their ill wills and make excuses about, they may be true.  They might not be true.  Either way we need to accept those people will be there then fight against them.  Not name call, but use good arguments.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:39
What does segwit do for you?  People keep saying this but I don't understand why this matters
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:57
If he did then he's ahead.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:54:27
Well, it is open source so things are much different than other times.  Bitcoin Core has been forked many times always calling the new forked coin "Bitcoin"
But you're 100% right Ver doesn't seem that stable.  He doesn't seem that smart either.  I don't know why people hate him.  
I do think there is a certain amount of fear he is right and BCH may take over. I mean the fees are a major major problem and we have 85 posts about Ver and zero about fixing the fees.   
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:08:36
No it won't.  Where do you get this information from?  Not even the supporters think this.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:10:46
They think its a waste of time.  Not needed.  But they do believe in LN and second layer solutions.  When they're ready (since it is open source) they will be run on Bitcoin Cash.  
Also, colored coins are coming back to Bitcoin Cash also.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:05:01
Interesting.  Why Litecoin and Ether but not BCH ?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:43:16

Average Bitcoin transaction is like $75K bro.  Bitcoin is for the rich, not the poor anymore.  Sending $75K and paying $100 ain't the end of the world.  
I super hope LN comes and works.  I will be the biggest fan.

You're right that both forks are a temp solution.  But one solution works and the other does not.  So I'd rather have a temp solution that works while we both try to figure out the long term answer.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:52:48
No its not.  I am talking about addresses.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:40:58
They are?  Interesting.  How do you know if you use a paper you don't get the same address as someone else?
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:48:44
But at least you can post it.  You cannot say the opposite here.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:53:06
Not talking about private keys.  Talking about addresses as I said in the question.  I understand private keys.

He doesn't even sell a few to live?  I respect all HODLers but I mean you live in the 3rd world country and don't mention selling any?
That makes me think its fake.  I mean sell 100 Bitcoin and live a great life and keep 19,900.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:51:57
Talking about addresses, not private keys
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:16:26
Much bigger % of the daily volume though
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:21:02
Ahhh   Thank you sir!   Makes sense now.  :) 
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:12:56
I did it also.  I don't only talk about my trades when I win.  Win some and lose some.  The fork will still happen but with limited support like Bitcoin Gold.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:30:02
I more favor the other side, but I fully respect this article.  He defends the mods that is perfectly fine and explains things.  
The problem is that is not what happens.  The mod policy here seems shrouded in confusion on what is acceptable along with many not even knowing there is any restrictions on speech when there obviously is.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:51:03
No, you're talking about the seed.  Doesn't anyone know anything about Bitcoin here?
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:10:49
Well... Bitcoin Gold happened so SOMEONE will do this fork.  Only takes one person.  And a few exchanges might be trapped into supporting it.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:08:30
Let's hope no one is betting whit that kind of money.   I also bet on B2X but sure as hell made sure the mortgage was paid first
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:47:30
CONGRATS MAN!!   Super awesome to hear!
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:54:09
I don't think $1.93 is good long term.  We need lightning network and second layer solutions as soon as possible.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:53:15
talking about addresses
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:04:03
I would explain more details but then the post would be banned.  I probably have a short shelf life as it is.  
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:46:56
Many times.  It is one of the best use cases and we will see a LOT more of it.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:19:27
So you think high fees are a good thing?
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:47:12
Way more 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:36:23
Get is up and going.  We needed this yesterday.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:53:41
Doesn't discuss the off line part.  Not sure what you mean about "that is not how it works" 
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:08:56
Did he say he was putting it ALL on B2X ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:52:15
So he doesn't have the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:52:06
Best answer, thank you
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:17:24
Have to include Poloniex, Bittrex, HitBTC, Binance, and many others that trade mainly Bitcoin to Tether.  
Tether is a serious issue that needs to be addressed sooner or later.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:27:31
He understands nothing about Bitcoin.  He says
**"People say its like gold, but no its not. Gold is limited."**
This moron doesn't even study the thing he is bashing.

Bitpay is an excellent company.  They didn't make their decision on the direction of their entire operation on a whim.  Give them some credit and let's see how this whole thing plays out before declaring them the devil.  
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:03:23
I shorted some Bitcoin at $6750.   Not a wise choice :(
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:11:17
There are two sets of strategies facing our competition.
1.......**First we attack** like we do against Bitcoin Cash.  The result has been they are sitting at  on coin market cap and everyone knows who they are and their share of exchanges accepting them is basically universal.
2......**Second we ignore** them like we did with Bitcoin Gold.  Even though that coin debuted at  on coin market cap, and rose as high as $450 *(I sold mine all my Bitcoin Gold for $300)*, we laughed at them and thought they were a big joke and maybe even a scam.  Now Bitcoin Gold is  by market cap and price is $29 and dropping.
The best policy in my opinion is to ignore them and focus on Lightning and Bitcoin.

Cheap Air is much better but in the United States, Cheap Air doesn't have Southwest or Delta.  
Thus, Destinia is used by many in those cases.   
The dumb thing about Destinia is they don't explain or publicize when they offer Bitcoin and when they don't.  My experience has been that day before never gets the Bitcoin option.  But I am interested to hear others experiences.    
CheapAir customer service via the phone or email is just fantastic.  Their hours are limited but the service is awesome.  Destinia has zero English customer service.  Only Spanish.

On Bitfinex they allow you to "split" your Bitcoin into B1X and B2X and then sell them if you'd like.  You can also "combine" one B1X and one B2X anytime for a normal Bitcoin you can withdrawal.  
How can no one have this answer on how to do this at HITBTC?
Someone is selling so obviously someone got HITBTC B2X somehow!
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:23:37
Holy shit.  Thank you so much.  This site looks awesome.  I will be testing it out for sure.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:26:57
I super disagree.  Fantastic product.  I'm hugh into Bitcoin and probably used every wallet, and use Bitcoin Core as well, and Blockchain.info is beyond an amazing product.  
Only negative is they don't support other coins.  Otherwise their product is top notch.
