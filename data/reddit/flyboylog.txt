I’m sorry you feel that way! Few reasons we can think of (along with our investors who feel similar sentiment). 1) Allows users to simulate trading with virtual currency instead of risking their own capital. 2) Daily prizes rewarded to whoever gains the most that day percentage wise. 3) You can make groups between your friends and compete on who trades the best. 4) It’s completely free. All prize pool money and affiliate payments (for bringing new players to the game) are paid through advertisements.

iOS and Android app will be introduced into market shortly. For the time being, you can play on your computer or phone through your web browser. Hope you enjoy! We’ll be conducting an AMA with our CEO and main developer after official launch next Sunday, April 1st.

I would also like to point out that because of our advertisement strategy, we’re able to pay out daily, weekly and monthly prizes to the top traders. So, happy trading :)

Hmm I’d reckon the 2.6 billion people around the world who actively play games would disagree. But it’s definitely not for everyone!

Haha I like your thought! We wanted to make it completely separate from any real capital being traded. This is a fun way to play against friends and the community to see who the best traders are, without the risk - also allows you to be a bit more aggressive with your trades than normal ��
