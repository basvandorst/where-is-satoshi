Nah, I'm broke af and I save on groceries to put extra money in the bitcoin. It's been so rewarding.

if it makes you feel any better, I once had 645 Bitcoins and sold them with a 15 euro profit (in total, not each). Chances come and go. Such is life.

Well, it's not the women that are a cancer to society. It's the children they raise. Just look at your own comment. It's full of signs that you have some serious lack of fatherly love.

You obviously didn't grow up poor. The first thing you'd learn is that money leads to more money and not enough money leads to an expensive life. Lazy pieces of shit that never worked a day can earn more money because they already have money. That's shite. Had nothing to do with being commie.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:28:35
You don't make it sound like a dick measuring contest, you're trying to make everyone feel sorry for you because you "lived the hard life, the hardest of them all". Again, you're generalizing and putting certain people in a room. Will Smith is a part of the black community, is he not? Morgan Freeman? Denzel Washington? Whoa, terrible what happened to them. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Maybe try to make the world a better place instead of pissing on everyone you think is not "worthy" of your level of "street cred" or "ganster life". You sound pathetic. It's not an attack, just realize how you write. You're sounding as if you're fighting half the population.

You seem pathetic. How do you justify if two people have a child, the father dies in Iraq and you say "shoot the mother"? Here you go again with the "I am a tough guy because I grew up tough. I'm so tough, I like that my mom is having cancer. Is that tough enough?". Really, grow up. I notice the whole lack of fatherly love in your comments but best get over it.

No it's not. It's what I dislike about the bitcoin. People only buy it for "free moneys" whereas it's actually supposed to be a currency. The only things I use the euro for is paying uni/groceries/fines. Everything else like clothing, electronic appliances and so forth are payed for with Bitcoin. It's why I exchange my monthly income for bitcoin. It gives me a lot of discounts.

You've not really experienced poverty if you call poor people parasites (or generalize a group as parasites).

My comment may get shot down.
UBI is a solution to the incoming automation industry which will cause a lot of job losses. From my perspective, it's also a solution to the depression that people get from their jobs. Jobs are so damn monotone, that it's not worth having one if you would want to enjoy life. UBI gives people the opportunity to chase a job that would satisfy them. Let people get paid hobbies, instead of jobs.

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:04:00
So, if you weren't born with a silver spoon in your mouth, why are you saying that only "commies care about that shit" that people of the 1% get richer than the other 99%? Because if you think that the 1% has nothing to do with the exploitation of communities where single parents are not a rare sight, think again.
You may feel sorry for people from venezuela, zimbabwe and NK, but after that, I feel sorry for the american people. Living in a corrupt country, where the government is made up of people of the 1% that change the rules to their liking. Do you think that those rules will help any single-parent families that fight for food every day? Do you think those single-parent families should "just work harder"? Having a 1% is not good at all. Because if your government is made up of those kind of people, the government loses touch with the 99% people, that have different problems.
And I never said only rich kids have an opinion.

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:50:34
9000 is a pretty big round number. For me hearing "it's going to go crazy" means that bitcoin will hit 10.000 before 2018. That would be 2 barriers of which 10.000 is by far the most challenging that the bitcoin ho(dl/ld)ers will encounter.

Googled it. Wasn't that hidden. You still pay the price that you see in the payment process. I thought hidden like, paying for your wallet storage through the currency that's in your wallet.

Because if it wouldn't, apple farmers wouldn't be a thing anymore.
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:16:13
So an apple farmer farms x apples and sells them for the price of y and is able to live off of that. Now the price of an apple collapse, becoming worth of y/10 and the farmer can't live off of it anymore. Nobody else is willing to become an apple farmer since the results are y/10 which would mean a farmer would need to farm 10\*x apples in order to live off of it. Not only growing this 10\*x, it's also maintaining, plucking, planting etc.

If you think about the smaller things, definitely. But imagine if someone is planning to buy a house. If he has the money for it, why not wait 2 or 3 years and buy an even better house that's not only fancies, but also of better quality? That's a lot of money just hanging around.
@_date: 2018-02-26 06:08:40
That doesn't make it better. If we still use currency in 20 years and 99% of the current workforce can't work anymore because of automation, it will only become worse. People will get support from the government and still not spend their money because it only increases in value.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:18:20
The price will get higher, a many miners will stop, few will continue, knowing that they are paying their current energy-bills with the profits in the future. In other words, only rich people can then get richer.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:19:57
But if inflation is so bad, how do you convince people to spend their money? If nobody spends it, nothing will run anymore. I would hoard my money, because I know that it will gain more value in time. That's also the reason why governments tax savings. If you're not going to pump it back into the economy, you're hurting the economy.

The blockchain doesn't really have anything like uptime for looking at the blockchain, because it's a peer-to-peer network, which means that if you can't access a blockchain from someone who has a copy of it, your viewer will automatically choose another copy of the blockchain. It basically had an uptime of 100%.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:17:59
Yes. But imagine if everyone would suddenly consume a lot less... imagine the company you work for would instead of the normal workload, only have a 40% workload? Would you still have a job?

It's not an intentional scam. But it's necessary because natural emergent behaviour in our society makes people hoarders. It's crazy how fast money has to be pumped in the economy in order for it to even run.

This is not actually the reason I switched to bitcoin. I'm more than happy to pay taxes but then again, I'm a european. The thing that bothers me with fiat is that the government can decide to inflate it and if it's stored in a bank, who knows what those criminals do with it.

Well, it can't.

And if the connected peer shows actual trouble with the connection, the client connects just with a peer that does not show this connection problem.

I'm prepared to be downvoted, but it's my opinion that inflation is needed for a working currency. Otherwise, everybody will just hoard the currency and not spend anything of it. Remember the great depression? If Bitcoin would be the only currency, I wouldn't spend it anymore because it will increase in value. But if I had a business and everybody would think like that, I can close it because nobody wants to spend money on my business.
