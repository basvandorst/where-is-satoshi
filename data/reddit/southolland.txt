Who knows what could happen Thursday with Brexit. It's got everyone spooked. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:13:50
Yes. There will come a day when Bitcoin will no longer need to be quoted in dollars, or any other fiat currency for that matter.

You don't have to be Libertarian to champion Bitcoin. I'm certainly not, I just recognize that Central Bankers of the world still subscribe to flawed economic theory. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:11:05
Bitcoin will be universal soon enough, so indefinitely. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:03:29
People used to say the same thing about Alan Greenspan. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:28:06
A Brexit could potentially be very beneficial to Bitcoin, and potentially very destructive to the world economy. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:26:45
At this point it will take more than just a bump in the price for Bitcoin to make headline news. It has to be significant.

"New" and "safe haven asset" aren't normally in the same sentence as one another. 
It will take some adjusting for most investors.

Torrential rain may suppress voter turnout. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 20:56:08
Even still, the more press Bitcoin gets as a safe haven asset the better.

The Australian government is having a big auction of confiscated Bitcoin next week. There might be a slight pull back. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:28:05
The Australian government auction has got to be having a big impact. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:29:41
If Bitcoin goes up, while other bubbles are deflating, I'm not sure you can call it a bubble. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:44:15
In the larger scheme of things, chart analysis of Bitcoin will tell you nothing. 
Bitcoin still has an 'unknown' factor that cannot be accounted for in technical analysis.

Charlotte is where Bank of America calls home.

Oh I don't need convincing. Just the idea of private blockchains are enough to give me pause, although I do own a little ether. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:04:10
Isn't the massive selling from the Australian government auction?
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:23:20
Hey if you really think buying into the stock market at all time highs is a wise decision, then absolutely you should sell all your Bitcoin and buy stock.
How does the saying go? Buy high and sell low? Err something like that, right? 
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:37:10
The fact that markets are up is exactly the point. The higher the market, the lower expected returns. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:49:17
Do I really need to explain the difference between stock markets and Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:20:21


Even from a strictly technical perspective, that isn't even remotely close to being true. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:57:00


Theres your first mistake. You're completely ignorant of the current market environment. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:02:15
If you at all follow financial markets and central bank policies you would realize that investors are currently starved of any kind of yield on virtually all kinds of investment vehicles, whether it be stocks, bonds, ect. For instance, investors are literally buying negative yielding bongs, in other words they're buying bonds with a guaranteed loss in a desperate move as they feel they don't have any alternative.
This low interest rate environment that we are in has pushed asset values to extremes. It is only a matter of time before investors turn to Bitcoin as a preservation of capital, or even for anticipated future returns. And that adoption from the investing community is not far off at all. I expect it won't happen gradually either, but instead in a tsunami.
@_date: 2016-10-04 18:49:10
Its only a matter of time before a seismic shift in capital toward Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:30:06
Does the price of the artwork halve as well?
@_date: 2016-07-13 22:26:26
Personally I'm very encouraged by the price stability since the halving. There's very solid support around 650-660. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:14:20
If such a claim had any kind of validity to it, then yes it would be headline news the world over. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 03:36:14
Inflation refers to the supply of money. Increasing the supply of money lowers the value, so its devalued. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:58:17
Just another Libertarian shitting a cow over irrelevant government actions. Nothing to see here.
