Yeah coinbase is okay for the purchase, once you have it you should look into either a paper wallet or a hardware wallet if you plan to hold or you plan to have it for an extended period of time

I watched videos and read articles and viewed white papers for 40+ hours in this to get where I am in understanding you will need to do the same to whatever extent you want to actually know what is going on...

Sign up for grad and coinbase they are linked, direct deposits to gdax take about 3 days (you get the price at the time of purchase not the price 3 days later) and there is zero fee. If you want the coin NOW to trade with you can buy on coinbase with a credit card but there are some fees involved.

Do you have an iPhone? If so go to builds.io it is 10 bucks a year per device and there are several apps you can get that you can't get on the App Store. It gives you Spotify premium for free, YouTube red for free, and upgraded versions of a few social apps. I love it.

Oh look a non automated response. How about you try doing this with my support ticket that has been open for 3 days.

I actually like five minutes ago received confirmation, took a weird amount of time for something as simple as an email, sorry to hear you are running into weird issues too ��

Long term a hardware wallet is worth it if you intend on using BTC long term

A paper wallet is the safest way until you receive the hardware wallet you should order if you have enough money to warrant it. Also I would suggest reading up on bitcoin , if you don't understand this you could probably use some study time. Not trying to be rude at all just important to be knowledgeable about your investments

I have in fact emailed your support team who then passed me off to another company who handles your bitcoin purchasing. This company is "Glidera" and they have not responded to me once since my case was opened and I have had to email them directly in order to even get an automated response.  I have yet to receive anything from them at all other than a notification that a support ticket was opened.
Whether it is technically Breadwallet or not that is sending me this bitcoin is not my problem... you should be judged on the quality of the service you offer. 
If I were planning on trading this Bitcoin you would have already costed me 5% gains which is sickening... and I am sure you have no intentions of giving me 4.8% extra Bitcoin.

New guy here - bought at 2k and ill be spending it on space soda someday!

DO NOT BUY BITCOIN ON BREADWALLET.
It has been 9 days since I made my purchase through the app and have been begging for a response from their support for about 3 days now with no valuable information or reasoning for the delay.  
I have made purchases on Coinbase twice in the same time frame and have had both transactions safely stored on my Trezor for about 5 days already.  
It may serve your purpose for a wallet, but even then a hardware wallet is meant to be more secure as far as I am aware.
(Edit: there -&gt; their)

I'll leave an update here if no one else knows at the very least :)

I did in fact pay for expedited deliver, should have mentioned that, thanks for catching me on that!
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:42:25
Thank you for your assistance in comforting me haha success!

You are missing the point. I trade on Bitfinex as do many others. In order to trade on Bitfinex you must purchase BTC elsewhere and transfer it to the exchange. 
The fact is that the BTC I purchased on Coinbase was in my wallet in less than half the time than it has currently been for Breadwallet.  Those coins have been sent to my Bitfinex account and traded multiple times and I now have 4.8% more BTC/USD than I will receive from Breadwallet.
You telling me I should buy coins on an exchange if I want to trade is ridiculous, what I do with my coins after purchasing them from you is not your choice.  
Your job is to do what is promised, if your app had a disclaimer that it would be 10-14 days before seeing any of the bitcoin I certainly would not have used it in the first place and honestly I think many others would feel the same.
