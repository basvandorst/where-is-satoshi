Yeah but when it starts burning the beef and electrocutes anyone who uses it would you still exclaim it's the best slow cooker ever and would replace every other slow cooker in existence?

What would such a hypothetical billboard say?

Pretty sure crypto*currency* wasn't intended as a store of value either. Goalposts had to be moved once people realised no vendor would accept their coins. 'Store of value' is what they're clinging to even as the price decimates.

You know what. You should go door-to-door espousing the benefits of  Bitcoin. Wear a nice white shirt and black tie so you look respectable. Have a name tag so you're less threatening. Go with a similarly dressed partner who can back up your claims.

Cold storage and all that jazz is well and good until the owner dies suddenly in India.

Forget the bitcoin I want me some of that $1 beer and ramen

Jeff Bezos is worth $150 billion and you eat instant ramen straight out of the packet.
How are those things related?

"Bitcoin's valuable because keeps an immutable record of its own transactions!"
"But what if nobody wants to trade with it?"
"Uhh..."

How many different fire stations can a market bear? What innovation and efficiency is there to firefighting? How can it get any cheaper than hoses and ladders? Drones and robots can do it all?


And what's the difference between insurance and paying for it through taxes? With insurance you're paying for a layer of middlemen. How is that more efficient?

How would it bring down the price of the fire service if paying for it was voluntary? Where's their funding gonna come from?
It'll be cheaper to let your place burn to the ground if you had to pay per service

I saw it the other day. Highly recommended.
Some major points:
- Mt Gox had a 80k btc shortfall when he took over. At the time, it wasn't a huge sum to worry about
- He had his own trading bot working, presumably to slowly make up the shortfall
- He made blind transfers (ie, he didn't know the amounts) from the hot wallet to the cold wallet. He did so the btc shortfall would not be noticed. The massive theft of btc were presumably taken by hackers gradually over 2 years from the hot wallets before the transfers.

They stopped fulfilling orders long ago, but are still trying to take in money thru their website. In theory, credit card orders should've still been processed.
The only advantage btc would have in this is you needn't bother going to the trouble of trying to get a chargeback.
