It depends what kind of financial institution we're talking about. In a proper brokerage firm, client accounts can only be used for trading and they remain the client's property. There might of course be cases where the firm dipped into client accounts, but this would be highly illegal and punishable in its own right, even without a bankruptcy.
In the case of banks, the FDIC has you covered anyway.

If this was a proper financial services company, client accounts would be untouchable by creditors - the accounts would remain the clients' property. But if you've just given money, ETH, ETC to the company - mingled with company assets (or personal bank account in the case of MtG:Ox) - then you'll have to share what's left after the IRS, the employee salary claimants, and the first priority bank loans have gotten their money back - and in that order, depending on jurisdiction. You'll be about on equal standing with the power company, their uplink provider, and other suppliers with unpaid bills.

Two points here:

2: I primarily know Glenn Greenwald for making sock puppet comments in his own support on blogs, so for me at least using him as a source is a bit ironic. (I know it's a bit ad hominem, but still..)

It's the difference between link security and end-to-end security. Typically, your email client will talk to the email server using SSL or TLS - and email servers might talk to each other using SSL or TLS as well. But that only protects against eavesdropping on the network - your email is still stored as plain text on the server.
Also, not all email links actually use SSL. Even some of those who do might be using self-signed keys. These days it's typical that an email passes through more than one email server on the way.
So example vulnerabilites:
1: One of the email links your email goes through is unencrypted, due for example to a misconfiguration of your email client, a too permissive configuration of an email server, etc. and gets eavesdropped.
2: Somebody hacks your webmail or email account and reads your mail.
3: Due to a vulnerability, a hacker has gained read access to a file system on the mail server.
4: A computer on your LAN - for example a media server somebody forgot about, or your router - is actually a botnet bot, and executes a man-in-the-middle attack on your email. Nobody has noticed because the mail keeps working perfectly, it just all goes through the compromised computer.
5: A discarded harddrive from your ISP is found in the trash; it wasn't wiped so it contained a year old bitcoin private key from a server backup and thanks to the filename it was easy for the dumpster diver to find it when searching through the drive.
In contrast, a PGP-encrypted email is encrypted end-to-end. Then it doesn't matter that the some of the links might be unencrypted or that the email is stored on a unencrypted storage - since it isn't unencrypted until the final recipient uses PGP to read it.

Not quite accurate - member states can institute "internal borders checks", but these have to be limited in time and place. For example,  a specific terrorism threat, a specific international summit or sports event, for example, might be a good cause for temporary border checks inside the Schengen area. There is a legal mechanism for it, and it has to be notified to the other member states, but for that limited time everyone can be legally stopped and checked.

In that quote, the "insurance company" takes the place of a government, and every china shop would need a sort of armed passport control at the door to protect against the completely uninsured, or those who have taken insurance with a company that extends coverage to clients who steal, rape and break stuff, or companies that are delinquent on their promises.
Roads would also need the same kind of passport control when entering them, or perhaps you could institute some sort of technology based system which rerouted you far clear of uninsured drivers, or perhaps the roads could be patrolled by drones which shoots uninsured drivers on sight.
The inefficiencies involved in this libertarian utopia would, I think, in time cause each insurance company - or conglomerate of companies - to control specific areas of land and protect them with military and police forces, and not allow to the uninsured or to members of insurance companies that they don't trust. They would also need a body of "laws" or insurance terms that everyone in their territory would follow. Congratulations, you have a national state.

You seem to be conflating the present algorithm of Bitcoin with Bitcoin as a currency/commodity or P2P-system. 


Depends what you mean by "works". 
Bitcoin can fail without anything being wrong with the math. On the other hand when something wrong is found with the math or algorithms, that can be solved by work-arounds or updates/forks to the protocol.
You're arguing a bit like somebody who loves Wikipedia, but is totally against any change to its rules and policies because they're "perfect" and "governments can't stop it", "exists in the cloud", "has no country", when in reality Wikipedia rules and articles are in a constant state of change, they have to respect laws on copyright and defamation, and it's hosted on very real computers that technicians need to service and repair.
Bitcoin is supposed to be an experiment for improving the world - not a holy artefact.


Except when the person in question used a brainwallet or some other private key with insufficient randomness. This has already happened many times. 
Also, a crucial point: Hitting an in-use private key is actually not impossible because of math alone. Given infinite time or a different type of computer, it is in fact a certainty that every private key would be compromised. It's due to the fact that our Sun has a limited amount of power, and because of limitations in semiconductor technology, that there is a calculation which shows how the private keys are practically unbreakable. Practically. Not mathematically.
The same crypto that protects Bitcoin public keys also protects our regular money transactions and connection to HTTPS websites, so I guess you could say that USD and HTTPS are also "backed by math". Every altcoin is also backed by math. 
What this has to do with enforcing laws, I still don't understand your point about. Since humans are non-serializable objects, how would your mathematical system force us to do anything? Bitcoin can not force us to do stuff, but we can force Bitcoin to change by agreeing to update the source. In a way it's our "laws" for the system that get expressed as code and math - it doesn't affect us except as users of the system. (Not that this effect is insignificant, of course, humans are affected positively or negatively by computer systems as any computer science student should know.)


You can't make an equation that bans government intervention either - unless that equation is backed up by a robot army. A government can regulate human behavior - hopefully the regulation is limited by laws and constitutional rights and human rights. 
The government can't stop you from doing some math in your head that says you're the richest man in the world, but it can pretty easily stop Bitcoin from working. Just by way of example, if Bitcoin traffic on just the transoceanic internet links was dropped, you'd have an unreconcilable net-split which might plauge Bitcoin. Or it could outlaw all businesses or taxpayers to have anything to do with it, which would leave Bitcoin for a daring underground.


"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows." - George Orwell
Funny thing with something like Bitcoin though. You could just push a code update that says 1+1=3, and it would be "true" in the system. The rest of us who know that 1+1=2 would just refuse to go along with it. Both systems would be "mathematically perfect and consistent", but one of them would just be bonkers.

Oh, in that case yeah we all have to follow our local laws and regulations, and the blockchain grows according to the Bitcoin spec.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:02:37


It's very hard to spend other people's bitcoin through brute-forcing their private keys. It is, however, astronomically easier to double-spend, selfish-mine, hack or scam your way to the same result as of printing your own "super dollars". 
Breaking SHA or even Bitcoin wasn't what I was talking about though. I was talking more about how you're going to force people, or convince people, to live by your mathematically encoded rules. They can just refuse to pay attention to it. Or if they want cryptocurrency, they can create their own fork or altcoin.
There is actually some interesting work being done with mathematically enforced bets and contracts in a blockchain-like environment. Such systems can enforce some types of contracts, but they still require the parties to opt in to the system. Also it's somewhat limited in the types of contracts it can enforce - it might be successfully be used to hold a formally defined bet in escrow and pay out a reward, but it would be pretty hard to use it to enforce general regulations for a society unless the system was all-knowing and had a robot army.


Not if it's binary, then 1+1=10. ;-)
OK, so 1+1=2 in the decimal system is universally true whatever someone says. How will you serialize human beings into collections of numbers?

I guess you could split FDIC into several competing companies, but they would all require their clients (the banks) to follow basically the same kinds of rules and regulations, and the state would still require that banks have this insurance.

That quote makes being insured the only way to be subject to laws, so insurance coverages does take the place of citizenship. A non-insured/self-insured individual would literally be lawless under that regime, for better and worse. This is actually worse than the current situation, since stateless people under many national laws still have protection from abuse etc.
But you bring up an important point - not only would the china shop need to check my insurance status before allowing me entry - I would need to check the china shop's (or its owners') insurance status to make sure that I would not be raped and eaten when I enter the shop.


This Mad Max future would be rather inefficient. Forget waiting two hours in a checkpoint when going from the Palestinian territories into Israel to work, now there would be armed checkpoints at every property and potentially on every road intersection in Nowhere, Nebraska. 
To avoid these inefficiencies, insurance companies would likely form agreements with each other where they would harmonize their "laws" and allow their clients to co-exist on their territories. Rather than having a checkpoint at every door and intersection, there would only be checkpoints between territories of insurance conglomerates that don't agree completely about what laws should apply. This would be national borders.
Without such conglomerates and "nation state" collections, we'd have a sort state of feudal civil war era.


They would likely need additional agrements with security forces which could repel company and brigade-sized elements who tried to take over the mall, steal everything and rape and eat the workers and customers - this would be the police and military.


Various conglomerates could have different immigration rules, but all would probably refuse acess to uninsured/lawless people. The exception would be "Hunger Games" style territories which might allow the lawless to kill each other off for entertainment.


They would need to cooperate as well. Hopefully the competition would not turn into armed conflict too often.


They might also just get invaded. Armed people who don't subscribe to the insurance terms of the territory just move in and take over.

As you say people don't want to live in a Hunger Games/Mad Max land of chaos and violence. My post was about how, if we actually lived in a "Terra Nullus" with a reality described by that Robert Murphy quote, it would quickly lead to a consolidation into de facto nation states because of market forces and because people want some safety and predictability in their lives. We might call them "insurance union territories" but they'd really be nation states.
Experimenting with opt-in legal systems is something that probably won't happen on Earth. No country would allow it within their borders, many countries have laws that apply to their citizens' crimes abroad, and the few people who would thrive in that environment probably are either thriving in our current system or are currently in prison.


So basically, national borders or gated communities. Or putting the violent people in a designated area outside society - prison or exile.

Prior art is a patent term, which would invalidate a patent - the point of a patent is to get new inventions published instead of kept secret, so if the invention was already known the patent is invalid. 
If you were originally using a trademark before another company then you are the "senior user" of that trademark with "first use in commerce". Note that just coining the phrase or using it in conversation or print doesn't make you the owner of the trademark - it's the first use to promote a product or service which counts, as well as its continued use. I'm sure somebody has written about a "Tesla motor" before, but that doesn't invalidate the Tesla trademark for vehicles.
When it comes to logos or longer catchphrases, a trademark would also be covered by copyright - but I doubt that the words "Internet of Money" rises above the threshold of being a copyrighted work in its own right.


Others are prevented from using it in a way which would confuse the customers of similar categories of products and services, so that the consumer might think that the other company has anything to do with your company.


Trademark protection doesn't from the outset ban "incorrect meanings" of trademark beyond who is using it. I guess, though, that you could write licensing terms for a trademark which stipulates that anyone can use the trademark as long as they uses it to mean what you define it to mean. For example, the "Compact Disc" trademark (words and logo) was allowed by its owner to be used on any equipment or optical medium which complied with the CD standard - excluding some copy protected CDs.

Slashdot's way of having meta-moderation (scoring people's ability to moderate) as well as having the up- and down-votes have meaning (like "funny", "interesting", "informative") is a good combination in my view.

Back in the earliest days of illegal hacking and spam, they actually charged the miscreant with the theft of a few satoshis worth of electricity caused by logging in without permission - mostly because that was the easiest legal precedent to point to if there were no other goods or services stolen in the same event.
It was of course irrelevant to the case that the criminal had paid their phone company for their dialup access, just like in your example. 
Of course, Coinwallet pays for their services here - from the network connection to the processing of transactions. Nobody is getting DDoSed by Coinwallet.
Your standing is not that of a service provider being DDoSed, but more akin to a telephone subscriber who can't get a dial tone because the local branch is over-utilized by your neighbors.

In the early days of computer break-ins, they were struggling to find something to charge people with if they hadn't stolen any goods or services as part of their unauthorized access. The solution - until better legislation and precedent formed - was to charge them with theft of electricity. Like a few cents of it wasted for spinning up a harddrive.
Do you think we could get Coinwallet charged with electricity theft? Even if they're paying for it, you could argue that if a large enough percentage of miners are stealing theirs - they are vicariously liable or accomplices in a crime? You'd have to find a utility company or landlord who'd be willing to press criminal charges and/or sue based on that theory - and worse, you'd drag down miners with you.
If you want to keep examples uncontrived and confined to TCP/IP traffic, arguing that Coinwallet is breaking the law here would be like me saying that CNN is liable *to me* for the Scientology website exceeding its bandwidth after breaking the Tom Cruise video and *paying Scientology for both the video and the privilege of linking to Scientology.org*. In reality they didn't pay for it, of course, because this idea of Coinwallet breaking the law is more contrived than any of the previous examples.
Or for another example, consider a sort of call-in music show on TV where you can vote for the next song by SMS (costing a few satoshis). If Linkin Park makes people request their newest single en masse, delaying your Kanye West song until 5 am, is Linkin Park doing anything illegal? Even if the TV station lets the Linkin Park song play again and again for hours while raking in the money?

Plenty of forum software has threaded replies and can switch between threaded and flat viewing. I remember reading and moderating forums 15 years ago and it was available already. I think even Dejanews - the Usenet web interace which became Google Groups - had it.

If the maturity on the short had been infinity, you would be right - but a short contract will eventually mature. And as the saying goes, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Excuse me but how do you know that it doesn't go directly to COB RTC's personal use? His Diminutiveness is so far down on the scale of existence right now, that I wouldn't put it past him to risk bad PR to the Completely Bona-Fide **Religion** of Scientology Which is Definitely **Not a Cult**, to collect some money by this route.
