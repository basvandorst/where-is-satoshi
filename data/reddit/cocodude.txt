Don't be ridiculous and spout your anti-EU nonsense here.
HMRC were engaging with the EU when they had these discussions. It's not guaranteed that the EU will cooperate, but there is open dialogue so it's a distinct possibility.

I think Gary's right. Essentially this could come under CGT so the value is released upon disposal (i.e. conversion to fiat). HMRC decided no special rules were needed when it came to CGT for cryptos.

HMRC did say that it is "very likely" that Bitcoins would be classified as a single use face value voucher. This certainly counted as guidance to me, so it's not really silly for people to have gotten concerned about the associated voucher VAT treatment.

Most people on Bittylicious trade manually. The automated stuff is for people that want to do this. Of course sellers run this client on their own computer and it's totally optional.
Jeez, this is FUD and a half.

I was at the meeting. This is the one point HMRC are still discussing as if you're mining on a small scale, having equipment losses considered under CGT (as opposed to simply being able to offset "income") makes life quite difficult. It's best to just wait for the official statement on this one.

I recommend everyone with anything to say about how the UK government is stifling businesses to submit their response to the link Tom gave. I have also heard positive noises from the Cabinet Office (as in they are actively trying to find issues like this stopping new businesses).

You can buy 1 BTC if you register, but yes, this will certainly increase. We'll be putting in phone verification and ID verification soon and this'll mean that we can increase the limits substantially.

I can assure you that these comments weren't from me (or anyone else representing Bittylicious). I have no reason to believe they're not legit.

Or maybe just compare a variety of markets before saying one is really expensive? Yesterday, Bittylicious spent a lot of its day cheaper than Localbitcoins.

It's not a marketplace. BitBargain is an awesome marketplace if that's what you want. Bittylicious is designed for users that want a Bitcoin or two with minimal fuss, so no choosing a seller etc.
