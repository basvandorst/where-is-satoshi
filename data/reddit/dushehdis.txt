I have no problem with the name bitcoin cash but everyone freaking out over the term bcash openly wants to start calling bitcoin cash, bitcoin.  To prevent confusion from two things having the same name it’s easier for people using bitcoin to call bitcoin cash, bcash. You can’t police what other people call things or use anyway. Companies often lose control of their names through generocide. Bcash supporters are the ones policing other people’s language. I have no problem with you calling bcash bitcoin cash but I’ll call it bcash.

It's sort of interesting but isn't his claim to fame (in addition to founding the pirate party) putting all his money and borrowing money to buy bitcoin?

By far the biggest reason people don't run nodes is because there is no incentive for them to run one. It has nothing to do with block size. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:38:28
Peter Todd has said if he was redesigning bitcoin today he would have the block reward never go away I believe. It's a valid concern regardless of who says it and I'm not saying either Peter is actually pushing for this but if the network is only funded by transaction fees that means someone with 1,000,000 in bitcoin just cold storing it like gold in a safe is contributing 0 to the security of the system that protects her funds.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:24:28
Agree, and besides this isn't the easily sybil attacked method of counting nodes right? So we have to see if the "economic majority" of regulated banks run this right? What does it matter if people run this at home? What really matter is what the bitlicense holding companies do.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:13:38
I agree. It would be far better to do nothing that a user activated soft fork which is dangerous, reckless, short sighted and stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:14:48
It's a small thing to turn the node on and sync it but the problem is you are going to turn it off after the transaction and most people aren't making constant transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:19:47
Well I've been asking big blockers whether they want SW assuming they also get unlimited and some are actually opposed to that. I'm not concerned with as broad an adoption as possible because I think in the long run the universe wants one money and we will end up with a dominant version. But for now I think it should be up to them to have the alt coin they want be that with SW or not. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:03:37
If the only opposition is bitmain dependent miners and vocal people on Twitter and Reddit just hard fork  and let them do their own thing. I don't think we want to be deciding what's economically important or not. Obviously grey market participants or people in regimes that require them to be unbanked aren't getting a vote here. I'm sure there are lots of things that the "economic majority" as defined as bitcoin banks might want that run counter to the real use cases of bitcoin as a settlement layer.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:32:41
There's nothing In there that isn't obvious and nothing in there as terrifying as attempting to drag people along in a contentious user activated soft fork.

Ok well my point stands you're either seeing brigades that don't exist, or it's a brigade by a group other than r btc or it's being used for reasons I don't understand. Rbtc only seems to care about block size and nothing else.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:37:45
This thread in particular doesn't seem to touch on any issue that the rbtc people are always crowing about. This is about price volatility and people being overly optimistic. When you originally said "opposition sub" in this context I thought you meant r buttcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:12:52
Well here's the thing. Those incentives exist when you're making regular transactions. Most people are 99% holding and not making daily transactions. You can easily turn a node on after a few months leaving it off and make a transaction then turn it off, I do this myself sometimes. This is especially going to be true with a small block size. I'm not sure whether 2mb-5mb wouldn't increase the number of nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:55:30
ETC existing is not a bad thing. People act as if there are no alt coins. Bitcoin could split 100 times and in 20 years the most secure and most popular one will still have 90% of the market in my opinion. What are people so afraid of with a fork? Is ETC more of a threat to you than Dogecoin? Free choice is what it's all about, if you think bitcoin unlimited is bad let them go their own way rather that debate just let the coins compete.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:38:29
If you want to compare coin price I think an ETH vs ETC split is probably cleaner. This path might have unintended consequences.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:25:04
And it's a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:08:12
Why not just hardfork to SW and small blocks. Clearly there would be market demand for this coin and clearly someone would mine it. And the big block and small block bitcoin can compete in the market. If there is a security risk with big blocks or market risk with small blocks we can find out over time without debating it. Alt coins already exist and ETC exists so what is the problem? If it's going to happen better sooner than later.

Jstolfi the bitcoin troll is responsible for pushing this misconception.

You'd have to believe that the overwhelming majority of the most committed bitcoin users you interact with in any forum are what? Fake accounts? Robots? I see barely any people supporting 2x who aren't either CEOs or truly bitcoin cash supporters hoping to undermine btc. The benefits at this point of adding replay protection seem to far outweigh the costs, including that it would be a show of good faith. However, if it's true that 2x will maliciously spoof core nodes the ship has sailed on good faith as well. Any comments on the plan to spoof core nodes?

You’re making my point about the price, it doesn’t matter for how long it lasts or how high it goes you still won’t be wrong, in your own mind. Bitcoin could reach 1,000,000 and that wouldn’t change your opinion in the slightest, right?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:45:00
I'd never advise someone to buy now with the current volatility. At the same time people do panic when the price starts to fall and panic-sell causing the price drop to accelerate. This would happen with any commodity but if you believe in that commodity long term it is irrational. What do you care if someone who barely knows anything about it thinks it's a ponzi or scam? It isn't and if people aren't informed enough to realize that why are you worried they aren't buying?

Volatility is an inevitable consequence of so few people having it. It tells you zero about bitcoin's viability as a currency. If you created a hypothetical currency with the perfect properties to be money the price would still be volatile as the world slowly realized this.
