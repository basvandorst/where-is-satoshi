holy shit. this isn't a crash. Every time BTC rallies, it dumps. Why is this post getting upboats? Next peak will be around 50k. Look at the history EVERY TIME BTC goes up, it drops. Pump/dump and then HODL keeps the value up. It's the same pattern it's always been. Yet someone literally posted the Suicide Hotline number today.

It seems to me that Coinbase is a great place to get BTC. and that's it. When I go to Mexico, I head to a local bank and convert my USD to Pesos. You know what I don't do? Open an account and keep money there. I don't get a Mexican debit card and I don't write checks from the Mexican bank account that I don't have.
Now, to comply with the law, Coinbase requires me to open an account to do the foreign exchange, but that's it. From there I send my BTC out of my Coinbase account (because that what any online wallet is, an account.) If I need to do something untraceable with said BTC, I just buy some DOGE and maybe convert is to another coin before I reconvert to BTC. Sometimes I end up with more BTC than I started with, but I digress.
What I NEVER DO IS SPEND COINS FROM MY COINBASE ACCOUNT. 
Why is this so hard to understand that we need yet another post about it?

There's plenty of ways to make money off of BTC without including the blockchain, but there is no way to create BTC out of thin air. Once a bank creates money, it's there for good. Derivatives are not the same thing, so please don't try to muddy the waters.

You're still not understanding. When a bank - central or otherwise - creates money, it is adding to the actual amount of money in circulation. It is fungible. It is "real" money. This is impossible to do with BTC. There is a specific amount of BTC in the world, and there is a ledger that tracks all of it. These are not the same things.

I was using cryptsy as my multipool coin exchange. I just converted everything to doge and withdrew that to get it out. Easy to convert back elsewhere. Apparently so far only BTC and LTC are effected.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:52:54
That's not my experience. Doge is pretty solidly close to 40 satoshi wherever you go for the last six months or so. Obviously when you're that low in price your mileage will vary by the hour, and even a single sat will have a relatively large effect on cost, but you can always trade in LTC to mitigate.

I buy goods with my cc all the time, as do most people. A wise ass remark doesn't explain to me how bitcoin is any different. I can prove using any communications we have and the block chain that you received bitcoins I sold you, so if I were a lawyered-up company, I could go to bat against your charge-backs. 
Not to mention, there's other ways to mitigate risk, like daily purchase limits and additional verification requirements.
So unless I'm missing something, I stand by what I said. Nobody has explained why there's any more risk of a charge back for BTC than there is for say, a tv that gets delivered by UPS and not signed for.
It's easy enough for a customer to deny receipt, and demand a refund from their cc company.

You're missing the point. Your broker doesn't care what you paid for each one, but the government absolutely does. You have to pay capital gains taxes on the _gains,_ not the sell price. In other words, you're responsible to report the profit made on the sell price over the purchase price of that particular share.
With bitcoin, the government doesn't even need you to report it because they can go right to the block chain and see for themselves.

It makes perfect sense. Bitcoin is an investment vehicle for most people involved in it, and the majority of people in the world still have no idea what it is. Of those who do, only a small minority have any interest in it. Of those who do, only a small minority actually look into getting it. Of those who do, only a small minority actually ever buy BTC. Of those who do, only a small minority ever spend it.
Sure the transaction volume is growing, but it's mostly people buying and selling BTC. Supply and demand are only tangentially related to the news you're talking about

The whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they can't be shut down. Reduce the supply, and the value goes up. Once the dust clears and the true amount of lost BTC comes out, the market will adjust and the value will increase. Come on people, this is economics 101.
*edit the funny thing to me, is that "economists" were saying how the deflationary nature of BTC would be its downfall. Now that there's a potential loss of supply, these same people are are crying fowl instead of deflating the currency.

Maybe I didn't think through, what I really mean is buying with a _debit_ card. Obviously credit cards are a whole other risk level; I simply meant buying with a credit card _number._
I understand the arguments, but if I sign an agreement with a vendor, and I give them my personal information, and they have a record of the bitcoin address that I'm asking them to send to as well as my personal real-world billing address that any other vendor would require, they would have all the proof they need that I received their BTC and come after me.  The blockchain itself proves which address received the coins, and my requesting those coins go to that address is a contract that's being fulfilled.

That can't be right. A person in the business of mining is no different than a person in the business of gardening. The fruits and veg are the product, and until you sell them, the are your property. You pay gains taxes on the sell price, not what they were worth when you dug them up.

Technically, bank deposits have been considered bank property for a long time. You have no right to your deposits, the bank can do whatever it pleases with it.

Why is it that every time I bring up the idea that bankers have the resources to create a competitor to Bitcoin, my posts get downvoted yet nobody will actually address my concerns? What I've been trying to say is that if Chase, Citi and Goldman got together to create their own blockchain based money, and allowed any bank to get in on the mining, the general public would only see an "officially sanctioned bitcoin." Have you guys forgotten that one of the biggest hurdles we've been up against in the last 2 years is that people think bitcoin is a criminal's money? 
The BlockChain™ doesn't exist. Blockchain is an open technology. And I love when people try to drag out premining, as if Satoshi Nakamoto doesn't own millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (i.e., defacto premine.)
I have yet to hear any of you successfully argue why multinationals couln't partner with governments and create their own Official Blockchain Based Currency, thereby turning BTC into some first generation, obsolete commodity. I'm not asking anyone to agree, but stop downvoting and start explaining.
KillMarcusReed, you say "they will have already failed because they will have tried to centralize the ledger" which is the biggest argument I keep hearing. All they have to do is make sure no single bank owns more than 50% of the mining power, and they do the same job as your average mining pool, yet they get the rewards. They can claim it's not centralized, because multiple banks are creating a decentralized network. Let's be honest here- bitcoin mining is pretty fucking centralized now, and nobody cares as long as we don't get too close to the 51% problem. 
This is the last time I'm going to make this argument. I'm just going to /save this post for 'told you so.' There is no way BTC can ever be accepted by governments and multinationals with so many BTC out of play to begin with. At the very least they'll remake bitcoin in their image, just to make sure they know where every penny goes.
*edit: for clarity, I'm trying to say that there is nothing keeping governments and their central banks from creating their own bitcoin clone, making it legal by fiat, and controlling all mining and coin generation, the same way they control currency creation now. Governments could decide who gets money by mandating which country provides hash rate.

I would agree, however if the nations' central banks decide to, they have the resources to make their own block chain and turn their vaults into consolidated mining farms. It'll still be "decentralized" because each central bank will have its own server farm, but they will be the only ones allowed to mine, and back in control of the creation of wealth.

Wrong. Assuming staying with Ghash is the current strategy, changing his strategy will reduce his profitability unless everyone else changes  their strategy as well. The only way leaving Ghash becomes a good change is if the group does it at the same time. It's a classic Nash equilibrium.

PROTIP for Americans until and unless things get better: If you're on the way to make a Craigslist purchase, bring a printed copy of the ad and  any correspondence just in case you get pulled over. Cops are money hungry and looking for ways to take you out, but most of them are believers in their cause. If they have a sufficient belief that you're not involved in drugs, they probably won't take your money.

The masses don't care if it's centralized or not. It's about the blockchain. The blockchain is the disruptive technology.

No it isn't. Until the coins are all mined, it's still inflating. Regardless of whether it's a deflationary currency or not, your comment really don't have any relevance to the post. BTC rises in value or it doesn't. The reason behind that rise is irrelevant to the cartoon.
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:57:05
Just playing devil's advocate here, but I think you missed his whole point. He's saying that the core of Bitcoin, the blockchain, is the way of the future. but BTC as a currency is destined to failure. I'm not sure why Bitcoin fans can't see the forest for the trees in this regard. Big Money doesn't want to get into Bitcoin specifically, because they can't get enough control of it. A huge amount of Bitcoins are basically missing and could show up at any time and kill it. And this is from the beginning!
You guys love to laugh at premined altcoins, but think about how many coins were mined by N.S. and friends at the beginning that haven't moved. What happens if someone dumps them? 
His whole point is that while Nakamoto's concept is sound, its current implementation isn't. And seeing as Bitcoin is open source, and you could simply copy the code line for line and start a new blockchain tomorrow, it falls on the Bitcoin development team to win on the open market. It is NOT a foregone conclusion that BTC will reign supreme.

I think I follow. Let's say I wanted to place my vote. In order to get it into the blockchain, I would what... sign a small transaction with the additional data, and record the block for future reference?
That would require at least a minimal amount of BTC to be transferred, correct?

LOL and here I went through google translate already. So the idea is, I pay them, and they put the message on the blockchain. I could basically do the same thing by sending myself a small amount of BTC and attaching a message, right?
Forgive me if I'm being overly simple here, I'm trying to get a good handle on how it all works. I guess BTCChina-Forever just keeps track of all the traffic that goes through them, so they have a separate database the refers to the blockchain for verification?

I guess it was more a question of how it works than anything. I've seen a whole bunch of articles here about what's possible, but nobody really talks about how.

Yes, I suppose it is. I think the difference is that with PoS, you the only way you can generate more coins is to hoard them. That's not good for volume, because there's a inverse correlation between volume and currency creation, i.e., the more coins you have in circulation, the less coins you can generate for yourself. It _rewards_ hoarding.
In the case of Bitcoin, it's more of a psychological and predictive question: Will the price go up? Yes, but if everyone hoards the currency, it loses its liquidity and as a result its demand and value. Nobody wants to support a currency nobody uses. I imagine a much more gradual baseline value increase over the long term, but I think by the time that's an issue, there will be a replacement(s) to BTC and it'll just be another commodity that people own.

Obviously we aren't talking about collectables. We're talking about cryptocurrencies, which require liquidity and value. If a currency isn't being used as a currency, and has no intrinsic value, why would anyone want it?
There's a reason for the word scamcoin. There are dozens of altcoins, and they are worth shit because there is no liquidity, and boo reason to own them. I should go on and be more clear in my point but I'm on my phone.

How does CASH avoid money washing? Oh. It doesn't and it can't. 
The idea that Bitcoin should be held to some sort of higher standard is laughable. The idea that Bitcoin could ever be MORE anonymous than cash is ludicrous. People need to get their heads out of their asses. The only reason the powers that be keep talking about Bitcoin in connection to drugs and/or crime/terrorism is to keep people like you from using it. They can't control it, so they don't want you using it.
