Here's some arguments for why it's unlikely that a single company will become massive, and then turn evil, in a free market (i.e. no government-granted favors):

Isn't the tech industry a good counterexample to this argument?
People keep buying computers, even though computers experience ridiculous deflation of 100% every 18 months.
Why buy a movie ticket? Because you want to go have fun, rather than stay locked in your room entire life.

aristander probably meant "is *aggressive* violence required to organize society?"
Libertarians are all for defensive violence, a.k.a self defense. It's aggressive violence we have an issue with.

What is "IF GREATER" referring to? Is it referring to the $100, or the amount I've paid circle?
I personally interpreted this to mean Circle will give you all your money back, or give you $100 if that's more money than you had in your account.
**TL;DR** The wording is ambiguous to me; could be interpreted to mean Circle will refund all Bitcoins

Regulation is part of the reason MtGox is having problems. Getting sued by the US gov, getting accounts frozen, that's hard for any business to deal with.
Still, the market has learned MtGox is extremely risky, and the market is responding by moving to other exchanges. If it weren't for government regulation, we'd be seeing a million exchanges pop up, with fierce competition for customers.

You never really answered his question... instead, you made an ad hominem argument.
