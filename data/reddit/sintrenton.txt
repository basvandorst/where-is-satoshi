'and' doesn't count, hence no capital letter.

And of the words in the Czech dictionary, it just had to be "whore". ;)

They buy in bulk, get a discount you'd never get,  give you a lower price than if you booked and keep a margin for themselves.  Hotel happy,  customer happy,  this company happy. :-)

Heh, me too. I took the crash course. Scandinavian living/working down here, Czech/Slovakia/Austria.
Any punters wanting to learn how to curse people's head off in these languages, just holler.  ;)

Oops. Sorry about that, but yes, I would say it was the first. Another reminder not to post on Reddit after five mulled wine. ;)
BTW, dobra praca. :)

Sorry about the mix up.  :)
My regards to the bcoiners in Vancouver!

Not sure.  Right now there is one available in the hackerspace Progressbar in Bratislava, Slovakia. mojbitcoin.sk
Haven't tried it myself, but as a Scandinavian working down here, always looking for options. :)

A regular bank account:Owner of account usually open. Transactions private.
Bitcoins: Owner of account usually private. Transactions open.
Change IP and perhaps MAC addresses?

You sound so levelheaded you have to be Scandinavian. ;)
Oh, right, you mentioned taxes earlier.
An advisor is probably a very good thing. Nordic tax agencies have access to databases in a way people from other countries not always grasp.  
Share with friends and family and I'm sure you will the bitcoins to good use.

Took Werner and his team all of about a day and a half.
Update version1 to 1.4.16, peeps.
(and notice the version number in ascii armoured text, not a bug)

They are normal, quite smart and very techy. The ATM is located in Bratislava's (capital's) hackerspace. 
And being from N Europe, living in this country -- This ATM was active before the one in Helsinki. :)
