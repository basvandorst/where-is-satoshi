It was always said that the next currencies when the world economy collapses will be food, alcohol, and bullets. Perhaps Crypto could help us avoid that, but I'm not taking any chances, I'm keeping a healthy stock of all four.

Not the ONE thing, it was the straw that broke the camels back. I was already really skeptical, I doubted his real interests, his ability to lead and his ethics.

I own nearly equal values of BTC, ETC, and LTC, although my LTC shortly eclipsed the other. I have a few hundred in ALTs as well, but as coinbase explodes in popularity whatever makes it to GDAX has a better chance of being accepted.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:19:03
It's because LTC can do atomic swaps, I personally think that because of how Charlie is promoting LTC as a BTC companion, that they will provide some stability for each other. BTC being the longer term store of wealth and used to transfer large sums of value, and LTC for smaller purchases. Someone explained to me that LTC aims to be the $1 while BTC is the $100 bill, I think that's an interesting way to put it.

Just a thought. Apparently what caused the massive growth over Thanksgiving was the whole kids talking to family about Bitcoin thing. What does everyone think about a repeat of that over Christmas? Especially after the massive growth since Thanksgiving the kids could go “Hey I told you so!” Then even more people jump in.

More utility than a beanie baby, even though there are high fees right now, we have a lot to look forward to in the future, including the lightning network. The fact that I can go somewhere else in the world and exchange for their FIAT currency, or in the case of Japan and S. Korea, I can already just buy stuff at payment terminals. Always remain critical, it keeps the euphoria down, but there's so much more to crypto than just a quick cash grab.

It’s a good strategy. Called dollar cost averaging. Goes up, you buy a little, goes down, still buy a little. Over time it grows... a lot... and quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:24:02
All these guys who think they're going to short BTC futures are fools. They think that Bitcoin is a silicon valley thing, but Korea is exploding on BTC. US is 2nd in trading volume against Japan, at least to the limits of my knowledge, and with the massive premiums and how wealthy S. Korea is, they're going to shred the shorts. I have a family member who works at NFA which is also based out of Chicago and they're very interested to see what happens with CBOE and CMA. She gave me a wink and a nudge that they tend to follow the other agencies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:46
Well yeah, Coinbase said they'd be adding BCH in either December or January. I was expecting Jan 1 myself, but whatever. I got a little bit from the fork, so time to sell that garbage for more BTC while it's on sale.

Why is everyone buying Lambos with bitcoin. Buy land with Bitcoin if you're gonna pull out profits. If you own the land you own the land. It's not tied up in Fiat, it's not tied up in Crypto. You'll have a place to live, and when you have enough you'll be able to buy more land to rent to people. And when you rent it to people, regardless of what shit show goes down between fiat and crypto, people will pay you in the prevailing currency.

Do yourself a favor, continue to invest, and invest in bitcoin but also in yourself. Idk how much house you can afford, but buy less. Then look into rental properties, because people need a place to live, and regardless of what the future holds, you'll get paid, either in fiat or bitcoin.

I had this discussion and we probably need to come up with more "Friendly" names, we obviously have Satoshis, we can obviously call them Sats, and kinda sounds like cents to me, and the goal is to hit 1 cent per Sat, ($1m BTC) So then the other name we have are bits, for uBTC, but what do we call mBTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:38:30
I bought like 44 iota. If it’s anything like bitcoin I’ll hold that shit for 10 years.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:31
I hope this isn’t the crash. I bought another $1k at 16,000 but I’m just waiting for what happened in September when it tanked 30%. Will that happen now or later? Who knows. All I know is that I need more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:10:09
Got in at $2k, I had a solid plan to buy at regular intervals and hopefully get to one BTC. But the growth was 4x faster than I expected and I only have about .2 BTC...
Now I'm scared, not that I'll lose my money, but that this will destabilize the global fiat economy and that it will hurt my friends and family. We already know that Wall Street is in a speculative bubble. The same shit that caused 08 is happening again. 
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency isn't the bubble. Crypto is the pin.

If the transaction goes through successfully it's immediately available. I've played around with a couple high frequency buys and it's very quick. But you can always buy LTC directly from your LTC holdings, which means you only pay a takers fee once.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:36:12
Absolutely. I would be surprised if we saw LTC hit 10k the same way bitcoin did, but its performance has been steady.

And the tech bubble crash happened when everyone  at the big banks were saying “it’s a safe investment" once I see Cramer smashing the "Buy Buy Buy!"

I actually voted republican in the last election, but not for Trump. IMO neither candidate was qualified, but I am willing to concede that Hillary probably would have been a better president than Trump.

One of my best friends is disabled, and that's not something a president does, period.

That’s why I have most of my value in BTC. I have a little bit of ETH, Vitaliks vision of the internet was worth my buying at least a coin. I have a lot more LTC. I really get this vision that LTC is not only designed to be the silver to BTCs gold, but also has a synergistic effect boosting the stability of both.

Fuck the Lambo, if I was to buy a supercar, which I most certainly cannot afford, I'd buy a McLaren. Second Land is the single most important asset you can own. If you own land outright, no loans, as long as you own in a decent area, it doesnt matter if values go up or down because you don't have the worry of a bank seizing your home. The second most important part about owning land is that you can buy more and rent it to other people, no matter what people need a place to sleep. I'm hodling long term, once my account value is worth 250k which at this rate is in 2 years, I'll probably start liquidating a bit to buy more land.

This is exactly why we need to start discussing in terms of mBTC. Its only $16 to get in on mBTC. Or it’s $16 to get 60k Satoshis. If you tell someone that by 2020 a satoshi could be worth a penny, that’s palatable. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:23:00
If everyone in the U.S. bought $100 of BTC that would add 30B, and at a market cap of 230B, literally every one of them would have to sell to drop it by 13%
BTC does that almost every day in fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:48
Coinbase owns GDAX, in order to buy and sell BCH in the wallet, you need to have buyers on an exchange... So yeah, of course they were going to add to GDAX. I don't know why people are so surprised, aside from the addition being a little early. I just see this as a sale on BTC. I can't dump my BCH from the fork, I had a little BTC on coinbase at the time, but as soon as I can, see ya BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:26:07
When I first bought BTC I saw something that was neat and maybe I could make a little money on it. After a month I saw my money had doubled, so I put more money in, and decided to do more research. Then down the rabbit hole I went. It went from casual interest, to belief, to the tinfoil hat wearer that crypto might destroy the global financial system the way that UBER and Lyft obliterated taxis.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:01:30
Want to help people through the psychological barrier? Just say that a satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin and that it would be great if a satoshi was worth just a penny. Except of course that if a Satoshi was worth a penny, then a bitcoin would be worth $1m.

I dont want to be "That guy" but gold does have quite a bit of intrinsic value, it's used to manufacture circuit boards, makes a great conductor, and has excellent thermal properties. My personal hope is that when (I said when, not if) Bitcoin/crypto overtakes gold, the value of gold will tank making electronics more affordable, therefore making smart devices more accessible in 3rd world countries, making crypto more accessible.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:49:29

We still only need to be at $8500 by the end of the year to be on track for $1m by 2020, I'm still hodling, though I've been buying more LTC lately. I actually thought Charlie selling is good for it in the long term, and I do think that LTC is the REAL BCH, designed to be synergistic with BTC, not parasitic like BCH.

I'm from Chicago and have family who works for NFA (basically a competitor to CBOE and CME) These guys are not the high risk traders that we see on wallstreet, these guys are used to betting on corn, soy, and oil. Bitcoin might drop tomorrow, it might go up tomorrow, but if you're concerned about what happens tomorrow then you'll lose sight of the gains over the last 6 months, and how far we need to go.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:19:59
I bought about $500 a few weeks ago, and jumped out when I doubled my value. Knowing bitcoin it'll correct again, even if I lose out on more crazy gains, I still came out net positive like crazy. It'll correct eventually. I still have my hodling which is 100% of my mined coin, nearly worth $1200 now, not bad for a little over a year of mining...
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:52:34
There is a correlation found that when google searches for bitcoin drop, so does the currency. Aside from that I get alerts every 50 in price change, up or down. I noticed during the last 3 corrections that when it dropped more than $150 in a short period of time that, that would be when to sell. I take a small hit. But I took my measly $300 from june and I'm sitting at about $1200 of value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:03:26
Bought a litecoin at $45, couldn't hurt to hold. Even at $100, who knows. I do know supply for LTC is much much higher than BTCs 21m so don't ever expect it to catch up.
