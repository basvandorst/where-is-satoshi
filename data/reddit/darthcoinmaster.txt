You could create an offline segwit p2sh wallet and then import it into electrum by using the BIP39 import seed option in Electrum, with changing the derivation 44 with 49 (to have the segwit enabled).  
Enjoy your segwit wallet in electrum!
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:25:05
You can use offline this   
then you could import the BIP39 seed into electrum and choose derivation path 49. Done. You have a full segwit wallet into your electrum software

I am always laughing when I see a "new service" promoting fast withdrawals for BTC... that means you never **own** those BTC.  
what people should understand that when a "service" is offering a custodial service, that means **you are not using BTC**, you are using a promise, a fake, non-BTC currency.  
**¡STOP USING ANY CUSTODIAL SERVICE FOR BTC!**  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid any custodial of your money.

Now, he told me that every time a customer is presenting the fucking plastic cards, he refused them and say: "I would much appreciate if you would pay with Bitcoin/LN, these cards are not money, are just a promise of money". Some they pay with BTC some they go to the bank and withdraw cash.

It't nice but it's also a weak point: thug attack - "give me your watch or I will fuck your face"  
I prefer to have my BTC stored in a more "hidden" way, that nobody could imagine where I store my stash.  
I also always split my stash in 3 parts:  
- large amount in coinjoined (not traceable) wallets/addresses (steganography hidden seed)  
- medium amounts in desktop wallet apps like Electrum (with EPS) or Wasabi or Core  
- small amounts in many different mobile BTC/LN wallets, just enough to be able to live, buy stuff quickly. Also for these is recommendable to use plausible deniability feature if is available.
It's insane to wear your hundreds of BTC in a watch, even if you have backed up the seed. It's about the implications in case that watch is robbed or lost.

Bitcoin = Be your own bank  
Split your stashed staked sats in different levels.  
1. Onchain = your savings  
2. LN = your spending  
Split your coins in 3 main stages:  
1. hardware/metal/paper/memory wallets or whatever hard copy of your wallet seed = keep there the hard stash that you almost never touch  
2. Desktop wallets = keep there a medium stash, a buffer zone between your "safe" (No.1 wallet), the incomes (buying, earning etc) and your many different other wallets, where you CoinJoin them (Wasabi recommended) and then split your stash into 3 types: HODL, buffer, mobile/LN (spending).  
Here can enter also your nodes wallets (BTC node and LN nodes)  
3. Mobile/LN wallets = keep there only enough for you to cover your regular spending. Also split your stash into more LN wallets/channels.

If you listen that interview, he says "we will have own implementation of LN, in Python". That means only with that node implementation node your Electrum wallet can connect.  
What if I have a LND node and want to connect the Electrum LN wallet? Would not be possible.  
What if I have a C-LN node and I want to connect Zap wallet? I can't.  
All this "war of implementation" will bring us in more mess up and user confusion.  
I can't have for each wallet I use a special node implementation.  
I has to be a way to inter-connect any type of LN node with any type of LN wallet.  
When I use Bitcoin onchain, I do not care which wallet app I use, I just have my wallet seed and I can use it in any wallet that supports BIP39 seed. Why is not possible to have something like this also for LN?

There is no such thing of "best ultimate wallet".  
Each wallet have features and designs that are good for specific situations/usage.  
It's up to each user to choose and use the specific wallet for what is necessary.  
The only important thing that a user have to consider is this: a wallet that do not respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( is not a real Bitcoin wallet.  
Secondly a wallet that worth taking in consideration is one that:  
- supports segwit  
- already or will implement Lightning Network  
- export/save seed passphrase/private keys  
- **NO** KYC/email submit/phone verification  
- fee control  
- coin control  
- coinjoin feature  
All the rest of wallets that do not have any of these features, **ARE NOT CONSIDERED WALLETS**

This way of thinking, of taxing every time you buy with BTC is totally wrong and should not be promoted in any way. This is exactly what IRS wants to get into people's head.  
When you work and the employer have to pay you for your work, you are not going to an exchange and buy dollars with your worked hours. The employer pays you in dollars and when you get those dollars, your income is already taxed. It doesn't have to be taxed again when you used you money.

Because Bitcoin is the ultimate best type of cash money.

I am a Bitwage user from the beginning.  
I also use Bitwage as a bridge for those of my clients (freelancing) that do not have BTC to pay me.  
I have no issue with Bitwage in the last years. Works as fine as it is promoted: payer pays in fiat to a bank account, you receive BTC directly to your personal wallet (not custodial!) next day.  
Yes there is a fee and exchange rate, but I think it's fair and reasonable.  
One more thing: I always coinjoin all  my BTC income using Wasabi wallet from a "registered" service.  
I would recommend to all new comers to use Bitwage, it's a great service and would help new people to get into BTC easily.

**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](

If you still didn't use **BISQ** is time for you to take it in consideration. Seriously.  
**Decentralized** - it can't be shut down or goes offline  
**P2P** - no intermediary between trade parties  
**Escrow** - your money are always safe  
**Borderless** - exactly like Bitcoin it can be used anywhere in the world  
**Permissionless** - there is no restriction on use, no age, no borders, no KYC/AML  
Same wallet seed you use in Electrum can be used in electrum wallet.

Because people with the mentality of "I will start trading crypto to get rich" could not understand what is Bisq...  
What you see today with all these centralized exchanges, price manipulation, TAs etc is just a transition period. It all pass away in few years. Now is the boom, the accumulation time...  
Don't give a shit about volume, markecrap etc are all bullshit. What all that matter is: **do you have enough BTC?** The answer is NO. So start accumulating now, meanwhile the devs are preparing nice apps and tools to use it as money, later.

This wallet, also named Schildbach wallet after the core developer name, is one of the oldest mobile wallet ever existed.  
The wallet saves the private keys on local storage in an encrypted file. You could just easily save that file on an external USB drive for backup.  
Every time you need to restore your wallet, just put that encrypted file into your "download" folder. You will need to use your wallet password backup in order to restore, the same one that you used when you create the backup.  
Despite of what others will try to push you to use another wallet, this wallet is just fine to use. 
Is NOT custodial and you always control your keys.

I personally tried both versions Linux and Windoze. NONE of them are working fine, that are available in many different versions.  
On Linux a noob, if it follows the scarce instructions, will end up in failed installation. All versions lack of very well documented instructions or at least a single script to install all in the correct way.  
On Windoze, the version available is not even starting the setup. End up in an error.  
**Please make a package with a script/bat that people can just click,. run the setup, configure as they wish the settings and done, they will have an EPS.**  
Or just make Electrum directly compiled with client and server and at setup to ask the user: which versions you want to install: client, server, both?  
BTW, even the instructions on the Electrum.org page are scarce. If you follow EXACTLY the commands for Linux, IT IS NOT WORKING! This is shame.

Yes, nice said, but put that in practice, took me long time, and I have some IT skills.  
Take a normal user to read/follow/execute these guides and will not be able to have an EPS ready with few clicks.  
  
  
  
And all other guides. ll of them are written (for a noob) in foreign language or are missing parts (that a noob have to spend days to fix) or are wrong/incomplete  commands.  
Even on Electrum download page the instructions for installing on Linux are **incomplete** are not working if you just follow them.
Somebody have to write a damn good guide, step by step commands for a total noob, that can help him/her to have his own damn node and EPS n his own machine. Otherwise we are just joking around and people get fucked like OP using a 3rd party server.

OK  


I trust only in my node to verify **my own txs**.  
Security is done only by those miners that mine the txs verified by my node or at least they run the same version of node like I have (not forks or oldest versions).  
Now come the question for you: what are doing with that node apart from just running it? Are you connecting your wallets to it?  
Don't tell me you have your own node running in your house but you are still using custodial wallets and payment processors for your BTC txs...
@_date: 2019-12-12 19:21:40
No I do not agree.

Yes, I am one that used Bitwage in the past, when none of my clients could pay me in BTC.  
Then I convince almost all my clients to firstly buy BTC as funds reserves, then accept it for their business and then they could pay me directly with BTC.  
It's a hard and long journey, but if you are determined you can do it also. Is just a matter of time until almost everybody gets it (bitcoin).  
But as a start I will strongly recommend Bitwage. Easy to setup, employer/client don't have to do anything, just send you the regular bank payment for your wage.  
You receive the money next day, for 1% fee, converted as you like. You can setup a % of the total to be split into % of BTc and another % into fiat, directly to your regular bank account and BTC wallet.  
Don't look at all those comments that will come saying that Bitwage is shit. They are just envy of you because they do not have balls for this and they are looking only for trading BTC. By doing this they are loosing your "liquidity" in exchange and a cow to milk.  
Never look at the volatility, that's total bullshit manipulation. In long term Bitcoin **ALWAYS** go up.
Bitwage offers you a way to forget about trading, prices, TAs, FUD, FOMO, manipulation, lost funds etc. Yes Bitwage will require KYC, but who cares? You can immediately pass all your income through Wasabi wallet (strongly recommended) and coinjoin your income.  
In the end YOU are the one to win because you will have a fluent income of BTC every fucking month.  
Bitwage is also good for freelancers that have clients abroad. Easy to pay for them into their own currency, to a national bank.  
Slowly then you can pass to a full BTC payment directly when your employer is ready. Educate them first. Be sure they understand totally how it works, the risks and also advantages.

I suggest to not put directly on the invoice your BTC address. Normally these papers goes into tax registering.  
You do not want to have all your BTC addresses linked and also others addresses linked to yours.  
Make a regular invoice in your local fiat, as usual. The payment details discuss with the client in private.  
Keep a low profile for the moment.  
I suppose also that you used Wasabi to coinjoin that income from a public address. You realize that now everybody is searching all connections on block explorers with that address you just published.

The most important thing in choosing a wallet is [the golden rule of Bitcoin](  
Then came the features that not all wallets will have the same. That's why is better to use more than just one wallet.  
**Mobile Wallets** (only segwit compatible matter)  
**1.Samourai Wallet**  
Pros- Advanced Privacy features  
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed  
  
  
**2.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
**3.Green address IOS/ Greenbits for Android**  
Pros- One of the better wallets for IOS. Features like multisig nLocktime for better security and 2FA not found in other wallets  
Cons- UX is not as polished as some other wallets

You can easily help your visitors/customers to connect to your node, by opening channels and your "problem" is gone.  
If there will be a "problem" for LN it will be if you are limited to one channel per node, but you are not. You can open as many channels you want. **FUCKING UNLIMITED!**

All these YTers, I am totally sure they get rekt by YT because:  
- they used some links to obscure scams or shady products  
- they used referral links to obscure sites and products  
- they pushed their audience into clickbaits  
- promoting ICOs or shady financial products  
- they do not keep close the information/education about Bitcoin, but they just use with fancy titles the word Bitcoin in order to attract more losers for the clickbait  
- they used their video channel for earning subscribers in order to be paid from ads, **they do it for money not for education**  
You want a real example of YT channel that is not affected and is doing great job in EDUCATING and not focusing on bullshit content? Think about why they didn't get the ban and others yes. Because they do a good job and do not promote bullshit.

Vouchers is the best way.  
 - gift cards in Carrefour and other shops (i think)  
 - BTC vouchers in shops  
 - BTC vouchers in shops  
 - BTC vouchers in gas stations  
 - coins for BTC vouchers  
You give them the voucher and they can redeem the BTC anytime they want/be ready. Is the best way also to teach them how to open a new wallet and use those vouchers. Don't look at the premium price of those vouchers, is normal, but is the best way to teach them.

2. Reclaim your privacy making some CoinJoins and coin control.  
3. test the new Wasabi wallet with your hardware wallet (yes, now it support HWW)

If you can't setup a BTCPay server, you can have a BTC node and LN node on any other machine you already have it.  
On windows: [Pierre Rochard's setup]( and then [link a LN woocommerce plugin to that LN node](  
On linux:  Install docker with bitcoind and c-lightning, then lightning charge and spark wallet. Link to that node the same wp plugin I mentioned before.  
bitcoind + LNC docker here   
  
  
But if you are not willing to install all these I strongly recommend you to just take a NODL box, ready installed with all you need. Plug &amp; Play. Will save you lot of time, money, patience, frustration etc.  
I have been in your situation and I know what you expect. It is not easy.
The best easy way is a BTCPay server. Seems hard to install but in the end it resumes only to few lines and you are done. BTCPay can be hosted on the same machine where you have now your WP+woocommerce, actually come with Woo integrated for 1 shop. If you will limit to that shop, is good to go, the best ever solution.
  
[Casa BTC &amp; LN node]( - plug &amp; play  
[NODL BTC + LN + BTCPay node]( - plug &amp; play

We are trying to make Bitcoin even more private and yet you come with this stupid idea of "searchable" identity linked to a BTC address...

It's just a tactic to bring attention from media. For more you give him, more they will bring him on front.  
Let him spend his money on court, he will not have any chance and he will even withdraw before it started because he knows that will never win.

I really do not understand why Electrum developers do not include in the setup process the install of Electrum Server or Personal Server.  
Make the user to be aware/responsible for his own risk.  
Put a damn question in the install process:  
- do you want to continue installation of Electrum Server? Be aware you will need a full Bitcoin node running and syncronized. If you have that, click here to continue with Electrum Server.  
- you don't have a full Bitcoin node? Then click here to finish the setup and start using standalone Electrum client with the risk of connecting to random bad actors servers.  
Electrum client as standalone client is a powerful wallet but is quite useless if the user do not know which server to connect and to be trusted. Blindly connecting to a random server it's a fucking dumb exposure to risk.  
I am glad that NODL and BTCpay are working on including an Electrum server version into their bundles. That way a user can take back his sovereignity and control.

So, a company that build hardware wallets, to "secure" your keys,  
- initially had a Chrome extension app that was used to access your hardware wallet. In the end they remove it because was a nightmare opening a door to hackers.  
- then they create this "brilliant" idea of creating a "live" application that ends up in being cloned by a malware.  
- now they are in bed with Samsung to make a "smartphone ledger" that could be the perfect trojan horse, just think about it  
- on top of that Ledger is a strongly supporter of [Bitpay, the enemy of Bitcoin](  
1. When people will open wide their eyes and see what is really going on?  
2. This blindliness on "oh Ledger is the best way to keep you bitcoin safe" will go to bad things.  
3. Hardware wallet ALWAYS will be the target of attacks and many will succeed. Why? For the simple fact that is well known that people will keep a lot of BTC keys in there.  
4. There are many ways to keep your BTC keys safe WITHOUT a HW wallet, without anybody knowing it or even be the target of such attacks.

1. Memorize seed, it's easy to train your brain. With backups, sure.  
2. Steganography. Hide your seed in a picture file, in plain sight without nobody knowing it. [One example here](  
3. Hide the seed into a text with 1000 words. I did that here in my years of posting, I hide a seed and nobody redeemed that BTC until now. In plain sight.  
4. Paper/steel wallets, splited in pìeces.  
5. Encrypted USB sticks with backups.  
I see people using their HW wallets as daily usage wallet "because it's safu". It's the most stupid thing that. You are a fucking target.  
If you want to use a HW wallet at least use it as "never touch it" wallet, hidden in a box somewhere. That it's your HODL wallet that you will not touch it not even in 10 years. You only need your xpub or some bunch of addresses to fund your wallet time to time with HODL coins.  
Use 3 levels of storing wallets:  
- quick spend, with small amounts: many different mobile wallets and LN wallets  
- medium, buffer zone, not so large amounts: desktop wallets, recommended with connection to your own node, used for taking the BTC bought from exchanges, coinjoin, coin control etc and then redistribute to mobile wallets and HODL wallets  
- HODL wallets: those with large amounts of coins **that you never touch them**  
In this way NOBODY will know exactly all your stash, where you keep it, how you keep it, how you use it.
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:40:09

Bitcoin needs a natural adoption, from the bottom, from each small merchant and individual.

Now getting in bed with Samsung is another alarm signal.  
We will see soon backdoors of those "ledger smartphones" that will leak users private keys or data about their crypto usage...  
This step is just the beginning of a greater move of the "masters": they can't stop Bitcoin, now they try to conquer it by creating tools to control the users. Silently.  
**Be aware of these "convenient tools"!** Could be the trojan horse...
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:59:09

It's a damn **decentralized revolution** that will change the world entirely, as we know it, without any politician help or words (liars all).

It's just a bit of paranoia. That piece of hardware is not safer than a TailsOS live CD for example. Even an old smartphone, used offline can do the same as is doing a HW wallet.  
This usage of HW wallets is a reminiscence of something deep into people's mind that your money have to stay in a box "safe" like a bank safe. I saw many people putting their HW wallet into a bank box... LOL  
Bitcoin can be safe in many other ways without using a HW wallet. HW wallets became now an "industry" and of course is hyped to make people buying them.  
I have 8 years using Bitcoin, I have a HW wallet but used as testing and curiosity. But all my BTC keys are NOT stored in a HW wallet. I have many ways to do that. And in these 8 years I NEVER lost any satoshi. The key to keep safe your BTC is to be well educated in this matter and keep clean your activity and devices.  
On the other hand, Electrum is not 100% safe. If you do not have your own Electrum Server, you have a risk that a rogue Electrum server, where your Electrum client is connected, to read your xpub and scan all your txs, IP etc.  
I would suggest you this testing scenario:  
1. Run your own BTC node, on a small machine box, rasppi or something.  
2. from any other PC or live CD Tails, run Wasabi wallet and connect it to your own node    
3. create a wallet and memorize that seed. Yes memorize it, train your brain for that and make a backup on a piece of paper or an encrypted text on encrypted USB.  
4. Every time you need to use in a safe and private way your BTC, boot with your TailsOS, run Wasabi, put your seed to recover your wallet (like a password) and done.  
This will cost you NOTHING and also NOBODY will know that you have BTC. Wearing around a HW wallet definitely will make you a target...  
Oh and another hint to store safe your btc keys with zero cost: **use steganography**.

I know what is a custodial wallet and I always stand against use of these, but for fuck sake:  
- is about using small amounts of BTC on LN  
- is just temporary, the blue wallet just started, is still in developing  
- we need to help building new technologies that help us, the users, so we can just let the devs know our requests. If they comply, ok all good, if they don't ... forever gone like OB.  
-I don't have to trust zigzag, I just move my coins from LN to onchain, that's it. It is up to each how they "clean" later their coins.  
- as the blue wallet devs announced; it will be future developments thayt will allow you to full control your coins, nodes, trust etc. so be patient, use this wallet a testing and make it better.

There is no need for that. Just accept Bitcoin. Who have BTC will pay directly to you with BTC. No more hassle.

Just used ZigZag exchange to send to myself. Works perfect.  
There is no such thing of "withdrawal" from LN. You spend or refill. People get wrong LN! LN is not a "wallet" like a BTC wallet. Is just like a multisig vault from where you spend or refill in a channel.  


**Do not spread lies and misleading. You cannot "withdraw" funds from ANY LN wallet/channel. You either spend or refill.**

Multicurrency - only if you have income in other crypto than BTC and want to change it into BTC. Otherwise don't bother use it.

Bitcoin stands exactly against all types of "payment processors". That's why Bitcoin exist! And yet you want to create an intermediary to cut off all Bitcoin's beauty.  
[Satoshi papers]( - **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
If you really want to "monetize" from Bitcoin txs, start Be Your Own Bank, aka buy a Casa node or Nodl node and start some serious BTC &amp; LN nodes and charge fees for any txs that pass through your nodes. Creating liquidity &amp; security will bring  you more "monetizing" than a stupid app to be a BTC intermediary.

I deposited BTC, open a LN wallet, refill with some satoshis, made some payments, send the left over balance to zigzag exchange back to my wallets. Done, all my funds were NEVER restricted or stolen or promise to give it back later.  
Yes, the wallet is new, have bugs, need improvements but I can't say it is a scam. It works for what was designed to be.

Everybody should try LN and not using only one wallet app, but all that come up. We will see many from now on and all needs to be scrutinized, tested, improved. Don't be shy to speak loud if one app is not designed as you like, maybe others will listen to you and will implement the features you want. Only like that we will have better apps.  
[BTC LN wallet]( - send receive LN payments  
[Blue Wallet]( - send / receive LN payments  
[Zap LN wallet]( - only desktop version for now  
[Eclair LN only wallet]( - only send   
[RawTx LN wallet](  
[Shango full LN wallet](

I posted **EXACTLY about this** [just a day ago]( and mods remove it for no reason, when was just a friendly warning.  
But yeah is not the first time when shitposts, stupid memes, spams, fake news are encouraged, meanwhile posts about how to protect against these are silenced/removed...  
As I said in that removed post:  
Suggestions:  
- always use email aliases for each site that is suspicious or you don't want to get in trouble. One alias/site is even better. If you start receiving suspicious emails, just looking into email header and you can see to which alias was send and identify the leaker.  
- always use different passwords and keep them safe in a password manager  
- use a random password generator for easiness  
Be safe!

I think this is bad in general. You are just giving for free data to LE... Let them work hard, why you put people to give more data?  
Anyway, posting a specific service that abuses his users maybe could have a result, but posting BTC addresses is really bad.  
**Bitcoin is permissionless** and what you do is against what Bitcoins stand for.  
Flagging BTC addresses will not make scammers go away! You are just making worse, misleading noobs.

Bitcoin doesn't have any remorse or bailout plan for dumb people. It's simple like that, you like it or not, nobody will save you if you do not control your keys.  
People usually try to adapt Bitcoin to existing systems and that is wrong and will not work.  
People should adapt to Bitcoin's values and system and change their mentality regarding money.

There are hundreds of sites selling BTC, but each one understand in their way to implement new protocols and developments of Bitcoin. Some are lazy, some are bad players, some are even against Bitcoin and they do it on purpose.  
If you use an exchange like that, is time for you to stop using it and find one that respect all Bitcoin features.  
I am strongly suggest you to use Bisq  decentralized, P2P exchange.

@_date: 2019-01-24 19:52:29
In my humble opinion, it will be many coins:  
- govcoins to pay your taxes with and also to be fully transparent gov, citizens can track deeply what is doing his gov with money, no more lost money or spending on things that do not matter. Example here, how many billions lost, gone:   
- supermarket coins, the ones you buy groceries and get discounts, practically what you have now on fidelity cards...  
- lawyercoins or smart contracts, you know for what are...  
- investment coins/tokens, are actual shares in a company  
- health coins, tokens for your health insurrance  
- transportation coins, tokens that you will use for your transport...  
All of these will exist but all of them will be necessary to be bought with... Bitcoin! And yes there will be trading for these coins...  
You are not buying BTC today for selling them tomorrow when will be 50k/BTC. No, you buy today so your kids and grankids will have a future in 10-20-30 years from now, and they can use them to get "specialized coins".

A max  300$ investment in your future own bank, plug &amp; play, I think is not expensive at all.  
Running a LN node means you literally became a banker. People do not realize that a 300 buck today is nothing compared with what you will earn in near future just by having that node sitting in your room and serving txs.

Stay away from Coinbase.  
Just use a watch only wallet for employees that are involved in taking the payments and you just keep/watch your full wallet.  
Watch only capable mobile wallets: Sentinel, Mycelium, Electrum, Blue wallet (still new wallet).  
Full mobile wallets (for you): Electrum, Samourai (still not final release), Blue wallet (new), BRD, GreenAddress  
Desktop: Electrum - for coin control of your income    
The thing is that paying with BTC onchain in a small shop is not so practical. I suggest a LN wallet.  
**Bitcoin Lightning Wallets**  
[BTC LN wallet]( - send receive LN payments  
[Blue Wallet]( - send / receive LN payments  
[Zap LN wallet]( - only desktop version for now  
[Eclair LN only wallet]( - only send

My last 5 experiences:  
- Bitrefill - 20€ recharge my mobile credit using LN payment  
- a local bar in my area - 30€ paid some beers with friends, using  BLW (BTC LN wallet)  
- groceries in a local in my area - paid 150€ with 10% discount because of paying with BTC, BTC wallet2wallet  
- order some food online for a friend, paid with BTC  
- paid my rent to the owner with BTC  
Slowly this became a normal way to live with BTC.

Yes, I agree with you that Bitcoin in some way was "hijacked" to be a speculation asset.  
But don't you think that all depends on us, the bitcoiners, to not let that happen? Try educating as much people as you can, about what Bitcoin really is. Try demanding to your employer to be paid in BTC, push merchant adoption and you will see that all that speculation train is fading slowly.  
When BTC will be used more as money, the speculation will not be so important anymore. This take time, but is the normal way of adoption.  
DISCLAIMER: I am paid in BTC :)

Good, now that we have an alternative, we need to change people's mentality to switch from Bitpay shit.  
I think BTCPay follow the same path as Bitcoin:  
1. Problem - we were in a moment (crisis) that we need an alternative system  
2. Solution - Bitcoin/BTCPay is born  
3. Reaction - people are afraid to use it, are too stuck into old systems  
4. Education - start slowly a good education and guides, offer solutions to existing problems, create tools for easy use, demos, testing etc  
5. Adoption - people will see slowly which one is better and more important, which one is respecting their rights and offer more freedom  
This is a slow process and we need patience.

There are actually 2 nice options right now:  
1. Samourai wallet have a feature to hide your wallet and bring it up only with a code in dial.  
2. Blue wallet have also a feature named "plausible deniability". It hides your real wallet, in an encrypted storage. You setup a fake wallet just with some satoshis in it, set a specific password for that wallet and done.  
The thug come to you and ask for your wallet password? Ok, play a bit of theater crying and shit, but give him the password for the fake wallet. Play the "poor guy" role and maybe he will give you a tip in BTC in the end.

You seem to be very angry, slow down, we understand the part of "control the coins", we all do, but your attitude is too aggressive and seems to be from another "wallet" that feels losing control. Nobody will take place to anybody, there is plenty of space for all.  
Yes we have to point out things that we do not like for an app. As I said, if the devs do not listen to the users, then we just leave them alone. Examples are many: mycelium, OB, bitpay, coinbase and many more. Once they are not listening to us, they are gone.

AML/KYC- One of the biggest barriers to offering merchant processing for the Lightning Network is being compliant.  This is includes adhering to all Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer regulations.  
So you think that AML/KYC is really necesary for a LN payment? So you think that paying a paywall article or a coffee with LN is a payment to launder money? Damn, how many coffees I have to drink in order to launder some billions?  
So what is this CoinMesh? Another way that govs and banks try to infiltrate into Bitcoin world and use it in their evil interests?

Good one!  
No wonder if all this scheme of pump/dumb had implicated those 2 "bitcoin traders" mentioned in the tweets.  
Trace seems to be a nice guys in videos, but I do not trust him at all, he's a 2 faces guy. He initiated that movement of proof of keys (good actually for noobs) but I doubt that his intentions was as was presented. Seeing him in those tweets, looks like he was planning a massive withdraw from exchanges, to lower the price, meanwhile he buys and after that push these fake news on the news to push back the price up, so he can sell. These fuckers are capable to do this.  
Why I do not trust him? Because meanwhile he "fight" with proof of keys movement, he's also an investor in Bitpay, the enemy of Bitcoin and also an opposite of proof of keys.  
This whole story smells of a pump/dumb.... just think about. Fortunately didn't work well for them. Bitcoin community is great and learned from the past and didn't fall into another trap.

I will better focus on positive things like:

- a massive **worldwide live** talk of Andreas A. on many big cities of the world  
- translated in local language  
- transmitted on huge billboards

Don't despair and nothing to be ashamed of. All depends on your own level of desire to learn new things.  
1. If you go for building your own node, the difference price from 130 to 300 bucks will be inverted into your knowledge, that can be useful later, when you can start building more nodes for your friends that like you now are struggling to do it. When the time is right, not too many will spare their time building their own node, will just buy it from you. Now we are in the early days, you have time to learn.  
2. If you just buy a node already built, then you are a step further into learning more about ... how to make money with LN, being a Bitcoin banker. Again you will have a step further comparing with your friends that still plays games or do their own life, ignoring your hobby.  
It's a win-win situation here. But anyway, what are 130 or 300 bucks today comparing with your knowledge of tomorrow? Nothing.

Here some:  
1. Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.  
2. Bitcoin concepts are just too hard for the bankers to understand.  
3. Bitcoin is not the money of the current generation. It is the money of generations to come.  
4. Satoshi Nakamoto stole from the banks the power to create/control money and give it to the people. Like Prometheus giving the ability to make fire from the gods to mankind.  
5. Bitcoin is both a payment system and a currency. Bitcoin is decentralized P2P money, limited supply/scarce, without borders, inmutable, permissionless, open source, secure, censorship resistant, fungible, personless, transparent, portable, highly divisible, durable, easily transactable, smart/programmable

At least 35min from this video are USELESS, just personal aspects of Andreas life, that are not important regarding Bitcoin. You really think that his morning coffee/habits have real influence on Bitcoin? Come on, let's be serious.  
Andreas is important and interesting when is talking about Bitcoin, not about his past life and habits. Leave the man in peace. Why you had to dig over and over into his personal life for 90% of all interview? Even can be seen on Andreas face that hi didn't like it. But I think he continue it just because he's very respectful and educated.  
Instead of seeing an Andreas talking with passion and enthusiasm about Bitcoin, I saw a bored person.

Bad, bad move. Coinbase is a bank. There are many other alternatives out there.  
If you still want to use Conbase to just buy BTC, I strongly suggest to move your coins from there into [Wasabi wallet]( to "clean" any option of tracking, by using the Wasabi wallet feature named CoinJoin.  
Once you have them clean, move them into your savings wallet as you wish (Electrum, Samourai, Mycelium, BRD, GreenAddress etc).

Bitcoin will never force somebody to use his BTC as he like (speculation or simple P2P money). And that's the beauty of Bitcoin.  
I am not so worried about all those speculators, I don't give a shit if they lose or gain more shitload of shit fiat. If they lose, I am happy, I never sell, I just use it as money. If they win, I win too because I HODL too.  
I am my employer too, I am a freelancer, I don't like to work for anybody else but myself. They pay me for the services I've done for companies/clients. Some they pay me directly in BTC, some they pay me in fiat but I use Bitwage.com for that, to receive only BTC.

@_date: 2019-01-22 10:24:37


Fuck no!
I will tell how I will do for some of my local clients (I am IT consultant for small merchants).  
1. Buy a domain name  
2. Contract a good internet connection for the shop/office location, with fix IP  
3. Build a good cheap machine with Linux  
4. Put the website on that machine  
5. Build/buy a node box (Casa, Nodl, Raspiblitz, build your own etc)  
6. Start on that box BTC node + LN node + BTCPay server + eventually an electrum server  
7. Connect your website with your BTCpay server. DONE  
Optional:  
- You can host your website somewhere else, but you will need to be sure no-one can access it, due to the fact you are using BTC payments. Very few hostings are giving you root access to your server and even then is not sure if they can still access. Rogue admins can happen all the time. If they know that your server is using BTC, for sure you are watched.  
- BTCpay server can be hosted also (see their doc page)  
Sources to read:  
BTCPay server:   
[Casa BTC &amp; LN node]( - plug &amp; play  
[NODL BTC + LN + BTCPay node]( - plug &amp; play  
[BTCPi]( plug &amp; play  
[RaspiBlitz node](

I do not want to deal anymore with "banks". In special "crypto banks".  
I think this is a common practice with all good bitcoin services, like Cashila also. Once they get a good amount of user data, they convert the service into a nightmare that is only feeding the gov/LE requirements and watch list.

Nope, this is NOT adoption, this is a step back from adoption actually. You are just going back to USE fiat, and not using BTC.  
Adoption = **using BTC as money**, not VISA.  
Retailers will slowly accept BTC as money, but if you continue to give them that shit card, they think nobody is using BTC. So they still continue taking visa (aka fake money).  
Do the big step: stop using visa, only cash or BTC and push merchants to accept BTC.  
Just by requesting that card you are just helping the banksters and NOT Bitcoin to continue using fiat.  
**FIAT MUST DIE!**  
BTW, just using that card, you double fuck (fiat + Conbase) your privacy and freedom. By yourself. When a person do not care about his privacy and freedom I don't know why had that right in the first place...

yeah but if it is a right, it supposed that you already have it and no need to demand it. So is more enjoying than demand it. Demand sounds more like begging something that you don't have a right.

You already have enough data to crawl just by "having an eye" on all txs from merchant's xpub. Chainalisys companies and gov agencies will love to have that too.

Don't forget that side-chains like Liquid are already in place and also those will release a majority of block space.  
LN is just a small step forward (in terms of quantity of BTC used), but with huge implications and shitloads of txs happening "behind the scene".  
Sidechains like Liquid will offload large amounts of BTC from mainchain and will be more specific txs inter large companies, exchanges, crypto banks etc.

I pay every day with BTC/LN.
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:50:35
I have also a regular income of BTC. What I do: that income sent to Wasabi wallet, split it into 3-4 mixed txs, then send back to 4-5 new created BTC addresses in other wallets/addresses.  
I usually keep my BTC in types of expenses/incomes:  
- mobile wallets (vary, not just one) with small amounts for regular expenses  
- desktop wallets for medium amount of expenses. Electrum is great for this, for his coin control features  
- Hardware wallets for large amounts, just for HODL, never touches online once it was created.  
One more thing you should take in consideration: Use Samourai with Electrum, same wallet. In Electrum desktop you could make better coin control after you use that wallet in Samourai. Use the same seed in both apps.

A [Casa node]( or a [BTCPay node]( will cost only $300. Or just build your own for less.  
For being your own bank, is just a tiny amount for your and your website visitors privacy.  
And BTW, having your own LN node, creating your own channels, you can charge fees, be a real BTC banker. Don't think that today is expensive 300 bucks what will be in few years a fortune...  
Ask yourself this question: how much are you willing to pay for your FOREVER privacy?

I regularly use these, the order doesn't matter and sometimes shared wallet seed between 2 or more wallet apps, for better coin control and backup:

No, but I use Bitcoin core as my node, plus Electrum Server and connect my wallets to those.
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:54:31
It is **the only one that matters** today. The rest are just against the Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin was created exactly to get rid of these intermediaries.  
Build a solution like BTCPay and we all will be happy to use it. But being another intermediary... nah that is not going to happen for people that really respect the values of Bitcoin and for what we stand against for.  
Maybe you will find some dumb idiots that just want to follow the trend, but soon many real bitcoiners will start avoiding all these intermediaries. It's simply against Bitcoin's values. That's all.

The number of followers still doesn't say anything... why is so important for Bitcoin, what he did/will do for Bitcoin. As far I see, his activity is non-related to Bitcoin. If he start accepting BTC that doesn't mean automatically all his followers will start using BTC.  
BTW, I prefer more to see just 10k people using BTC in the right way instead of 1M "followers" that have no idea about Bitcoin and jump directly to Coinbase trap....
Please answer to those 3 simple questions.
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:07:46
Nope, the real goal  of S2X wasn't the consensus on both proposals, but disguised in those proposals, the code to be modified so big companies like Bitpay, Coinbase etc to be able to censor the users based on their txs. Dig more about S2X and see their real desires. They are the real enemies of Bitcoin with no doubt!

If you have a public LN node, please publish a LN invoice and  I will donate to that cause. Venezuela needs a movement like that and the bitcoiners outside of Vzla will like to help.  
Let's create a parallel mesh network in Venezuela, open source, censorship resistant, permissionless, inmutable etc and ow the world that Bitcoin can win wherever is people's power.

I know that outside of Bitcoin community Coinbase is heavily "recommended", but that is because many people lack of education and knowledge in this matter, but here, inside the Bitcoin community, there were tons of [warnings about Coinbase **not to be used**](  
You should never ignore warnings, even if you will see many jumping to say "nah, I never had any problem with Coinbase". Those are just ignorant that really don't care if you lose your money.  
As a general rule:  
- choose an exchange with more good reputation, strongly recommended a decentralized P2P one.  
- if you buy from a centralized regulated exchange, be sure you "clean" your BTC  
- NEVER keep your BTC on a centralized exchange, see   
- always use a wallet that respect the most important rule: 100% control of your bitcoin keys

Bitcoin itself IS the payment processor and the currency. You don't need any of those bloodsuckers: Conbase and VISA. They just fool you to use that shit card.

I can store BTCPay on my own secured server, with just $300  not on cheap hosted centralized datacenters.  
If that server will get hacked by govs, it will be ONLY my own fault against my own customers and not all other customers (in Atomicpay case).  
If a gov will already have your access to your database, because it is required by law to present it, as a business as yours, then doesn't matter if it will be on decentralized storages.  
Soon maybe I will be able to host my own BTCPay server on IPFS, Storj like decetralized solutions and then NOBODY can force me to do shit about my customers.  
AtomicPay is NOT different than any Paypal shit intermediary. Point and clear.

many haters here. Also coming ProofOfKeys movement is near and many shill centralized exchanges, "day traders" and idiots do not like the idea of using your own node with your own wallet... is all about control and they lose it with what you want to do.  
Regarding your question, did you tried also with mobile BTC wallet Schildbach? If with that one works, also with Samourai should be fine.
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:37:26
[You could create your **own LN node**]( with Casa and then let others to open channels with you.  
This is why LN node like Casa is important that many people will use it as their own node/channels. This means more decentralization.  
Also you can earn some satoshis too, being your own bank.
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:50:27
