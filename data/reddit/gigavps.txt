The headlines of Bitcoin being the worst investment of 2014 are for sensational purposes only. 
If one only steps back and looks from December 2011 to December 2014, they will see the best performing asset class, with 100x (10,000%) growth over the past three years.

True security from bitcoin stealing software means that your offline computer should never be online.
I would recommend that you use Armory for your offline wallet storage. You can then have watching only wallets on any other computer to keep track of balances and make new transactions.
Bitcoin security is still hard, but Armory makes the most sense for keeping private keys private.

If I am to understand correctly, you cashed out the 150 coins before sending the USD to Tesla to purchase the vehicle?

There is an assumption in your piece that implies that all miners only raise capital for CAPEX and use their earned BTC for OPEX. 
This is not always the case as some miners are cluing into the fact that if both CAPEX and OPEX are raised captial, the BTC earned can be saved rather than spent.
This would be similar to a buy and hold strategy but without the effects of moving markets.

Since when is BTCTrade one of the top three Chinese exchanges?
Could have sworn it was BTCChina, OKcoin and Huobi. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:31:14
18.75% if we're trying to be exact.

I'll offer $5,000 in BTC at the time a bill of sale is executed.

Has no one ever heard of "naked short selling"?

Funnily enough my datacenter reps sent the bib to us when the baby was born. Looks like it came from cafe press.

There is no way this site is legit. Moneypak does not allow use of their logo or trademarks.
STAY AWAY!!!!!

Hate to burst your bubble, but Bitpay as 0% processing fees.

Good on you sir. I'd like to help cover the costs for the domain.

How do you handle generating private/public keys on the site?

You may also want to have a third key for 2 of 3 so that if your phone and its backup disappear, you still have 2 keys to have access to the coins.

Pump and dump in progress. Was $1.01 before open, now at $3.39.
Be very cautious!

Upon closer inspection....
- Cannot sign up for cloud hashing service, links don't work and login/signup "coming in August"
- Store has broken links, 
- Pool is two parts, one is p2pool and the other is stratum and their stratum pool is ZERO hash rate

4-of-5 address would meet the requirement of one party having veto with 3 other addresses having 2 of 3 authority.
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:18:11
They'd have full control in your example, not veto authority.
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:11:28
Complete scam. Stay away!
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:42:51
No personal names tied to the company. Bitlicense link is some kind of chicago permit. Press release claiming big things are coming. These are just a few of the signs that this site is a SCAM.
Be very aware.

Somebody made up currencies to begin with. Someone made up the internet. You use both, yet it is retarded to put your finances into Bitcoin.
I would suggest you come with a better argument if you are going to claim something is retarded.
