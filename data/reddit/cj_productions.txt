I'm not sure how to ELI5, but basically in any of these markets, someone can either place a limit order (those things on the left which can be "walls") or a market order, which immediately will appear on the right. There's also stop orders but you won't see those until they are executed. you can imagine they don't exist for now.
Limit orders can be cancelled, as long as someone does not market buy or sell into the order first. Market buy/sell orders cannot be cancelled. When you execute a market order, for example a market sell you basically say "I want to sell to the highest bidder in the order book." So, that person is eating up green orders. Sells (red) eats buys (green) and visa versa. This 10k wall is the red order in the order book, and in order to clear it, there need to be enough market buys to eat up whatever value it is.
And many people can place orders on top of others. That's usually how you get a "wall". A small order in the order book isn't considered a wall because they usually get eaten so quickly.  10k is a significant wall because of the accumulative value of all the orders. It started with something like 365 BTC. That takes a lot of buying power to eat through.

Not trying to be a dick, but you don't like to read, do you?

 That is a very cherry-picked observation and makes it look like you don't know how to read graphs.

I'd say you're legit. I really like what you're doing. I think it will bring more attention to crytocurrency as well.
