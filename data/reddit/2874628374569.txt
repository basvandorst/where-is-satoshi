The hardware is made in China, and it's dirt cheap to produce compared to what it would cost to make in the US . All (most) of the components are made in China. They are capitalizing on this, coupled with cheap electricity and lack of regulation / oversight on the whole industry (aside from the exchanges, as we have seen recently).
That's why the mining equipment is made in China. I really hope that other country start creating their own mining hardware. The current monopoly of hardware and mining equipment from China is not healthy for the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
We need to diversify. We need wider adoption from other country. We need hardware from other countries.

@_date: 2017-03-18 06:55:39
This is one of the element that I think is fundamentally flawed with Bitcoin. No one should be forced to use some specific proprietary hardware such as ASIC or should it be about who can produce the fastest chipset or who doesn't pay electricity because they live who knows where and that now because of that can they influence the price and determine what the future of this currency will be. This is creating inequality among nations and individuals.
The fact that the current system allows this to happen is wrong in my opinion and runs contrary to the very core concept of a decentralized currency. What we see happening now was bound to happen, it was just a matter of time. I personally think that it's pretty obvious and I don't understand why it's surprising anyone. 
Bitcoin right now is just following the same old trends and philosophy that have been applied to other currencies. Some people have an unfair advantage or control the market because they have some kind of arbitrary advantage (low cost electricity, low cost production of chipset, etc).
Decentralization must be based on the **adoption** factor and **common and accessible hardware**. Not on who owns the most proprietary powerful hardware or who lives in a certain country where they don't need to pay for electricity or where the local government is artificially propping them. This is ridiculous.
The price should be determined by how many people are using / adopting it and where anyone (you and me and your grandmother) is able to buy commonly and non proprietary accessible hardware to process / mine it.

Also, we need to demystify what's going on in China. Most people here on Reddit think that China is a big black mysterious box. It's not. If you can read and speak Chinese (Mandarin), you can easily find numerous blogs and website speaking about Bitcoin. Chinese posters know that, and they use that to their advantages. They know that most westerners don't have access to these resources. We need a bridge here on r/bitcoin. We need Chinese people to give us a perspective on the Chinese Bitcoin market. It's not rocket science really. Basic 101 translation and people willing to do it. We need more exposure so that we can understand what is going on in China, with Bitcoin. No more cryptic tweets from some obscure Bitcoin Exchange CEO's. There's a shit ton of information out there, and Reddit Bitcoin is very naive right now, because they can't read and understand it.
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:24:27
Please allow me to shamelessly plug an older thread that I think didn't get as much traction and attention as I think it should have back then. I think that this issue is now becoming pretty obvious and that something needs to be done about it. I'm not an expert and my argument is probably flawed like some have pointed in the thread, nonetheless it underscores a fundamental flaw with the current ecosystem in my opinion. When I wrote that I was not trying to make it a nationality issue, but more a proprietary mining hardware issue. Which we are now seeing happening with the ASIC chipsets produced by Jihan. Please disregard the China mention in the title of the thread, that's not what it was about entitrely. Although I still believe that we can't totally dismiss entirely some geopolitical elements that are related to having most of the BTC processing power concentrated in one country that is not really let's say a poster child for democracy, freedom and decentralization. I don't personally buy the fact that what we are seeing happening now is totally disconnected from the Chinese government. That's just my opinion and I understand that many won't agree with me.
**The ASIC mining controversy - Why don't we revert to GPU mining? Why do we allow China to corner the Bitcoin mining market with proprietary hardware?**
"If I understand correctly, Bitcoin was meant to be decentralized. So why are we tolerating that a certain type of proprietary hardware should dictate the future of this currency? The control and the impact they have right now on the Bitcoin economy is out of balance. This very concept runs contrary to the whole philosophy of an open and free architecture. I personally think that this is a huge threat to the future ecosystem and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:05:06


Which is everything else than specialized hardware such as ASIC mining CPUs. That is my whole argument. I don't want to buy ASIC hardware, I want to be able to mine Bitcoin with my cellphone, my TV or my toaster. You see what I mean? Decentralization, accessibility, common and easily accessible hardware. I don't give a fuck about your special chipset from China. This is the road to perdition for Bitcoin. Monopoly, in any form or shape, is a death sentence to this technology. Anyone arguing against this, is a fool.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:58:17
If you think that the current Bitcoin ecology is healthy, anything I say won't be enough to convince you, to the contrary. I don't really have an argument against your argument, if your only retort is: Well, duh, create a new coin you moron. Like I have said, this discussion is about Bitcoin, not about "I'm pulling a new coin out of my butt to support my point of view". It is pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:40:21


I think that there are also geopolitical risks associated with the current situation. We can't simply ignore that. China isn't really the poster child of freedom and democracy, right? 
In the event that something would happen where China is cut out from the rest of the world (economic war, government crack down on the internet, etc) the ecosystem could collapse (The same could be true for any country, not just China by the way. It just happen that right now it's happening in China.).
What would happen if let's say tomorrow and because of the aforementioned examples, Chinese miners are unable to process transactions? People will say, well other people would setup mining facilities. But this takes time. It's not something that can happen overnight. And in that time frame (weeks, months?) the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and economy could collapse and never recover. And what if most if not all of these Chipsets are made in China?
I think it's just common sense to not allow anything like that to happen and to make sure that the underlying architecture takes that into account. 
Take for example the BitTorrent protocol, if China was out of the picture entirely tomorrow, it would have absolutely zero impact on it and it would continue to thrive. Simply put, anything that goes against decentralization is bad in my opinion and goes contrary to the idea and concept of a decentralized currency. It's a fundamental flaw.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:00:29
The Chinese government doesn't care about Bitcoin. They most probably hate its decentralized nature. Any government hates this concept because it runs contrary to the idea of having control over a government issued currency. It's just a sandbox for them. They are only interested in the underlying tech, Blockchain. 
They tolerate it and use it right now to explore the concept and analyze how the market behaves. Once they are done studying it, they will ban Bitcoin and enforce their own currency. Mark my words. It will happen. Do you really think that any sane government would embrace a decentralized currency? China is just the canary in the coal mine and we should pay close attention to what's happening right now and react accordingly and preemptively instead of just being reactive. That's why I think it's important to think about this now, not when it will happen and potentially screw up the entire Bitcoin economy. Because when it happens it will be too late and Bitcoin will be gone, replaced by Fed Coins.

My professional advice as an anonymous Bitcorn Internet Expert is the following: Invest everything you have and don't look back. Now is the perfect time since it's at an all time high (every time it happens it is usually a sure sign and a very good indicator of a solid and unquestionable future trend). Let the excitement and the emotions of the moment drive your investment decision. Withdraw everything you own (remortgage your house if you need to, empty your savings account, etc). It can only go higher! To the moon! /s
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:02:37
I agree with you but there is still an element related to this country and the mindset of people from there that I think we should not dismiss entirely. I have lived in China for many years and done business there as well. I am quite familiar about how cutthroat a business environment it is. I can guarantee you that no one there gives a shit about any kind of naive idealistic goals about Bitcoin and how it can allow farmers from Africa to do business without banks. It's all about money and profits, that's it that's all.
And to see what is currently happening doesn't surprise me at all. Chinese people are outstanding business people. When they see an opportunity, they are very quick to analyze markets, react and find clever ways to maximize profits or take control of markets. And to see how some people are now trying to control/corner the market is not surprising me at all. What they are doing isn't wrong, the system allows it, so why not? And while we debate about ethic and morality, they are laughing all the way to the bank.
Capitalism isn't about ethic or politic, it's all about profits. What I am advocating for is simply for Bitcoin to not allow this kind of predatory methods to succeed. I think that it runs contrary to its core concept.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:07:58
I'd rather buy a thousand GPUs (common and accessible tech) instead of a couple of ASIC (Proprietary tech) miners coming from China. That is my argument. Accessible and non proprietary tech is better than proprietary tech. Anyone should be able to mine Bitcoin, with easily accessible tech (regardless of the price). Proprietary tech is wrong.

I think it's urgent, and we need to do it for the sake of the future of this currency. Bitcoin can't be controlled by any country or individuals, ever. If we allow that, it will fail and be easily replaced by fed coins or another alt coin that will take over.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:25:11
The fact that ASICs are made in China does not mean that Bitcoin mining is controlled by the ASIC manufacturer 
But it is now, so how do you explain that?

You can't just dismiss the impact that such events would have on the market. The market, in the real world could suffer immensely if miners decided to do this. I'm not speaking about the technical side of it, I'm speaking about perception from the general public.

Let me shut down tomorrow your ability to buy or sell Bitcoin by banning it in my country, entirely. No bank transfer for you (like it's already happening in many countries, and you haven't seen anything yet in my opinion).
Now, let's envision that all of the most influential nations of this earth take the same approach, overnight. 
How would you buy or sell Bitcoin? This could happen, it's a very real possibility.
How would you transfer your dollars to Bitcoin? How would you sell them?

The hash power is essential to the ecosystem. It's not a trivial subject. Who controls the hash power controls Bitcoin. 
That's the current situation.
And I think it's wrong and that it needs to change for Bitcoin to thrive and succeed.
Any model that allows centralization is bound to fail. I'm advocating for measures that will change this.
Periodically changed POW, P2P distributed ledger, etc. Anything that will change this fundamental flaw, is what I am advocating for.
I'm not a shill, I'm just looking at the current state of Bitcoin and I think that major changes need to done for it to succeed as a true **DECENTRALIZED** currency.
That is all.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:35:41
What if we lose 90% hash power? How are you so sure about your estimates?
This is a real question, I am not shilling. Where can I see a chart that shows me where Bitcoins are mined, country, etc. I'm willing to accept that you are right and that my worries are unfounded.
That's what I said in my opening statement:
"How would the market react? Emergency change of POW? Would the farms outside China be able to pick up and fill the void and assure a smooth continuity of the system?"

They can regulate the entry and exit points (Bitcoin to Fiat, Fiat to Bitcoin). How did you buy the Bitcoins that you have right now?
That's all that matters. 
Do you really think that they will allow Bitcoin or other Altcoins to supersede fiat currencies?
When they decide to clamp down, your internet money will be worth absolutely nothing once you can't buy anything in the physical world. The only reason Bitcoin is worth something right now is because you can exchange it for real money, their money, their system.
Bitcoin without their system, is absolutely meaningless. For now at least. But I don't foresee a future where they would allow this to happen. 
Why Would they? Why would they allow this to happen?
Because you are having some type of libertarian wet dream about a monetary revolution that would take them all down? This will never happen. They will never allow this to happen.

Let’s go to on the ugly side of reality for moment. Allow me to put my evil hat on for a moment. Let’s say that one day, the Bitcoin market cap is worth trillions of dollars and that a small but very important group of people have a huge influence over this value, what we refer today to as the core developers for Bitcoin. Open source? Yeah, right. Good luck with that in the real world when it matters and it disrupts real world markets.
As a drug dealer (hypothetically), someone with no moral values and no philosophical take on all of this. I’ve invested 2 billions of dollars in Bitcoin.
I could decide one day to take them all out in order to make money or steer the debate in a direction that would be profitable for me. A hundred of people killed? No big deal for me. When big money is involved, ideals fall apart, taken over by opportunists and criminals. Nothing else matters.
What would happen then?
Could they be replaced easily? How would this affect the market?
I feel that as long as some specific individuals have such a big influence on the direction of the technology and the price of Bitcoin, some very nasty individuals could take advantage of that. Right now, the market cap is low, but once it becomes big, we could see some very nasty development and events influencing the price of Bitcoin.
In my opinion this is a fundamental flaw. For Bitcoin to succeed in the long term, the contributors need to be totally anonymous, if we want to keep it truly open source and free from outside nefarious influences. It needs to be decentralized and totally anonymous.
I am not advocating anything that I have just said. I am only extrapolating and creating scenarios that I think are plausible.
The current ecosystem is too fragile.

Not fast enough for the market to not crumble and never recover from it.
Who will sell this hardware to these "new" miners that will save the day and which hardware will they use? Are you producing ASICs chips right now? 
Guess who is right now producing these chips, that's right, the "Evil Chinese".
Bitmain as a quasi monopoly right now. Will you invest millions to develop new chips and sell them to these miners that will save the day, magically?
Good luck with that. And good luck with the time that it would take to achieve that.
It's unrealistic and very naive to think that way. Time is of the essence. We're speaking about days, not weeks. The Bitcoin economy could be destroyed in a matter of days, if they wanted to.
That's wrong. And this is why Bitcoin need to address these fundamental flaws. 
Otherwise it will fail.

I personally think it's not a matter of if but when. I respect your work a lot Luke and I think that your heart is in the right place. But ideals and values won't be enough to solve this issue. The community, you and I, need to take a stance and take control back of the ecosystem. This needs to happen now.
UASF is the soft option (pun intended), change of PoW and alternate solutions, are a real long term solution to get rid of these bad actors.
I hope I will never see another influential twitter post from Jihan anymore, **he's irrelevant**. The only difference between him, you and I, is that he has invested millions in custom hardware. How ridiculous is that and how contrary does it run to Bitcoin core principles?
His opinion is irrelevant, as should it be in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Miners should not control the future of Bitcoin.
Because Bitcoin is not about popularity or money, it's about freedom. This is the fundamental ideal that it was built upon.
Freedom from the legacy monetary system, freedom from people like Jihan that want to lord over us, the 1%.
It's a disgrace and an insult to Satoshi's original vision that we have allowed these people to gain so much control as they have now.
It also exposes a fundamental flaw in the Bitcoin ecosystem that we urgently need to fix now. 
These bad actors are moving fast and we need to counteract before it's too late.
We need to take control back of the narrative (public relation, the mainstream media) and also the tech.
And lastly Luke, I would like to thank you for engaging with the community. I (we) really appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:57:28
You do understand that Bitmain makes most (if not all) the ASICs chip that process Bitcoin currently, right?
"If Bitmain's slaves don't manage to escape from Jihan's plantation, others will come as long as there are transactions to be mined on the BIP148 chain."
Maybe that will be true one day, but right now it isn't.
"Anyone who's not a Bitmain slave"

Technically, it won't have any impact, but emotionally, it does, on many "users". That's what I am talking about. My whole argument is about the human side of this debate, emotions, perception.
If you don't get it, I don't know what else I can do to make you understand the impact that it has.

That's a cute, overused, naive, revolutionary larping and idealistic retort. 
But once they decide to shut it all down, they will. There's no revolution going on, as much as you would like it to be. 
All of this is just a very tightly controlled experiment for the rich and powerful to learn from.
Just watch and see.

It's a number game. Like it or not. And as long as this is true, Bitcoin can be manipulated and influenced. As long as it relies on how many people said that X should do Y because Z said so, it is flawed. 
It's a fundamental flaw.
Number game = eventual and inevitable centralization.

I'm exploring hypothetical scenarios. We can debate and exchange ideas. I'm asking questions that I feel need answers, I'm not looking for a fight. So please be civil.

We must do anything that we can to prevent Bitcoin from becoming centralized.
The current trajectory is wrong and not headed in the right direction.
A change of PoW is the only solution (temporary until we find a long term solution, I agree). We need to find a solution that prevents custom hardware to dominate the ecosystem. Otherwise, Bitcoin will fail as a concept. It's so obvious ffs, I don't understand why it's not the only and most important talking point.
Side chain solution? Scaling debate? Who gives a fuck if we allow custom hardware to control it all.
We are ignoring the elephant in the room.
We need to solve this fundamental issue first. Absolutely nothing else matter until we solve this problem.

Let it all go to ZERO! luke-jr.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:13:00
UASF NOW! Let's make it happen. Tweet it to all your friends.
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:13:53
Bitcoin Core, Pretty please, with a cherry on top.
Change the PoW now.
Thank you. 
The Users (99% of the Bitcoin community).

This is what Bitmain and Jihan Wu are doing right now with Bitcoin:
**Selling Shovels in the New Gold Rush**
"Back during the 1849 California Gold Rush, few prospectors struck it rich. Most of the people who made money back then were those who “sold shovels” or provided other services to the same miners who traveled far to live hard lives panning for gold."
They produce the hardware, they create controversy and manipulate the market and they laugh all the way to the bank.
Rinse and repeat. Since 2013.

I'm not against hash power. It's a fundamental principle that supports the concept of Bitcoin. I am against centralization and monopoly. We can't ignore the fact that a couple of actors are currently controlling the entire market (80%?).
Bitmain produces the chip that process Bitcoin. They have an almost absolute control right now.
Do you think that this is a healthy market? And how do you propose that we solve this issue?
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:33:15
Enough is enough imo. If we are ready to accept a hard fork for whatever reason (UASF, etc). A PoW change should be the first step in getting rid of all these issues. 
The mother of all hard fork (the nuclear option).
Fuck all this drama. Let's just do it, and let's move on to a better and hopefully drama free world for Bitcoin (like so many alt coins already did).
This whole situation is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:25:18
Based on the value of proposition, Bitcoin is whatever we all agree it should be. Not what some people (the 1% miners) think it is.
Bitcoin can evolve. And this evolution should be controlled by the users. Not the miners.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:56:02
Change of PoW is the **only true and absolute solution**.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:52:09
They aren't scared at all.
Fuck Bitmain and their monopoly, seriously. What a joke that is.
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:03:07
Let me upvote you then! We need to be able to discuss about all of this. Like it or not. All opinions are valid. No one should be silenced.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:56:50
Just substitute the word "Miner" by "User" and I think the analogy is very well fitting. I know it's confusing but the analogy still stands.
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:22:49
Bitcoin Core, please change the PoW now! 
Fuck Bitmain and fuck Jihan Wu and his ASIC tech.
We beg you as a community. Free Bitcoin once and for all!
Please listen to us!
Do it. Now. 
/tongue in cheek

Do you want to mine Bitcoin? What are your options to do so today? Don't you think that there is something wrong with the fact that you are limited to buy this hardware from only a few manufacturers? You think that it's normal that only a couple of people (2-3 manufacturers) control the entire market? I don't understand why it's so hard to see.
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:14:00
It's not about patience anymore. We need influential people to be assertive. 
The only one so far that has been assertive in all this bullshit debate, is Luke-Jr. And Core blamed him from spending too much time on Reddit and speaking with us.
I personally applaud him, for taking a stance and engaging with the community, us "normies" on Reddit.
The almost absolute silence from Core is deafening and damaging. They are too neutral. 
They need to take a stance and support unequivocally the original principles that made Bitcoin what it is today. If they truly believe in these principles, they need to defend them.
I feel that they have lost control of the narrative. And I am not the only one to think that.
Wake up Core please and be more vocal, the future of Bitcoin is at stake now.

DEFINITION of 'JihanWu Bitmain'
The expression may have been derived from the California gold rush, where many of those who profited did so by providing the miners with picks, shovels and other equipment needed for gold mining. The idea behind pick-and-shovel plays is that, in the case of E&amp;Ps, for example, it doesn't matter if the E&amp;P Company finds oil and gas or not, they will need to purchase specialized equipment either way.
