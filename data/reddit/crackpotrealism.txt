If you didn't see the alt prices go down when btc dropped for major players like NEO and omg then you are as blind as those bch supporters.

So you want the long term success and stability of this coin jeopardized for your personal gain. I get the drive behind making money, but have some perspective....

greater than 60 out of 100 coins in the top 100 are down on that list. You are right. People, please don't trust users like Do your own research. Just because the top 15 of the top 20 is slightly higher does not mean the market is doing well.

Why do you think alts are suffering right now with Bitcoin down. It's a period of uncertainty and once we see a proper, "healthy" correction, Bitcoin will be back on top with the other alts. Your 8 MB block size hardly makes you special to anyone other than miners and the minority of people who want lower transaction fees in place of being an actual store of value that is necessary for a currency to thrive.
If you can't see that then go back to r/btc and stop fucking with us and crying when you get banned. Lightning is coming even more quickly than before with no2x, so your naysaying days are numbered, asshole.

That's assuming that no alt on exchanges has any long term potential which is completely, verifiably false.... you don't need to short alts or sell at the very peak to make money with them. Choose an alt with low market cap and a solid idea/team and you would make far more then the amount of time you waste on bitcoin. Unless you are investing fairly large amounts of money (in the hundred thousands or millions in usd) and you just want to be slightly safer with bitcoin then you are not utilizing the full potential of the market for long term trades. Assuming Bitcoin does succeed it will certainly not be alone at the top.

I think it's naive to think it won't be tested again.

Depending on how much you are investing that way of thinking is even more dumb. There is clearly more opportunity to grow your portfolio in alts than Bitcoin.

Kinda dumb because there is the real possibility that your coins will be locked up in the exchange for a day or two during which people (or whales) get a better deal on the altcoins that you dumped. 
In this case you miss out on an opportunity to make more money than however much you get from bgold.
