Thank you for watching and for an honest opinion.

Well, you're kinda right. This was on purpose, though, because as someone said: come for the money, stay for technology (or something like that). It's still mind-blowing to me, to be honest, that we witness such an event in a real life. 
But the main idea was to show how hard it would be to remember something like this and a struggle of being a "rich" man without an ability to access the goods. I was inspired by a true story and never intended to throw shade to the BTC as technology and potential. But thank you for the honest reply. I appreciate it and value it more than good replies :)

I was using the following lenses, but unfortunately, I already sold them: 
* Sony Zeiss 55mm 1.8
* Sony 16-35 f4
* Sony 24-70 2.8
The quality of the Sony camera is insane! I enjoyed to work with the camera, it's light, capable and durable. But if I was shooting today - I would probably choose a different setup.

Yes, you are totally right. The whole thing is such a bizarre and mystical phenomenon, with speculations and weird characters from Satoshi to Roger Ver. All of it definitely inspired me to push it through and share it with you, guys. The whole team worked very hard because we believe that BTC the future. Thank you for watching it and I'm glad you like it!

You're damn right, man! If I could redo it I would definitely choose to show the days only. Currently, the titles only indicating the space between cuts, and it seems to hard to comprehend. The timeline is linear (no back and forth cust) but in a reversed direction, except for the ending. This is the most confusing part that we couldn't figure out. But your suggestion would be very helpful on the time when editing was happening :)
And for what it's worth, this is our first short film and my debut as director/writer/editor and cinematographer.

You are too kind! Thank you! We submitted our film to SXSW but it was rejected. Will submit soon to grab more attention to the video and topic as well. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:18:01
Yeah, I know, it's confusing. But the story demands the time jumps revealing the plot.

Glad you like it, friend. And thank you for the kind words!

Thanks for the flattering comment! No one compared my work Tarantino and Black Mirror before :D I personally couldn't care less about SXSW, tbh. It was a team decision and I went along with it.


Sure thing! Send it to me and I'll take a look.

"The" means everything related to bitcoin as well. All the hopes and fears, if you will. But will not argue here, I'm not a native speaker and I'm still learning ;) Sadly, there is no way I can fix that already.

I know, this is not the perfect times for bitcoin, but I will submit this anyway. 
This is the first teaser for my upcoming short movie "Th3 Future" about Bitcoin I filmed this summer with my best friends. Very soon we will release the trailer, that will reveal more interesting details about the plot. Any thoughts so far? Would like to hear some feedback.
PS: Yesterday we tried to launch a viral post, but it miserably failed :D I still love it though...
