Hope 1Dorian4RoXcnBv9hnQ4Y2C1an6NJ4UrjX still works. Guess it won't hurt sending 2$ in XBT. 2$+(0.0001 XBT)0.06$ in transaction fee.

Great_Stefan it would help if you linked directly to the place where they talk about the topic you bring up. If you want replace your link with this one: 
It links directly to the place in the video where they talk about the issue you are bringing up here. You link to 00:00 which is at least 55 minutes too early ;)

How about  and Bitcoin the CryptoCurrency. If Bitcoin is available to all people as most posters agree to then it is also available to women and women gamers.

Don't argue. Now tell me about these ideas of yours... so we can begin getting constructive. What were they?

Do something constructive like telling your opinion. You could just have chosen not to answer. Explaining that you are "afraid" of this thread helps nobody. I have raised a similar issue on bitcointalk and all I got was hate. I'm used to this, but we must organize because unfortunately some parts of the community is against change. We must organize those who care about the issue. If you don't care please don't comment.

Let me know where that is so I can comment on it :)
