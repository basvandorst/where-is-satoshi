Disagree, plenty of things failed the first time around. 
If it's truly better money, people will want to use it, so they retain the value of their hard work. That's VERY fundamental. Self defense, protection of self interest is **primal**. If people want a better money bad enough, *there is no stopping it*. 
If *that* iteration of money is Bitcoin, specifically? Who knows. It could take 100 years. But if people DEMAND a non-fucked form of money/store of value, then they WILL get it at some point.

Agreed. If OP or anyone else went to a mall, or Walmart, or some social event and asked 1000 people if they're into Bitcoin, you'd get almost none that have. I've been in Bitcoin for nearly five years and I can count on 2 hands, the number of people I've talked to who own bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:44

No one knows the future. And you don't make money if bitcoin dies. Yes, you technically still have bitcoin. Lots of it. But then it would lose all fungibility and would cease BEING money. So you wouldn't have money. You would have bitcoin, and it would be worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:53:39

There are a lot of stupid people on the planet. Sorry, not sorry. So that's a fucking lot of dumb wives. (Dumb guys too, of course)
I don't know if she is or not, but it's certainly his/her right to think anyone who watches that show is dumb. They may or may not be, but the opinion is what it is.
All that aside, the idea that your wife (just because she is YOUR wife) can't do stupid things is pretty ridiculous. 
There's nothing wrong with judging people based on their actions. It's pre-judging them, or judging them based on things beyond their control, skin color, country of origin, sex, etc. that is wrong.
If you DO something I think is stupid, guess what I'm going to think you're stupid. And I'm not going to apologize for it.

Bitcoin is like gold, and like land. There's not going to be more than a finite amount. So the fact that some people own a lot more land than me, doesn't bother me. 
Sure, a whale could do a massive sell-off and that could drop the price when he does, but then those Bitcoin are now in the hands of "the many" so that "issue" is less of a concern in the future. And usually, such a price drop is just temporary.
So, I can see why you're concerned, I just think it's mostly for a day-trader to worry about. Because they might be on the wrong side of that crash. But a holder shouldn't be bothered, imo. I saw the rise from double digits, to $1200, to 200. And I held. Now I'm having a grand old time. Because I was not a weak hand.
Cheers. Keep learning. Never stop asking questions.

Look up what Ponzi means. All gold not still in the ground is owned, just like bitcoin. Does that mean gold is a Ponzi scheme?
What do you mean by "should have" half of the Bitcoin wealth? No one, necessarily, *should have* anything.
I find what you say to be pretty confusing, but I'm happy to help answer your questions. But you need to start with the definition of Ponzi and explain why you think bitcoin would fall into that category.

Nonsense. Fiat is a fairly new phenomenon in relation to the entirety of human history. So value exchange existed LONG before fiat ever did. 
If you own something and the value goes up (people willing to pay more for it, than you did) then the item has gained value. You don't need to sell it to *realize* the value. If you have a comparable for the value, then it is what it is. People will recognize the increased value without you needing to sell it, for that value to be established.

You say this as if being forced to elect someone to rule over you is moral to begin with.
Was there a vote taken on who you should marry, and if you didn't marry the elected member and follow all the rules the electorate set in place regarding your marriage, very bad things would happen to you? 
Would you support such a "system"?
People need to protect themselves against anyone or anything that would use violence against them. Just like a different fish needs to inflate, for it not to get eaten. Just like a gazelle needs to run really fucking fast, for it not to get eaten. Just like a lion needs strength and sharp teeth and claws, to be able to catch food and not die to starvation, and to be able to fight off a pack of hyena, and not die to their great numbers and even *stronger* jaws.
You either have the ability to protect yourself against an attack, or you don't. And if you don't, then you and your genetic line that ran since the inception of life on this planet, are now history.

Wow you're a nutjob. Who gets to control the inflation rate? You? Bitcoin was created AS A RESPONSE to this central planning, corrupt horseshit. Changing it to the same as a shitty Fiat would make bitcoin lose its most attractive use-case. Being free of that type of manipulation.

Not an argument. 
Bitcoin is oppositional to your whole ideology. Bitcoin would need to be destroyed/suppressed for your Communist Paradise to work, at all. That you don't even see that is evidence that you haven't even thought through it. If Bitcoin did exist, it would be destroyed by your fellow *comrades* controlling everything, because they NEED control and they *can't* control Bitcoin.
So you would take bitcoin into your ideological hellhole... where it would be killed off by the people who DO (you don't) understand the great threat it would be to their system. This, killing the fox.
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:48:40
No it's not a pointless distinction. And your misunderstanding all this time, and being angry about it changes nothing. Inflation literally means the increase of *the supply*.


You clearly don't understand.
Your example doesn't even include whether or not the money supply was inflated, i.e. more dollars were created and put into the supply. You're just saying the values fluctuated. But that could be caused by any number of things. Loaning money is not inflation. **Only** creating new money and putting it into the supply, is inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:57:16
Inflation means an actual increase of the money supply. The negative effects of inflation are well known, and people commonly, and incorrectly, call the *effects*, inflation. Values lowering relative to other goods or monies is NOT inflation.
Could someone do something that cause value  fluctuation that would be similar to the negative effects of inflation? Yes. But it wouldn't be "inflation".
Think of it this way, and consider this example *in a bubble*.
You have a 2-cup measuring container with 1 cup of molten gold in it. If you put more gold in the container, that's inflation. 
If the 1 cup of molten gold is worth less tomorrow, then it's lost value... but it wasn't inflated. It's just valued less for whatever reason/s.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:46:02
If you're talking about *price inflation*, then you can specify by using that term (or simply say price/cost increase, if that's all you're talking about). 
You can also Google and find the definition, exactly as I told you. Now what?
Inflating something literally means "to make bigger", so using that term to describe *making the money supply bigger* is MOST accurate.
When you inflate a balloon, are you adding gas to it, or are you making the balloon *cost more*? You know the answer.
And never have I heard someone describe prices dropping as *deflation*. Have you? People using the term incorrectly in your high school is not my problem. If your high school taught that 2+2=5, that wouldn't make it so.
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:12:21
So you like something that was created without the use of force, and now you want to inject it into a "use of force" system. 
That's like seeing and liking a really happy fox in the woods, and like him so much you want to see him happy every day. So you catch him. And you bring him to where you live. And you cage him, for his own safety... *of course*. But now he's not that happy fox anymore. He's not free to do foxy things, to live with his foxy friends and to make/bring more happy foxes into this world. You killed that happy fox. He will never be happy again, and his genetic line of Happy Foxism is dead. You and your force of power destroyed it, forever.
And you probably don't even see the irony, that *that* fox that you abducted for your own selfish pleasure, only existed because *someone else* hadn't taken him or his ancestors away before you did. Happy fox without happiness is the nullification of the precise thing that you appreciated. And you want to cage bitcoin, with your ideology, and your force over people...

What many mean by Globalism, is "global control" not simply global access or universality. 
Ex: Global Universality
The internet is pretty much global and that's awesome. It could be like China, and every country has their own network and they all have that shit locked down. But it's not. It's (nearly) global.
Ex: Global control. The Axis have won the war in *this* timeline, and they now have total global control. One government, one language, everyone is "equal" in that everyone is operating under the same set of rules.
One of those is fine, because it doesn't involve the use of force. The other is not, because it does. I just wanted to point out the distinction. 
The point that pretty much anyone on the planet can use bitcoin is pretty awesome!
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:05:25
Yes, then price has risen. You can just say that. You don't need to call it *inflation*, because it's not.
Just because some people use the term wrong, colloquially, doesn't make it so.
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:52:13
No it doesn't. Rising prices are an *effect* of inflation. Inflation merely, and specifically, means creating more dollars and putting it into the supply.
If I'm selling a used car for $2000 today, and decide to raise it to $2005 dollars, just because I feel like it, that's *inflation*?
Are you really saying that any price rise, for whatever reason, is "inflation" and any price decrease is "deflation"? 
Sorry, that's just wrong. Prices fluctuating  could be caused by any number of different factors. Lumping them all into the single term *inflation* is lazy and stupid, and would be meaningless. When you go to analyze a problem, and drop the label "inflation", what exactly are you talking about? No one would have a clue, because it's so broad.
Blowing up a balloon is inflation. The balloon being worth more, or less, is not.
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:28:53
Great principle. Totally agree. So what's wrong with OP simply informing us of this change? You know... so we actually have the information to be able to make a decision , exactly as you explaines we should be able to do?
Or do you not want people to have the information, therefore *breaking* your principle? Otherwise, I'm not sure what exactly you're criticizing. I didn't know about this policy change, and now I do.
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:10:07
It's not price inflation. Why do you need to say *price inflation* when you can just say *price rise*? Inflation literally means "making bigger".
The average price of milk going from $3.00 to $3.15 is not "making bigger". The cost rose. Period. It could be due to any number of reasons. *Maybe* because the money supply was "made bigger". Or maybe for other reasons, entirely.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:23:55
Yep, they control the interest rate. Wtf does that have to do with Bitcoin? I know quite well how it works. I just don't like it. You don't think the banks And the politicians getting paid off by them, is corruption? Tinfoil hat... funny. Everything I've said is actually proven which you'd know if YOU actual knew what you were talking about. Hello *bailout*!
I'm trying to control what? I'm trying to control nothing. No branch is a good branch. I'm not in your binary circle of what kind of policy is best... I'm outside of it. No control is best.

If you send coins to an exchange, you don't own those bitcoins. The exchange *owes you* that number of bitcoins--nothing more.

Almost everything is made in China,  because they're  doing it cheapest.  There's nothing wrong with that. And the miners,  generally, are getting delivered. I remember the bad days, years ago. Scam after scam, after late delivery, and fortunes lost. Hardware is MUCH better today.
Is "industrial" car or phone manufacturing a bad thing? No, it means better and cheaper goods. So I'm not sure what your argument is there.
Mining is not that centralized. Unless you're just looking at how there are a small handful of large pools. But those pools are just organization. The pool owner does not own the miners. There are thousands of individual miners and mining farms within each pool, and any sign of fuckery and they're gone. There are more individual miners and nodes now, than ever. And most importantly,  miners COST more than ever, which is a good thing, because people are more heavily invested in their success. These people are not hobbyists who happen to have a nice gaming gpu. These are people who WANT AND NEED their income, and for bitcoin to succeed.
The network is better off now because of those factors, MUCH better off than 2+ years ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:40

But you **know** bitcoin is going to trend down, so you'll be betting against it right? I mean, you'd be a fool to not bet against a *sure thing*, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:00:49
When did I ever say Bitcoin is exempt from market forces? That's absurd anyone would think that. You DO NOT know that Bitcoin is going to fail. Period.
People speculate with lots of things. Including other assets, and real estate. Does that mean those things are not actual value? No. Whatever something sells for in a free market IS established value. Everything that can be bought and sold has speculators involved. That doesn't mean the value isn't real.
Even if bitcoin's *only* utility was an asset class, that's a great purpose in itself.
If you're so certain about bitcoin's coming fall, I suggest you short it and make a killing. But I doubt you will put your money where your mouth is... like I have.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:10:23
Yes we all know Bitcoin is not a stable asset. But it's still mere opinion that it's stupid to do. Risky yes, that's objectively true. 
And maybe the guy owns a lot more wealth than we know. So with regards to the bigger picture, he wasn't even risking a substantial percentage of his total assets.
And no, stupid is not determined by the outcome, either way. I'm sure you'd FEEL stupid and regretful if Bitcoin went down 90% instead of up 90%, but that doesn't change the act at the time.
If the guy did his research, and his purchase was based on an educated assessment of the Bitcoin economy, then no that doesn't quality as stupid, imo. 
"Stupid" is usually associated with thoughtless, rash, emotion based decisions, or lack of information/intelligence/thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:52:08

Then that makes it more risky, but not any less thoughtful. Pointing a fake gun at a cop is stupid. Making an educated guess that an asset will rise in value,that you fully believe in and have spent lots of time analyzing can't fall into the same category, imo.

Ahh, a gambling comparison. I researched for months and made a call based on my assessment that Bitcoin is solid technology, and that I thought it would go up in value. 
I'm not a gambler. I hate gambling, it's moronic (house has an absolute edge). I never gamble. 
I could have sold at 200 or 500 or 1000 or 5000. And I'm not selling now.
Maybe I just know and understand more than you do right now. But I get the feeling you think the opposite...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:50
Sure you could. I could have come to the conclusion years ago that it was a bad idea, that it would die, or whatever. And I would have been wrong.
I've seen life-changing profits *because I'm correct* in my past assessment. And my risk assessment has not changed, in fact it's strengthened. Bitcoin is much stronger now, the infrastructure, the ease of aquiring, lots more exchanges, lots more vendor acceptance. All good stuff.
Sure, it could be a bubble. But you seem to operating under the assumption that it is a bubble. But you only *know* it's a bubble when it pops. Until then, *you're* merely speculating that it's a bubble.
We could have been having the exact same discussion about Microsoft stock back in the day, and we know how that turned out. Not all speculative assets turn out to be frenzy-fed bubbles. Plenty are just natural growth (with *some* speculation, of course).
And maybe there will be a Bitcoin bubble...up to 500k, and then the market settles around 200k... But we don't know if *now* is bubble territory. 
I remember when people said a future price of $1000 was crazy. And then then it happened, people said "bubble" then too. But no one is saying a thousand is still a bubble today, are they?
I totally appreciate your skepticism. I was incredibly skeptical, originally. But for you to say there are much better options, when you don't know what will happen, is kind of silly. You... giving that exact same advice 5 years ago, would have been TRAGICALLY wrong. All due respect.

Yes, in the sense that if you own an Australian island with a Lambo on it, it's your car. But you don't get to force the people of Australia to build a bridge (and eat the cost) so that you can drive the thing to a place that you can actually use it.
It's not exchanges' fault that suddenly there are tons of unusable Lambos sitting around all over the place.

It's not a moral issue. The exchange didn't sign up for the responsibility to create all the infrastructure for this split, and the 2nd coin that results. You can't force that responsibility on them. As previous poster said, people could have moved their coins to their own wallets so they could guarantee their preferred outcome. 
Dealing with that mess is a shit-ton of work. This is a reasonable compromise. Some exchanges aren't doing anything at all. You had 10 btc deposit? You still do...

Bitcoin is not a currency, it's actually *money* which is better than a currency. Currency is a placeholder of value. And the currency I'm guessing that you think is so great (USD) is always, constantly losing value. bitcoin is actually the thing of value being traded, not a placeholder.
So good luck with that. Go on and make your 1-10% gains. But please stop telling others what they should be doing, based on *your feels*.

There's almost no way price is getting that close and not going over in the next 30+ days. You're sunk. The only question is: condiments?

Not research about the future price of bitcoin, but rather the strength of it, i.e. the likelihood that it will fail, or that it is a scam, etc.

Yep, it's not just some random guy who sold, that people are pointing and laughing at. There was a good amount of Malice intent in addition to him just selling. The "hate" is kinda justified.

Ok, well it's on you to prove the intrinsic value, then. And if I can come up with an example that does not apply, then that breaks Universality, and it's not intrinsic. If something is *naturally valuable*, then it's valuable all of the time.
Usually when someone says intrinsic value, they're really saying there are multiple use cases, so whatever it is has multiple *reasons* that the thing has value. But that really has nothing to do with *natural* value.

Do people actually think those suits look good? Seriously, wtf.

Supreme..., really? 
Now I know I don't like all bitcoiners. What a sad discovery.

What value does gold have to a starving person on an isolated island? What if they're the last person on the planet? What if they were 100,000 years ago? A principle must be universalizable for it to have a chance at being true, and that means in all space *and time*. 
Nothing has intrinsic value, except perhaps water, as I imagine all living things need water in some form (?) But water is generally so available, that its value is relatively small.
Nothing , except bare essentials of life, has natural value. Oil didn't have *natural value*. Striking oil on your land was a bad thing, as it was a pollutant. But then, uses were found for it. And then it had tremendous value.

Cash them out.. with what exchange? I can't imagine there's any way that could have been automated.

Lost so much respect for him with his tribalist bullshit, science denial regarding race and IQ. 
Much *smarter* men have been into bitcoin *much* longer, anyways.
