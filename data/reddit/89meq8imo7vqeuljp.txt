Hey Scammer aka u/MemoryDealers , you feel it? ��
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:20:08
Roger is a scammer without a backbone. I am 100% positive that whatever he says the oposite is true. That goes for all of his paid channels of communication.

Its very nice to talk to a girl about bcash on bcash forum.  100% from Venezuela. /s

I like how roger sends people to ask these questions  when 10000 mark is here. He did that when 20000 was coming and he will be doing that at the footstep of every milestone. Graphs, speculations, scams, frauds. Thats what roger does, its his job, being a full time scammer.

If Mr. Kobayashi sold enough coins to cover creditos who requested CASH (I read that they are in majority-cant confirm 100%), it would be logical to redistribute BTC to people who requested crypto.
“Now that all bankruptcy claims have been accepted or rejected, henceforth, I wish to proceed to the distribution process as soon as possible,” concludes the 18-page trustees’ report. “At present, the possibility of carrying out a distribution and the timing and method thereof, has not yet been determined. — 
—&gt;I will continue to consider whether, in the case where a distribution is possible, a distribution will be made by way of distributing BTC.” &lt;—

Innovative scamming

I tell you how. Roger obviously had coins there. So Mark gave OUR coins back to Roger Ver and some exra bonuses for saying Mtgox is fine.
You people realize that the BCash fork and other Rogers projects are fueled with OUR STOLEN MONEY/COINS ?
Absolutely disgusting
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:25:12
Yes , Roger did.
Rogers projects and forks are paid with OUR money which I find absolutely disgusting. That scammer telling people what to do...unbelievable.

I am waiting for Litecoin to be added on MtGox. Right after they launch Midas LOL
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:48:55
Hi Mark,
How much money or many bitcoins did Roger Ver receive for saying  : MtGox is solvent ?
