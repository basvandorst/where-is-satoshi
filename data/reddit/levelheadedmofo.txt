It does look like a legit email and all, but I feel like it may just be a canned response that they use as a way of retaining customers (preventing the loss of customers to overstock.com in this case).
(Anyways, it looks like OP is not fag)

God damn so much selling.

I agree, but you're not going to get anywhere with this individual (see their comment history).
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:31:35
You have only avoided responding to the question and attacked the individual instead.

Fake as fuck.
1) Improper grammar
2) Amazon is not going to give you insider information like this.
3) No email headers w/DKIM gtfo.

Shit happens man, don't sweat it too much. If you still have the drive, you might be able to recover the data.

Looks like a lot of confused selling at 2:30PM ET. People can't read time zones.

Honestly, if you don't have "a lot" of bitcoin, you probably don't need the extra security of an actual hardware wallet (with physical buttons, etc).
You could get by with a USB stick that you keep physically secure somewhere.

I am kind of skeptical on whether it has actually ended.

I do agree with the other response (nobody knows the future).
If the larger pattern holds, maybe we'll see a dip to around 5400-4800 somewhere around Nov 16. Or, maybe not. What do I know?

There's absolutely precedent. Honestly, some people seem to not fully understand what that word means.

Your post was really lacking in content as I recall.
I do agree though that 6k has proven to be a tough barrier, and it's entirely possible that we have peaked for a time.
(I actually think it will go higher, eventually.)

Pretty much, yes. It's a very simple method of cold storage that can be done in various ways.
I guess it depends on what you want to do. The other comments are pointing you towards products that you may not even need (no one has asked what functionality you would like to get out of a hardware wallet).
