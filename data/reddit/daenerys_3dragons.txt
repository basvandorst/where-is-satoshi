Bitcoin has a number of defects which are likely to result in it failing to be the long term winner in crypto-space. If you are investing for the long term (5-10y) it is a good idea to look at the altcoins. Unfortunately asking the question here in r/bitcoin is a bit like going to a Ford car dealership and asking them which other manufacturers make good cars. You will get biased (and stupid) responses which suggest that only bitcoin is useful and all altcoins are rubbish/scams/ponzi/doomed to fail, etc.
Thinking logically it is clear this is nonsense. Bitcoin may have been "first to market" but as a result we have become aware of its defects. Some altcoins are attempting to solve some of bitcoins problems, you need to look carefully at the details of their protocol,mining rewards,transaction handling and attempt a "thought experiment" to see which will scale up for real world use. In addition it is very important to look at the background of the people and/or companies behind the altcoins as some are simply out to make their promoters money.
We suggest you do all this research yourself rather than rely upon anyone else's opinion (which may be biased shilling) 
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:57:25
You are wrong. Check out the bitcoin wiki under "weaknesses" and it is clear that you cannot change everything about bitcoin, only certain things. If one or more of those defects in bitcoin are holding it back from real world mass market use then it will be some other coin that can be tailored to suit that will win the race in future crypto space.
there are a nice variety of alternative things being tried in the altcoins and quite a few are directly because you cannot easily get the feature into bitcoin. What suits the very small world of geeky agorist libertarian bitcoin enthusiasts here on r/bitcoin is highly unlikely to be the flavour that appeals to Mr.Joe Public.
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:31:44
Yeah, 'cos bitcoin is so useful as a currency but apparently you are only allowed to "trade" it one way !  The transparency of this overt shilling and overriding desire to "profit" from ever increasing valuation against the $ is amazing !
I suspect very few of you on here are, like me, true enthusiasts of the idea of crypto, most of you are self serving greedy people out to simply "get rich quick". 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:45:05
The Sage of Omaha quite rightly pointed out for many decades the irrelevance of his stock price per unit when you were investing a set amount of money and therefore buying a set % of the company however he relented many years later and introduced the "B" shares albeit with a very novel one-way convertible option.
I am actually quite surprised that your general people had that opinion, are you sure they still do not have those lovely media pictures of real round metallic bitcoins rattling around in their heads ? (might explain it).
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:26:15
Good luck with it. We found this a very interesting exercise which we started over 40 years ago to assist us with stock market investing in the UK. The more we work on it the better it gets generally although there is the occasional glitch when we have unexpected major market movements.
Bitcoin seems to have a much better % predictor accuracy than some other stuff and we think this is due to the fact that it is a very new thing and also massively driven by human psychology (there is no underlying profit driven company to consider ). Neither does it behave like commodities which are products with real world use. One might have thought the gold price was the nearest analogy and we do use that as an input but it only contributes a small % to the bitcoin predictor i.e. the historical comparison shows only a little in common.
For these reasons we do trade bitcoin relatively cautiously using CFD mainly and rarely bitcoin itself as we are suspicious of the predictor being so accurate and think it might come unstuck sometime. So far so good tho' and generating nice profits. 
Of course one still needs to have the right frame of mind to trade bitcoin (and anything else) and I suspect many r/bitcoin users are not cut out for this kind of thing judging by their posts, too much "panic" and too much "inexperience". For newbies we suggest playing at virtual trading for 3-6 months before putting real money in and then only put in an amount you are comfortable to lose entirely (which is quite likely for newbies).

@_date: 2014-05-05 08:15:45
Clearly a nonsensical attempt to shill it up ! 
All my analysis both technical (charts) and wider crypto-space news/developments indicate a 80-90% probability of bitcoin BTC/$ dropping through $400 within the next 19 days and a 50/50 chance of it testing $200-250 within the next 30 days. Far too risky to buy now unless you see at least 5 days continuous increasing highs on significant volume. This may well mean you will be buying at $500+ but will be far less risky than piling in now when there is such a significant probability of $200 region shortly.
TL:DR We can afford to wait for it to go lower.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:43:34
It does not seem to be dedicated to bitcoin if you follow the content of r/bitcoin which I have done for over a year. There have, e.g. , been thousands of words about pornography and drugs to name just 2 non-bitcoin subjects. Doesn't bother me one bit, what does though is this isolated insular attitude that bitcoin is the only relevant cryptocurrency which, to any sensible outside observer, it most certainly is not. If you are interested in the fantastic possibilities of cryptocurrency and have money invested in bitcoin you would be very silly not to be interested also in the developments taking place elsewhere, in other coins, in infrastructure and companies not specifically "ony bitcoin". This is just common sense. 
Attempts to shut out these kind of things because they are "off topic" or "belong to another sub" are really doing the bitcoin community and investors a disservice. sure specific detailed discussions of some aspect of doge should be in its own sub but we should be happy to discuss the same topic if, e.g. it has some relevance to bitcoin.
You say bitcoin is an extremely promising idea and I agree but i also say cryptocurrency (in general) is an extremely promising idea and you will find that many of the big investors now getting involved are talking about "bitcoin and other digital currencies", "cryptocurrency", etc. This is a fact and we need to wake up to it and embrace it here.
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:21:25
This is correct but also applies to all other altcoins, etc. So if we discount their price and hence market cap we can see they are at least as interesting as bitcoin. In fact maybe more so as they search around trying to solve some of bitcoins problems.
This helps to highlight the possibility that in the future, say 5-10y, it is increasingly likely that bitcoin itself will not be the winner in crypto space.
Price and speculative trading will not decide the question of which crypto-currencies are the most suitable for real world use by the mass market populace. It will be safety, ease of use and other features. And I suspect a crypto pegged to fiat is going to be very attractive to many.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:29:54
Soooooo, we "pretend" we have lost all our (their ?) fiat and really we have stashed it away in anonymous untraceable bitcoins which we can then access from anywhere in the world without anyone knowing about it.

@_date: 2014-05-26 11:02:20
Snowball = rises contributes to rises = speculative bubble.
It will actually be BAD news if we have another bubble burst its guts all over the BTC/$ chart.
My recommendation, if you want to make good money out of bitcoin, is to trade it not as bitcoin itself but as CFD (contract for differences) on somewhere like Plus500. This is far more profitable than trading/holding bitcoin directly and has the advantage that you are not exposed to the risks of having bitcoins stolen/hacked or exchanges going bust (dishonestly or otherwise).
Sure, buy and keep some bitcoin as a long term investment for its potential to "go to the moon" but then use any extra spare income you have to trade it on Plus500. Go and have a look, it has served us very well over the past few months and you can make money when the bitcoin price is going down as well as up.
@_date: 2014-07-04 17:21:08

Not new at all, been watching for ages, and reading, and researching. As mentioned to another redditor I make no mention of current BTC/$ in my post. It is the PROBLEMS with bitcoin that have caused its price crash, these problems remain largely unsolved and there has been very little serious effort to address them over the last year. 
As bitcoin has become more mainstream and more "investors" attracted to it the problems have multiplied and generated masses of bad press.
I firmly believe a crypto of some sort will, eventually, be very important in the world, but it will not be this one.
@_date: 2014-07-13 22:08:11
Not stabilized at all, your window is too small time wise. Our computerised prediction is that it will be trending downwards for the next week or 2 until it reaches low 500 / top 400 region.
There are several negative indicators not least of which is the excessively high $3M or so staked on Bitfinex CFDs at ridiculously high loan rates of c0.5-0.8% per day which are due to unwind over the next 2 weeks. Many were staked bets when we were $666 or higher recently and a lot of people are going to come unstuck with an associated price fall quite rapidly at one point. Watch the charts and see if I am right !
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:02:43
Relevant and important news will not be found only in biased pro-bitcoin publications/sites/etc. You need to look wider to get a true picture of what is happening in the world of crypto-currencies. I note, with interest, that many pro-bitcoin sources are very sparing in their coverage of the wider crypto scene and the many altcoins about. This is quite "interesting" considering how many of the bitcoin exchanges have a very wide offering of altcoin prices and also recent surveys which show that about 40-60% of bitcoin hodlers also own other altcoins !!

Our trading predictor algorithm can be set to look 6m and 1y ahead although quite obviously the possible values and probabilities are normally quite wide.
Our price predictor generally has an 80 % success rate with BTC/$ and has proved very profitable for us so far. Total profit now exceeds $135K. We use the predictor to trade BTC CFDs mainly (contracts for differences) on the company Plus500. Do have a look if you are interested, there are also other companies with CFD bitcoin trading available. 
We have got predictor figures for 30/11/14 and 30/5/15. Owing to the 80% success rate so far we feel these are a lot better than guesses but of course they could be significantly in error as there is at least a 20% chance they are wrong.
For 30/11/15 our computerised algorithmic predictor suggests a 70-75% probability of trading in the range of $220 to $480.
For 30/5/14 we get a 75-80% probability of trading in the range of $80  to $330. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:43:24
Probably not according to our predictor algorithms but it's showing about 80% chance of consolidation or falls compared to further increases so there is a possibility we may enter a bull phase. Market needs watching carefully right now after such a massive move in a short time.

The reality is Bitcoin has had 2-3 years to get itself "fixed" and has failed because too many players in the game are just in it to make money and not to promote a new world currency. The next few months will be critical, I suspect a government or financial organisation may well trump the game with a new crypto before Bitcoin gets any improvements even if Bitcoin does survive the Mt.Gox situation and the masses of negative publicity that will be coming over the next couple of weeks.

Try to understand you do not a)Have any coins and b)Store coins in wallets.
Bitcoin is "virtual" and if so called coins exist anywhere it is only on the blockchain (i.e. the ledger or transaction record). The only thing you store is the secret "passwords" to prove to the system that you have the right to alter a particular entry on the ledger (spend it). This is VERY FUNDAMENTAL to the idea of bitcoin (and all other cryptos) and if you understand that properly you will be better prepared to look after your investment.
@_date: 2014-02-22 08:39:02
I agree with the gernerality entirely, my point is that this particular crypto, Bitcoin, is effectively dead and the sooner we move on the better.

Well you must be living on a rather different planet then as everybody I speak to about it considers this extremely important.


You hold a very strange view about everyone in government. surely you do not believe that they are all only interested in their careers ?
There must be plenty of examples of powerful politicians doing something which they think is important / helpful to society and sometimes they succeed sometimes they do not. If you really do hold the view you profess I suspect you see no point in voting either (?).
Also you do not have to be a technocrat to think about cryptocurrency, you just have to examine the pros and cons with respect to consumers, companies, merchants, society, government, etc.

In general before attempting any kind of dissertation on any subject at any level one should have the initiative to do ones own research.

Bitcoin may need A bitcoin foundation. it does not need THE (existing) bitcoin foundation.
This should be disbanded and we should have a new democratically elected foundation where each holder of 1 (or more) bitcoins has 1 vote. i.e. if you have 10btc = 1 vote, 1,000,000 btc = 1 vote. this sholuld ensure sensible results.
also we want all prospective candidates fully vetted for criminal or immoral activities in their past. Only honest upstanding citizens need apply.

If bitcoin were to ever reach the point of replacing the dollar it will have to go through a considerable period where it is running along-side  (competing ?) with the dollar. It is inevitable that there will be regulations imposed and , in part, these will be intended to protect consumers. It will be a matter of interesting debate as to whether any specific rules are being applied fairly or whether there is an interpretation of "protectionism" for existing fiat. I suspect regulators will be rather more concerned at protecting existing fiat holders because they are, of course, in the vast majority.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:50:07
On a 5-10y timeframe I think there may well be several fiat linked cryptos as it is unlikely individual countries will want to lose control of their own financial systems but there will be advantages in a digital version. In addition there will be a demand for one or more independent cryptos like bitcoin. I suspect more than 1 as there are different areas in which certain features might be beneficial. I am thinking of large value commerce and import/export being 2 of those areas as well as the normal value commercial transaction we all do day to day.
Certainly many of existing alts offer nothing special compared to bitcoin and are effectively "clones" but there are a few improvements / tweaks which have been tried in an attempt to solve some of bitcoins problems.  There are some alts which are more innovative which merit keeping an eye on.

"Earnings" is the wrong word - I think you mean speculative profits. There are 2 points :
1)You got a real world benefit (the stereo) because you SOLD some BTC , i.e. not hodling.
2)All parties come to an end eventually so please be careful and don't end yours feeling sick.
The $500 level did not hold overnight and trading volumes are generally very low. There is little follow through buying driving the price forward right now and still the daily overhang of mined coins. Players in the market who have bought over the last 24 hrs may be back for more today but they may not. The general trading level over the next 24 hrs will be critical as to whether this new higher level will hold (say $500 +/- 15), if it does not we view the market as weak to bearish and expect a fall back towards $450.

An interesting perspective, somewhat different to a lot of the opinion expressed on here.  You are right in identifying the ease of movement issue with cryptos, provided there is a useful market value either via exchanges into fiat or others willing to take the crypto for goods/services then this works well. There are no restraints at present in moving Bitcoin and I suspect it may well be difficult if not impossible for any authority or government to impose any unless they make it "illegal" to hold bitcoin or transfer it. Therefore this movement of value is certainly a unique benefit, which would apply to any crypto. Bitcoin of course seems more established now than the rest so if you wanted to move/store value it would seem to be the best one to choose but, does the wild fluctuation of price mitigate against this use of the crypto. I suspect it may work both ways, some see it as risky in thinking they can lose as the value fall on the other hand some may like the idea as they think they may get high % gains (as some have done in the past). 
So if you are right, and increasing BTC/$ price is the driver the question I would ask you is how long can the price keep rising and at what kind of rate ? Surely it is self evident that you cannot have a continually increasing graph ?

Brilliant ! So if the price is not important and might be $50 obviously it would be a bad idea to buy some and hodl it, and if we own some already let's sell before we see it go to $50 and make a loss. OK that's done, all BTC sold, no more to be bought.

I am not working for them but I agree it is higher risk (if you are inexperienced).

There are of course other companies around that allow you to trade bitcoin CFDs. If you think it might suit you it costs nothing to investigate the possibilities.

I cannot believe after all this time, and numerous posts (in the hundreds !!) that people are still ignorant of the necessary security and procedures for handling real world hard earned money held in virtual bitcoin. Surely it is obvious by now that you have to get 100% on top of this.
We have 2000 BTC as a long term (highly speculative !!) investment but it matters not one bit that I tell you this for there is no evidence of any bitcoins (no wallet data, no keys, no SHA256 hashes of anything, nothing that looks remotely like bitcoin passwords, etc ) on ANY of the computers I use at home or work . 
For long term hodling:
Always use cold storage , physically distributed hardware, use multiple backups, encrypt data with either a secure commercial system or your own version, keep paper records in a highly secure place(s)in case you suffer a brain injury or death and make sure you know who you trust absolutely with the recovery plan.
The only possible point of failure in this is the "trusted person(s)" but if you are prepared to go it alone (i.e. lose your BTC if you become demented AND don't care what happens after your death) then even that can be eliminated.

When something is perceived to be falling in value and/or going out of fashion you will find that the retailers, distributors and wholesalers run down their stock instead of replenishing it . This is because they do not want to be left holding something that is difficult to sell and/or worth a lot less than they paid for it.

I made a statement about simple business commonsense and you then say something about me having a belief in absolute failure. 
Well, yeah, you sure did read that wrong then. Where do you get these mad ideas from !!!!!
BTC may have some properties of a currency but also has some of a commodity and for a considerable number of traders as a simply speculative vehicle for making money. With all these scenarios it is perfectly feasible to consider "running down" a bitcoin inventory if one perceives a substantial fall in either (or both) value and interest. And I did not suggest anyone was "shitting their pants"(your words), might be a perfectly sane rational behaviour. We trade every day (not bitcoin, other things) and we don't get "emotional" like that even with the occasional daily 4 figure loss.

For anyone out there who thinks they have the ability to predict the bitcoin price (and I am sure there are many who are good at it) we suggest you not only put your money into bitcoin itself but also trade bitcoin CFDs (contracts for differences). We have done very well out of it since October 2013 and have turned $5K into over $124K which is, of course, much better than any direct investment into bitcoin would have achieved whatever price you got in at over that timescale.
Have a look at trading, CFDs, etc, it will probably suit quite a lot of you. We use a company called Plus500 but there are others of course. Plus500 lets you set up an unlimited virtual account so you can test your skills first before going live with real $. also there is, of course, no risk of exchanges going broke or having your bitcoins stolen when you trade like this.

Our analysis of recent exchange data would tend to suggest a small number of players in the market have made a small number of large buy trades. It is certainly not general increase in volume which remains relatively low though of course a few individual trade "spikes" do increase the average.
Naturally a few large buys will push the price up but it didnt hold at the high and has fallen back about 50% as I write. We think todays close will be interesting, does it come as a new closing high for a few days or not. If it does will tomorrow close higher.
Rather too early to go bullish yet we think, would like to see both rising volume generally (not spikey !) and a few days of increasing closing highs, say 5 days worth . in the meantime we stick to our prediction of trending lower with a high probability of a break below $400. However this spike is interesting and we will run our algorithm predictor tomorrow after we see todays close and final trading vulumes on the main US exchanges.

Who is this idiot ? In the first 3 paragraphs you can spot the logical errors !
The reality is that the exact same arguments, graph comparisons. etc could have been applied to many known past bubbles/scams/ponzis so if you are going to put forward a logical argument to prove "bitcoin is not a bubble" you have to test it against the tulip bubble, etc and other past known phenomena. Only if you can show your ideas do not apply to any of them and do apply to bitcoin do you stand a chance of having something useful to say.

Yes, I know, just repeating my point that one should not only invest affordably but also diversify risk i.e. don't just go all-in on bitcoin but consider the wider picture. I am a firm fan of the idea of crypto-currency and expect it to be very important in the future (5-10y timescale) but I doubt that bitcoin will be the long term winner and expect there to be several major cryptos in use by 2020-2025. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:27:00
There are already many different cryptos with their own communities, there are already multiple exchanges where at least 10 different cryptos can be exchanged, there are already merchants which take more than one crypto. The direction in which the real world is moving is obvious and should be obvious to all r/bitcoin too ! So why do so many of you continue to deny the facts ?

Nice post. As I have often been called a moron (or worse) by fellow redditors I hope you won't mind if I have my threepence worth here !
If your aim is to make money, i.e. treat bitcoin as an investment and you are confident you can call its direction then you will be massively better off if you trade bitcoin on CFD (contract for differences) on somewhere like Plus500.
The comparison between trading bitcoin directly and as CFD is a no brainer, and you do not have to worry in the slightest about dishonest exchanges folding, 2FA security, hacks, loss of personal data, verification, etc,etc. 
If you want to make money out of bitcoin as a long term investment e.g. you think it will reach $100,000  (go to the moon !) then you are better off just buying the maximum amount you can afford right now (whatever the price) and then leaving it, going away, forgetting about it for 1/2/3 years or whatever.
Just make up your mind before you start and stick to it !
Of course, you could do both, buy the maximum you can afford right now, then, with any extra spare money you have later get into trading it. This will give you the opportunity to make nice profits (income) while most of your wealth is sitting safely in "cold storage" for the long term.

It all depends on what you are trying to achieve and why ?
Simply want to make money ?
Believe bitcoin is going to the moon ?
Think bitcoin will be the long term winner in crypto-space in 5-10y ?
Want to experiment with it, buying things, using it ?
It all depends, my friend. FYI we run a trading algo for predicting the price to assist us with trading bitcoin CFDs on Plus500. Last month we were spot on, this month we predicted 480-520 by the end of August, also there already at only mid-August. To be honest we are now totally out of the market as the behaviour is worrying, as are stories of exchange manipulation. In other words the risks now exceed our comfort zone. We consider there is a significant probability of a serious crash to a low level in any market that behaves like this and our predictor algo suggests $200-260 may be seen within the next 14 days. It also suggests a bounce back to $550-650 is a possibility. These kind of figures and probabilities are very uncomfortable and we would be inclined to wait until either $550 clears and goes up for 2 consecutive days or $300 is cleared on the upside after a lower bottom.

This is due to the increasing use of multiple accounts by individual posters and super-multiples (10-200) by certain vested interest groups/organisations who wish to manipulate the sub.
It has become "necessary" for certain groups/people (you know who you are) to do this as they attempt to manipulate the price ever upwards. Unfortunately now still resting at only 50% or so of the ATH where it has been (or below) for 6 months. They are getting desperate now !!

Although Bitcoin is indeed the most popular of current cryptos there are over 200 alt-cryptos now in existence. One might say why do the holders/users of those alternatives not choose "the most popular". Clearly there are attractions for some in using something other than Bitcoin so best not get too obsessive about the "most popular" tag.
Although Bitcoin is popular in its tiny community of enthusiasts it is an insignificant percentage of the population at large and also an insignificant number compared to Google/Amazon customer base. 
IF someone like Google started their own crypto they could design it to have fewer defects and more attractive features tailored to their customers, they could offer security/insurance for their own crypto, they can promote it for virtually zero cost and I suspect that in a very short time period (if their customers like it) the user base would be higher than Bitcoin. They may not care very much if it does not get wider use outside Google/Amazon to start with but if it does take off they can form alliances with other large companies who could use their coin. As Bitcoin has a fragmented promotional system (many companies of different sizes) as opposed to one large company I doubt Bitcoin could compete in such a scenario.

Very nice run up to nearly $600 trounced us a nice 1200%+ profit on CFDs but our predictor thinks it's too unstable now so we are out of the market for a while till we see how it goes. Suspect much potential profit taking waiting to materialise as $600 escaped us and it trends down. Bullish sentiment suggests a new base at around $520 +/- 5% could be established over the next week or so. The bearish scenario suggests a fall below $500. A tricky decision we fear if you like to trade, perhaps less so if you have bought recently and are looking longer term (hodler).

If you bought at, say, $400 in November 2013 you are showing a 50% profit. Very nice !
If you trade bitcoin actively as we have done and been successful you will be showing rather more. We trade it on Plus500 as CFDs (contracts for differences). In the last 6 months we have turned capital of about $10K into over $68K profit. Rather more than a simple 50% gain.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:30:27
No, you are too early, a few more days to go according to our algorithms and don't forget I said they show a 80-90% chance of a break through $400 on the downside, the probability window is about 15 days from now. And I did say that, of course, we may be wrong. no predictive algorithms will be 100% successful all the time but we like ours as it has been 85% accurate on bitcoin over the last 14 months and given us a 5-figure profit.

At the present time there is no benefit to the consumer/buyer and a small benefit to the retailer/seller of probably less than 1% by the time all associated costs are taken into account. this is currently boosted a bit by extra custom and free advertising for newly adopting retailers owing to the novelty and high level of enthusiasm of bitcoin enthusiasts who like to promote their crypto.

Yes, I suspect a large proportion of the "Bitcoin is the One" brigade are rather more interested in propping up their rather dodgy investment as they are now showing a significant $ loss. For the record I own no bitcoin or other cryptos and never have, but I do admit to making a tidy sum on bitcoin CFD when I rode it up from $400 to $1000. Since then have stayed out of CFD as perceived as too risky for me.

There are as many possible values as there are hodlers. There are also a large percentage who expect it to fall in price and/or die. We hope you have taken all this into account before putting your real hard-earned money into buying any BTC.
"Investing" in bitcoin (by buying some) is a highly speculative thing to do so as always the advise is to not put in more than you can afford to lose. i.e. if it does go to $0 it won't hurt your real world financial postion (ability to pay your bills !).
Many suggest that the outcome is likely to be binary i.e. there is a chance you will either lose it all ($0) or be massively rich ($100000). The upside looks great but the downside is shite if you have over-invested or gone "all-in".
What are the real probabilities ? No one knows but existing holders will of course continually attempt to talk it up (blatant shilling sometimes). Personally we think the main problem which the enthusiasts have overlooked is the total unsuitability of bitcoin for use as a currency in the real world.
Yes there are a few  places you can use it to buy goods or services but this is a tiny percentage of real world businessess which is growing very slowly. On a 5-10y timeframe it might become better but I suspect that there will be some real serious competitors in the market by then.
There are already over 250 altcoins and you can bet some large retailers like Amazon will be working in this area possibly intending to launch their own cyrpto-currency.
Even if bitcoin does become more widely used there is nothing to guarantee that its value (BTC/$) will increase as utilty has a weak correlation to price at present and there is no sound economic theory to suggest this is bound to change. It might / it might not .  The suggewstion that the number of bitcoins being limited to 21M makes them scarce is a fallacy. How many satoshis are there in 21M ? More than enogh little "bits" to deal with massively more real world utility without affecting the value at all. Don't forget price has dropped from $1200 to $400 while both the utility and the network has grown.

I have dipped into the wiki but it would merit more study . In general it might well be good advice for all holders of bitcoin to a)Study said wiki and b)Read Satoshi's paper . I try to add to my bitcoin knowledge when I have the time.
Your point about developers is very interesting. I also have an interest in the restoration of ancient computers and although the working groups do have some substantial assets of software, machine code, compilers,and programmes with run results it is quite a task to reverse engineer a working museum exhibit. No documentation as to what does what - a real challenge. In some cases it looks like only one or 2 people were responsible for code writing and we think they kept all the "plans" in their heads. Perhaps a mistake by the companies that employed them not to insist upon full documentation not least to insure against the "he was run over by a bus this morning" scenario.

Yes, two very important points. It is the non-clones that are the most interesting. I also particularly like tree ledgers like eMunie not least because the size of a linear blockchain like bitcoin will become well into terabyte size if it gets mass use and who is going to wait to download all that (or be able to) !
Tweaking of bitcoin is indeed limited to certain possibilites due to the structure of the protocol and in addition it becomes harder to tweak as adoption increases and the block chain and infrastructure grows. I have actually been very disappointed in the poor response of bitcoin's dev team to all the difficulties bitcoin has seen over the last year - very slow !

Correct me if I am wrong but surely the protocol configuration of the ledger in a tree or a chain is fundamental to the way each crypto works and it would not be possible to change mid-stream from a chain based ledger to a tree based one or vica-versa. If you have a crypto running , say, a tree and want to change then the only way is for a coin1 swap to a coin2 which all holders would have to agree to and to close down coin1 when finished. A scenario which would seem to have a rather low probability of success in the real world.

The OP has hit the nail on the head here, we actually do not need or want the speculative investors in bitcoin we just need to support the idea without all this buying/selling. It will be much less stressful as there will be no worry about our hard earned $ going up and down all over the place.

That is the psychology argument but we saw sub $400 before and now many of the hodlers who got in around there or a bit after will be seeing a loss looming on the horizon. My bet is that many will be offloading as $400 approaches and they won't be coming back in till somewhat lower. 
Our tech' analysis confirms this, support points have now been broken and there is a high probability of falls much lower than $400. Technically the support point below $400 is about $138. It will only take one or 2 pieces of "bad" news to coincide with a sub-$400 trade to shove it right down.

Step back a bit and look at it from the outside. It is clear to anyone with a modicum of common sense that Bitcoin has been beset by numerous problems, bad publicity, etc for a long time. It is not suitable as a crypto for use by the ordinary coinsumer (sic). Far too complicated, not secure, unregulated exchanges and so on. Really Bitcoin is now dying, quite quickly in fact. A newer and better crypto is coming, designed from scratch , without bitcoins defect.

It is likely that some large company or even government is already inventing the new improved crypto (with better security) and it will be launched, get mass market appeal and Bitcoin will be left behind as a plaything for computer geeks who can see who can steal the most coins this week. You have really dropped the ball by allowing the wonderful design of Satoshi to become so badly tainted by all this dishonest activity. Your loss, NewCrypto's gain.
In the eyes of the general public (outside of this cosy little enclave of enthusiasts) Bitcoin is not liked, not trusted and it never will be.

Good advice. I suspect the vast majority, over 95%, of all current BTC volume/value transaction is trading/investing and you cannot establish a new "currency" unless it becomes widely used for the purchase of goods and services.
Without actual usage this thing is simply a speculative vehicle - hence the wide ranging volatility.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:02:37
In the real world 99.99% of companies will not be arsed to go through all this shite. they use the currency of their country or their customer/supplier or Euro/$ and the normal fiat-fiat conversion/exchanges. Reporting/accountancy is thus simple.
It has always been possible for companies to trade using other instruments, e.g. gold but they don't bother to do so. 
Why would they ? So now ask yourself why they would have any interest in using bitcoin ? 99.99% of them won't. What do the companies who like/want to use bitcoin have in common ?

Life itself is not so much of a gamble it is what people do that is gambling. We do not say that your cat with a typical life of 15y is gambling, it is just living. Humans also just live but they make choices some of which are gambles and this thread is a financial discussion therefore we are talking about, specifically, finacially gambling and as such the talk is about financial matters . So it is not that I have a financial mindset (which I do not) but it is the topic of this discussion.
Excessive greed is a reasonable description of those who have put a high percentage of their wealth into any one thing in the hope of making a very large gain, it has nothing to do with me or my "greed for dollars" (actually I have no dollars today !).
You are right that all investments are gambles but the degree of gambling i.e. degree of risk, varies depending on (amongst other things) overall financial situation of the investor, % in the "stock", time frame, volatility, etc. On any sane view of bitcoin it has to be considered fairly high up the risk tree THEREFORE anyone with a relatively insecure financial position should not be putting a high % of disposable income into it.

No, I think you are wrong on several counts. The size of the bitcoin community may be large now in terms of crypto enthusiasts but the reality is this is a tiny infinitesimally small community in the real world of finance (hence your point is irrelevant).
The developers have failed miserably to tweak the problems out of Bitcoin, and they have had the time ! Testing has revealed numerous weaknesses (still unfixed).
A new entrant will quickly take off and rise above Bitcoin if it is easy for ordinary members of the public to use. Your comment about damage and fiat devaluation is really just airy-fairy nonsense. Fiat devaluation is a very slow process and a useful mass market crypto will penetrate exceedingly rapidly compared to that. 
There is no "if" about Bitcoin failing, it is failing now. But the other copycat cryptos are still here and anybody can start a new one tomorrow. There is virtually no entry barrier. I see no reason why a new, well designed crypto, easy to use by the general public and promoted with a bit of publicity should not quickly exceed Bitcoin's current (lower than it was !!) market cap.

Are you suggesting that in some way bitcoin is "professional" because it appear to me that:
a)It has been set up anonymously without enough explanation.
b)It functions in an uncentralized i.e. distributed manner where any tom dick or harry can mine and/or run a node without any vetting of qualifications.
c)All bitcoin exchanges are unregulated.
I hardly think the word "professionalism" can thus be applied.

Nice work but we run rather more sophisticated forecasting algos here with a much longer timeframe and as a "significant event" predictor. Typically covering up to 60 days ahead.

Don't just buy random coins ! Do your research, there are over 200 alts to chose from, assess the different properties and look at the people behind them. Buyers (right now) are not a very important consideration if you are looking for the long term crypto winner. You want to be holding for a few years and the winner(s) will be tradeable. Losers won't, hence the need for diversification into a few possibles.
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:56:47
OK, so you are a fairly experienced investor with 20 years on the stockmarket, you have come into crypto and now you trade bitcoin and litecoin and have made money. Trading is not the same as long term hodling tho', yet your post seems to refer to the longer term 5000/10000 target.

There is a growing realisation that Bitcoin is not going to be a mainstream success as it has too many disadvantages for the ordinary consumer. In addition it has been tainted in the eyes of the public by Mt.Gox, other exchanges losses, thefts and general poor security not to mention the association with illegal trading such as drugs. 
It is also now evident, with the existence of so many altcoins, that it is trivial to use a Bitcoin like protocol to set up one's own design of a crypto and a large company or government crypto can be sponsored in such a way as to rapidly gain more users than Bitcoin has ever had.
The future for Bitcoin is bleak, probably forever destined to remain a "plaything" for computer geeks. As this reality gradually becomes accepted the investment holders of BTC will be selling so we expect continued price falls.

That is clearly nonsense, study the technical details of the altcoins. There are many well known problems with bitcoin and it is no good pretending they do not exist. the sponsors of some of the alts have tried to address some of these and it is quite useful to see how they are working. When/if one (or more) cryptocurrencies become widely accepted it will be the one(s) which have the ease of use and safety required by the mass population. Bitcoin is far removed from that. This is why the recent smart money is now into crypto-currency in general and not just only bitcoin specific. Check out the latest news items in the crypto space.
In reality bitcoin has probably had its day now, it had a chance and blew it ! Better, safer, easier to use cryptos are coming and one of those is likely to be the ultimate winner in the future, not bitcoin.
The network effect of bitcoin is being eroded now, number of nodes dropping, mining becoming increasingly unprofitable. Merchant adoption is still tiny and when merchants do come on board many accept Lite,Doge, etc too. As do many exchanges.
The so called value in bitcoin is now dropping as all these factors come into play, the realization increases and the price falls back towards sub $400 (with a few ups &amp; downs along the way).

I am fascinated and interested in the behaviour of large wild cats such as tigers, lions, etc. But I have no desire to buy one ! 
There is no point in making an "investment" in bitcoin (or any other crypto) because it will simply be a wild and risky ride. You won't actually profit unless you "sell" your bitcoins for fiat or good/services at a merchant. If you do make a profit ask yourself where the money came from. It can only come from another investor who pays more for their Bitcoins than you paid for yours. Common sense will indicate that this cannot go on for ever . In short it is simply greedy speculation.

We don't. And you shouldn't.
1)The fantastic and exciting thing is the cryptocurrency aspect, not bitcoin itself. Be open to the wider crypto world.
2)Bitcoin is the first so it has exposed its faults/flaws/defects first which can be improved upon by a new altcoin.
3)Certain aspects of bitcoin cannot be changed so if one of those is related to a fault it becomes a loser long term. Tree ledger may be better than chain - have a look at the technical details, e.g. eMunie .
4)Development of crypto as a useful real world currency is still in its very early stages. Bitcoin is nowhere near a useful system for the vast majority of the world population. A newalt may well be.
5)Bitcoin is tainted by association with illegality, thefts,hacking,drugs, etc as well as the disaster of Mt.gox and other exchanges folding.
6)Several of the existing alts were a genuine attempt to improve upon bitcoin and worthwhile experiments in certain altered aspects e.g. mining difficulty.
By all means keep a finger in the bitcoin pie but be sure to have a diversified spread of investments in some of the other promising altcoins out there. I am not naming any as I do not want you to start shouting "XXXcoin shill" at me. Do your own research of the alts and make your own mind up. At least half a dozen really interesting ones out there IMHO.
And I ignore the price graphs both historical and now. Its the tech' details, people behind them, and so on which you should be looking at. One (or more) of them could well be long term winners in crypto space and turn out to be better than bitcoin. If you stay "all-in" on the BTC I reckon you will be missing out on some great future possibilities. Diversify, my friends, diversify !

Yes, there does appear a lot to do and once any crypto is started there is a high chance it will be around for a long time as there will always be enthusiasts who want to "play" with it. Yes, in view of the current size of bitcoin I expect it still to be here in 10y BUT I wouldn't consider it a safe bet for investment purposes. Who is to say it will not just stabilise at, say, $100 ish, for some considerable time. IMHO the correlation between BTC/$ exchange price and utility is very weak.

True, but there are a huge number of posts on here from real noobs and I reckon some of them have no idea that there are over 200 alternative cryptos already in existence. For their benefit lets point this out more often.
Also we do need to sometimes discuss things which affect both, say, bitcoin and doge and/or favour one or the other. Where will that take place if bitcoiners say "No mention of doge here" and doge "No mention of bitcoin here" ? No, your attitude is clearly nonsensical and actually unhelpful to bitcoiners who need to know what is going on and be able to chat about it. We should be happy to talk about all aspects of the wider crypto world here and how it affects bitcoin, as most assuredly virtually all wider news will indeed be relevant to us and our investment.

If you have to ask the question you do not know what you are doing and you certainly will not get unbiased advice here on r/bitcoin. And if you didnt know that you shouldn't be "investing" in anything !!
Go away and research "investments" for at least 3 months before spending your hard earned money on anything. And pay attention to the fact that bitcoin has been trading at 30-50% of the all Time High for many months.

My submission is about bitcoin and bitcoin enthusiasts. I suggest they may be being too short sighted if they are "all-in" on bitcoin without considering the wider crypto world.

@_date: 2014-05-17 19:30:13
Not quite ! To calculate market cap take the current price and multiply by the number of bitcoins, i.e. the number that are already mined (not the final 21 million). Theoretically one should not count those known to have been lost / disappeared / unaccounted for but it is a bit tricky to evaluate the figure so normally market cap quoted will be an overestimate to some degree, we think by 2-5% but its really more of a guesstimate than a calculation.

If the price is falling then we suspect a proportion must be selling , that is how markets work. However it is likely that there is a fair  core % of hodlers still happy to stay in. whether any future falls to below $400/300/200 or whatever will shake many of them out is another matter entirely.
I still see a greater interest among the serious money (VC, etc) about cryptocurrency in general rather than specifically bitcoin. My advice would be to put a proportion of your investments into other alt.coins and infrastructure companies rather than being "all-in" on your BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:38:46
It may indeed be necessary or helpful for all the bitcoiners to inhabit an island because for the next 10-20y the vast majority of the world population will be continuing to use government fiat. On the island they can perfect its use for the real world because it sure as hell isn't anywhere near that state yet and the bitcoin devs have had months to sort out the problems - a very poor show considering all the claims on here that bitcoin has the largest team, the best devs, etc. Does not look like it to me !
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:30:21
Sorry you are just plain wrong. BTC divisible to 100M Satoshis is effectively analogue, not digital. Certainly no more or less digital than any other currency in the world anyway.
It is virtual because there are no coins/notes.

Several alts have tried to change certain technical details of the bitcoin protocol to overcome one or more of bitcoins defects. It might have been better for the future success of bitcoin if the bitcoin dev team had done the required work on bitcoin itself but they have been very slow to act and there are in any case some problems that are difficult to solve with a "tweak".
Bitcoin now has such a bad reputation with the general public (see recent surveys) that it is unlikely it will be accepted for mass adoption.
An alternative stands a better chance.

One of bitcoins "problems" has been its price volatility. If a competing newcoin was sponsored by, say, Western Union, they could set it up as a pegged currency and always guarantee, say, parity with $ . I suspect that feature alone could be the killer USP which ensured mass adoption for newcoin. A crypto that would be useful, of guaranteed value (no risk of exchange loss) and of zero attraction to speculators/ traders and much less likely to be hoarded.
Wouldn't this be massively more attractive to the ordinary Joe Public ?

OK, some interesting points to debate. Lets have a look at the trust issue. You say trust is a function of time. Clearly that cannot be true of many things over the longer term as new developments/inventions take over in particular areas all the time. With Bitcoin there have been numerous problems related to trust and as I see it the bad news items relating to lost/stolen bitcoins are getting larger as time progresses. Mt.Gox being the latest and a huge multi-million $ issue. Therefore the birth date of Bitcoin has become irrelevant, newer cryptos can have a cleaner slate and if they have some insurance attached surely it is a no brainer for the general public. They will go for the one sponsored/regulated/insured and backed by a trusted name rather than the tainted and unregulated Bitcoin with it's poor history and bad news memories.


This is a phrase I have seen before  (I think you must have a book of them somewhere !!). but what does it mean ? Most of the products and services we use in everyday life are from a single company or organisation. You can use the same phrase against them but our lives are not full of failures from them. 


do you mean trusting one organisation (the sponsor). If so I fail to see why, we trust individual companies, banks, etc everyday of our lives, it is not really a problem for 99.9% of us so if you are right and this really is the allure of bitcoin then I am afraid it will only be so for a tiny minority of the general populace as most people do not think like that.
I do actually get the impression that the main thing most users of bitcoin like is this libertarian anti-establishment idea, it's decentralised nature, it is outside the existing system. Fine if you like that but please realise you are in a really tiny minority who think like this. Everybody else wants things that are useful, safe, cheap, regulated and they do not view Bitcoin like that now.


A newly set up crypto could be initially given away as a promo for a large company, e.g. Amazon, and they would accept it as payment for goods. they could do this in 1 day.And have 10 million owners of the altcoin and 10 million products to sell for them. Therefore that statement of yours is clearly wrong.
I will leave it at that for now, might come back on some other points later.
 
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:01:55
This thing is still in very early stages and needs refining a lot more for mass market use. Governments have no incentive to do the work themselves. Large companies are doing this now so expect to see a corpcoin before a govcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:29:46
This is a good question but the answer depends on a number of variables:
Fixed costs,variable costs, capital costs of equipment, probability of success,whether mining solo or in a pool,when started and, of course, the relative price (in fiat) of the mined BTC.
What we can say is that for each existing mining set up there is a "break even point" in relation to the overall cost of mining vs the BTC price (in e.g. $).
Would any large miners care to publish their accounts (and have them verified ) ? Apparently not ? 
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:30:54
The new crypto may well be (initially) an extension of fiat.
@_date: 2014-05-26 23:45:07
Hi there. By now I expect you will have done some research and noticed that the price of bitcoin is very volatile. It had been as high as $1240 and then went down to below $400 but is now around $590. You will therefore be wondering whether it is a good idea to invest now, or later, or ever. And if you do invest you will be concerned that your investment could be worth less than you paid for it sometimes. This might be worrying.
There is a simple solution. Take the amount of money you were going to invest into bitcoin and split it into 2 parts. With the one part (half) if it is more than $5000 then split it into 10 pieces, put $500 (or 1/10th) into bitcoin on the first of each month. If it is less than $5000 split it into 5 pieces. Put each 1/5th into bitcoin on the first of each month. Now lock your investment away in cold storage. This is your long term bet on bitcoin "going to the moon" and reaching, say, $100,000 sometime in the future.
Now for the other half you can earn a good profit and income from trading bitcoin - predicting its up/down movements. This is best done not on a bitcoin exchange but via trading of CFDs (contracts for differences). One company you can use is Plus500. You can start a "virtual" trading account to get the hang of it before going live. do have a look at it, it has served us well and we turned $5K into over $124K by trading bitcoin like this.

I agree that if there are certain restrictions in New.coin it would not be a true currency (let alone a crypto-currency) but as yet we do not know what restrictions, if any, might exist. Why do you think they will be going down the route of a "token", with restrictions, with ability to confiscate ?
I would have thought, in view of the exciting nature of crypto, and the huge possible gains to be made if you are the backer of the winner(s), that they would be aiming for a fully operable digital currency (as a long term aim). Agreed the legislation may need to change but this does not stop work on it, only restricts its use at present.

The cheaper bitcoins become the more we can all afford to buy and the more attractive they will be to everyone. Hence greater adoption. Also when they are more like 1$ in price it will be easier to do the sums to buy things hence greater utility.

Evidence for "lots" of ATM please, I thought it was just a few dozen.
Transaction volume stats cover all transactions including buy/sell on exchanges. To be honest I do not think an increase in speculation like that is a plus point so we need stats which show true retail transactions ideally. this is pretty impossible to obtain from blockchain info so I think the only source to indicate actual real world use would be from merchants. Is there a source of such data ?

@_date: 2014-05-05 15:10:42
Basically confirms our own analysis as posted here over the last few day. We have our own technical analysis algorithms here supplemented by +/- adjustments on bitcoin &amp; crypto news. 
To repeat: There is a 80-90% probability of breaking down below $400 is the next 19 days, there is a 50% probability of trading in the region of $200-250 in the next 30 days after $400 breaks.
Our analysis (in common with all !) is not always 100% reliable but we do find it brings consistent profits when followed and generally comes right 70% of the time. For the 30% when it doesn't over half of those a very near misses so rarely result in a significant loss. We therefore give it a weighted accuracy of 85% and with respect to bitcoin over the past 14 months are actually running a little above that.
TL:DR We can afford to wait for it to go lower.

eBay has a certain focused philosophy with regard to protecting buyers rights - see details of their T&amp;Cs and eBay/PayPal buyer protection rules. Accepting bitcoin will be difficult for them owing to the lack of chargeback and until the various world authorities/governments have properly legislated/regulated the bitcoin space it seems very unlikely that any merchant the size of eBay is going to go there. This would appear to be a long way off in time, I reckon there will be at least 2 years for this to run without such a worry.

As with any investment in something new / cutting edge (i.e. crypto) it is very important to keep an eye on the competition.
Unfortunately a lot of bitcoin hodlers seem to be blinkered in this regard.
The crypto space is certainly hotting up. More investments, VC etc. But we can see a shift in the language used away froim being exclusively "bitcoin" talk to more" bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" or even just "digital money". If we assume that these big companies/investors know what they are doing we must draw the conclusion that they are well aware (consider it possible or even likely) that bitcoin may not be the long lerm winner in crypto-space.
Please do not go "all in" on Bitcoin. It is sensible , if you are going to invest, to spread some into other possible alt.coins which might be winners long term and also a proportion into crypto companies, infrastructure development, etc.

As they (USMS) seem to be quite new to bitcoin transactions (what a surprise !!) they are being ultra cautious. Following verification that the destination address has minimal (zero ?) association with tainted coins we expect they will send a trial minimal amount and get the recipient to confirm they have received it before they send over the full 3000 (or whatever).
The comment about the low bidder expecting several fellow bidders to be disqualified is quite interesting as is the fact that several bids seem to have been in the 400 -460 region which is pretty damn close to our own algo predictor for such events.

1) I am not a troll just because you think my post ideas are different from you.
2)I disagree about libertarians being in bitcoin at the beginning, in the very early stages I believe it was mainly computer programming enthusiast and maths enthusiasts. If you have evidence otherwise I would like to see it.
3)Stating there is no such thing as "good" regulation seems self evidently nonsense.
4)Decentralized technologies don't "see" anything but their proponents may have an agenda.
5)You can have considerably more security without inconvenience, ease of use can be kept the same and back room security increased in many situations, the increased cost of doing so may very well be cost effective.

It is unlikely to be in the interests of any losers or winners to make any (truthful ?) announcements because there are more bitcoins yet to be sold by USMS and it would be disadvantageous for any prospective bidder in the second auction to leak any information about his strategy.

A fair attempt at improving Bitcoin and utilising a sponsor (Google) and no mining. Much more likely that something like this will succeed in the future as opposed to Bitcoin. Clearly the sponsor can be any large trusted corp', and there will be no problem finding millions of "customers" who are happy with the idea.
I know it wont appeal to many Bitcoin enthusiasts who are fixed on the decentralised no single point of failure argument. That is fine. Each to his own. The reality however is that Bitcoin enthusiasts are soon going to be left in their own little world of agorist libertarian crypto while the rest of the world moves on with something more like this new idea.
In addition there is so much bad publicity surrounding the word "bitcoin" that I do not think it ever stands a chance of being "popular" with the general public.

Our analysis. As many do we use various means to try to predict the likely movement of traded prices on things in which we have an interest which includes bitcoin. The main parameters suggesting these figures are related to technical analysis of the BTC/$ price graph, trading volumes and other inputs. The algorithms suggest a 80-90% probability of a drop through $400 within the next 20 days.

It is simply an approximate balance of sellers and buyers. Do not forget there are 3800 ish bitcoins mined daily and a significant percentage of those will be sold quickly due to commercial miners needing to cover overhead costs. 
Additionally when prices lose their historic volatility the active traders tend to be out of the market a bit. This also reduces the volume and tends to make the price "sticky".
IMHO the situation is bearish as price has attempted to break $450 on a few occasions but has failed to hold above this level. There is continued pressure on the downside and we reckon a break below $400 has a high probability over the next 10 days.

Traders/speculators should push it down through lower resistance points to sub $400 before end May but whether this results in panic selling or opportunity buying is probably a 50/50 call I reckon. Personally I think there is too much unhelpful news about and the chances of another big negative seem higher than a big positive news item so on balance I expect once $400 is broken we will be trading around $200-250 for a while.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:37:14
I am NOT talking about buying altcoins to make a relatively short term profit. 2 months is irrelevant. I am talking about the long term winner(s) in crypto space in 5-10y time.

More. Or less. (More or less).
The algorithm is a predictive tool which may or may not be accurate on any given event/subject. You cannot use it to "prove" things, it is a guide to help take action (or not).
An opinion is a human view which may be more (or less) accurate than a specific (my bitcoin ?) algorithm depending on the information intelligence expertise experience used to form it. You may know far more about bitcoin than me and therefore your opinion may well be much more reliable than our predictions. Can you prove that ?

For the record our estimate/prediction is for sub $400 by the end of this month and around $200-250 by the end of next.

Learn from your mistake(s) and steer clear of speculative risk if you cannot take the loss.
PS All unregulated exchanges (in anything) are very risky.
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:16:41
We agree that a break above $500 may be significant but our algorithms show this is only about 10-20% likely compared with a break below $400. If $400 breaks on the downside there is virtually no resistance all the way to $138 technically speaking.
My likely scenario is break below $400 by end of May, trade in $200-250 region before end of June.
We can afford to wait for it to go lower. If you do not yet own any BTC be patient, if you do a sale now could well be profitable for a buy back in on the 200's.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:32:13
Attitude apology accepted and item 2) deleted then. Dealing with 3) first.
I agree that there are many scams and dubious schemes about, also many on here are very new to investing in anything and can easily get "burnt". As always one should only invest amounts that are safe with respect to ones own financial position (many say do not invest more than you can afford to lose !).I also say do not invest in anything you do not understand.
However my point is a general one. Too many who are interested in the very new and exciting idea of cryptocurrency/digital currency are "all-in" on bitcoin. Whether infrastructure and other associated company investments are more risky is perhaps debateable. Certainly there have been some losses in this area (perhaps outright scams ?) but there is an increasing interest in cryptocurrency and there will be many more investment opportunities arising this year. The key is not to simply follow the crowd but to do ones own research of the company, the people behind it, and the product/proposition. At the end of the day you have to take a view and put your money into those you like.
Although many altcoins are clones to a greater or lesser degree and a fair proportion may have been established simply to make money (speculative) I think there is evidence of a degree of good intentions in some where the developers have tried to improve upon bitcoin and/or tackle a problem associated with bitcoin. I therefore do not dismiss them all like you do (and there are more coming soon too !).
No, Bitcoin is not static, but I am very disappointed at the speed of progress in tackling apparent problems. The dev team is very small, relatively unfunded, appears amateurish/hobbyist and has a degree of politics/infighting associated. You describe the network as "strong" - against what measure ? There have been quite a few jitters about 51% mining attack in the past which looks like a serious weakness. The "ever growing community" is a phrase used  rather too much I think. We can say the same about doge I reckon.
My suggestion to diversify into altcoins was not primarily to defend against the risks of bitcoin but rather to have a stake in possible winners in crypto space should bitcoin prove not to be the ultimate "numero uno". By winners in crypto space I do not mean trying to make money out of the fastest moving graph of some altcoin against the $. I am more inclined to view a 5-10y time horizon and I think there is an opportunity here to be in early on several cryptos. Just suppose for a minute that bitcoin is not going to be the winning crypto in 5-10y, if you have gone "all-in" on bitcoin you have lost out big time. If you diversify now, hold a few altcoins, you may be sharing in a rather bigger pie !
Even if bitcoin fails spectacularly e.g. price crashes to sub $10 and stays there or lower  and even if this also crashes ALL existing altcoins (IMHO unlikely) then it does not mean the end of cryptocurrencies. I and my mates will start at least another one up the week after the rest of them crash. There is clearly a huge benefit to mankind from the idea of cryptocurrency so it is not going away that quickly. 
Bitcoin just happens to be the first, but (by definition almost) it is the one with the most faults/flaws/defects. There will be better cryptos coming and some of these will have mass market appeal (Bitcoin does not and has very bad associations with illegality/drugs/thefts/scams) if one is truly interested in investing in this area (rather than just taking a quick profit on a ride up for a few weeks/months) one needs to have a much wider horizon than simply bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:03:28
Disagree, far too simplistic attempt at tech' analysis.
We trust our own algorithms developed in real world investment scene for over 40 years and now computerised. Bitcoin prediction success 85%, net profit on BTC in 5 figures over 14 months. Some losses but minor.
Prediction: 80-90% chance of breaking down through $400 in the next 17 days, if it does so 50/50 chance of trading in range $200-250 in the subsequent 30 days. Technical support point below $400 is showing as $138. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:43:08
There is, to my mind, some confusion as to which part of the Bitcoin system is the problem here. Hopefully we all agree that there is a problem (due to thefts/exchanges folding/etc).
I break the system down into the following:
1)The open source bitcoin software.
2)The necessary hardware of mining/processing nodes.
3)The users of Bitcoin be they buyers or sellers, merchants, holders,investors or whatever.
4)The ancilliary service companies, i.e. exchanges, wallet providers, mining hardware companies, bitcoin related startup promotors, bitcoin company share promotors.
Where in 1-4 has the vast majority of the dishonesty occured ? Is it related to some unique aspects of Bitcoin that are not present elsewhere in financial markets ? If so what ? And how do we fix that ?
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:31:03
Good. We welcome more regulation for the currently unregulated aspects of bitcoin which have caused ordinary bitcoin enthusiasts to suffer losses. With regulation will come greater acceptance from the general public.

Yes, but Bitcoin has too many faults, it is dying and the world changing crypto which you predict and I believe will come is NOT going to be bitcoin, it will be a new crypto which does not have the bitcoin defects, designed from scratch, different and better.
Bitcoin was an elegant and interesting experiment by Satoshi but now is the time to bury it and move on. We can do better and we will .
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:58:33
Yes but in the real world only a tiny minority are interested in anarchist payment systems, the vast majority of the population actually want good regulation and protection. Therefore the winner in future crypto space IS going to be a regulated crypto-currency, and it is NOT going to be Bitcoin.
This will result in Bitcoin being a minority crypto for its own enthusiasts who like or want its unregulated nature. the majority crypto(s) in use for real world commerce will be something different. 
I draw the conclusion that Bitcoin price/$ will be somewhat lower than it is now when the reality of this becomes apparent.

In order for bitcoin to succeed as a useful mass market product for ordinary members of the public it needs to be safe, secure, easy to use and trusted. Good strong regulation is therefore essential and that is what most people will vote for, they do not want to be subject to the thefts, hacks and scams which we have seen in bitcoin's history. Promoting this crypto on the basis of "no regulation" will keep it a "dustbin case" forever, destined to remain a plaything for computer nerds (and some criminals).
Is that really what you want ?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:40:27
You are right that my comments may well also apply to EXISTING altcoins, but bitcoin is the biggest current crypto, it is the one in the news and this is r/bitcoin so I am talking about this one ! I can see possible avenues which address your other issues, how exactly that is achieved will be up to the designers of the new crypto but I think, for example, you will find that ordinary coinsumers (sic) will be willing to trade privacy for sureity against theft. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:23:35
Time will tell, my friend ! (And just saying "You're an idiot" is not a very adult contribution to the debate - maybe you are 12y old ??).
For the rest of you reading this please do some research and consider the points. How easy is it to start a new crypto (200+ exist now) ? Could a large company or government do so and give away the "coins" ? What do you think matters more, the opinions of the mass populace when they choose something they like which is easy to use OR the opinions of a small minority group with special interest/enthusiasm ?
Bitcoin just happened to be the first, not surprisingly it now has the largest "market cap" but in reality the number of users is tiny and the possibility of a government sponsored competitor is huge. Bitcoin will soon be on the sidelines, you can keep playing with it if you like but the rest of the world will be using other cryptos which are better (and will soon be bigger) than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:28:41
How do we define success or failure of Bitcoin ?
What determines whether it is dead or dying ?
Since November 2013 this forum has been full of those claiming great things for bitcoin (as the price went up to 1140). Now the price is dropping and is at a 3 month low (I exclude Mt.Gox). Many of them have changed their tune, now they claim great things for Bitcoin and either say the drop is a short term blip OR that price is irrelevant.
One thing is for sure, a rapidly increasing price is certainly newsworthy but I would suggest that even more newsworthy will be the stories of hardship due to real $ loss on this speculative crypto. And that news will only harm Bitcoin and other cryptos. 
We have yet to see the full result of the price falls and the Mt.Gox fiasco but I expect it will play out fairly quickly (say 1 month) and the bads news will be everywhere.
If any of you out there have invested real money in Bitcoin please cash out now while you still can, there may be a point where you cannot if other exchanges catch the Mt.Gox disease. Taking a loss now may be painful but at least you will get something back and won't have lost everything.

If they are paid in bitcoin but can only pay 25% of their bills in the same then presumably they will have a continuing need to keep selling bitcoin to get their "other" currency, be it $ or doge or mistermastershiftershaftercoin. A very very silly situation. No ordinary member of the public wants to be arsed with using 2 or more different competing currencies in their own country so the reality is that you will never get into this situation in the first place.

3 strange comments !
1) Why accuse me of that ?! If I say invest in other coins AS WELL AS bitcoin why would that be altcoin pump/dump and not bitcoin pump/dump. Makes no logical sense. Also I mention no particular altcoins (there are over 200) and I don't think you would assume I own some of all of them !! I am making a GENERAL point about diversification and have mentioned no other coins by name. your comment is therefore nonsensical and more likely in the circumstances to be interpreted as YOU shilling up Bitcoin !
2)Actually I do not know what you mean or infer from this clean up comment. Do you want to explain ?
3)It is self evident that if you are interested in cryptocurrency that buying altcoins AND investing in infrastructure companies is clearly diversification compared with going "all-in" on bitcoin. Perhaps you could explain why you disagree ?

Briefly and simplistically:
You cannot "calculate" the lowest price that bitcoin can go down to via a mathematical formula because it is openly traded on many exchanges so the price is whatever players are willing to trade it at.

Yes, of course, we all have a right to draw someones attention to the fact that we did not read what they had to say and we did not like it. In other words feel free to act as stupidly as you like because I am sure there is not one person in a million who could consider such behaviour as intelligent. 
It probably won't help bitcoin to promote it as the currency for idiots !
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:30:18
You will probably have accumulated a lot of "stuff" in your 19 years of existence which you no longer need or use. Have a good clearout and sell it on ebay, a yard sale or whatever. It is surprising how many people simply overlook this. Books, clothes, CDs, old computer equipment, old games/toys and those highly desirable, rare and sought after 
Magic The Gathering cards. !!!!!!!!!!!
You will have something I am sure and it is not unusual to find a collectable high value item - do the research on ebay /google before you price anything up to maximise your income. This kind of activity can be slotted into any spare time you have 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. 
I generally like to sell at fixed prices or set an eBay auction start price quite high to avoid letting something go too cheap.
Also ask around your neighbours, relatives, etc to see if they have any odd jobs that need doing e.g. gardening, mowing the lawn, window cleaning,cleaning the cars. You might even find some will pay you in bitcoin !!
Good luck.

Jesus Christ ! You guys have been waiting for 6 months to go to the Moon, surely you can give me a few more days for the sub $400 break (I did say, a few days ago, within about 20 days break $400, then 30 days to trade $200-250). You are very impatient.
I stick to the data / predictions we have here. Expecting about 80-90% chance of breaking $400 on the downside before the end of the month, expecting a 50/50 chance of $200-250 within 30 days of that.
Just wait. I may be right , I may be wrong, but lets see shall we ?

@_date: 2014-06-05 17:25:20
Surely it is self evident that if you consistently fail at anything you need to change the way you do things. Nothing to do with bitcoin really - just basic human psychology.
I trade bitcoin as CFDs on Plus500. We started with $10K and now have over $200K. This is largely due to the very high volatility, we make money on a falling price as well as a rising one. Not all our trades are profitable, it's about 70/30 but we use stop loss limits, etc to minimise loss and maximise profit.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:16:07
You have no patience !! A study of the bitcoin charts will show how volatile it is, just 'cos its gone up a trifle yesterday or today means jack shit. And, BTW, algorithms are regularly checked against reality, like all users we are not expecting 100% accuracy but anything over 70% generally gives good profits if traded correctly and sensibly. Our historical accuracy on our bitcoin trading algo is 85%+. We are happy with it, we know where our in and out price points are, we know where our stop losses and take profit points are, and we are quite happy with the way bitcoin is behaving today.
I expect you have your own trading view (or maybe you are just a long term hodler ?) so wish you good luck with yours.
The party continues for the moment but it looks like some of the guests are getting a little tired / weary ? And a few have already left, of course.

It is irrelevant where they are provided they are properly encrypted.
They can be "stored" in plain sight but you may not want to draw  attention to the fact that you own (substantial ?) BTC.
Multiple copies should be in diverse physical locations. If they are ALL in your house and then the house burns down ....
System of encryption is most important (must be ultra secure and extremely difficult to brute force crack). Password must be unforgettable or otherwise stored securely and/or covertly.
There is no reason why you should not use your own encryption system as opposed to a proprietary one if you know what you are doing.

@_date: 2014-03-10 06:33:27
Please explain how !
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:30:36
Very briefly and roughly:
We have algorithms that match price charts of the chosen subject with past historical price charts of other things of a similar nature and also against patterns in itself. Then have adjusting factors as an input such as newsworthy items which we manually scribe as positive or negative and give a weight 1-10 . Algorithms then predict significant events into the future and ascribe them a probabiulity factor based on how many times the past history has shown such a result.
Every 5 days the algos check their own predictions against reality and if erroneous apply a delta fraction correction which over time,will adjust the outputs more accurately.
Our bitcoin accuracy rate is currently running at just over 85% and has been pretty consistent thus for 5 months now. When started 14 months ago we were about 60% but has improved.

I did accumulate a rather rapid negative 90 or so back in November/December but it is trivial to repost with another ID (I have a small number). Others seem to have suffered more, I particularly liked some of the posts of darkwings_08 who got negative karma in the hundreds last time I saw him here but he was deleted/banned or something and you cannot even see his past posts now. 
Most posters who get serious negatives are adult/mature/thick-skinned enough to take the comments they get (and give as good back usually) but what really stinks is moderators banning/censoring because we have no way of knowing why they so acted. Maybe they acted fairly, maybe they didn't - some transparency would be helpful otherwise there is always the suspicion they were simply "removed" because their views were disliked by a majority.

Might be funny / might not. Lets see how low it goes over the next couple of months, we reckon there is a 50/50 chance of getting below $250 , and so far our predictive algorithms have been very accurate on bitcoin. (We made over $50K on it last year, agreed not much this year but still profitable nonetheless which is more than can be said for a lot of hodlers as of todays $420 ish).

What is your view and why ?
@_date: 2014-05-17 14:18:03
If you believe in the future of cryptocurrency you would be well advised to keep a careful eye on the altcoins. There are several people here on r/bitcoin who will try to convince you they are all "rubbish" or "irrelevant". This is most certainly not the case as is clearly apparent from the market cap and number of users of several of the alts. The reason you will be told otherwise is that a lot of pro-bitcoin investors on here are desperate to shill up its price, probably because they hold a fair amount of their real hard earned money in BTC and are seeing it fall in price (there will be many who bought at 1000,800,600, etc all now showing a big loss !)..
You need to tread carefully to avoid these biased comments.
bitcoin itself has many serious problems / difficulties which may well mean it does not get accepted for mass market use by the ordinary Joe Public. It may well be that one of the altcoins is the eventual future winner in crypto space.
If you are an investor it may well pay to diversify into other coins. Please do your own detailed research. And expect this post to be severely criticised by the pro-bitcoin (holding a loss now) enthusiasts !!
If you have not invested yet please be careful, the price is showing a consistent downward trend right now and is massively below its all time high.

No PRNG is 100% safe, so the question should be "Is it safe enough for application XYZ ?".
With respect to generating a bitcoin keypair it looks great but to be sure you would have to know rather a lot about crypto-security which I suspect rules out all but about 7 of us.
Therefore why bother, just play safe and use true RNG not PRNG. Plenty of them available.

I never used the word perfect, you are distorting my comment. I said bitcoin is now no good for everyday use by most of the population. It is not even "good enough" for knowledgeable computer geeks who keep complaining on here that they have mysteriously had their BTC stolen (again). History certainly does not show (in general)that being first guarantees future success, there are many examples contrary as well as for that argument so you are just guessing when you say that.
VC money is now being invested in the wider crypto-currecy area, not just bitcoin specific. Ask yourself why.
Hash rate is irrelevant - just a geeky number. Says nothing about the future performance of any crypto, this is a fallacy that keeps cropping up - where do you get these ideas from ??

USMS auction on 27th is a sealed bid auction. They will not decide the winners till 30th. They will not announce any results or details so unless the winners decide to go public after 30th you will be just as ignorant then as you are now.
The prospective purchasers of blocks of 3000 BTC (or more) are unlikely to be acquiring them to actively trade but more likely to have their own hodling ideas. therefore the effect of the auction is likely to be minimal with regard to current exchanges.
Do not forget the current mining reward is 3600-3800 BTC per day anyway and a reasonably large % of those will be sold quickly to pay commercial miners overheads.

Much more likely is that you really do not know what you are talking about and it is I who will amusingly watch you wriggle and squirm as Bitcoin starts to be overtaken by other better designed, well thought out and popular cryptocurrencies.

And who, exactly, might have the resources (the supercomputers) to do that ? I think we know the answer. Have you not just identified one of the weaknesses of a P2P crypto using the Bitcoin protocol. Anyone, anywhere, at any time can turn on enough hashing power to take 51%. Surely this would be a trivial exercise for a government that wanted to seriously disrupt and/or destroy it ?
In fact they could do it by stealth and keep setting up new "miners" who appeared to be located in different countries and to be independent operators but in reality are under the control of XYZ just waiting for the right time to launch their attack and you have no way of knowing.

It wont be exactly like bitcoin (obviously) but will have better features, be easier to use, and be safer for the general public.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:46:00
I am not sure I understand all of what you are saying (my ignorance of your terminology ?) so do correct if I have misinterpreted.
1)"Higher trust because it has been around longer". Probably not in my opinion, agreed it was the first but trust in bitcoin among the general public is poor. See recent survey where 62% thought bitcoin was a "scam". Also recent and not so recent events will have destroyed trust as people see bitcoin thefts/hacks/losses and dishonest players in the unregulated market. A new sponsored crypto could have a very high level of trust to start with if it is backed by a trusted organisation, e.g. AMEX. also a new crypto could be designed to be more secure and/or offered with security/insurance/loss protection. 
2)Developer attention. The crypto sponsor will employ developers, not necessary to rely on volunteers.
3)No , I do not think your first-mover advantage applies. Note with respect to eBay the costs in setting up and promoting another auction selling site are quite high and I think this does not apply to crypto where it is low cost to launch a protocol requiring just 2 modest mining nodes to start with. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:01:48
The alternative cryptos exist alongside bitcoin so I see no reason why a Google coin cannot do the same. The "leg work" involved in setting up alternatives was minimal so there seems little disadvantage in starting a new one. Google coin can be tailored to suit the company and its customers, there would be nothing to be gained by taking over Bitcoin protocol development.
I suspect any new coin produced by a large company will be totally independent from Bitcoin so they have full control over it and also avoid any taint from the unpleasant past bitcoin "problems" i.e. scams thefts closed exchanges Mt.Gox etc.

@_date: 2014-03-24 06:35:21
I am a firm supporter of crypto and believe it will be very important in the future. I have great respect for Satoshi and his ideas which launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin has grown but no-one can deny it has had problems. Many altcoins have also grown significantly. The "success" of Bitcoin, so far, is not my issue. I refer to the future. Bitcoin will not be the mainstream winner - that crown will go to another crypto.
My posts have nothing to do with FUD/jealousy/hate/trolling but simply pointing out the obvious facts as can be seen by anyone who cares to open their eyes and look.
Unfortunately there are many like you here who have a blind faith that Bitcoin is going to be THE crypto for the masses. You need to wake up, particularly if you have any of your real world wealth / hard earned money "invested " in it !
specifically, also, the current adoption rate... etc you mention can be overcome by a government or company sponsored altcoin in literally a matter of days when they "invent" their specific coin, give it away to their 10-30 million customers/citizens and authorise its use. Bitcoin is just too tiny to withstand that.

There will be a reluctance on the part of Joe Public to use bitcoin if the "value" of the bitcoins he bought yesterday/last week/last month has a possibility of being significantly less than the price he paid. Bitcoins $ price graph shows this has been true so far. The general public are not stupid and not going to get any useful benefit off bitcoin as a payment system for as long as it remains so volatile.
There appears to us to be nothing to suggest that the bitcoin price will either stabilise or adopt a more sedate upward trend. This hinders adoption.

Yes, this is the end of Bitcoin. totally unsuitable for use by everyday folk who will always remember the bad publicity surrounding it, the stories of lost money, hacks, thefts, folding exchanges. No one outside of this cosy little community will ever trust anything with the word Bitcoin in it. It is time to face up to this reality, lets bury  now, and the replacement is not going to be called Bitcoin 2.0 !!

Interesting propaganda which, as always, fails to answer the very specific queries of contrary evidence and instead tries to be insulting to those that don't believe. A typical tactic by those who wish to hide something. Here we are rather more thick skinned and also less gullible so propaganda like this does not impress but merely serves to reinforce the knowledge that we are being lied to.

The current AML/KYC legislation does not in any way stop work on a new crypto, it only (currently) restricts certain aspects of its use. Changes to legislation will be coming soon anyway and in a 5-10y view there is no reason to think that amazon's coin could not be a fully operational crypto.
Your last comment is nonsense. If darkwebby says it is going to accept, for example, "AirMiles" vouchers I do not think British Airways is in anyway implicated or at fault so why would the argument apply to any crypto.

The problem is likely to be who wins in the argument when some faction argues for a protocol change to increase the limit.
There is going to be some point in future time if bitcoin is successful that this matter becomes such an argument.

Your kind of reply is EXACTLY the reason for my post. Too self-centered on bitcoin and too quick to use the excuse that r/bitcoin is "just for bitcoin enthusiast and NO OTHER COINS". 
In the real world (i.e. outside of r/bitcoin) there are exciting developments taking place in crypto currency in general as well as just bitcoin. All these things should be of interest to true enthusiasts on here and if they relate to a potential competitor to bitcoin then of course all investors/hodlers in the BTC should be (self) interested in that too.
If we dont keep our eyes open we risk this sub simply becoming "bitcoin shill ltd".
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:46:40
I am not disagreeing with you (yet !) but would like to get a handle on why the word "adoption". Is it not just ownership or holding ? We cannot really say "users" as I think most of us are well aware that a huge number of bitcoin hodlers / traders / investors do not actually use it to buy goods or services.
Whether an increased number of individuals holding bitcoin is significant or "good" is another matter. And we might be wary of a simple analysis of quantity BTC per address as increased use of wallets usually results in multiple addresses for individuals. Also some large holders (ETF ?) might well be splitting their holdings up for security and/or other reasons.
The stats from the exchanges might be more helpful (number of registered users, number of active users) but I am not sure how many have given out such info. 
We face the usual problem in trying to "mine" data like this off blockchain info, etc, and have to be careful (if we want to be accurate/truthful !) of not reading TOO much into things. As you may have gathered, here we like to dig deep into the details !! 
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:56:07
A centralized digital currency using the same or similar ideas to the bitcoin protocol is indeed a "cryptocurrency". The matter of whether it is centralized or decentralized is not important to the way that it functions.
We can set up 2 different cryptos identical in all respects except one is centralized and one is decentralized. From the POV of users there is no functional difference.
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:21:51
DOH ! Well obviously "Yes" but don't expect many of them to be posting a reply right here, that is reserved for holders of the opposite opinion !!!
IMHO the bitcoin ATH looks further away than ever with the real money going into "cryptocurrency" in general rather than bitcoin specific. Too many bitcoin enthusiasts have taken their eye off the overall crypto scene and are blinkered into watching the $/BTC charts. Keep a close eye on the competition, my friends, this is where the interesting activity becomes apparent later this year.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:23:31
Not true. The "faith" is only in a tiny community of pro-bitcoin enthusiasts. The larger community of the general public associate Bitcoin with risk, scams, theft and losses. Nothing with the word Bitcoin in it is going to have mass market appeal. By mentioning dodge coin you have demonstrated you misunderstood my point. No EXISTING cryptos are going to win long term, they all have the same defects as Bitcoin. It does not matter how many $ have been spent/wasted/lost/gambled into BTC the very word Bitcoin is severely tainted. To suggest any talk helps is clearly nonsense, what matters is public perception not the views of a tiny community.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:06:39
It has not been launched yet - check it out when you see it. IF these problems have been solved or vastly reduced I predict that it will quickly overtake Bitcoin and gain mass market acceptance.

Yes, I think you are wrong on several counts.
I suspect the main reason for a wildly fluctuating price is the actions of short term (day ?) traders, speculators generally and market manipulation by exchanges, who are of course all unregulated.
There is a huge temptation for exchanges to act in their own interests and keep the price fluctuating to generate more transactions and hence more comission income.  No body overseas the exchanges or carries out even the most rudimentary of finacial checks - it really is "wild west" country out there !

"Decentralised" might be exciting some people on here but I think the outside interest from other "investors" in Bitcoin is interested in other things not least the reduced cost of financial transactions,  and that can apply to any crypto.
I would suggest, however you define "decentralised", that the ordinary joe has no interest in that and if a government crypto (or crypto style gloss) attracts them they will use it and not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:17:48
I am a firm believer in crypto-currency and think it will be very important in the world in 5-10y time.  Unfortunately I do agree with you that bitcoin has marked itself out as unsuitable for everyday use by the ordinary Joe Public. The thefts/scams/dishonesty etc have also tainted the word bitcoin in the eyes of the general public.
It is likely that bitcoin itself is now dying (slowly at present but maybe very quickly soon) and we will soon see a much better crypto-currency emerge which has less of the problems of bitcoin and is safer to use, easier to use and may even be pegged to a fiat currency. 
Of course a lot of the bitcoin enthusiasts on here will say that a sponsored crypto which is pegged is not a crypto at all. They will be wrong and in reality the views of a minority of bitcoin enthusiast are irrelevant compared to the views of a few hundred million ordinary consumers who will like the new sponsored pegged crypto.
Very few people are interested in stuff like liberty, decentralisation, anonymity. Rather more want safety, ease of use and known fixed value.
As bitcoin falls in price then r/bitcoin will become more interesting for the likes of you and me to discuss the coming world of cryptocurrency, there will be fewer idiotic price shilling and "to the moon" rubbish and more sensible talk about what makes a good crypto.
Keep watching, and don't forget to keep an eye on the altcoin scene too. The big winner in future crypto space may be one of those.

Relevant and important news will not be found only in biased pro-bitcoin publications/sites/etc. You need to look wider to get a true picture of what is happening in the world of crypto-currencies. I note, with interest, that many pro-bitcoin sources are very sparing in their coverage of the wider crypto scene and the many altcoins about. This is quite "interesting" considering how many of the bitcoin exchanges have a very wide offering of altcoin prices and also recent surveys which show that about 40-60% of bitcoin hodlers also own other altcoins !!

It appears to be an increase in buying but there have been suspicions of exchange manipulation before, especially Mt.Gox.

In the real world (outside of reddit subs and other circlejerking communities !) all businesses and organisations keep a close eye on not only competitors and potential competitors but the wider newsworthy developments in their "field". Bitcoiners should do the same and welcome information, posts, replies, discussions about doge, other alts, wider crypto news, etc. Lets move away from this attitude that any mention of altcoins is inappropriate !
@_date: 2014-05-07 05:12:31
Please take a "Calm" pill.
 Although I see a degree of so called trolling on this sub (in common with many other subs) I also see a very high degree of pro-bitcoin enthusiasts calling posters trolls when they have simply expressed a contrary opinion, raised a valid point about a defect with bitcoin or suggested things like it might be vastly overvalued. 
These type of posts are not "trolling" but genuine discussion about bitcoin so we hope you do not fall into the category of false trolling accusations. Lets assume not for the purpose of answering your post !
Although (theoretically) it would be nice to give everybody as much freedom as possible in practice large complicated societies with big populations need to adopt some rules and regulations in order to operate i.e. not degenerate into chaos. The regulation of anything considered a currency is pretty vital to that as it will be essential to monitor what businesses and individuals do fairly accurately so that a taxation system can be impimented with general agreement.
If the tax system is not perceived to be reasonably fair it will be difficult to collect it. Therefore the establishment of a "main" currency for accounting and taxation purposes is essential.
On top of that it is generally allowed for other currency type things to exist with various degrees of regulation. Bitcoin currently falls into the "allowed to exist" category but some governments are trying to ban/restrict/regulate it. In the future this may change for bitcoin but if it does it will change for all crypto-currencies. The regulators are not likely to set anything up solely for bitcoin. Expect to see discussion about regulation being more about cryptos in general rather than bitcoin specific.
Personally we want the experiment in crypto to continue as more needs to be done but we want all cryptos to have a chance to do more in the world not just bitcoin. There are defects with bitcoin which look like real trouble in the future and several altcoins are trying to address these.
At the moment bitcoin is the biggest so tends to attract the most attention from both pro-crypto enthusiasts and anti (and trolls), it is probably best to take all criticism "on the chin" because it is only by discussing both the good AND the bad that real improvements can be made in these areas. I think most of us would agree that bitcoin is unsuitable in its present form for real world use by the general public so there is a lot that needs to be done if it is not to be overtaken by a new crypto with better features.

Diversify, buy some other cryptos, there is a good chance that bitcoin will not be the long term winner in crypto-space but that crown will go to an altcoin. Check out the competition, do your own reasearch, look at the problems which bitcoin has and how certain altcoins are trying to solve them, check out the details of the altcoins protocols and their backers, their websites, etc. There is some very interesting stuff out there and always remember that bitcoin is not the only tree in the orchard.

Our algorithimic predictor is sometimes wrong and sometimes right. We judge carefully when to put money on it. Generally trading as CFD on BTC with Plus500.

You may have failed to take account of the possibility that bitcoin stays around but in view of competition is not the only crypto and although useful to buy goods and services (along with the other cryptos) trades at around $1 -$10 per bitcoin. 
Your strategy would then seem to be a mega fail ! Although bitcoin itself is used a lot and could be said to have succeeded. The point is that there is a very weak correlation between utility and the exchange price.

As we are all well aware that computers store stuff digitally in order to sensibly apply the word "Digital" to something there should be some aspect of it that is digitized other than for computer use/storage.
For example: Digital Television - the transmission system has a digital aspect to it, multiple carriers at various phase-quadratures if I remember correctly.
To apply the word "Digital" to bitcoin we need to see something other than it simply being used on/via computers. Is there any aspect of it that is like that as opposed to discrete chunky "analog-y" fiat ? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 08:06:22
The reality is that traders and speculators have done great damage to bitcoin by inducing wide volatility as they play their games with the simple intent of making money.
This accusation can also be levelled at many others in the bitcoin space and here on r/bitcoin who are also profit motivated. Numerous posters talk about trading, buying/selling, trying to make money,etc. Rather fewer have an interest in discussing the pros and cons of bitcoin as a useful cryptocurrency.
This is changing as more lose money as the price drops and they leave bitcoin. So, IMHO, the continued price falls are indeed "Actually Good News" !!

There is indeed a great similarity in many respects between past historical scheme/scams such a the tulip-mania and bitcoin. And the initial point you made is also referred to as the "bigger fool" scenario.
There have been attempts before to create money, some (I think one in the USA) failed due to government restrictions (declared illegal) but whether it would have succeeded/failed anyway is unknown. Other money similar schemes exist (like air-miles, nectar poiints,rewards points, etc). Which category bitcoin truly falls into is debatable and there is certainly no shortage of such debate here and on other subs.
Many altcoins seem to have been created specifically as pump/dump scams and have made some people quite rich. Others seem to be a genuine attempt to solve a technical problem in the bitcoin protocol.
Whether bitcoin is a scheme/scam is a very interesting question but maybe it is not necessary to know the answer. Maybe it is only necessary to watch the price and the behaviour of the hodlers ?

You appear to have got me all wrong.

2)Expressing an opinion via the use of humour is not trolling.
3)As previously mentioned I do not dislike crypto (or Bitcoin) but bitcoin is broken now and is dying.
4)I understand Bitcoin and crypto . Have been watching and studying Bitcoin for over 2 years. Studied cryptography for decades.
5)Bitcoins historical or future price is irrelevant. The success or otherwise of any crypto is related to its USE. Not its exchange rate vis-a-vis any fiat.
6)This is r/bitcoin. Vocalisation is what it is (unless you are just going to use emoticons).

You completely misunderstood my logic. There are many reasons why it is apparent that bitcoin is not going to be useful in the real world for most people. I am not just looking at where it is now.
Anyway as 2014 seems to have seen continual price falls and we are now at 3 month lows off Mt.Gox and going back down to Mt.Gox $100 I think most people are selling out of bitcoin as we speak . Actions speak louder than words ?

The similarities are interesting. Crypto enthusiasts saying (pretending ?) the price is irrelevant because of its fantastic world changing features. Buyers who are exceptionally enthusiastic about the price going ever upwards (to the moon). These kind of "silly" attitudes do nothing to help the cause of crypto-currency. If we could get back to a more rational sane view it would be great !

Any investing is gambling, even hodling. The reality of bitcoin is that there is a vast amount of trading going on. Interestingly trading CFDs is an "off exchange" deal and Plus500 do not hedge so whatever postion I take on Plus500 of whatever size makes not a single satoshi of difference to the BTC price.

To be honest I have seen no evidence of sensible action by the mods and a considerable degree of what appears to be "censorship" particularly of some posts which are not pro-bitcoin e.g. comparing bitcoin to tulip bubble. 
These kind of "alternative" views seem to disappear on a regular basis particularly older historical ones. I would seriously like to get to the bottom of that before enforcing rules more. 
All "censorship" should be transparent or not take place at all.

Twas always thus.
Actually it comes and goes and there is plenty of outlandish shilling, pumping or downright silly $100,000 posts on here but I think that is the nature of the beast right now. Hopefully as the price continues to fall to more realistic sub $100 levels this will peter out and we true cryptocurrency enthusiasts like you and me will be back having sensible discussions about the subject. 
TL:DR Still overbought - wait for more falls.

Yes, but holders of Bitcoin are likely to give a shit as they now see the price at a 3 month low (off Mt.gox) and going towards $100 on Mt.Gox.
At least they are acting logically and selling out to mitigate their loss which is what I would advise everyone to do. This time next month we will be lower than now by a significant % if it carries on thus and I see absolutely no reason why it should not continue to so decline.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:22:50
We want and need more government regulation for bitcoin to start to drive out all the criminality which currently occupies the bitcoin space. If we can get rid of all these bad actors we stand a chance of getting bitcoin into a more favourable light with the general public. At the moment it is too closely associated with scams, thefts, hacking, etc and too many enthusiasts of bitcoin have suffered losses.
Good regulation is not only desirable but is essential to the future of crypto-currency. As an experiment in a new cash trading system bitcoin has had some success but it has been hijacked as some kind of libertarian agorist freedom instrument by some rather undesirable sections of the community.
I say lets stand up to these people and get them off bitcoins back, it was never indended as an instrument for use by these minority interests and their involvement is doing bitcoin no good at all.

Probably, the long positions on bitfinex were obvious as was the timing on expiry. I suspect however that several traders saw this and had a go independently. I wouldn't call it manipulation though, simply use of open market knowledge. It was a gamble as there is no way of knowing if it will be sucessful or not, there may have been others waiting to buy in huge amounts at a certain price, so certainly had a risk attached. In any case as bitcoin exchanges are totally unregulated we do not think anyone can cry foul in this particular scenario. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 07:57:37
I think you may find they are in the majority. There are a few of us who really like the idea of crypto-currency and believe it is likely to be very important in the future (I do) BUT.....
....we do not think bitcoin is going to be the winner in future crypto space and the above  play a very large part in coming to that conclusion. The dishonest and criminal element have really fucked it up for the rest of us, and the weird minority libertarians have managed to knock some more nails in the coffin lid.
Part of the problem in migrating bitcoin into a mainstream useful currency is related to its early history where it was used for darkmarket type activities and had a significant number of libertarian/agorist supporters. This is very "remote" politically from what is necessary in order to appeal to ordinary Joe Public.

Whether this relative degree of stability remains is highly doubtful. There are just too many hodlers and traders who are profit motivated and trade volume is likely to spike either way with a significant break below or above critical values.
Overall the probability is skewed very much towards the downside (bearish). There is also the continued daily overhang of c3800 mined btc. A subtantial proportion of which needs to be sold quickly to cover running costs of large commercial mining set-ups and with the price being so much lower than earlier this year that proportion is higher .

Very true, you put it well. There is no "logical" thought out investment analysis in his piece at all - just a load of hype and shill really. Of course if Bitcoin does go to 10x, 100x or 1000x he will look clever and those who followed him will be rich and smug. alternatively if it goes to zero or any figure below 1x he will say "well I did say it might go to zero".
Lets be VERY CLEAR - THIS IS A GAMBLE so if any of you out there are putting in so much that it will really HURT if it goes to $100 (or less !) you have only yourselves to blame and your own excessive greed. Put in only an amount you are indeed happy to loose as many have said on here before.

I recommend all who are interested in cryptocurrency and bitcoin do some research into how this all works, what the pros and cons of various features of the protocol are and look into the innovations being made in the altcoin scene, and who is behind them.
One problem which has continually been discussed here is the 51% mining threat and a few alts are working on eliminating that. There are other things - go do some research especially if you have money "invested" in Bitcoin. As a general point investors should always keep an eye on the competition in their particular field, don't be arrogant and assume that Bitcoin is the king and always will be or you might be unpleasantly surprised in the future !

A "Sure am". (Translation "Yes, I am buying something" so clearly that could be bitcoin or 10kg of C4 and you have still been truthful !!).
Example 2.
Q "Buying a car or something ?"
A "My wife and I are going to look at a couple of cars tomorrow" Translation "We are going to look out of the window at the 2 cars in the driveway next door"

If new to bitcoin there are loads of charts to examine and lots of research to do before you decide to "risk" any hard earned money in this unique unregulated experiment full of traps for the unwary and subject to continuing scams and thefts.
Why not start with the fact that the All Time High was months ago, was over $1240, and we have been trading at substantially lower than that ever since.
You will find that there are many participants here who shill it up to an extreme degree and we suspect a fair proportion of them have bought too high and are sitting on a real world loss. They are getting desperate to suck more players in hoping to get it back over $1000 or wherever they bought so that they can cash out at a profit (or smaller loss).
If you are new to bitcoin be very wary !

Nowhere in my post do I mention Mt.Gox. My humour is a comment on bitcoin in general, not Mt.Gox investors. Bitcoin is broken, caused by numerous problems and difficulties and Mt.Gox situation now is simply a symptom of just one part of it.
You are being very naive if you think the only problem with bitcoin is the deflation factor. I draw your attention to the following problems/difficulties:
Repeated thefts/hacks of bitcoins from users and exchanges.
Complexity of ensuring safekeeping of bitcoin assets. e.g. hot wallet,cold wallet,off-line signing, etc.
Unregulated nature of exchanges, several early exchanges folded and "took" investors bitcoin with them.
Association with drugs. This in itself mitigates against the wide adoption of this crypto.
there are more, but I strongly refute your "only" comment.
You are right there is nothing better YET. My point is we need to ditch Bitcoin and start again to solve all these problems.

No, its going down. Try LOOKING at the chart. This time next month way below $400 and the month after that expect to see $200-250 ish. I may be wrong but our computer algorithms have had a 85% success rate with BTC/$ over the last 14 months and shown a consistent profit stream. We put our money where our mouth is !
Feel free to follow your own ideas however but do remember it takes quite a lot of effort to earn your $ and you will feel very sick if in 2 or 3 months time your so called investment has halved. How much is the real "can afford to lose" amount for your own personal circumstances ? Whatever it is do not exceed that figure as an investment into bitcoin and all the other altcoins. and if you put some into bitcoin why not diversify into the alts too, doge, etc ?
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:05:50
If you want to use bitcoin as an investment (make money) you will be much better off if you trade it as CFD (contract for differences) on somewhere like Plus500. Its much better than holding bitcoin itself and you can make money when the price falls as well as rises.
Do have a look at it, it has served us well and been very profitable ($5K turned into $124K !).

Actually not new, been around investments for decades and bitcoin nearly 2 years. My experience is clearly different from yours, I have contacts in "smart money" and also know what is going on in various places and you are just plain wrong. There IS a clear move toward money going into crypto-currency in general and not bitcoin specific, there IS a realisation that bitcoin has many problems for real world use and is also tainted by bad publicity. There is clearly the possibility of a better crypto being devised that can be sponsored by a large company or even a government and be seen as much better than bitcoin, have large monetary backing for advertising and development and could easily overtake bitcoin to become the bigger crypto. These are not "idiotic arguments" but plain facts which a lot of people realise. You, clearly, are not one of them !
Your sentence ".. Bitcoin cannot fail... if it does.. " is clearly nonsense but I can see how you are desperate to defend your position ! Would this be because you have invested your hard earned money and are now getting desperate to shill it up as you are seeing a loss and watching the price gradually reach new lows (with a few ups &amp; downs) ?
Finally, for others reading this discussion, please check out the history of posts on here about serious competition for bitcoin and also the news items where it is clear my views are not alone. You do have to be careful of news sources, quite a few are biased and are "only" bitcoin but there is the wider unbiased press and the wider crypto news. Also other crypto related subs are worth watching. An eye should be kept on the altcoin scene where some serious work is taking place on trying to solve some of bitcoins weaknesses (e.g. 51% mining attack).

It is not a "good" investment, more like a risky gamble with (many would claim) a binary outcome i.e. might be worth $0 might be worth a lot. Time alone will tell but how much time are we going to give it ? Predictions last year now look stupid and as I write the price continues its downward trends. 
There are a lot who are trying to "talk it up" who may well have a vested interest because they are already invested at prices somewhat higher than today's exchange rate. Be careful who you listen to !! Do your own research ? Think about other ways to "invest" in the idea of cryptocurrency apart from just buying some BTC.

It is simple physics, to get the fastest possible hash rate and hence most productive miner the processor will need to be run at the maximum possible speed, this means it runs really hot, and to remove this heat requires some forced cooling i.e. fans.
No one is going to build a miner with a cooler slower processor which does not need fans as it will sell for far less money as the hash rate is much slower.

Bitcoin is only one of a number of competing cryptos. None have origins from a large company or government sponsor. It is trivial and relatively low cost to start a new altcoin.You can tweak the parameters of the protocol to suit whatever you want to achieve, e.g. ease of mining, coin limit/inflation rate,etc. As soon as a large company like Amazon sees the opportunity here and government regulation and acceptance kicks in bitcoin will be usurped by a sponsored commercially designed altcoin that has instant mass market appeal. There is nothing unique or special about Bitcoin that will ensure it stays "top of the tree".

Oh Dear, you are so wrong on every count I do not know where to begin. Bitcoin is virtually dead now and it matters not a jot how many future "investors" are drawn in to this "bigger fool" scam. The evidence of history shows that bitcoin is of no use to the ordinary mass public, other better designed , more secure and regulated cryptos may be useful but Bitcoin is severely defective. As for peace and freedom I am afraid the vast majority of Bitcoin enthusiasts on here have very little regard for it, many are just foul mouthed ignorant idiots whose normal response to a post they dislike (i.e. one even a trifle anti-bitcoin) is to shout "troll" or emit 4 letter abuse !

First to market has actually proved to be the death of Bitcoin because it has been overtaken by wild speculation on the price and not received the attention needed to fix all its faults. Bitcoin is totally unsuitable for use by ordinary consumers, they will not be interested in anything with the Bitcoin name in it as they will remember all the bad publicity, the thefts, closed exchanges, hacks, accidentally lost coins, wild price fluctuations and stories of significant real world losses. No sensible consumer will touch Bitcoin with a barge-pole, its just too badly tainted and perceived as too risky.

Our tech' analysis algorithms take account of psychology and we add +/- factors to it according to the cyrpto news, etc. The psychology involved is actually not very different to the somewhat historical tulip-mania and we have incorporated a little of that into our software (would have done more but historical records are poor/incomplete). so far we have a very acceptable 85% accuracy and a 5 figure profit over
about a year. 
If you re read my post you will see that I did not claim BTC would hit $138 I simply said that was the technical support level below $400. It appears that $400 has not been breached (yet) so we wait to see how high it bounces (I think it is a bounce). We are fairly confident that $500 is unlikely to be broken before another test of the $420 area.

A little pun on "seen Satoshi ?", which we havn't 'cos he(they) disappeared. Avoids using the word bitcoin (as there are others) but keeps reference to it with the founders name and the eponymous tiddly fractions.

There is no such thing as a "real price" . It is what it is (traded at). 
In 2-3 years bitcoin is likely to either have very serious competition or will already have been overtaken by another crypto. Probably not one of the popular altcoins but more likely a sponsored pegged crypto similar to bit-dollar.

Easily solved. I will just get my fridge (with its own IP) to do my bitcoin trading for me when it is not too busy doing the shopping.

The problem illustrates in an interesting way the general absurdity of the claim made for bitcoin that it is decentralized.
Only certain specific aspect are decentralized in certain ways and at certain times. The rest is not. We need a TOTAL rethink including the elimination entirely of the possibility of 51% mining attacks. See Badgercoin and other alts for better ideas.

Bitcoin is effectively dying as I write. Keep well clear. It is totally unsuitable for mass market adoption and has masses of past bad publicity. Save your money for the new crypto that is coming which does not have all this "history", has regulated exchanges, has a very low risk of hacks/thefts. I do not think you will have to wait long, expect to see it within 12 months, shortly after Bitcoin has been buried.

See previous reply about use of the English language.
r/bitcoin welcomes all kinds of opinions whatever the posters expertise but it would greatly benefit the cause of crypto-currency if there was rather less of the attacking of people just because one disagrees with their views. We want less of the "BS" "Fuck you" etc type replies and more of the "That was an interesting view, but I disagree with it because... " type of discussion. This will elevate not only r/bitcoin into a more serious place to discuss important matters relating to crypto-currency but also show us in a good light to the outside world.
The level of discussion and general language, tone, etc on here in the past has been very puerile at times and also offensive at times. We should all consider carefully what kind of message this gives to the outside world, to newcomes to the bitcoin scene and to watching news media.

There has been some considerable profit to be made in altcoins which has not been available at the same time in bitcoin. Certainly some early adopters of certain alts have been able to get 2-8x price appreciation when bitcoin was hardly moving. your comment about the charts is certainly not true although there is a degree of correlation with bitcoin once altcoins are established. There are several other point in your reply which are wrong and I will address those shortly but have to sign off for an hour or 2 now.

We are republicans here. ((Edit; the dragons are also carnivores)).
BTW my algorithms are still showing a 80-90% chance of a break down through $400 before the end of May so please be patient. We may of course have the 10-20% "not" scenario but our analysis shows that the bull side is only established if we have a minimum of 5 consecutive days of increasing closing highs above $450 . Not impossible so keep watching. 
We think it looks increasingly bearish now as $450 has failed to hold on several occasions and there is regular selling in volume every couple of days (probably mined coins).

We stick by our predictions as posted earlier.
Ran our algorithms again on Sunday with all the latest price charts and bitcoin and crypto news factors added in. Here is the result:
There is a 80-90% probability of a price break down through $400 within the next 16 days.
If $400 breaks on the downside there is a 50/50 probability of trading in the $200-250 region within the subsequent 30 days.
Our algorithms are tested against the real world, based on over 40 years of investment experience and, so far, have shown a 85% accuracy with respect to bitcoin. More than enough to show consistent substantial profits if traded sensibly.

I think your comment about altcoins market cap going down slowly is also applicable to bitcoin as it has decreased a lot since its peak, agreed with ups &amp; downs but the trend seems obvious. I must admit I do not check altcoin stats regularly but last time I looked there were c 200 listed on one site and at least a dozen or so had market caps in $50K+ bracket. I would call that significant but of course your definition maybe $M so yes, just a few.
My general point was that it is trivial to start a new altcoin and have it progress (without any backing/sponsor) so a new coin from the likes of "Google" or similar could quickly overtake Bitcoin. I doubt any altcoin simply launched from someones basement will be the winner in future crypto-space but a large company, or even government, can realy push/promote their own crypto massively more than anyone at bitcoin can do.

If you want to make money out of bitcoin and are confident it is going up you will make much more money by trading CFDs (contracts for differences) on somewhere like Plus500 than you will by trading or holding bitcoin. 
Sure buy some and keep it for long term investment but then take any extra spare income you have and trade it on Plus500.
This is our philosophy, we have a nice stash of over 2000 BTC acquired at an average price of less than $10/BTC and we now actively trade it and have made over $124K doing so. Have a look and see if it suits you. Trading CFDs is much less hassle than dealing with bitcoin exchanges,moving BTC off exchange, dealing with cold storage, etc and all the paperwork is done for you for income tax reporting, etc.

Yes, I did know that ! If you are relying on a barrier (case) to stop access to a port (socket) that would otherwise be accessible then you need to ensure that the barrier is robust enough i.e. it is not easy to cut holes in it. As you can cut quite thick hard materials with very little  effort &amp; time these days due to modern power tools then this would imply a very thick case which would be very expensive. Much better to have nothing critical behind the barrier (case) and locate these parts elsewhere so that cutting holes in the case does not lose you the cash. !!

Sorry I think you are just plain wrong there. Even if bitcoin fails (whatever that means) and even if that drags all the other cryptos down (price wise) they will still exist to some extent BUT even if they all "disappear" I believe the idea of cyrpto-currency is too important to be forgotten and it will continue to be worked on. So investing in alts is a very sensible diversification, there are several which are not bitcoin clones/copies and have developed new ideas (to improve upon some negative aspect of bitcoin) these are definately worth watching. Also new ones coming out weekly merit the same attention - check out what they are trying to do.
The "linkage" between other cryptos and bitcoin is weakening as more people become aware of the competitors and what they have to offer. also there is I think a degree of disappointment with bitcoin because the devs' have been rather slow to act to sort problems out in the past and have been less than democratic in their decision making.

a better question is whether they help or hinder the future of crypto-currency in general. It is pretty obvious to those outside r/bitcoin and to some inside who pop their heads out above r/bitcoins cosy little ivory towers that bitcoin itself is unlikely to be the long term winner in crypto space. It has too many defects for use by the mass market Joe Public. It is more likely that the future world winning crypto is going to be spawned in the altcoin area so this really is the one to watch now.
bitcoin lost its first mover advantage some time ago when bitcoin dev' team failed to act quickly to solve all the problems that were emerging as adoption increased.

The "neckbeard" is a normally solitary creature which spends most of its time in its den either on a computer, reading comics or eating pizza. When it does venture outside it is usually to meet with fellow neckbeards at themed gatherings called conferences. This may be something like a bitcoin conference, star-wars, star-trek, etc.
Neckbeards are invariably male and do not, except in exceptional circumstances, have a female mate although some may claim to have a "girlfriend" this will usually be an online relationship (often with another neckbeard pretending to be a girl).
Classified as a sub-species of "nerd". Some nerds do appear to transmute into neckbeards as they get older and become more unkempt and dishevelled in appearance , possibly due to their mothers no longer being around to do their washing.

There are a FEW large buy orders which are moving the market today. Likely to be a small number of players, maybe even a solo. We have no idea who or why so remain cautious, general trading volume has not significantly increased but a little up due to the upswing enticing a few waiting buyers out of the shadows. If the market continues to make increasing daily highs which hold for say, 5 days, consecutive we will be turning towards a bullish sentiment but if the highs fail to hold, as they have done in the past, we remain bearish. In short a little to early to tell now but it injects some excitement anyway.

The risk of investing solely in bitcoin is actually a lot higher now that there are so many (250+) altcoins available and thus significant competition . In addition the defects in bitcoin have become apparent and it looks increasingly likely that bitcoin will be unsuitable for mass market real world use by ordinary Joe Public. (Bitcoin now also has a bad reputation in the eyes of the general public).
We think the risks are at least as high, if not higher now and anyone looking to invest should spread their money into several other promising altcoins and also consider the companies and infrastructure associated with cryptocurrencies in general. Whatever you do it would be a bad idea to go "all-in" on bitcoin before considering the alternatives and what the future might hold. it is certainly a possibility that bitcoin could still go to zero if a new and better crypto comes along which has mass market appeal. bitcoin could be overtaken in a matter of months and could "die" quite quickly.

There are many big gold mines out there and recycling of scrap gold is quite a high percentage. I think gold supply is increasing every year. It is also being used up for lots of things e.g. electronic components. The total amount of gold as an investment is probably somewhat less than $6.2T. Shall we Guesstimate at 50% ? (3.1T).
 
12M bitcoins currently but research shows a large number sitting in old wallets and never used. I think I saw this was 60%. So lets say 4.8M actively held "investment" BTC.
I therefore get (extreme rough estimate) 4.8M/3.1T=0.15%.
We have come up with a similar figure by different assumptions so I reckon that is quite fair and reasonably accurate as a starting point.
Bitcoin has a number of advantages over gold as a store of value. It is trivial and low cost to store and transport any amount, even say $10M. This would be expensive/difficult with gold. Also once many more merchants start to take bitcoin for goods or services it is easier to spend i.e. convert to something else.
In reality I think 1.3% target (long term) is probably a wild underestimate. 10% would seem realistic to me but we might be talking 5 years out here. Not long really considering many people hold investments (or even deposit accounts!) over much longer terms.

I agree , and I do think ease of use of bitcoin has come a long way and there is much more information about using it out there now. Also we have some new ideas like Trezor.
The fiat options are indeed more restrictive in some ways and costly but they do not get much worse with time. Bitcoin is doing really well at this stage in its life and I do expect it to get better but may need a few "tweaks" from the software experts to hurry it along.

Really you are looking too far out in time. I suggest a 2-5 year time horizon for a more widespread use of bitcoin by what I term "the ordinary Joe". Global acceptance by governments &amp; all businesses &amp; all the people will probably be years after that.
For a 2-5 year horizon I think 10s-100s $K is not unrealistic.
This is a VERY wide range (of course !). Anyone who starts being specific about things like this deserves your suspicion I would think.
So what i am saying is maybe $20k, maybe $40k, maybe $100K, maybe $600K, who knows. But something very much larger than what we see now.

Your initial statements / assumptions are wrong. I could probably engineer a "bubble" in Donut Discount Coupons at one of my factories with 1,000 employees if I was so minded. 
Only 1000 participants and probably very little credit on the donut speculation.

Yes, as more merchants "go bitcoin" they will be better off keeping a bit for refunds. My daughter (age 14) is into selling stuff on eBay (via my a/c) and we always keep a fair bit in the PayPal just in case there are any complaints/refunds/cases/chargebacks. Bitcoin merchants are likely to do the same type of thing.
Therefore increasing the scarcity of traded coins !

We do not want any kind of censorship or restrictions here. Lets have a free for all. If somebody wants to discuss the relationship between bitcoin and cheesecake flavours so be it.
Feel free to ignore it / down vote it / reply with criticism or whatever but I do not want this free idea of an unregulated currency to be tarnished by small minded restrictions thank you very much !

You seem to have bought yourself "worry" rather than bitcoins. Please think more carefully about what you are doing and why you are doing it before you make decisions like this.
Bitcoin needs people who are promotors/users/spenders/holders (P&gt;U&gt;S&gt;H&gt;) not in/out participants like yourself.
I hope you find an investment more suited to you that you are happy with - clearly bitcoin is not the one for you at the moment but I wish you good luck. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:04:02
Excellent. Yes bitcoin is ideal for small transaction like this and it is very low risk.Good luck with your promotion.
We need more people to do things like this to help promote the idea of bitcoin.

Here is a little true story of my own experience which opened my eyes.
Many decades ago (in my early 20s) I was employed by a large company , I had many work colleagues who were close friends. I had always been interested in becoming self-employed or running my own business and often talked about such things at work so they knew my ambition. I hoped to find one or 2 co-workers who shared the same idea and we could work together on some business idea part time to try it out.
Despite being in a building with over 1,000 workers of which I knew the names of around 1/3rd I didn't find anyone else who was interested in self employment over a period of 7 years working there. I decided to go it alone and started in a very small way running a market stall selling second hand goods. Many of my co-workers knew what I was doing and although some of them seemed interested I did note that quite a lot thought that my efforts were funny or amusing and they were laughing at me. After a year I started a part time mail order business, it grew quite quickly but I continued doing it part time as I wanted to be sure before going full time due to mortgage etc. 
One day I had quite a breakthrough and a large company placed a very significant order with me.This was about 9 am.
My full time work was variable hours and I went in to the office at 10am. At our coffee break at 11 am one of my co-workers asked how my mail order business was doing, I said:
"Great, only this morning I took a big order which made me £10,000 profit" . This was true, and this figure was about 150% of my annual salary (and that of my co-workers at the coffee break).
After making that comment  6 of the people I worked with stopped talking to me and blanked me for several weeks. Not a word of discussion, no comments, nothing, they just stopped talking to me.
You have had your eyes opened in a similar way. Please note their reaction says far more about them than it does about you. I hope you find some nice REAL friends soon !
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:34:25
Exceptionally low fees.
Irreversibility of transaction = more secure/less likely to be defrauded.
At current (new idea) stage there is a huge amount of publicity to be had by declaring "we now take bitcoin" and this also opens up potential new markets (different customer demographic).
On the downside the extreme current volatility of BTC/$ is a real negative.
When bitcoin transactions and associated hardware are refined I would expect speed of transaction may be a benefit but we do need to address the (sometimes) long wait for 6 confirmations issue on larger purchases.
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:06:02
Yes, it does seem quite difficult to explain that this is something completely new and cannot be judged by "old rules".
Best to judge it by its behaviour so far looking at the big picture, the average rises, the moving averages, etc NOT the few down blips along the way. We are now massively up on any 3m/6m/1y/2y view. Worrying about short term sentiment is really just for day trader and we do not want or need people like that in bitcoin. We want supporters and users not profiteers.

Do try and learn something about business before coming up with half baked ideas ! You are freelancing (self-employed), you have a client (hip hip hooray, so far so good). They want to pay you (GREAT !) but, Oh Dear, you don't like the way they suggest (cash), you want it your way (BTC). STOP BEING AN ARSE !!
Take the clients cash, concentrate on giving them an excellent service/product so they come back, keep them happy, (do it their way) and spend that lovely cash on as many BTC as you like. RESULT : Everyone is happy and you no longer look like an idiot.
Now go away and get on with your great freelancing business, Good Luck with it.

As I have just said in another post , we should not be judging bitcoin by "old rules". Bitcoin is something new and novel, please do not compare it with old things like companies and stock market quoted shares. 
Bitcoin is a new "system" if you like. It is not a company trying to make a profit. We should judge bitcoin by its behaviour to date. How it has grown, how many merchants now accept bitcoin, how many users there are and (lastly) its price BTC/$ performance which is NOT the reason bitcoin exists but is a PARTIAL indicator of its success.
I repeat we do not want speculators, profiteers, day traders, etc in bitcoin we want supporters to buy, hold, spend, use and promote this new idea.

Excellent article ! Certainly there is no reason why any company in the bitcoin space should be in any way anonymous or cagey about who they are, who controls/owns them, contact details, etc.
Checking out things for yourself is a very good idea. I liked a couple of companies myself but less than 1/2hr of internet searching soon revealed some very suspicious looking matters hence we struck them off the list !
I particularly like to check out personal information on CEOs and owners. We found one who was clearly a drug user, had been "suspended" from his last employment, was prone to violent outbursts (unstable) and had failed to declare interests in other businesses. He wont be getting any of my money !
Caveat emptor indeed !!

We do not really want/need people who are just trying to make a "quick buck" out of a "game". What we want are investors who are committed to the idea of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general and who are investing for the longer term and/or intend to use/spend bitcoins with various merchants, shops, etc.
People like you only distort the market and make it look more like shitcoin than bitcoin when the prices fluctuate wildly as you "come-and-go". We would rather not have you as an investor. Please go and "play" somewhere else.

As a member of the minority (female) participants in bitcoin I see no issues with it. There are no rules or regulations restricting anyone from participating in bitcoin whether male or female. It is just coincidental (historical relating to computer interests ?) that mostly men are into this now but I can assure you that bitcoin is something we girls talk about too. The bias will shift as the usefulness of bitcoin in real world spending, shopping, etc develops. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:19:41
Bitcoin will be much better off if we can get rid of day traders, they are only in it for the profit and it would be much nicer if we had committed bitcoin enthusiasts who buy, hold, use and promote bitcoin, not profiteers.

Your logic makes no sense to me. In reality we will be going to mBTC or uBTC when it is convenient to do so. 
There have been lots of fiat currencies where things were priced in very high numbers (due to inflation), so the actual numbers whether 10,000,000 or 0.0000001 are really irrelevant. We have after all cents/dollars/$M, etc and the same everywhere with fiat. The "figures" will adjust to make things convenient and mBTC is fine for most everyday things.
We will ask "How many millis ?".
So getting back to your main question it is simple a matter of supply and demand. As I said earlier this will be VERY difficult to predict at this stage of the bitcoin system but on a 2-5y time frame I think somewhere between $10s and $100s of thousands per BTC is realistic. i.e. Anywhere between $20K and $600K, might be more, might be less but SUBSTANTIALLY higher than now.

Idiotic machine designer allowing interface socket to be accessible via a hole. All stuff on the non secure (street) side should be customer interface only.

I will attach 2 electrodes to a part of your anatomy of my choosing. They will be wired through a relay to the mains outlet in the wall. The relay will be controlled by an output from my computer. The input to my computer will be the Mt.Gox real time feed of BTC/$. The program I shall write which will adjust the output (relay on/off) in response to the input (BTC/$ price) will be closely related to all the "predictions" you have made on this sub/reddit.
