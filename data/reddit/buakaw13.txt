1. You're looking for the word "your"
2. there is plenty to complain about when they are selling your information without saying so. Luckily no one that isnt a complete moron uses RH for anything. It is awful for traditional investing and the same goes for crypto. Nothing new. Great app for broke college kids.

Anyone who said that literally does not understand the most basic, fundamental facts about cryptocurrencies. RH didnt even let you withdraw or own a single cryptocurrency. It was NEVER a CB competitor.

Probably because you dont know what programmable or "smart money" could do for you. In other words, you are ignorant to the benefits. Of which there are thousands. 
You wouldnt want to be able to make your money work for you? or set up contracts tied to assets that take care of price negotiation for you depending on the use of the asset?

no, it is not.

lol. 
do you know what fdic insured means? It has nothing to do with crypto stored on cb.

Yea, blockchain and autocracy/censorship go together great! It totally wont be ground zero for a sick, dystopian social credit system-powered future.

You seem to have a weird and misplaced hate for Americans. 
Show us on the doll where America touched you.

Nice strawman. Crazy how you could read that comment and respond to something that was never said.
You must be new to WL and Assange. Anyone that has been following WL for close to a decade knows how they have changed. Assange even hinted at Seth Rich being involved when he knew for a fact that isnt where he got his information (we know this as fact now). he is a compromised liar.

Hinting that they got their intel from a dead man(seth rich) when they know they didnt. 
Selectively releasing information. not releasing "huge" russian leaks when they claimed to have them. 
Youre naive as hell.

The point is there is a purchasing power difference that isnt being covered enough by wage increases. 
I am in awe that you were upvoted this much.
