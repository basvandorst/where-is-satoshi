If you have an iPhone, I think iCloud is a good place to store private keys. iCloud doucument is also backed up on device locally and is itself encrypted(Ofcouse the key file should be encrypted too). Even you lost your phone you can buy a new iPhone and get data back. Based on this principle, I code an app for my self, or you can just use the native file app on iPhone. Loss data is more wider threat than stolen, I think for individual users. So back up encrypted keys on cloud maybe a good solution.

\[This solution may be an alternative to hardware wallet\]
Hi, I have thought about Bitcoin private-key management issue for a long time, and I have created
a wallet app for myself in 2014 on iOS platform. Because I trust iOS platform, the app sandbox and the biometric protection provided by iPhone.
Even more, I trust iCloud storage, I had use iCloud to back-up encrypted wallet data. But when apple transfer the iCloud management to some local authority that make me rethink the AES-encrypted-data and cloud back-up solution, It became vulnerable，because AES-encrypted-data protected by user's password(usually weak password) can be brute-force crack by the cloud administer or hacker.
So this makes me figure out a new solution to protect private-keys using an NFC-XOR card. Using the XOR key storage in the card to protect(xored) the private-key and then back-up to cloud storage this makes a perfect security and can resist any brute-force attack.
This is the first time I introduce the soft-hardware hybrid wallet with an NFC-XOR card solution. The wallet is my side project and the final NFC version still not released. And the wallet is just design for Bitcoin and no other coins intended, so the wallet maybe not a good choice for most cryptocurrency users. But the NFC-XOR card is truly worth to be discussed. There is long history of NFC function on Android platform, but I can't find even one wallet use this solution to protect private-key to resist brute-force attack.
Because, the solution is easy to use and implement, so this maybe a good practice and will be wide used.
With open source software(no matter what kind of platform ), open cloud storage's robust service, and an NFC card, every one can build a perfect Bitcoin wallet.
Even I have built wallet for myself for about four years but the NFC-XOR card solution just comes about 3 months, so It requires detailed and open discussion. I have built a web page and blog ([ ) describe the NFC-XOR solution.

Not fully get what your said, but one private key can make (mostly)  two standard type address. P2PKH address start with “1” or P2SH(SW) address start with “3”.  If you did not release or lost the key you can redeem your funds from both of the address, because Waller app can differ the type and create the related match redeem script to spend the UTXO.  If you want to import the private key to a wallet , the app should let you select one type you meant to then generate the right address.

IMO, besides the code other ideas and comment are also helpful. I think the first step we should read the white paper to know how it works. LN paper give a lot details.

It depends on iCloud to store and sync bitcoin data and have version backups. So technically the data will never lost.
You can set a data encrypt password to encrypt the your data. No one else can reach your private keys without the password.
I'm the developer. Bitkey's first version release is 2 years ago. I made it for a pure tool to storage and manage Bitcoin private keys.

It is about backup keys, backup encrypted wallet data in the cloud.
Because I think backup keys/seeds on a paper is very unreliable(Flood, fire, forgetfulness, damage, single pint risk).
About the brute-attack risk, we can enhance the encrypt password with some security questions which the user never forget and a remote hacker cannot easily guess, for example, 5 people names may give us 100-bit entropy.
Best solution should be the Multisig-TimeLock address for storing a large number of coins.
One key will never be lost and one key is air-gapped secure.

@_date: 2018-12-28 03:13:19
'physical proximity'
When a user purchases a hardware wallet, the user cannot determine whether it has been conquered. As software can check the hash sum but the hardware does not work.  At any point in the supply chain, there is a possibility of physical contact by the attacker.  The hardware wallet is not perfect, a large number of coins must be kept by multisig address.  Hardware wallet is not essential.
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:15:30
Other problems,  wallet will have more data in the future rather than just the key/seed only. For example the multisig scrip, scriptless scripts, MASTs, more complicated info such as timelock in script. Beside the keys backup the whole script should be backuped too.

The fee is related to the size of the transaction, and the transaction size is related to the number of inputs(UTXO) and outputs. Even your source address is one address, there may be a lot of UTXOs in the address.

Two-factor access does not mean preventing brute force attacks. Internal employees can try interfaces indefinitely.

0.001 is definitely too high miner fee, you can use some wallet with the ability to compose a customized fee rate. If you use iPhone I recommend the wallet BitKey, a pure bitcoin wallet. 
At this moment, 16sat/byte fee rate is enough.
Even your transaction size is 1k, at that fee rate, 0.00016000 BTC as fee is enough.

If you use a centralized wallet/exchange, may be the addresses will change and different. 
If you use a decentralized wallet, and you keep you own private-keys, then any one can query your transaction and find your source address. 
 If someone send any bitcoin to this address, you can spend it, because you have the private-key.

FreeWallet is a name of Bitcoin wallet? 
So bad name, such as freewallet, safewallet, trustwallet, BTCwallet. Why use these confusing words to be app name.

WALLET just a tool to help user keep private keys.  Too many bad players are  misleading the new Bitcoin users.

I understand what you described. So my first answer can meet your requirement except the “automatically” feature.  An UTXO level tx build tool can compose the tx, by manually not automatically.
Indeed, the feature you proposed is useful.
I actually use BitKey wallet on iPhone. Every time I compose a tx, I can send my change to a HODL address(A Multisig-timelock address).

The MD5 hash and open source problem,.
The fact is sad any mobile wallets installed from App Store, you cannot confirm the binary is identity to the open source code.
Only PC/Mac wallet can check open source code and hash sum, when you build the code yourself.
Another sad fact, even you build the software from code, you can not confirm that there is no backdoor, you can not  read every line of code and depended library code .  ( Open source Copay wallet issue is a big joke, the dependency lib have backdoor to steal keys)
In this respect, the hardware wallet is good, because the structure is simple and the code is small, can be easily reviewed.

Using multisig-timelock address is a good solution for individuals storage very large amount coins. One key never be lost to avoid data loss disaster,  one key is cold to avoid remote hackers. 
For small number of coins, using a wallet app to management keys( encrypt keys, signing transaction locally on mobile device) is just fine.

iPhone’app have sandbox defaulted, the apps are isolated to each other . Android app can write and read the whole sd card.
