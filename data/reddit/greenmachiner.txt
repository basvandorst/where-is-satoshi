Coinbase sucks. Try localbitcoins or maybe bitquick.co (but I'm not sure if that works there)

True. Hopeful not lower

Hiw old are you if you don't mind. I'm 25
@_date: 2019-07-30 22:16:32
Yeah. Had plenty of chances to save it but kept thinking just get more drugs it might go down
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:20:48
Yeah. I think New York is one of them if in not mistaken
@_date: 2019-07-30 22:48:06
Yeah. I used it to get drugs to get actual money for food and shit. I have a job now thanlfully. But I kick myself for being blind and not knowing that increase. Also I lost an old pendrive around 2013 with at the time $250 in bitcoin. How much would that be now?

Don't jinx it

I could sure use 5k rn. I know I wrote the seed in one of my many notebooks.

Can I post TX ID? Would that help?
I saw it has been seen by peers but my fee was really low. like 50 cents.
Does it ever "drop out" of the mempool?

It's an exchange to buy/sell 
I have used it in the past successfully except for this deposit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:02:54
And if not? Is there a possibility they would be lost? I tried to send the remaining original from the first wallet balance but it never transmitted and did another reset and balance is back. I sent to the same exchange. Localbitcoins
EDIT: It showed up again as pending unconfirmed. Oh well. I just hope I didn't lose them. Hopefully they show up tomorrow or soon
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:56:25
Dang it boy
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:28:31
I thought they were lost forever. I see in my original wallet still the money there. But on blockchain.info it still shows as unconfirmed. Weird. This is the first time I had this happen.

I haven't had a bad experience. I use it to cash out my bitcoins. Also only do cash deposits. 
I mainly use bitquick.co. to buy BTC It is cash deposits 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:10:36
Localbitcoins.com, or I use bitquick.co
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:42:49
I have a job. And I guess I was miskaen. What is bitcoins purpose? Surely not anonymity as has been proven by block chain analysis. Was it to replace the banks? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:25:28
Will do. If this works out good this will be the way I will be buying from now on. I bought $250 worth and got $246 which is not bad in my expectations. Usually I would get.charged like $20 or more. If I can withdraw them I will be using this more often. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:31:28
Like PayPal where you upload an ID? 
My main concern is how to get it out of cash app. I've had friends send me Bitcoin they claim they bought through Cash App but I don't know how that works. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:41:00
It's a software wallet
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:58:40
I usually buy off local Bitcoins or bitquick. But usually do cash deposits in person at banks. This just seems like it would be easier. I bought some and will see how it works out. I just am now awaiting verification to be able to withdraw them
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:34:58
I got it working after a couple of emails to support and successfully withdrew it to another wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:17:31
Tell that to the darknet markets
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:18:11
Does it have to be a drivers license? Or will a State ID work fine?
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:00:36
Earned from work? They payed you in bitcoin? What kind of job/companies pay in BTC?
