Because people selling lowers the price. Therefore holders encourage other holders not to sell. 
Also, it kind of is a team. People are barracking for crypto because they want an alternative to banks and other institutions.

Nah because if we indict them then all that sweet sweet trickle down money will stop

They're not actually a miner. It's a scam website.

They are. Coins are - and will continue to - move to PoS instead of PoW. Capital mining equipment centralisation will become irrelevant.

I honestly don't know the answer to that, but I also don't think it's relevant. It maybe be true what you've said, but it's not an argument to justify what he's likely doing right now. 
Everyone manipulates, but I guess it depends on how selfish you are, coupled with your economic power to realise the vision which determines whether it's a net positive or net negative to society at-large. My argument is that Peter Thiel falls on a dangerous side of both of these in that he's very selfish, and has enormous economic means.

If there is a true revolution (I cringe at the contextual usage here) with cryptocurrencies, it's not going to be done off the back of comments by self-interested parties such as Peter Thiel. It will be done *despite* these people. 
Once you watched him a few times and read a few of his things, it's very clear that he communicates in a very Machiavellian way, and that he leans heavily toward this bullshit Ayn Rand-esque Libertarianism (conveniently avoiding the fact that she died whilst on welfare... go figure). So therefore, to view any of his commentary, especially public commentary, as not having a self-serving agenda, is, in my opinion, absolutely ridiculous. Again, not saying that what he's saying isn't true, just that there's a motive and that logic needs to be followed if you want to find out what he's trying to do and how he's trying to manipulate.

**x doubting y** doesn't necessarily equate **a doubting b**
Buffet is famous for his *investing acumen*, which is a field relevant to BTC. 
The astronauts in the video are *not regulatory specialists or technology pundits*, which are the fields relevant to comment on SpaceX's future.
I'm not dissing crypto – I hold it – but the relevancy of this is not valid.

I’m not saying it’s not true, but it’s worth remembering that this man is an absolute master manipulator. It factors into it somehow.

Because he made enough on his short and now has bought back in long. Because he's a liar. He's actually discussed this exact thing before.
