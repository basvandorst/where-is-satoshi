Yes, as I have understood it, it might be a good solution for malleability and the quadratic hashing problem, if it is done as a hard fork. I think the soft fork solution is the main problem with Segwit. I am no expert here, but this is how I have understood it. The story has been sold that hardforks are dangerous and softforks are preferrable. They seem to create a big mess, where bitcoin can potentially be stolen from segwit transactions by malicious miners etc.
Someone with more understanding of this has written about this but I am not allowed to post the link to it here. If you google "segwit a fork  too far" you will find it.
The malleability fix does not affect scalability now really, as there is no working lightning network yet right?
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:47:34
Well, switch all Core nodes to BU then and we're good to go.
Edit: I now realize Roger Ver is trying to steal the Bitcoin from Greg.
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:47:59
And if everyone must agree on the direction, you are not going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:14:48
So, dynamic block size limit, and keep working on lightning?
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:54:30
Well, doing something like 10 tx / s would be enough now. And work on LN and other things continue. In the future, maybe gb blocks would be ok, who knows.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:36:03
And the c*nsoring
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:45:01
So, what is the proof that this is the result of "spamming" / attacking?
In any case, if the block size limit was higher, it would not be effective. No, I don't mean Segwit, sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:43:54
Some grown up shit
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:00:01
Transactions are not getting through. Fees are high. People choose to use other things than bitcoin to pay for things.

@_date: 2017-02-13 17:00:58
yes, you got the wrong troll
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:29:44
Well, let's say 25.2℅ then if we are just pulling very specific numbers out of our asses, which are not close to being real.
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:50:58
Ok, I read that. So the theoory is that miners would start creating big blocks just to force other miners away, because they can't handle the transfer of the block?
I think this response there is a good point on that:


I mean, openly behaving in this way would not be good for the Bitcoin price would it?
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:11:01
Well, Ethereum has a difficulty update each block, BTC has it every 2016 blocks. Transactions will not be possible, the minority will die out, exchanges will not have trading in it. Right?
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:31:48
I have concerns about it, but I am no expert in this area. My understanding is that the soft fork solution results in a number of problems, like risk of bitcoin being stolen from segwit transactions by malicious miners, reducing the security of Bitcoin, as non-segwit nodes can not validate segwit transactions.
I'm sure you have read "segwit a fork  too far" which lists a number of problems with SW, especially as a SF.
@_date: 2017-02-14 11:40:07
Well, he could create his own coin if he want instead of shitting on the vision of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:46:00
Why would an exchange use two chains? I assume you are trying to scare and confuse people here.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:01:49
My point is that Segwit is a overcomplicated mess for a block size increase solution.
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:15:06
What he means, as I read this, is that your hardfork proposal will be ignored by Core, and that Core will be "fired" if BU activates.
@_date: 2016-03-11 06:36:07
attack? why was it an attack?
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:05:12
No, it is a horrible analogy
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:37:52
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:01:14


Nice shift of focus, because you don't have any real arguments. So Visible then.
The point is: Making comments that are hidden by downvotes visible and then sorting by controversial is pretty bad. 
Just because there are many downvotes, it does not mean that people can't think for themselves or that they are "brigading". It can also mean the the post was worth a lot of downvotes because it was shit.

@_date: 2016-03-11 13:49:00
I really whish I could believe that core has a good plan forward for Bitcoin, but I can not really see how that is so. I really hope I am wrong and that everything is fine, that I have been fooled by the "hive mind" of It really does not seem like it though. It does not look like Bitcoin will be functioning as a descentralized electronic cash system in the future.
About the blocksize, according to the plan presented by core, isn't it a bump to 2MB, earliest july 2017? But not really decided 100% yet (so could possibly much later or never)?
@_date: 2016-03-23 12:20:02
A WoT seems like it would risk becoming a circle jerk, not getting enough new perspectives.
Is there any data indicating that paying for votes would decrease manipulation? I'm thinking a lot of genuine votes would disappear and someone with money could easily manipulate the voting.
Moderators curating everything sounds like a really bad idea tbh. The censoring and removal of posts based on personal beliefs and ideas is already a massive problem.
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:36:30
are you trolling or just completely clueless?
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:37:06
Sure, there are probably times when people just vote without thinking, in some mob fashion, and sometimes there are just many people individually disagreeing and having a good reason for it. Moderators just deciding when there is "brigading" and changing the sort order is not good.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:06:12
Hard fork code should have been ready 3 months after Segwit, which has not happened. Unless you count luke's hard fork code which starts with a block size of 300 kb.
No serious proposal has even been worked on that I have heard of. 
So the Hong Kong agreement was broken, and it does not look like SW will activate.
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:26:19
sorry if i misunderstand now, but do you mean that if 90% of the users leave and the 10% that are left agree, that is "strong consensus"?
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:50:17
Did you misunderstand what he said or are you twisting this on purpose?
@_date: 2016-03-09 09:48:50
What is wrong with that?
@_date: 2016-03-21 08:45:35
it's almost like people are angry at something about this sub.. hmm.. further investigation needed.
maybe the Reddit admins have some ideas here. I've heard some talk about censoring here, a wild thought, but maybe it could be related?
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:57:12
@_date: 2016-01-29 10:59:47
But a minority in control can just change things without asking and stop changes that the majority wants? A small group in control can just decide that they know best? Sounds good.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:52:18
except those votes that are genuine. a lot of those too
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:47:34
No, it's not brigading, it's just people reacting to lies and shitty posts
@_date: 2016-03-05 22:44:00
so blocks should be full, that is ok and unavoidable, and the solution is to have an undo option if the transaction does not go though? let me know what I am missing here.
@_date: 2016-03-28 07:43:20
bitcoin classic is bitcoin, not an altcoin. do you not understand that or are you trolling? it is an alternative way forward for bitcoin, not a new coin.
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:00:23
I'm confused now. Isn't it impossible to steal coins from a segwit transaction? I heard that was one of the lies from the opponents of Segwit. Maybe I misunderstand.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:50:09
Looks pretty accurate really. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:11:16


Sure, "layer" away, but don't force usage into layers outside Bitcoin. Let Bitcoin scale using a larger block size limit And develop LN and other things, and see what is used for different usecases.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:19:02
No, that is not shady... what in the hell
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:01:45
I was wondering what the difference was between a Contributor and a Developer, when the contribution is in part development.
A "Developer" represents all contributors, but a "Contributor" only represent himself, and only the non-developing part of his contributions?
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:02:31
no, noone knows that segwit is going to work fine as a scaling solution  until LN or other payment net is ready (or until core finally raises the block size, if they ever do that). noone knows if and when LN will be finished, and very unclear what capacity increase segwit will have from what I have read. I've heard a lot of numbers. Some claim x1.75, some claim that it will be more like x1.2, and it will take time before it has effect.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:26:51
I didn't see that I shifted focus, I was responding to the point about unhidden downvoted comments. 
And I don't know, I'm not really sure that it is a side effect, seems intentional to me, but I could be wrong.
And I agree that votes are not perfect in any way as a metric for how good a post is, but it helps a bit to find relevant info and points, and it gets confusing and misleading that the sorting order sometimes is changed. And I think it is a real problem that moderators just decide sometimes that the wrong posts are at the top, and the sorting needs to be changed.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:59:34
I think ideas should be considered by their own merit, and not be based on who it comes from
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:10:48
good thing we changed the block size in time then
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:44:50
Yass. 
This concept of a "reference implementation" is a big issue. Let's say Bitcoin Core got it 100% right and have no other intentions than was is best for Bitcoin, I mean, I don't really know. In the future, they might not have the best intentions, or another team becomes the "reference implementation" which might not have the best intentions.
Most people here dislike BU. Let's say it activates. Now most development will soon be done in that project. Are all other implementations attempted attacks on Bitcoin then? And the number of developers are some kind of proof that it is the ultimate implementation?
Development has to be descentralized and contributions anonymous I think. Otherwise we get politics and shit slinging. Creating super stars out of developers is not a good idea, as they can now control public opinion, instead of the best ideas being adopted.
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:36:45
but it is the number of "experts" that matter. the others are just part of the same "hive mind" spreading "FUD"
@_date: 2016-03-13 22:03:31
hmm. i dont know if i am just slow here, but it is still too abstract. what could be the concrete use of what you described?
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:56:24
I don't think bitcoin could handle that today. if there only was some way of handling more transactions
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:39:39
So "Contributor" refers to what then?
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:36:42
what ?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:06:13
Aha ok, sorry, I misunderstood you. 
I think it is because they were expecting Segwit along with a 2mb HF, and now have lost trust, and maybe have become skeptical about SW as a SF, but I don't have a full overview of everything they have said.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:39:39
Because they don't want it. Bitfury and BTCC support it. Most people that is left in this subreddit support it, but that is because of the "moderation" here.
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:59:10
i still have not really understood what smart contracts are useful for. what problems do they solve? what is the hype about? i have a basic understanding of the concept but have not heard any good examples of application.
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:01:36
I think it is more of a stretch that developers employed by blockstream are independent and without an agenda. So I think your theory fails compared to mine.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:35:48
The area is now wiped
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:27:54
Hmm, won't this just result in a bunch of nodes stop relaying blocks, while the network keeps functioning? Unless too many nodes does this silly thing and transactions are affected? I think you have to just accept that SW in it current form probably won't activate. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:05:07
Yes, it was poor judgement to give up the control of the core repo
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:50:49
Well, I see that point too of course. But the political games that follow is a high price to pay. I don't really have a solution though.. maybe some would like to contribute without having to make a name.
And many big contributors do get a salary from Blockstream of course.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:45:17
So if core would deliver a 2mb hf and it activated, the real bitcoin would be the one building on the 1mb chain?
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:48:03
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:07:46
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:07:38
Well, if 25% has their own agenda and the rest does not, maybe the agenda of the 25 % shows a lot.

I have tried to understand what real use Etherum has by reading about it and asking people, but I have not found anything yet. Could very well be that I am missing some things completely, just strange that noone can give one example of a real problem that Etherum solves, or explain what value it brings. All I get is talk about things it can do, but never Why you would want to do it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:10:59
Yes, but I mean, is the argument that the new chain should not be called Bitcoin (even if everyone switched to it)?
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:39:53
And if the price went up im this period you would credit Jihan for that too?  Sheeeeeeeeeeet. You are so full of shit in here.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:36:58
The point is of course that positive views on other things than Core is heavily c*nsored here, and that results in a strong support for core in the people that are left and most active here, and in posts that are allowed.
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:38:58
There is a problem with conflict of interest when you are getting paid by a company to work on Bitcoin, and also are involved politically in Bitcoin and function an authority, don't you think?
I mean, many here in this sub complain about Roger Ver influencing people with money, what is the difference? 
Ideally, no private companies should be influencing Bitcoin development in any way, and contributions should be anonymous. This is probably impossible, to do, I'm just pointing out a problem here. 
The argument that "most development is done on this, therefore it is correct, and we should praise the indiviuals involved in the reference implementation" is not really something that rings true with me. If that it the argument by Andreas there.
And as I said, the idea of a reference implementation that is "under attack", instead of having an open discussion about pros and cons is not optimal either.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:21:10
Is this controversial somehow? What am I missing? Why would he keep the coins in a minority chain which is likely to die off?
And why is it anyone's business what he does with his coins?
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:26:28
Not doing anything would be better than activating this. But actually, it made me smile, so maybe it is not a complete waste of time. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:59:51

@_date: 2016-12-15 13:49:25
No need TO SCREAM.
I just said that they do what they want and do not listen to others, did not mention anything about their authority. 
Having said that, they do act like an authority, and seem to be ok with censoring and keeping control by politics (in the form of deals behind closed doors for example).
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:49:24
My understanding is that miners and wallet providers etc are increasingly disagreeing with Core and that we might see an alternative implementation on the bitcoin blockchain, but we will see :)

Core has not listened, and will continue to not listen. Of course that is important and one reason to not adopt segwit; Core needs to go.
Segwit (if it really is necessary?) should be done properly in a hard fork.
And raise the blocksize limit first.
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:56:07
Yes, haven't you heard about the roundtable bro? They hade this table and it's all over. Contentious hard fork THWARTHED.

@_date: 2016-02-11 12:38:55
Yes, I know that. I mean in this context. What makes classic contentious? It's an opinion, but it is put forward as fact.
@_date: 2016-02-15 11:03:28
Because it is still contentious. It needs years of research and many meetings around round tables and things.
