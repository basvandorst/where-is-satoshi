HODL. lol jk, but not seriously, use a little to gamble. Use a bit to learn how to put in in cold storage and out. Spend a little. Squeeze as much experience as you can out of it. When you've done all that, you'll feel more comfortable investing more or less, and on what.

Yeah, I feel like I'm in the wrong neighborhood in this thread.

I'm sure it's a reference to the (666) mark of the beast. Revelations 13 16-18 
"16 -It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 
17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.[e] That number is 666. which is a marking that you will not be able to do do business without."
So in some Christian's minds, a QR code on your hand that in the future you might not be able to buy things without, sounds a lot like what is described in this part of the bible.

I think it's the potential, and putting the hypothetical 2 and 2 together that gets to them.

Haven't been here in a while... wow, glad I sold at the 800s...

Same. I'm aiming for a total of 10btc before just kicking back and setting up a recurring buy. A good crash would speed that up a littl lol

People who are saying this have just as much knowledge on what will happen as you man. So it's your risk. It could be 10,000 by the end of the year or 1,000 by next week.

As someone who just stores all my coins in paper wallets, will I have to do anything in order to keep them HODLd long term?
