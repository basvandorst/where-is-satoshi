If you want cryptocurrencies to grow in general then you should be concerned by bitcoin failing or losing most of it's value. It will set cryptocurrencies back by years. Sure, most coins won't go anywhere, but people's confidence in cryptocurrencies will be severely diminished.
@_date: 2016-03-01 23:19:28
The cryptocoin tech may improve after a bitcoin death. I don't have many concerns in that area. My concerns are in people's confidence in cryptocoins as a store of value. Bitcoin is generally seen as the "safe" coin value wise. It's the first, the move valuable, and most used. This makes it easy for people entering the crypto world to get coins without having to become very well versed in the crypto market.
After a bitcoin failure that confidence and easy choice will be gone. People could just go to the most popular coin at the moment, but they would be more hesitant as they would have a reasonable fear that their coin would suffer the same fate as bitcoin.

I agree that the trickiest part of this will be determining the change in purchasing power in a well predefined and mutually acceptable way.
One method a bank could use is to have certain price indices, such as a mix of private and government based ones, listed in order of preference.  The most preferred index will be used for determining repayment but if it is no longer available or it is too far from the other indices then they could go to the next preferred index.

I am against IP and I support Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin client software and surrounding algorithms might have IP associated with it but IP is not critical to Bitcoin's operation.  In fact IP is far more likely to harm Bitcoin than help it (such as from encryption and software patents).
Ownership of bitcoins relies on other people (the Bitcoin network) recognizing a transaction that send funds to an account that only you know the associated private key for.  So IP is not essential to bitcoin ownership; only keeping a secret is.


Are you talking about hacking someones account or the entire system and how do you see this in relation to IP?

Actually there is a difference.  In a typical short you borrow an asset and your loses can wipe you out if that asset rises significantly.  This is not the case in this scenario.


It makes financial sense.  It is removing currency risk in a risky currency (you seem to be ignoring this positive aspect of it).  It also allows the bank to get customers who would be reluctant to take a loan out based in BTC (I know I wouldn't).
You are only looking at one possible outcome of the loan.  They could also receive far more BTC than they loaned.
Also banks make loans all the time that "allow" you to pay back less.  It is exactly what happens when inflation is higher than your interest.

Banks could make loans based on purchasing power instead of currencies.  Loans would be paid back with payments equal to some amount of purchasing power.

You have to have that same trust for any other bitcoin client.  Don't forget bitaddress.org uses mouse movements to contribute randomness to the prng.


Again, you also have to trust the armory website isn't doing anything malicious when you download it.  You can get around this by hashing the download and checking if it matches published hashes.  With bitaddress you can download it and do the same thing.
@_date: 2012-06-06 03:24:53
If during the course of the loan the purchasing power of BTC goes down by 50% then the bank would get paid 206 BTC.  By basing a loan on purchasing power you remove the currency risk.
Even if Bitcoin gets widely adopted it will still have risks associated with it.  It could still see massive losses in a short period of time.

Basically the amount money that is required to be paid back on this "purchasing power" loan is set not in nominal terms (you owe me x amount of dollars) but by however much money it takes to meet some predefined purchasing power (you owe me enough dollars to buy this basket of goods).
Example:  
A bank gives someone a 6 month 100 BTC loan on June 1st with the terms stating that the repayment shall have the same purchasing power as 103 BTC on June 1st.  To keep it simple we'll assume only a single large repayment is made at the end of the loan.
During the course of the loan the purchasing power of BTC goes up 50% as measured by the price of BTC in dollars and the inflation rate of the dollars.
On December 1st the loan is paid back with 103 / (100% + 50%) = 66.67 BTC.  This 66.67 BTC in December is worth as much as 103 BTC in June.

Bitcoin client software can already be shared easily.  All the ones I am aware of are open source.
It seems you may be confused on some of the aspects of Bitcoin.  There isn't a single private key that can lead to the demise of Bitcoin once compromised.  It doesn't work like DRM on other software where the private key is stored on a device owned by the person you're trying to restrict.
Each person can create as many private keys and associated bitcoin addresses as they like.  As long as they keep them private they will have control over those funds at the addresses.  There is no software being protected, only private keys.  If someone loses their private key it only affects them.


Which kind of IP do you think bitcoins owner would complain about if eliminated?
Also as you mentioned IP rights aren't really effective, people get around them often and easily.  If Bitcoin relied on IP it would probably already be dead.

An FRB system would be difficult with bitcoin as a bitcoin bank can't just go to a central bank and get more bitcoins in during a possible bank run.  It would be possible if people who store money agree to possible withdraw restrictions until loans could be paid back.  In that system I would not expect the reserve ratios as low as we currently have.
Having an FRB system won't have much long term effect on deflation. There would be inflation during the period it gets adopted, but not afterwards.  FRB basically acts as a money multiplier.  If the monetary base isn't growing, then the money supply won't grow either.

No.  The difference is you can't use just a passphrase to generate all the contents of your hard drive.  You would require the encrypted data to decrypt with the passphrase.

I don't think that will be an issue as most people will probably use thin clients.  Miners, nodes, and businesses can store the block chain.
Keep in mind if the block chain is growing fast then that means there will be a lot of transactions with a lot of fees.  This will help support the block chain storage costs.
There are also distributed ways of storing the block chain, such as users only storing the blocks with their transactions.

Yeah, I think really any balance in a ledger or account system that has real world value should be protected from fraudulent modification.


The government does an extremely poor job of solving problems as it is so I would prefer solutions outside of the government.  Although it would be consistent of them to treat ledger/account systems as they do banking and credit cards.  Since they tend to block out other dispute resolution methods it would make sense for them to handle this.
I prefer systems that are secure enough to not to require dispute resolution organizations as there is a monopoly in that industry where I live.  Plus it's cheaper to not have to deal that stuff.
In reference to video games specifically; I believe that most game EULAs specify that the game currency has no value and that users agree not to sue over it.  This protects them if they delete/lose your account.

Yes, it's similar to shorting a currency against purchasing power, not another currency or commodity.  The one difference is that the bank isn't borrowing the BTC to make the loan (if it did that, the loan would also have to be based in purchasing power).  Since they are not borrowing BTC to short, the loan doesn't have the same risks associated with it as a typical short position.

Currently I doubt any IP rights would help you if someone steals your bitcoins.  Patents and trademarks certainly don't apply and copyrights won't help you either since they are not distributing the private key when they make a transaction.  The closest thing that might help is trade secrets but I doubt that would apply to someone's Bitcoin private keys.
The way I think bitcoin theft should be treated is the same as someone logging into another persons bank account and transferring money to themselves.  It's not the copying of someones bank credentials that is harmful.  It's using those credentials to make a fraudulent transaction that's harmful.  When someone steals bitcoins they are making a transaction with someone elses private key and taking funds that are not theirs.
So if a society has the means to deal with banking and credit card thieves/fraudsters then they sould also be able to apply those means to bitcoin theives.
In practice legal protections won't help much since bitcoin thieves are usually anonymous.  This is why bitcoin doesn't really rely on legal protections, just cryptographic ones.

On a side note when people look at a dollar inflation rate of say 2% they think it's not as bad because they are measuring it against a flat price level.  But really they are being robbed much more than they think because without the creation of new dollars existing ones would be gaining significant purchasing power.

They control the client that is available at bitcoin.org.  Which seems to be the most popular client.  Even the online wallets are using it for the back end.  It is basically the reference implementation.
They also have significant control over the protocol.  In addition to that their seem to be some people that want the development team to have full control over the protocol with users blindly accepting any changes (I hope these people are in the minority).


Yes, and that is great except a client still has to conform to the protocol.  So if something harmful was slipped into the protocol, any client developer would have to support it.  This isn't like a typical open source project where developers can fork and add or deny any change they want.

I think that if governments, such as the USG, wanted to stop bitcoin they would take a somewhat easier route than a technical attack.  For example they could co-opt the development team or at least the part of it that matters.
It wouldn't be that hard for the USG to coerce Gavin into harming bitcoin considering the fact that Gavin lives in the US.  The defense against that would be the community rejecting harmful changes.  However, this may not be very effective considering there are people who want to make Gavin a BDFL and how hard would it be for the USG to create a bunch of sock accounts supporting this call for a BDFL.

The private key is all you need to store.  From the private key the public key can be created and then hashed to produce a bitcoin address.

Multisig allows more than one private key to control the balance at a bitcoin address in various ways.

* An escrow service could have to ability to approve a transaction but not the ability to steal the coins.
* More than one person to have complete control over the balance.  This is useful for situations where the users trust each other but are concerned of something happening to one of them and losing the funds.

No, you can't run a denial of service on a bitcoin address.  If you managed to get many pointless transactions in it would merely be block chain spam.  There are currently limits in place to prevent this, one being transaction fees.

This isn't a flaw in the RSA algorithm.  It is an implementation flaw related to generating the random numbers used.

Any user with sufficient computing resources (not much at the moment) can be a node on the bitcoin network.  A node stores a full copy of all transactions that were confirmed by the network.  There are thousands of nodes online right now, with even more offline.  It is very unlikely that anything but the most catastrophic disaster will destroy the data necessary to bitcoin.

I am not familiar with the site but from reading the FAQ and looking at the image here is my take:
The site requires everyone to pay their highest bid whether or not they win.  The full prize, which is bitcoins, goes to the highest bidder.
In the picture we see two people bidding above the prize value.  These people bidding above the prize are probably associated with the site since they are making clearly loosing bids unless they also receive back their bids (such as the site owner).  So, basically you can't win bidding at this site if you are always out bid by the site owner.
Regardless of any possible fraud this site still seems like a foolish thing to get involved with.

It would have to continuously shrink, which is not going to happen.  Eventually the reserve ratio would get to low where either the bank will raise it or a bank run will be imminent.
Keep in mind I don't think this is a problem.  Bitcoin's resistance to being inflated away is one of its appealing features.

The video links directly to where he talks about bitcoin and he does say a little more.  He mostly talks about how regulatory burdens prevented google from making their own currency and how regulations will be a burden to p2p currencies.

I don't know at the moment.  A tool to associate addresses would be useful.  That way Mt. Gox users can check to see how connected they are to that address.


I hope they are not keeping people's exchange accounts under one address.

I have noticed that too.  It is actually not 0, but usually around 30-50 micro-btc.
I have had trades with that bot or whatever it is.  Each time with a slightly different amount.

Actually it wouldn't kill the network instantly.  At 51% it would take significant time to rework the block chain.  They would also only be able to do double spending on bitcoins they owned.

For maybe a couple months you could see a large bid and ask order that would completely dwarf other orders in size (I believe it was around $100k).
They would move these orders and it would cause the market to move a lot.

I don't think you understand Gresham's Law.
It's not talking about using money for bad things.  It's talking about the consequences of the government fixing exchange rates between two forms of money.

That is a large assumption you are making.  Most coins won't be spent everyday, so if we actually had $1.8 million dollars of transactions per day it would be a lot higher.
Also, how did you come to $1.8 million dollars per day?

There are a lot of bid orders and relatively less ask orders implying people are demanding more and wishing to hold more.
One thing I must note if you are trying to read the market depth is that we are dealing with selling two different types of assets.  
To place a bid order we must first transfer dollars to Mt. Gox which can often take about 3 business days.  Once in Mt. Gox it is more convenient and cheaper to leave the dollars in the account with bid orders just in case it the price dips.
Now to place ask order we must first transfer bitcoins to Mt. Gox.  This usually takes about an hour with no fees.  So if someone has a desire to sell bitcoins at some price they can keep them offline until the price approaches what they want.  There is also more risk in leaving btc at Mt. Gox since they are easier to get out anonymously.
@_date: 2011-12-02 01:12:59
I am also seeing the same thing but with multiple orders in place.  They all disappeared at once.
However, I can see them through the api calls.
EDIT:  The orders are back on the website.  One thing I noticed is that they no longer show Ask orders that do not have enough funds, but will for Bid orders without enough funds.
@_date: 2011-12-08 03:24:58
It looks like they are spending it.
I heard Mt. Gox might have a large amount around that much.
One thing that would be helpful is if anyone knows how to find the chain of transactions (besides manually) between two addresses?
@_date: 2011-09-27 05:19:40
First off.  I hope you realize the post on pastebin is bullshit.


Shutting down the exchanges would cause massive price fluctuations.  Not to mention it would make it hard for their customers to get bitcoins to pay them.


Day trading and market participation in general adds liquidity to the market and minimizes those big swings.  The reason those swings are so large is because the bitcoin market is small enough where a single trader can significantly affect the price.  If the bitcoin market had more traders this wouldn't happen as easily.
@_date: 2011-12-06 21:30:48


This really demonstrates the problems with using dollars on the internets.  The most difficult part of getting bitcoins is moving USD.  
I really noticed this when just exchanging crypto-currencies with each other.  It was very quick and easy.
@_date: 2011-12-06 18:21:35


What's the difficulty that you are seeing?
In the US it's easy with dwolla and Mt. Gox.  It just takes about 3 days to get money into dwolla.  So it is basically slow, unless you already have money in your dwolla account.
@_date: 2011-09-19 01:15:21
You have it backwards.  Mining costs won't provide a floor for the bitcoin price.
It's really more of the case that the bitcoin price affects the mining cost.
As the price rises more people mine raising the difficulty and cost to mine per bitcoin.  As the price falls the opposite happens.

If you look at the transactions you will see they spend a few hundred bitcoins and then send the change to a new address.  This is normal.  
Every time you spend bitcoins with the default client it will send the change to a new address in your wallet.

I think it's a good idea to have a separate subreddit so this one doesn't get to much spam.  This will also allow websites to advertise their use of bitcoin and not get down voted for shameless self promotion.

Bitcoins can be divided further in the future if needed.  The current limit is more of an implementation limit.
@_date: 2011-12-13 19:48:19


Indeed.  You can usually save about 1% by buying with a bid order matched to the highest bid price.
I would also like to point out that if you place a high bid order it will fill at the lowest ask price first.

With the website he listed you can create multiple keys, print them out, and store the private keys in a safe location.
When you want to receive bitcoins you just give the bitcoin address to someone to send to.  To spend those bitcoins you need to import the private keys into a client or online wallet.

You would also need to take into account the velocity of money.  The rate at which the currencies exchange will probably be different. 
How fractional reserve banking is performed will also affect the value.
Basically how the money is used will affect its value greatly, making this hypothetical situation very difficult to estimate.  
One thing you can safely say is that the purchasing power of one bitcoin will be very large, such as more than a typical individual's yearly salary.
