Coinbase is to buy bitcoins not store them

I think the problem with the last big bubble is it brought in too many people who just want to use bitcoin as an investment tool, and treat it as if it were a stock.
They don't care a bout how great of a tool it is to transfer money to anyone, anywhere, instantly(almost, gotta wait for confirmations). No one asking why your doing this, no one locking your money down if they think you are doing something shady(while they determine what shady is), etc.

The guy has been putting the wall up and down all day(weekend?). I doubt coinbase would do that

Don't they always sell at a higher price? They are not an exchange, they are a service that make it easier for you to buy bitcoin. Gotta make profit

You mean clicking a button on coinbase, not hard

It's not really overkill. They were KILLED with credit card fraud since they opened to the public. You can still get this info for stolen cards, but it is much harder so it will cut down on fraud by alot.

currently 13k to go before price starts going back up

I just added my card like 20 min ago and bought 1 btc.
They must have something in their fraud prevention that needs to be tweaked

It doesn't track IP address

Let's see. You take someone else's name and credit card,  then purchase coins. 
Then when the person notices they charge back.

Look at the bitstamp order book?
There was a 30k sell wall at 300

This. I feel like they are going to keep doing this, then act like they were defeated so everyone will feel like they are safely using the devices. At the same time they have backdoors in and are laughing to themselves
