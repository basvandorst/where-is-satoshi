Partially answering my own question:  
The contents of this DL are interesting:  
And there are some downloads of older version here:

Ok, point taken.  I started out looking at the crypto key-gen code which is where I saw gotos.  Although, we did very recently see an epic fail from Apple in the use of gotos for handling errors in crypto code :)

That's the plan.  First step is to learn more myself by reading the existing code/documentation though.  I'm also very keen to learn whether people think Bitcoin-Qt is even the right implementation to start out looking at?  If there is another implementation that has higher code quality and enough users to actually have some say in the values of the various magic constants, I'll start there...

Or they :)

There was a talk at BlackHat 2011 about how broken Chip and Pin is (was?) in the UK.  Most criminals don't actually care though, they still prefer doing their fraud CNP style.

Is there any good history of how we got from [this paper]( to [this code](  Is Satoshi's original implementation around anywhere?  Were the final details like algorithm choices, generalization of signatures verification into a stack based machine, etc. made directly in code or were there follow-up papers/discussion?

Dusting off old mining equipment in time for the actual fork seems futile.  Assuming you're mining equipment actually has dust on it and you turned it off for good reason, then the hashpower you contribute is going to be inconsequential based on current difficulty.  You'll be paying energy costs and contributing not a lot, maybe just spend the money on buying the coin that you support instead.
If we get to the first difficulty adjustment post-fork and the chain you support *still* has massively reduced hashpower, that might be the time to dust off your old mining equipment.  It might even be profitable, depending on how the market values each forked coin.

Curious. Why is the quantum resistance expected to differ between keypairs that received mining rewards within the first two years of blocks, and those that received later mining rewards?

Which bank/banks are Ok with accepting the fiat all these machines generate?  I see a lot of the big players in the banking industry turning down any "cryptocurrency" or "bitcoin" related business these days, let alone cryptocurrency-related money service businesses!
