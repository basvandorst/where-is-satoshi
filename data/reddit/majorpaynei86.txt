Wealth without political and legal privilege is like a de-fanged and de-clawed lion.
Without the structural violence, there is nothing that wealth can take control of. It will be subject to market forces, that will naturally limit it.
However, I admit that that a collapse of state power in and of itself is not conducive. The people may still be ruled by a false belief in authority. What is needed is a change in thought regarding legitimate social structures.

Also, get rid of corporate subsidies, tax loopholes, corporate welfare, government contracts, bailouts, patents, copyrights, etc.

I'm not arguing that climate change or 'climate weirding' isn't real.
WTF is anyone going to do about it? China/Russia/India are sure as fuck not going to stop their massive pollution. Even if the entire US stopped all CO2 emissions entirely (which ain't fuckin going to happen either) there would be at most .5 degree reduction in the forecast. This won't do a goddamn thing. 
Do you think it is worthwhile that the entire global economy collapse and that billions die for the prospect of a small reduction in the progression of CO2?
Also, every single doomsday scenario that we have been told of has not come to pass. We were told that there would be more and more worse storms, hurricanes, etc, etc but this hasn't happened. Every fucking computer model has been wrong. We are now hearing of a global cooling period now.
Climate change is now a buzzword used like religious fanatics that attribute every weather phenomenon as a consequence of it. California drought - global warming. Texas floods - global warming.  Lots of snow - global warming. Warming warming - global warming. 
Everyfucking thing is now the result of global warming. The anecdotal evidence that science deniers were using to argue against climate change is now being used by these climate fanatics to prove it.
All of this shit is being used by governments and corporations to be given even more control over everyone else. It is just another power grab. We are powerless to stop it period, it would be too costly to even slow it.
The best that we can do is to keep on going forward, innovating, finding new energy sources that don't have significant carbon emissions. That is the best way to deal with all of this, not by hindering innovation.

Considering that it is illegal to print cash is still not a charge against bitcoin
Edit - there is a simple and easy way for it to get into the hands of people - ACCEPT IT FOR WAGES, GOODS, and SERVICES - the fucking same as cash.
How the fuck often do you have to go to a currency dealer to get cash if I may ask? Those who are in possession of bitcoin generally aren't banks that have the blessing of the state to deal with it in the light...so they are forced to do so with these deals. If there weren't any money transmitting licenses, you would be able to get bitcoin anywhere...very easily.

@_date: 2015-06-06 11:51:58
Because the point behind bitcoin was to go against the mainstream, where people are in charge of their money, not governments or central banks. It gives power back to the people using it, but with that power comes responsibility. People have been made complacent and dependent on these structures, while enslaving themselves in the process.
There is little reason to have or use bitcoin if it 'goes mainstream', because in order to do so, it would need to go along with everything it was made to go against - government regulation and central issuance.
Just go to ripple if you want a centrally controlled, monitored, and regulated virtual currency; or just encourage Fedcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-31 22:33:03
That is beyond me...another way is to make mining economical and extremely simple.
There are no economies of scale for mining...it only helps when you are doing so for a living.

They can make large blocks but they are at a disadvantage doing so because it must be propogated and then verified by other miners, which gives other miners a slight advantage in propogating their smaller blocks.
Also, smaller miners can still mine blocks with no transactions in them currently. They can still compete against big players in a meaningful way because there is no requirement that they they must use the resources necessary to broadcast large blocks.

I understand the second point and it has validity.
Soft limits can still be in play, as is the case currently. It is much faster to download and validate a block with 1 mb in transactions vs. 20. We don't know how miners will react. It may in the short run have a downward pressure on the blocks since miners can download and validate subsequently smaller broadcast blocks instead of the previously larger ones.
As for the blockchain size, pruning will happen. I don't see any long term issue with this. The only issue I see is bandwidth.

Bitcoin itself is innately political. It is a proof of concept; that currency, voluntary relations, and ownership consensus is entirely possible without the need of the state.
It proves that decentralization works. The central power of the state is not necessary. Even if some bitcoin businesses fail, the underlying protocol is strong. Fuck the system, we don't need it.
Nakamoto's work appears to be politically motivated, as [quoted](
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto
"[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto
In the Bitcoin network's transaction database, the original entry has a note by Nakamoto that reads as:
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
Some claim this quote implies Nakamoto had great concern or contempt for the current central banking system.

How does it provide a detriment? If bitcoin is used merely as a means of exchange then it cannot be to the detriment of the poor.
There are some who own vast swathes of the dollar, euro, or pound, but this in no way harms the poor. It is the printing of fiat that steals the value from them.
In fact no rich person keeps a significant amount of their wealth in any currency because of this facet. They invest in real estate, stocks, bonds, gold, or bitcoin to hedge against inflation.

What's your point? The problem that people have with fiat money is that one group has the right to make more while another party does not (which is actually backed up by violence). It uses this coercive power to fuck with the system and grant itself value at the expense of others.

Facts. If it is seen to be unreasonable based on the circumstances that you are attempting to commit tax evasion by claiming something as an investment when it is clearly a consummable, then you will be risking fines/prison.
So if you want to claim your 2010 Mustang as an investment, you have a high hurdle. However, if you bought a 1967 Shelby, refurbished it to mint condition, then you could possibly pull it off.
Edit - virtually all mining is done as an investment/profit making opportunity. No one does it simply for the good of the network. All costs related to it are deductible.

Look, the customer tried to 'buy out' when purchasing your merchandise at $1000. You can give them a $1000 credit for a replacement or get the value in USD as a return.
They were making the choice to convert their BTC to your product. Just give them a like product in return. If they so chose to have it in currency they take the risk of 'cashing out' at that time. 
They could even wait during the return period for a better BTC exchange rate which could net them a small profit from it. They are dealing in bitcoin; it is their burden in dealing with its inherent volatility.

I really don't understand why people have issues with this. One cannot simply use bitcoins to get more bitcoins, they must provide some good or service to others to accumulate more. The closest to this being loaning out coins.
However for bitcoin to succeed as a currency, it doesn't matter in the slightest if 1 person owned 99.99999% of all bitcoins. I could still buy satoshis and trade with others for goods/services. 
The only bad outcome is not that the bitcoin guy kept on accumulating bitcoin but unloading it at one time (which would drastically drive the price down but would allow others to buy them up for cheap). So the only downside is that it wouldn't be a good store of value. 
However, it would be stupid for this individual to unload at one time because it would significantly cut into their profits. They would need to do it slowly to maxize them (which would only help those who currently own it).

1. Who gives a shit what they think?
2. Who cares? If you use bitcoin as a means of exchange, it is meaningless.
3. You can't transfer cash over the internet. Buying stuff with cash over the internet is extremely difficult. If you use a third party service (paypal) they charge you a huge fee plus you need a bank account.
4. Paperwallets. Casacious coins. If the grid is down, gold and silver is pretty much meaningless too. Bullets and rice are better means of exchange because of their inherent use.
5. Bitcoin is much easier. There is no need for trust in bitcoin to hold your money. It doesn't put it on hold. It is not subject to chargebacks if someone makes some kind of bullshit claim.

This is like arguing that since you think forcibly taking is bad, that forcibly taking from a thief is also bad; or 'Kidnapping is bad, so you shouldn't arrest a wrongdoer'. 
Sometimes an action is good, that would have otherwise be bad, based on the previous bad actions of another. I can kill someone who is threatening harm against another, even though it is normally wrong to kill.

Isn't there a set inflation of coins forever for ethereum? Anyway, I'm not invested in ethereum. I believe my comment on bitcoin still stands, however. Ethereum could even have been open source without them even announcing to the community that it exists. They would profit in the same way. This way you have faster adoption and implementation.

Well you can always track him down and break his legs. WTF else do you want people to do? Let him just go away? There was a contract made between the clients and the company. Why should customers be held to it while they aren't?


This is just a complete load of bullshit. Independent courts and private arbitration has been and is currently being used for international business relations. A contract explicitly allows for one party to collect damages if the other breaches. Because governments now claim a monopoly on power, the efficacy of such options are diminished. This does not mean that government is necessary by virtue of the laws of physics, but has been made necessary because they have forcibly prevented others from alternatives.

All states have depended on the mass delusion that governments have legitimate authority to steal, cage, and murder people. They depend on this delusion to give them this power.

It's the decentralization of power that is important. The 1% use the coercive power of government to grant competitive advantage over others through regulation, subsidies/government contracts, and tax loopholes.
Bitcoin distributes this power whereby individuals are on a more level playing field. How easy is it now for your average person to transfer money around the globe without the need of gatekeepers? Decentralization is key. This will inevitably need to a significant reduction of the income gap.

Tell that to the children that are bombed every day


So says the local mafia boss


Taxes that are stolen from me, pay for them, unwillingly. If I want roads or if my community wants roads, we can pay the private contractors that build the F'ing things in the first place, without funneling it through the bloated bureaucracy that wastes around 40% of the value.


Are you dreaming?


It's not 'free'. It is stolen funds that my parents were forced to give if they chose to send me or not. The U.S. pays more per pupil than any industrialized nation and ranks 20th. Government schools are a complete joke. Jesus F*ckin Christ 19% of high school graduates are illiterate and 35% are functionally illiterate.
At no time in history has it ever been easier to be educated (rather than schooled i.e. indoctrinated) than ever before with the existence of the internet. Much of education can be provided for nearly nothing. See Khan academy as an example.


You know that all of these were originally private institutions from philanthropic sources. Also, many areas still have private fire protection and garbage collection. WTF is government any better at picking up your shit than other people? Why do they grant themselves a monopoly and prevent competition? Do you like substandard quality and inflated prices?


I'd rather pay government workers to dig holes and fill the same holes back in again. It would do more good than the shit they do now.


Who said dark rooms? Politicians, lobbyists, and wall street are all laughing their way to the bailed-out banks with the help of your tax dollars and that of people who have yet to be born. The vast, and I mean vast, amount of taxes don't go to your local communities. They are wasted, stolen, and given to people who don't deserve them (and I don't mean those on welfare).

Because States have a monopoly on the use of force. If people could fund Blackwater to get his fat ass and brought him to private arbitration, they would have done so. But because governments claim the sole right to kidnap people and judge those cases themselves, we couldn't do that.


All of your current regulations have done is JACK AND SHIT. Fuck regulations because they ALWAYS benefit special interests.


How the fuck would they have to begin with? These weren't located in NY. Secondly, no one lost money because of the Silk Road. It was facilitating voluntary transactions among individuals. The government was the one that stole the funds.


Neither because I'm not stupid enough to get fucked by either. Nearly everyone on this board KNEW that Mt.

If bitcoin comes that rare and no one trades them, the price will go up. Those speculators will be driven to trade them because of the higher prices.

??? I'm sure in order to pay anyone with any currency, you must first have it to begin with.
I guess if you want to be paid in bitcoins and not much issue with them converting AUD to BTC, then you may be able to set them up with an Australian exchange in which the bitcoins automatically deposit to your bitcoin account. You could even have a coinbase account that automatically withdraws to USD. As someone else said this may involve around 3% total fees (2% for Coinjar and 1% for coinbase).

Negative interest rates means that they are going to be paying the banks to take money.

Bitcoin's value is due to it being a protocol, a language by which to communicate value. Gold and any other currency's value is essentially this. 
The U.S. dollar has no use except for wiping my ass or burning it but it does have forced communicative value.
It is siginificantly easier to communicate value with bitcoin as opposed to gold but since it is young, it has a lot of hurdles to overcome that gold has already won over thousands of years.

This is simply just a bunch of words being tossed around with no substance. Why would I deposit into the PDIC to benefit users of MtGox? We ALL knew that they were taking a larger risk.
Also, how does you deal with the differing levels of risk that comes into play with different services? You need individualized determinations of the risk involved depending on each system used.
This system is almost like what is currently done when the US federal government comes in and offers to build homes of individuals who's houses were destroyed by hurricanes. The thing you need to know is that homes have been destroyed multiple times by hurricanes because these homes are located in Florida where such occurrences are more prone ro occur. Why should you pay for the increased risk of other people that they knowingly take? It would be like me paying for the same insurance as a professional stunt man.
You can still have the PDIC, but you need some way to determine the amount needed to deposit for the amount of desired insurance based on which service used. Who is going to do this?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:52:27
Also an attorney....the simplest is just doing a flat fee when dealing in bitcoin.
If taking a retainer, just have it in the agreement that it equals x/hrs of work. Once those hours are used up, they must refill the retainer based on current market price of bitcoin at that time.
If you have some btc left at the end of representation, take the number of hours left as a percentage of the btc retainer and return that amount.
Edit - there are ethical issues of taking bitcoin as a retainer because there is no current way to participate in IOLTA programs. You may just want to go with a non-refundable retainer.

No...you abandoned it. But this has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin which is information.
The idea is best conveyed through what is called 'trade secret'. If I have not assaulted, defrauded, or have broken an agreement to get info, I have done nothing wrong. Any information that I get, I can use. I received information and then sent a message to the bitcoin network based on that information. 
No one has a patent or copyright in bitcoin. Therefore what we are left with is trade secret as the only means of protecting information. Since OP gave the info out with no restriction and without any corresponding promise on my part to limit the use of such information, I can use it virtually in any way I so wish.

You go from saying there is no morality to stating that morality is created by joining a social contract: "Because the society / State has created the moral framework based on the views of its individual members."
You cannot create morality. This is entirely meaningless


A contract (as stated under common law and the law of this land) requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, contracts of great importance including those that last greater than a year also must be written under the Statute of Frauds (which has been incorporated generally into the Common Law)
Where is this contract? What are its terms? ["I've never received an offer from my rulers, so I certainly have not accepted one; and rather than consideration, I have received nothing but contempt from the rulers, who, notwithstanding the absence of any agreement, have indubitably threatened me with grave harm in the event that I fail to comply with their edicts"](
Also, how can children enter this social contract and be obligated to its terms when they are forcibly prevented from entering into express agreements themselves? Where does this obligation arise?


[“And yet we have what purports, or professes, or is claimed, to be a contract—the Constitution—made eighty years ago, by men who are now all dead, and who never had any power to bind us, but which \(it is claimed\) has nevertheless bound three generations of men, consisting of many millions, and which (it is claimed) will be binding upon all the millions that are to come; but which nobody ever signed, sealed, delivered, witnessed, or acknowledged; and which few persons, compared with the whole number that are claimed to be bound by it, have ever read, or even seen, or ever will read, or see.”](


So morality is determined by government dictate? Is it like god?
Also if society says something is good/bad, it makes it so? If we are society, did the slaves agree to forced labor? Did the jews commit suicide?


To take someone else must first have it. You are begging the question - a logical fallacy. 
Further, everyone would be dead because the act of eating or drinking would be taking away the right to those resources. Where does this supposed right come from by the way?


Now you say a right of access, which is different from the above. Again, where does this right come from (in light of you claiming their is no morality)
For a detailed discussion and refutation of all of these arguments please click [here](


You or I as a property owner cannot steal from, assault, imprison, or murder people who happen to be on our property. A property owner only has the right of exclusive use. He or she can only expel others from the property, nothing further.
If a person comes onto your property, they are still not obligated to any rules that you dictate - they are simply trespassers.
This is also assuming that the owner has a valid claim to property. The U.S. murdered the native populations and intentionally breached their treaties. So based on their own rules, they cannot be a legitimate owner.


You are making the positive statement; therefore, you have the burden of showing why I or anyone else has the obligation to do so.
I guess through your reasoning, a mugger or rapist can't ever be wrong, the victims must like or leave the neighborhood.

Because forcefully taking over an area and claiming that the inhabitants are obligated to give them money is inherently hypocritical and unsound in its reasoning.


Obviously you do by stating that they must leave or be obligated to give them money. You have proven no basis on which they have such an obligation.


'Voluntarily' is not being used in its normal meaning here. Does a cashier voluntarily give money to a robber at gunpoint? In a certain sense yes, they do; in that they can direct the actions of their body, yet in another they are not since it is being done under duress.
According to the State's own terms, it is guilty of extortion, conversion, assault, kidnapping, and murder; yet it grants itself immunity from such actions.


Let's assume for argument's sake that their is no morality. In that instance, there is still no obligation on the population's part to leave. There is entirely no obligation to do anything whatsoever.
Yet the state speaks in terms of morality and societal obligations. So if you view this from a moral basis or not, one MUST come to the conclusion that any claim on part of the state of the right to rule over others is false and has no basis in reason or evidence.

Sit down because I am about to lay some knowledge on ya.
What anyone may do is 'enforce' what can be and what has been termed Natural Law. Other terms and concepts can be described as Reciprocity or Estoppel.
What this means basically is that any individual who engages in any action, may have that same action imposed on them to the same extent and type to which they have exerted on others.
The reason why is from either or both implicit consent or estoppel. One cannot hold two contradictory principles at the same time while imposing such on others.
What this means is that anyone who kills may, in turn, be killed because they have denied the same to others. This applies equally to theft.

The feeling is just silly. When you hand cash over, the teller could theoretically pocket the money. They could just take your 20 and not give you any change. You are trusting them that they don't screw you over.
You trust these companies to not f*** you over by entering 10x's the amount of currency when using credit cards. There is alot of trust that goes on when doing business with large retailers (I wouldn't be doing drug deals on the street corner with the above scenario)
If they fail to issue the btc, you have proof on the receipt they gave you and the blockchain. If they just take the money off at a later time, then just bring it up to management. If there is a streak of such things occurring, then customers will no longer do business there.

If you are dealing solely in bitcoin, no real fees at all.


For you maybe, but this is not the goal of Bitcoin generally. Bitcoin is its own currency and needs to be exchanged for the others. If you want to go simply from AUD -&gt; USD, then you will need to find a normal currency exchange which may provide lower overall fees.
It could be cheaper to go from AUD -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD if an Australian exchange comes with lower fees; however, at this time it does not exist.

That's why you set up your loan agreement to take this into account. It's not really that hard to do. Dollars lose value every day, month, year, decade, etc. Interest rates take this into account and charge you accordingly.
Bitcoin loans can work the same way. However since price inflation/deflation is very hard to gauge, a lender would charge a fee of x% over the CPI value of bitcoin at the time of payment.

Scarcity is entirely the same across every single implementation. No one is wanting to change the issuance rate whatsoever.
A significant reason why people value bitcoin over visa or PayPal is because it has much less friction i.e. it is faster and cheaper. 
But with core...many devs want extremely expensive transactions and/or you must use centralized services to get around it. They claim that it is for decentralization but keeping the block limit low only held s Chinese miners. If you increase blocks, more decentralization will occur.
So again, why do you want to use bitcoin over visa/PayPal?

That's the point. We don't have segwit. 


Right now for the past 3 days we have hit the limit which has been constraining throughput.


No need to jump, we are basically there


So your use cases allow for these fees. There are others that aren't economical when you are making smaller payments.

This isn't true. Smaller blocks hurt decentralization AND price. The only ones that need blocks to be so small are chinese miners. A small increase in block size can be done with no issue whatsoever.
Otherwise, you should be supporting an even lower blocksize limit.
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:18:06
From the Roadmap:


be enough**.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around **moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8** rescaled to respect segwit's increase).
We have already reached capacity before these bandwidth proposals could even be implemented. 
The following is the reason why we need an immediate (and limited) increase, again from the roadmap:


scale and decentralization. If the system is too costly people will be
forced to trust third parties rather than independently enforcing the
system's rules.** If the Bitcoin blockchain’s resource usage, relative
to the available technology, is too great, Bitcoin loses its competitive
advantages compared to legacy systems because validation will be too
costly (pricing out many users), forcing trust back into the system.
**If capacity is too low and our methods of transacting too inefficient,
access to the chain for dispute resolution will be too costly, again
pushing trust back into the system.**

Market demand is filling supply. There are negligible costs to increase the blocksize limit such a small amount.
Keeping it small increases costs to consumers and users, which will incentivize use of other payment networks/cryptos.
Edit - all of this will result in your 'store of value' to take a shit in value.
@_date: 2016-01-31 12:28:50

No. This is not true. Inflation is built into interest rates as of now. These lenders aren't retarded. They know that the dollar/euro/whatever is losing purchasing power and therefore take this into account with regard to the interest charged.
The same will happen with regard to deflation. Instead of tacking the inflation rate onto the base interest rate, lenders will instead subtract the deflationary rate from the rate of interest (or use some other metric based on CPI)

Also, there is a well-known exemption to such behavior if it involves normal business activity. It must be acknowledged by you that purse is used for legitimate, legal purposes. Sometimes it may be used by criminals but there are many services that people use that are significantly used by such.

Who is saying that the roadmap is 'bad' or even more so that anyone 'should feel bad'?
There is a disagreement on the ranking of priorities. That's basically it. 
Also, not all core developers agree on the course of action (as evidenced by Gavin and Jeff), but may have agreed to the roadmap so that they can continue to develop on that specific implementation.
If someone feels 'betrayed', then they need to look again at the decentralized nature of bitcoin and realize that this can happen. 
Does LukeJr feel betrayed that Core has no intention on reducing the blocksize? Do others feel betrayed that specific changes aren't implemented in Core?

So the difference is that you can legally steal from your neighbors, or that you are just a slave owner that can demand more production?


Of course not. Stealing the gains of individuals of their investments isn't BAD, they really haven't lost anything. Just skimming off the top doesn't really hurt people. They weren't going to use that extra money to use in the economy and invest in other ventures. They were just going to use it for hookers and blow.


Why would a counterfeiter need to?
Jesus fucking Christ! Do you know what the fuck an opportunity cost is? Forceful taking of resources and using it for things that would not otherwise be done with it, is a inefficient and mis-allocation of wealth. It destroys investment and wealth creation. But because you can't immediately see how bad you are destroying future prospects, you think it is totally ok. HOW ABOUT STOP FUCKING STEALING FROM PEOPLE.

Did you even read what I said?
Miners are already choosing what transactions to include; they would do this even if there weren't a block limit in place.
If you decrease the block limit so as to reduce throughput, do you believe that people would use bitcoin as much as they do today?
If you could only do 10 transactions in a block that required $800 to push through a transaction, do you believe that people would stick with that network if another separate one would spring up and provide significantly lower fees while retaining the same security and decentralization?

@_date: 2016-02-14 21:11:59


There is always scarcity, especially of resources. Miners are not going to give things out for free or just waste money by including more and more transactions. A limit doesn't increase fees but actually hinders overall returns.


I don't follow the logic. Also, a miner cannot just simply increase transactions without limit as stated above; further, if there are too many transactions included in a block, the miner runs the risk of having their block orphaned and having a competitor win the coinbase/fees.

Basic payment channels are created between those parties. But to 'transfer' bitcoin between unconnected and unrelated channel members, you need a way for these parties to know to whom to send a payment and where it should eventually end up.
You need centralized, trusted parties to indicate the path by which these transfers across the network occur.

Keeping blocks small forces fees per transaction to be higher NOT overall fees within a block.
The value of the network is important so introducing artficial friction into the system (i.e. artificially small blocks) reduces the value of the network and therefore the demand to be included in the block (which directly translates into lower overall fees)

It's nice that you get to redefine what you mean at every turn to support whatever you want.


I thought libertarianism is anarchy and then you use a highly oppressive, statist society to prove your point. That's convenient.
Mass environmental degredation can only and has only ever existed as a result of state privilege and license.


Governments only ever care about money. You are cattle from which resources are taken. The chinese have figured out that complete command economies are counter-productive, where overall theft receipts are less. The ruling class is trying to maximize those gains. It doesn't matter to them what effects it has on others because they are not engaged in market relations (i.e. voluntary trade). They rape and pillage 'their' people. This is what every government does.


Is this a result of government however?


Then why is it that homeschooled children do better accordng to every single metric? 


["What is important is that the \[anarchy\] did not collapse due to any internal problems or flaws in human nature. It was defeated from without. Anarchism had not failed. Anarchists had proved that ideas which look good in the pages of theory books look even better on the canvas of life."](


How is this any different than today, except on a much smaller scale?


It is the opposite of utopia. We recognize the failings of human beings. This is why we know it is a horrible idea to systematize and legitimize those human failings by concentrating them into a small group of people who have the RIGHT to rule over others.
You are the actual utopian in that you believe the right amount of violence used by just the right people in just the right direction can perfect society.


Holy fucking shit...aren't you naive. EVERY SINGLE GOOD THING ABOUT SOCIETY EVER IS A RESULT OF THE MARKET. PERIOD.

This has already been tried and failed. 
But let's address first what is the issue with monopolies to begin with. The theory is that these companies will be able to drive out all competition with economies of scale, buy out any potential competitors, and then and only then can they drive up their prices and price gouge their customers.
To become and remain a pedatory monopoly, one would have to be able to provide customers with goods or services at a price point that was below all other competitors. If one is more competitive and can make profits over and above others, there is little point to drive up prices - since it would be counter-productive by drawing in new competitors.
[Standard Oil controlled 90% of the oil market for about 10 years, during which time the price of a barrel of kerosene fell something like 300%.  The price reduction was brought about by improvements in the refining process that Standard Oil created.  That's how they garnered the massive market share in the first place, and the fact that they didn't abuse that market share is why they were able to maintain it for so long.]
There are several reasons why 'monopolies' cannot and have never been able to do the above. First, they are always open to competition at any point. Just because some company buys at all competition at any particular point, does not open them up to other competition after the fact. New innovation is developed, which always puts 'monopolists' on their toes.
Rockefeller attempted to purchase all competitors to retain his market positioning. Others took advantage of this attempted tactic by starting companies with no intent whatsoever to make a profit through sales but only to sell them off. This was a significant reason why Rockefeller was unable to retain his market share for very long.
Another critique is that current market majority holders will sell their products for a loss as a tactic to drive out competition. This was attempted by a german chemical cartel against Du Pont. They couldn't figure out how he was able to stay in business while they were bleeding assets. He was simply buying their products and reselling them on the market, being able to make huge gains at their expense.
Another reason why huge monopolies cannot exist is by reason of 'diseconomies of scale'. For the same reason why communist or command economies cannot efficiently exist, is the same reason why large corporations are unlikely to exist within freed markets. The lack of a price mechanism from within creates too many inefficiencies that cannot be adequately addressed without a market mechanism. 
After Rockefeller was forced to be broken up for anti-trust purposes, he made more money than he ever had before. His companies became more nimble and able to freely move within the markets.
The robber barons only became oppressive when they could no longer compete in the market place. They were being hounded by competition and unable to outcompete. They reverted to state privilege as a means of preventing competition and maintaining their market positioning.

Again, you are conflating two issues. Such corruption can and does occur in economies in which there is no capital class (as traditionally understood).


Saying that capital can buy force is irrelevant to the argument. It isn't an inherent characteristic of it, but *may* be secondary one. Also, workers can use or even buy their own force.
The issue may be bargaining power and wealth inequality (this being an entirely different issue altogether)

Good luck with your capital-less labor value. Just try planting a crop with sticks and rocks.
I would rather have my 'surplus value' go to the capital owner of a industrial sized, gps-guided, air conditioned, plow-planter thing. I can produce orders or magnitude more (and thereby get more value in return) for taking a wage as a worker of capital than by clawing in the dirt.
The problem with this line of that is that capital has value in and of itself. This is why you are willing to rent equipment because it makes your labor more efficient, productive, and therefore valuable. Without capital (and thereby the capital owner) we would just be hunter-gatherers.
This facet is not what is at issue in capitalism. There are other privileges that are the cause of why capitalism is such shit i.e. monopoly powers of pure absentee ownership, patents, licensing, regulation, tariffs, legal tender laws, etc.

But even with a collapsed central state, quality of life for Somalis is higher than when it was ruled by a central state. Also, your example is not valid since somalia was governed by regional governments and is now governed by a central government.

What is 'unfair'? How do you measure what this is?


Capital doesn't say or do anything. Only an 'owner' can determine what should be done with it. I don't understand the issue with this since you have the right to unilateral control over all personal possessions. However, magically this becomes an issue once someone uses anything in a productive capacity.


I support syndicates and cooperatives. However, we see workers willingly forego the prospect of being owners of capital (by being in a coop), because they don't desire to be subject to uncertainty. (I agree that the current system heavily encourages or straight up forces people into wage labor - to which I also disagree)
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:49:06

It definitely could through selfish mining, wherein miners create transactions themselves and include them in a block only if they win the coinbase. This will cause competitors to expend more resources than they in order to compete. This results in centralization.

It's called a market. Do you need to vote for some feature you want in your mobile phone? When resources become scarce, the price rises, thereby reducing consumption. Markets automatically regulate themselves. If you want an 'all-knowing' bureacracy handling consumption of goods, create another soviet bloc.

Your family, church, baseball team, concert, shriners, the amish, communes, etc.


You have a really skewed understanding of consensus.
 


Let me first say it's unrealistic to believe that just the right amount of force, yielded by just the right people, in just the right direction can perfect society.
Secondly, this is the problem where you want to impose a one-size fits all approach to every person. Do you believe in a global government or society in which all norms and laws are uniform?
If you don't, then you believe in some sort of pluralism. 
People can and do agree to basic norms and rules by which they conduct their lives. They will, on a near universal scale, agree that theft, murder, kidnapping, etc. are wrong and will even agree to punishments if they themselves are found to have committed such acts.
Once you go beyond this, it gets murkier but people will still largely agree to other norms, which will then lead to socieites where people still agree 100%. If they don't the socieity will differ within and among themselves, but still be able to get along.
Some people may be Methodists, others Baptists, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Pagans, or Atheists. Some may be communalists or will be rugged individualists. Others will fund the sciences, others the arts.

One reason why bandwidth should be taken into account are for those use cases where mining profitability is not sought.
21 inc. machine, IoT, efficient mining (where waste heat is utilized), etc.
It will be useless for some to run their btc mining rig/space heater in the winter if their bandwidth requirements don't meet spec.
Another are for those who live in the third world vs. the first. Significant bandwidth is something largely seen only in the first world.
An interesting idea that was actually proposed on the name that shall not be spoken] subreddit was for miners to propogate transaction hashes rather than the transactions themselves (since it's assumed that other miners would have these transactions already within their mempools)
This significantly reduces the amount of data transmitted which would alleviate any worries for increased blocks.

**Dynamic Block Size with Hard and Soft Limits with High Disincentive to Flood the System.**
This proposal was submitted late in last week's thread. It can be found [here]( 
Average of previous x blocks creates a hard limit. Soft limit is x% of Hard. Hard [and soft block limits are] increased/decreased when average x blocks are greater/less than the soft limit.
~~If current block is greater than the soft block limit, coinbase is reduced by the mining fees of the highest paying transactions of the block. (ensures that highest paying transactions are included while miners are disincentivized to increase block size because fees will be included in next block)~~(For example the hard block limit will be adjusted if the prior x block average is more or less than 80% of the hard limit. If the average is 83%, the hard limit will be adjusted to increase where this average soft limit is again 80% of the hard block.)
Next block transactions must include a fee at least as much as the average fee (per kilobyte) of the last y blocks.
Average block fee would be determined by the [soft] block limit (in terms of size) and total fees paid within the block. Blocks over the soft limit, puts a dampening pressure on including transactions in the next block (by causing an increased minimum fee). Blocks under the soft limit will decrease the average fee required to be included in the next block, which will encourage more transactions.
Additionally, a decreasing fee structure can be made for N-Lock Time transactions so that the cost to include in the current block decreases as the n-lock is larger.
Edit 1 - I don't see a need for fees to be disgorged. A fee market will naturally occur when blocks are being rapidly filled. This will necessarily increase the average fee and therefore the minimum fee needed for the next block (since a transaction must include a minimum fee to be included in the block). If blocks are constantly full, fees will eventually normalize as blocks naturally increase over time. Nonintensive miners have an advantage that blocks cannot rapidly increase in size if the average is calculated across a substantially large number of blocks.

Maybe you could have a transaction involving 4 parties instead of 3 (including an arbitrator)

You are being a little too optomistic. The same can generally be done with cash; however, people and businesses are sheep that, for the most part, willingly go along with the system and just hand it over with little to no resistance.
@_date: 2015-10-30 06:23:04
There would be little incentive for such transactions on part of users. The only incentive in paying and intentially accepting ACS transactions would be in an attempt to increase block sizes without increasing the cost of doing so.
The only parties that would have the incentive to increase block size would be large mining operations attempting to out-resource competitors. However, each transaction must have a minimum fee. To increase blocksize, the minimum fee would necessarily increase. There would be no way around this even with ACS. (It may not increase as much as it would had fees been included but it would still increase). To have lower fees, you must have underfilled blocks which would decrease block size, which would obviously be counter to the desirability of these transactions.
@_date: 2015-10-15 11:34:04
If you increase the blocksize, it makes these attacks significantly more expensive to pull off. Keeping the blocksize low, allows these attacks to continue and bog down the system.

Did Satoshi hand it down from on high saying, "Thus doest Satoshi declare, the 1 megabyte block shall ever be instituted amongst the Network. If you shall ever changest mine Protocol, you willst know the fury of mine hand."
The decision to stay at 1 mb is still a decision. The network is running against the block limit. When satoshi instituted it, the network was not even running close to it. If you think it is such a holy thing, you may want to keep the limit x% over the average traffic that existed when it was instituted.

Your premise is inherently wrong. Communities have no right to 'allow' shit. What you mean is whether the nebulous thing you call community that is arbitrarily defined can use force, even deadly force, against people.

They don't, only in the short term if there is a lot of network pressure. As blocks steadily increase, the average fee per byte goes down, eventually evening out to what the original fee amount was.
I'm glad you saw this, since this is what I initially thought was a problem; I forgot that blocks increased which would decrease the average fee.

The way to get rid of this car culture is to get rid of publicly funded roadways (they are expensive as hell) and have individuals pay for the costs of roads. (They already pay these costs but they are hidden; if people actually saw what these roads cost, they would likely have a heart attack)
This will automatically encourage mass transit and it will also have the effect of no longer subsidizing the costs of transportation for large corporations. (the general public is paying for the roads to the benefit of corps; also, semis do like 100,000 times the damage to roadways as cars)

I would look into Tokenly. These are tokens that represent anything issued on the bitcoin blockchain.


Not quite yet. You could possibly contact BTCjam.com to set up a system specifically made for these types of loans. 
(I am from a Common Law country, so I don't know exactly how it would function in Germany; I will be writing this for others who are from one of those countries who may be interested)
You  would not be selling shares, but small Promissory Notes (you would have 1 promissory note with the bank saying that you promise to pay the bearer of the note (the entity who physically holds the note (token) ). Instead of one note worth $200,000, you could have 200 promissory notes worth $1,000 each with a reasonable rate of return.
The more complicated thing would a mortgage (which isn't a loan but a lien on real property). This would be somewhat novel since these generally involve the interests of a single legal entity, not a host of them.

**Dynamic Block Size with Hard and Soft Limits with High Disincentive to Flood the System.**
Average of previous x blocks creates a hard limit. Soft limit is x% of Hard. Hard block limit is increased/decreased when average x blocks are greater/less than the soft limit.
If current block is greater than the soft block limit, coinbase is reduced by the mining fees of the highest paying transactions of the block. (ensures that highest paying transactions are included while miners are disincentivized to increase block size because fees will be included in next block)
Next block transactions must include a fee at least as much as the average fee (per kilobyte) of the last y blocks.
Average block fee would be determined by the block limit (in terms of size) and total fees paid within the block. Blocks over the soft limit, puts a dampening pressure on including transactions in the next block. Blocks under the soft limit will decrease the average fee required to be included in the next block, which will encourage more transactions.

Why are they there? Because it is a central market making site? They weren't this way to begin with. It provided an easy platform for certain use cases that didn't exist before.


Bitcoin is unavailable for the vast majority of people. The use case will be for bitcoin users, not the general public. Hopefully it will grow and become an Ebay or Amazon, but it must provide benefits over and above what those platforms provide - such as censorship resistance, no fees, and international transactions.


OB1 will and there will be market leaders that will be used by default. Initially this may have been an issue but OB1 will provide this at the outset.


Do the other platforms compete? Did they always?
Google is still quite poor when using it to find goods sold by bitcoin merchants. (Especially of the type sold in the second-hand market)


Why do Amazon and Ebay exist? 


Things develop and grow. You could have said the exact same of bitcoin. It was seen and continues to be seen to be worse across every single metric; however, companies provide applications for ease of use that begin to make it competitive.


This is the only apparent valid criticism that I have seen.
Either people will find use cases for it or not. Let the market decide if these characteristics make it more valuable than the other platforms.

This problem can be handled previously by agreement. So let's say that payment is due on receipt. They are responsible to pay at the time they receive the payment request/invoice.
If there is a time lag and the value of bitcoin has changed then you can have, for example, the following conditions. That if payment is made before a certain date, the customer is required to pay the original bitcoin amount if the fluctuation is anywhere within +/- 10% deviation. 
If it deviated more than this, then it will be equivalent to the current dollar/yen/gold value that existed at the time of receipt i.e. if the bitcoin was worth $68 at the time of request, the bitcoin amount is the current bitcoin amount that now trades for $68.
If the customer fails to pay within a reasonable time i.e. 2 weeks/a month, then the customer must pay as determined above plus fine amount - which could be a set amount and/or equal to the unrecognized gain.

Theft - "is the taking of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it"
Tax - "Is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority" and is "any contribution imposed by government"




"tax is used by every country I can think of, and that to work almost everywhere is to be taxed. If the only choice anywhere is ‘A’ being forced to pick ‘A’ does not mean one consents to it. Furthermore, would you say to the person who gets mugged ‘you consent to it by staying in a city where muggers operate’ of course not. It is like saying that Jewish people consented to the Holocaust because they lived in Germany, or similar occupied territories, an utterly absurd and offensive idea. 
I do not have to flee to a remote uninhabited island because I do not wish to be stolen from, any more than you do because you wish not to be beaten up, or because you don’t want to have people trespassing on your property. Staying where you are is not consenting." [Link](
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:00:23
Still irrelevant and false. Slaves were given food by their masters but this did not change the fact that they stole the products of their labor.
Edit - 
Another "justification often heard is those of public services. 'Tax is legitimised because I use the roads, the street lighting, the rubbish collection services.' This frankly is an over used argument and a whole load of nonsense. The government forces me to use its services. I can’t get a private rubbish collector because the government’s monopoly means its not viable in the public sector. I can’t leave my house without treading on state roads because the state insists on paying for them. I can’t walk under private street lighting because the government puts it up for free.
When someone provides you with something taking it does not legitimise them taking from you. The classic example is a kidnapper. If I am kidnapped and locked in a cage taking food from the kidnapper does not legitimise my kidnapping. By eating food provided for free by the kidnapper to keep myself alive I am not consenting to be kidnapped. Equally by using the roads or any public services I am not consenting to be taxed, I am taking the service (food) that the government (kidnapper) provides. It is the only food (service) that I am able to eat (use) because the kidnapper (government) does not allow others to provide alternatives." [Link](

Because it has nothing at all to do with whether it is theft or not.

All of your points are entirely irrelevant. Please try again.

I don't know if others would like the same thing but some functionality with wallets to create QR codes and corresponding code and import that information to be easily copied and pasted/scanned which will have the public address, the amount, and any additional information relating to the transaction so the purchaser doesn't have to enter this manually.
You could send this to the recipient and they scan/ctrl-v it and simply verify the transaction.

How about selling on ebay without the use of paypal and have them send a money order/cashier's check?

I agree...I misquoted it. I left out "without that person's permission or consent"


"in regard to the so-called social contract, I have often had occasion to protest that I haven't even seen the contract, much less been asked to consent to it. A valid contract requires voluntary offer, acceptance, and consideration. I've never received an offer from my rulers, so I certainly have not accepted one; and rather than consideration, I have received nothing but contempt from the rulers, who, notwithstanding the absence of any agreement, have indubitably threatened me with grave harm in the event that I fail to comply with their edicts." [Link](


Another "justification often heard is those of public services. 'Tax is legitimised because I use the roads, the street lighting, the rubbish collection services.' This frankly is an over used argument and a whole load of nonsense. The government forces me to use its services. I can’t get a private rubbish collector because the government’s monopoly means its not viable in the public sector. I can’t leave my house without treading on state roads because the state insists on paying for them. I can’t walk under private street lighting because the government puts it up for free.
When someone provides you with something taking it does not legitimise them taking from you. The classic example is a kidnapper. If I am kidnapped and locked in a cage taking food from the kidnapper does not legitimise my kidnapping. By eating food provided for free by the kidnapper to keep myself alive I am not consenting to be kidnapped. Equally by using the roads or any public services I am not consenting to be taxed, I am taking the service (food) that the government (kidnapper) provides. It is the only food (service) that I am able to eat (use) because the kidnapper (government) does not allow others to provide alternatives." [Link](


I am more than willing to pay for these things voluntarily for those goods or services provided by individuals or groups, which are funded not by the threat of a gun but simply through the free market mechanism of voluntary trade.


Yes. Then I am simply utilizing the government to steal on my behalf to benefit me. This is theft and fundamentally wrong.


I owe nothing to a prison guard for granting me food, especially if my liberty is being deprived without my consent and without me violating any other individual's rights. 


WTF is a "fair" share? Who determines it? What is its extent? What is its limit? Were slaves paying their "fair" share by having all of their liberty deprived of them in exchange for shelter?


That is not the point at all for the example...please read again. It never said that there was no infrastructure on it, merely that it lacked any people whatsoever i.e. there is no government there to steal from them.
