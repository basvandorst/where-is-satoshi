&amp;gt; Sorry to highjack the thread but OP is completely misinformed. It was not one house it was many different cases spanning many years.
&amp;gt; The 22 billion is actually 207 million in that particular picture. The other picture with money in them are from the countless seizures done through the years. 
&amp;gt; The picture where he states "than most legitimate museums" is an actual museum
&amp;gt; Edit: thanks for restoring my faith in Reddit, I lost it for a second when I saw such a blatant lie on the front page.

I'd like to point out how ugly the formatting of that graph is.
Then remind you that their job is accurately reporting on financial news and presenting it in an easily understood fashion.

Before anyone gets too pessimistic, let me point out that this is exactly the kind of challenge the bitcoin *software* sorely needed. What has happened will give developers old and new first hand experience with the consequences of real software bugs, and should motivate a lot of inspired thoughts regarding toughening up the code for the future.
I always felt like bitcoin needed this exact kind of problem; Just like all good men and women must experience difficulties to build character, so does bitcoin (the software) need this hurdle to *grow up*.

Even if you are a bank and loath the open source BTC, you can't ignore the growth that Coinbase and Bitpay services are going thru.
You would still want to capitalize on their potential out of pure greed.

This is not an AMA, and while I have nothing to prove, I would be happy to share proof of my holdings if it can be done 100% anonymously.  Judging from the tone of some of these replies, some of you are annoyed or even angry at what I am doing and I don't wish to even remotely make myself or my holdings a target.  
The point of this was to document my actions in a public way so I can look back on them down the line.  Yes, the advice is also appreciated but it doesn't change what I have done or any of my plans.  If I become a statistic, so be it.  I am a fighter and will find a way to make it work as I've done throughout my life.  
To address some of your concerns though.  This is not a leap of faith.  I have done my research.  I feel the projects surrounding bitcoin right now are revolutionary.  Every day there is a new startup, dream, or idea that someone has which is being copied and improved on.  I am watching it like a hawk, and will move to LTC or some other currency if it begins to approach bitcoin's success.   I will not, however, sell at $X simply because it has reached that arbitrary point.  I have my wits about me, while acknowledging this is atypical.  
To the person who felt it necessary to question my education, I have a bachelors and a doctorate in a field I will not reveal.  Perhaps I will go to my grave in debt.  Perhaps not.  That is part of the fun of this little experiment.  Thank you all for your input though.
Edit:  silly smartphone typos fixed
