I think Satoshi didn't realize that there were so many whinging fuckers  around.  Everyone needs to learn to adapt or there is no point. 
People  are acting just the existing fiat system, everyone is afraid of change and are happy with how their finances are and not looking at the wider problems and infrastructure. Short term.

@_date: 2014-10-24 18:40:59
Possibly. That being said, we must remember that the system is evolving and things do change. But we must be vigilant and do our research before using these exchanges

Link to any progress?
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:10:18
I one hundred percent agree with this. Can we also get a voting platform on the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-10-27 09:34:42
Me too. I come to this thread to see how badly people are reacting to the market. I dont trade but its interesting to see how this plays out with humanity as a whole
@_date: 2014-07-11 10:48:25

@_date: 2014-07-23 11:03:48
I disagree. I spend hours on reddit after work and have more than enogh time to skim over all secrions of this subreddit. But some censorship is needed by the Mod. for instance I dont think NSFW content shouldnt be able to make it to the frontpage. I love porn but there are other places for that. 
you guys need to remember than new bitcoiners will visit this site to see what sort of community we have here and it may impact the image in these early stages of MONEY
Thanks 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:59:15
Whats that?
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:08:06
no chance

I also just went to Chadstone to ty one of these awsome looking subs but the dumb worker didnt even know wgat Bitcoin was. it was very embarassing for me and Hero
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:31:38
care to elaborate how this is done sir?
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:38:19
I am interested. Im a sri lankan citizen and would consider purchashing and know others who r in the market as well. Can you please let me know more details. Perhaps a name or a address for the place. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:23:24
Thanks, I did do some research and this option does seem available in Australia but there are fees involved which makes them less feasible. Always good for a last option though. Please do spread the word in-case other people need a last resort. Thanks again
@_date: 2014-06-28 06:09:27
send me some please
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:26:28
in all honesty. im not sure what these big words mean. english is not my 1 st language. however, by the sounds of the words I would consider abit of both depending on how you are feeling on the day. but we are futurist legends
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:42:50
Its confirmed. The One has spoken. Dorian is not the real Satoshi. Mah nigga
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:23:57
I agree with your point. However. they are 2 very different things. But I guess there was a time when a loaf of bread was 10c. But imagine if 1BTC worth 10k. a loaf of bread would be .0001 BTC. Its hard to fathom for me. But hey, i'm down with it. Fuck the details.
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:54:52
Guessing u cbf typing
@_date: 2014-12-25 10:08:09
What the hell. How come no one has ever mentioned this cool new technology. Im in Australia and cant use circle. Is this Virtual Cc the way to go for me?
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:14:03
you are very right sir. I hope it aint gonna steal my coins!
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:59:04
No evidence, I own about 2 Bitcoins and am confident it will grow in value over time. Say 5 years BUT for the people who did not get in even relatively early, they will have to earn or buy .001 Bitcoin for the same value 1 BTC is today. Seems psychologically fucked up 
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:22:52
is that part of reddit rules?
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:57:27
Thats true, it would be confusing if different clients had different units. But eventually as the supply is so low, we would not be able to continue as a society if 1 Bitcoin is 1 Bitcoin rather than being a fraction of what it is now. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 10:49:13
thanks mate. had a few beers after work so..... 
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:51:05

@_date: 2014-04-19 17:12:06

@_date: 2014-08-27 07:50:37

Can we get this to the frontpage?
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:13:56
Its funny. Ive known about openbazaar for a long time. But i cant bringmyself to spent Bitcoin for a cup. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 08:21:18
Props bro. Respect what you guys are doing. Ill be buying some from Melbourne
@_date: 2015-04-10 09:04:28
The only reason im in this is for the store of value aspect of Bitcoin. The easy transactions are a plus but rarely ever use it but would pike to. With the volatility nakea it hard for me. But i think in 5 years looking at the world economy Bitcoin is a really sade bet. I mean as long there is atleast 100000 ppl that would accept it as payment. We should be sweet. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:11:26
I can imaginr. But this is better than gold. In my openion. Aww snap
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:41:16
Dude you gotta find a way to reimburse the dudes that lost a shitload of money in Gox. Please. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 08:06:19
It makes sense to me. No extremism bro. Lets have balance. Socialism and capitalism and statism

They are just reducing their overhead. There won't be cheap banking. Just more profits.
^This guy gets it.
@_date: 2015-10-08 10:19:56
Nice work dudes. We need more of this for the average Joe!

Unfortunately linux is not a option for me. I use ubuntu someimes but its abit hard to run my work programs on it. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 11:15:40

The victorian government also has some coins that they siezed
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:03:18
Whatpisses me off is that these theieves are getting monopoly of bitcoins and then can move markets without any remorse as it was free coins anyway. Peeps need to step up
