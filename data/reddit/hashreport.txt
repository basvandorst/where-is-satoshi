We're going to have 3 swag-bags to give out. So far We've got shirts from Chain, BitLendingClub, The Bitcoin Society, pens, stickers..

It's possible, assuming that lbc has been utilized as the primary means of exchange in these countries, which may not be the case.
I took a quick look at the Philippine traders. Most are inconclusive (and I'm not sure you can draw any conclusions from feedback totals), but one:  
has more 'feedbacks' from transactions so far this month than he did in the previous two months combined.

I don't know if that's doable. There are few forums/communities that are as centralized and specific as bitcointalk, and fewer still that have as diverse a collection of posters.

Depends on your topic, there's some Economics papers floating about.  Ethical/Rhetorical/Philosophical papers generally don't exist in Academia yet.  Half of my thesis was on Bitcoin, and I did a conference paper on some rhetorical aspects of Bitcoin, but there was little to draw from.
The plus side is that you can take just about any approach you want and be fairly confident you're breaking new ground.  This is good for grad-school, but if you're doing undergrad work YMMV depending on your professor...

It's interesting to me that he uses the term 'distruptive' because I think that's what needed to spur public adoption. 
In this I mean situations in which producers with products/services that have mainstream appeal/demand, restricting the means to obtain them to using bitcoin rather than cash - therefore disrupting their normal system and requiring the consumer to adapt. 
What if a wildly popular song was _only_ available to purchase with bitcoin?  Or some 'killer-app' that everyone wanted?  
While some are swayed by ideology and novelty, the rest of the consuming public are swayed by desire and utility, they have to want something enough that they're willing to disrupt their normal chain of action to get it. 
I don't know if this can be done without some sort of determined system in which products are sourced and purchased (with fiat or bitcoin) and then turned around and sold for bitcoin only, like commissioning an album by Snoop Dog, Willie Nelson, and Daft Punk and making it available only through purchase with BTC.

You're not necessarily wrong. It definitely treads near the same path as or every "Miss [Enter country name here] pageant" out there.  
But to be fair, many of the photos are not simply T&amp;A. Some (like the 'Samurai' girl, Anna) are tastefully done, and many of the women are NOT relying on the level of skin they show - they're wearing modest dresses and posing on/in beaches/parks/etc.

It's not that dramatic of a problem yet, and as platypii says, there are already potential solutions.  Some of the ideas are discussed here:

There's still time to retweet or share the Facebook post and get your chance to win one of 3 bags of conference swag! 
Each bag (OKCoin) contains a lanyard (bitcoin-trader.biz) at least 2 shirts (from Chain, BitLending, or the BTC Society), and a random assortment of other conference goodies!
