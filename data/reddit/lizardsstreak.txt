Is that mid-day 11th in NYC time? What's the actual time alignment?

Oh man, I could not have to worry about paying for my engineering degree if someone passed me like, one bitcoin. 
But I'll have to work for that- lots to learn! Gambling with money is a first for me though- I've always been raised frugally and I'm hoping I can make something of my in-college savings and spending fund to make the burden a little easier after school. So many bills to pay...

I'm hearing that it'll explode by the 9th so I'm thinking maybe it'll be worth it? 
What kind of transaction fees and exchange fees are we talking here? What percent?

No, absolutely not. I'm in college, I'm thinking about putting 100 dollars into it. It's an okay chunk of my money but hopefully I can make some gains by the 9th? 
Also, do I sell on the morning of the 9th or morning of the 10th or some time between then? NYC time? I'm very apprehensive.

Yeah, I regret not investing the last time I thought about bitcoin.

I'm going to put a whole sack of money into BTC today so that I can sell on the 9th. Hopefully I'll get some extra spending money and make my money back so I can invest back in after the 10th. If it dips hard. 
Reasonable idea? I'm talking sums of money that aren't up anyone's alley- I'm a poor college student with a steady income and I am not afraid to lose out money the first time. Gotta learn somehow!

(It's only 60 dollars), so I'm not worried. My original plan was to buy after the dip, but I decided that I wouldn't mind losing 60 dollars, and if it grew, better for me, right? 
Thank you for the reading list- that's very helpful.
