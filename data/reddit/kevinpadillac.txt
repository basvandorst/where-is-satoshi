most anyone who created anything on the internet has a reddit account. it's the tenth most visited website in the united states

while that would appear to be true, and is at least partially true, the porn industry has evolved so much that recurring billing isn't necessarily the go to solution anymore. at this point, getting people to pay for porn in general is difficult. that's why you'll see aggressive tactics on mobile porn sites, and now the implementation of bitcoin. it's because any new and exciting platform or method of payment is good for the industry. i would also keep an eye on "sexcoin," especially when the initial hype dies down, and it may have already. i don't really follow altcoins. i just assume those with an out of the box purpose in ecommerce (namecoin, etc) are a bit more reputable in a sea of *entirely* useless (at least for the time being) altcoins

waves platform could position itself to be the russian coinbase
the creator of waves platform is a russian dude who created coinomat and he has a lot of capital to swing around with waves

if after reading


if you don't see a problem with what they did, then you're probably just siding with them because they're a reputable upcoming startup powerhouse and i'm just some guy on reddit. there are too many people like you in the world
it's definitely a method of obtaining user information starting with nothing other than publicly available information, was severe enough for them to patch immediately, and you're obviously mad about that
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:43:05


yeah it did
you don't know what you're talking about
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:06:21
they actually just patched it, and made the forgot password form display this


but refused to honor me for it
this literally just happened
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:09:29
it's a security hole, which would be easy to patch, and if it isn't patched it could and most likely will play a huge role in relatively large bitcoin heists where the victims are innocent people who made the mistake of using the same password in two different places
and coinbase could make simple changes to help prevent that, but they won't

this thread hasn't been active since yesterday apart from me and josmul123 going at it
then this post pops up 5 minutes ago and immediately receives upvotes?
really? i already proved that it's very likely josmul123 is a shill [**HERE**]( and you're very likely one of his comrades 
you guys are absolutely horrible at this, and are starting to bury yourselves
edit: you even btc tipped the guy $1 5 days ago

"Obtaining user information" is listed as "sufficient severity"
you seem upset and unwilling to admit that you're wrong, and i'm assuming it's because you're mentally ill
later creepy reddit dude

they didn't mention that it had previously been reported in october until after they had already
a: denied that it was a problem
b: patched it
and provided no proof that it had ever really been reported. they didn't patch it until i turned it in. they behaved in an extremely unprofessional manner, and if you're unable to see that it's because you're stubborn and delusional
