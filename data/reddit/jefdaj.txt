Not true at all. I'm enough of a coder to know that these things can be subtle, and that this is a particularly bad codebase to read without help/guidance.
Speaking of which, none of the core devs would be considered qualified in economics but we listen to them anyway (to some extent). If only people with working knowledge of a subject were allowed to have opinions that would leave.... basically nobody.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:48:04
luke-jr is making a positive assertion here so it's reasonable to ask for evidence. Also, he's one of the core developers and if he's on this subreddit bringing up protocol details it's reasonable to assume he feels like answering questions right now.

I'm not sure it matters that it *could* work well out without any increase. Sure it could. The question is what settings make it most likely to work out well, which is a more complicated question.
The other thing to consider is that bitcoin's main advantage right now is the network effect. It's not the best coin, just the first and most secure (because of popularity). The longer it coexists with other currencies the more likely one of them will overtake it through some chance event or by being better. I'm not sure the economic term but in ecology it's called [competitive exclusion](
@_date: 2015-12-24 07:23:55
This is true and a big problem. I've thought about it a lot though and can't imagine how it could bootstrap itself into a currency otherwise. May get downvoted in this sub, but I think the only long-term solution is to let this wealthy elite develop and then tax them.
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:31:15
That didn't make a lot of sense to me... Popularity isn't all about security. Lots of the most successful technologies are wildly insecure but people use them for other benefits. Greedy algorithms like the free market and evolution don't lead to globally optimal solutions, only locally optimal ones. It's really common for flawed systems to entrench themselves permanently because they had a short-term advantage at one point. And this isn't about proofs. Yes it could work without any increase, but that's not the answer to a useful question. The only question that matters here is what we should do, and I can't even imagine what "proof" of an optimal answer would look like.
@_date: 2015-12-06 02:32:25
How does it prevent sybil attacks? Like if somebody makes 10 million PGP keys spread across a botnet and has them all vouch for each other in a web of trust, how does it keep that botnet from controlling everything? Do you explicitly choose which keys to trust?
EDIT: Nevermind think I figured it out. It's a layer on top with reduced security, but a much better, decentralized layer on top with better security than we have now with centralized exchanges.

Yeah that bothers me. Hopefully by then we'll be able to figure out a way to contain it. One hopeful thing is it could be done easily with solar power if that becomes cheap enough, whereas cars still need a high energy density fuel. Guess it's not so much a bad metaphor as a depressing one...
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:05:00
You're right I haven't. I'm used to Spanish, which seems very easy to translate. There are even apps that replace text live in video streams now, so you can look at a Spanish menu through your phone and see everything in English!
Maybe some combination of automatic processing and user paraphrases? Like if it were standard to TL;DR the top couple comments per thread that would go a long way. Or do you think people would be willing to talk in [simple english]( I suspect this would also help when complicated topics come up.
It's a tough problem but I see borderlesnesses as one of BTC's (and the internet's) main advantages. There's a huge divide between the people who understand bitcoin and the people who have actual use cases for it (weak local currency, no access to banks etc). Maybe the practical short-term solution would just be an international forum with sections for each language.

Hey as someone who's been arguing for bigger blocks, this looks like a great compromise to me. Plan for linear growth and it could go wrong either way (too small or too large).  Everyone is equally unhappy, so let's move on! Unless there's some obvious technical problem think we've got a winner.
Not that it makes a difference but on seeing this I bought some BTC. I think others will too.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:13:01
Well actually the good physicians do try to do that. They get pretty fast at it and hand out bulleted lists of ELI5 resources for the common prescriptions. It's hard in 15 min but they spend a good part of their time trying.
I'm not sure working on bitcoin is much like being a doctor though. If there has to be a health metaphor I'd put it closer to the CDC where you have to both engineer vaccines and get them distributed to everyone with local flu shot days at the store etc. If you just came up with vaccines and didn't explain why people should take them or make an effort to distribute it wouldn't turn out well.

I wasn't counting them as "off chain" I guess. They require it to be economically feasible to broadcast your transaction on the main chain quickly whenever you want to close the channel. They're great though, and we should use them.
EDIT: They also work best with a central authority managing a bunch of channels, but that's not required.
EDIT: And they require you to tie up funds in an amount that increases the harder main chain transactions are. So sort of hurts interoperability but not a big deal I guess. Also it would drive buying :D
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:57:54
It's almost impossible to predict the right time to buy in without inside knowledge. I suggest cost averaging: buy the same amount in dollars/euros each week or month, and you'll pay about the average cost over that time period. As long as the price rises during the time you're buying (which could be years) you'll pay below the market rate overall. Or just buy some now and don't kick yourself if it's lower in a year. It'll still be higher in five years.

Yeah they might be. I'm on the fence too. It would be complicated to get right without distorting the articles.

They might not explain all their reasoning, but they do have a responsibility to explain the relevant gotchas, like "don't take with alcohol or acetaminophen", "must always be taken on time or X happens", "come back immediately if you notice Y it's a common problem" etc. No one would consider "look it up yourself" an OK explanation.

That is the healthiest way. It's silly to have a currency all about security through independent verification, and then get mad when someone wants to fork the codebase. Runtime consensus should be the only consensus, and people should be running whatever code they prefer. The network as a whole is supposed to be robust to that.

Jesus metaphors don't work on the internet haha. It's like a bitcoin node in that it connects to a p2p network to update and communicate its current state. It's like a website in that you can install it on your computer or host it in the cloud. It's not *exactly* like either.

It lets you prove incontrovertibly that a certain file existed by a certain date, and that you had access to it. You could use it to support a copyright claim, prove your apartment or rental car was already damaged when you got it etc.

@_date: 2015-12-19 04:10:11


I didn't mean that people or governments can solve them better, just that you have to keep in mind that markets and evolution don't come up with an overall optimum either. There are two major things that get in the way:
1) What they come up with will be better than other similar solutions that could have been reached by incremental steps from earlier iterations, but there also might be much, much better solutions that there's no clear way to get to. It's like how gravity pulls things to the local minimum height. If you roll a ball it just stops in the lowest spot that it can get to without going up again first but there might be a huge cliff nearby. Or a biology example is how giraffes have [this nerve]( that goes all the way down and back up their neck again for no reason. It just got adjusted little by little, and there's no mechanism to step back and say "wait why not make it direct instead?". In terms of humans and money, I think it's obvious that we don't actually need money (even bitcoin) anymore. We could just build robots to do all the menial labor and/or have fun handcrafting some stuff if we wanted. There's plenty for everyone. But that would take a radical redesign of the brain and there's no way to do that now that we've been so well adapted for scarcity. We also shouldn't need to exercise to stay fit. Your body could just make you ripped on its own if it wasn't used to conserving food. For that matter you shouldn't have to eat a variety of specific foods to get vitamins. Your body could make them all from ice cream or beer if we hadn't lost the enzymes at some point. But we're stuck with incremental changes.
2) Selection/market forces don't work well at small scales. They only behave reliably with large populations. At small scales randomness dominates, and which one wins out doesn't have much to do with being better at all. Like if a big Bitcoin exchange has a scandal or somebody kills the leaders of some of the big pools, and micropayments with another coin take happen to take off in a big way at the same time due to a celebrity or TV show or something, that might be the end of it even though the other coin sucks. Or if there's a large terrorist attack and it turns out they financed it with bitcoin. The outcome is deterministic (better one wins eventually) at large scales but stochastic (random) at small ones.


I agree, except I think to a large extent the outcome won't be based on "better" either way--it'll be based on which one happens to grow too big to die first. Then all future things will be built on top of or integrate with that early winner until/unless something is so radically better it's worth starting over again.
.... so yeah, I don't think we disagree exactly haha. I'm just a little more cynical. I think markets will lead to better money than we have now for sure, and we'll look back and have trouble believing people got along in the current system. It's just that there will be way better situations we never approached at all.
@_date: 2015-12-17 06:45:36
Working on an open source project actually seems like a great example of the modeling problem to me.
It may not be altruistic, but the benefits are complicated and differ for each person. If you tried to argue that overall dev progress could be predicted by looking at a couple variables only (person-hours spent per expected dollar rise in BTC for example) and that those variables have to line up for coding to be sustainable, that would be a flawed argument.
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:27:06
They could still learn about the economics and have someone else hold BTC for them if they want. Maybe that would be a better approach, just explaining the 21 million cap and leave the technical details out?

Bitcoin could be supplanted without actually failing, if everyone starts using something else with higher capacity. Think Linux vs Solaris or BSD.
EDIT: Actually, BSD is a good example. It's still considered "better" in terms of security and is released by a small, highly-qualified team. And it's been completely overrun by the messiness of decentralized Linux development.

@_date: 2015-12-27 17:18:48
Well they disagree with most users (individual and corporate; miners could go either way) about how to scale Bitcoin. So if they *are* correct that it should be done through lightning network now rather than blocksize increases + maybe lightning later, it would be in their interest to explain that why in a way that everyone wouldn't consider vague and misleading. They clearly have a problem either with their reasoning or with explaining their reasoning.
EDIT: TL;DR They should spend time fixing their PR problem.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:19:30
Eventually people will have to get comfortable with the idea of forks. Maybe not contentious runtime forks, but little things. Core is just the reference implementation; everyone gets to run whatever code they want, and the network as a whole prevents them messing it up for others. Hell, even the bible has lots of different versions in different languages.

Yes. That's an assertion that would take him like 5 seconds to back up, either with a quote or a short bulleted list of protocol requirements and whi, but would save people who don't have a working knowledge of the codebase days of searching and/or a high risk of going astray in the process.
A quote would be better in my opinion, because the code itself can be interpreted many ways and if something can be implemented easily that doesn't necessarily imply it was intended. For example all the pieces are in place to implement blacklisting, but I imagine Satoshi would have preferred that the coins be fungible.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:23:39
That's not the only interpretation. Many people either stopped running XT nodes because of the DDOS or switched them to stealth mode. Also many people may be uncomfortable running an "unofficial" version but want XT to be the "official" one in the future. Or, they may not think running a node contributes anything meaningful (similar to how not voting doesn't imply you're satisfied with the current government).

It was an XT node, so I assume whoever was pissed off about that did it. A lot of other people got hit too. In my opinion it's what turned the tide against XT at the time... sad that intimidation works, but it totally does.
I also have a fairly small local ISP, which sometimes isn't 100% on top of things but I enjoy avoiding ComCast. After calling them a couple times they figured it out and gave me a new static IP, and I didn't try again because I like them.

As soon as you go offchain you lose most of the advantages: interoperability of all payments, permissionless innovation, incentive to mine the main chain, censorship resistance etc.
Not saying one giant chain is the only way it could work. Having multiple synced main chains might be viable but none have actually been shown to work yet.
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:09:34
I wouldn't consider it a replacement for paper wallets or hold everything on it. But it's great for the use case of "how to carry around more than you're comfortable trusting an android phone with". I treat it kind of like my phone is cash, Trezor is a checking account, and paper/offline computer/something is savings. It could also be great as one of several authentication methods for multisig.
@_date: 2015-12-17 04:25:02
It doesn't have to be exciting. If/when a lot of people start to hold their money in bitcoin, many will run one for privacy's sake because it's the only way to check on your addresses without revealing them.

We should design it to benefit everyone on Earth as much as possible, especially the poorest. But there's no way they'll be running nodes. Think about what that would require: full nodes on Nokia feature phones using balloon internet/satellite? And in a lot of places people literally have to generate electricity from a water wheel or something to charge those phones.
EDIT: You know what would be cool though. Satellite transmitters to send, receive, and verify transactions with no other infrastructure required (to whatever standard of "verify" is possible without running a node).
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:58:27

@_date: 2015-12-05 23:07:29
Looks cool! I don't entirely get it though (yet)... what secures it? It seems to me if the Stash network is much smaller than the main chain then it would be easy to defraud someone by taking over a large percentage of Stash nodes, and if it becomes larger then there isn't much incentive to secure the main chain and you could attack that.
@_date: 2015-12-07 04:19:24
I'm confused by that. There's certainly more of a wealth difference between rich men/women and poor men/women than between average men and average women. So if that were the reason wouldn't rich women be into it? (I may be entirely missing the point)
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:23:51
Interesting. Sounds like it prevents predatory lending, but at the cost of not being able to get any money without convincing someone else your idea is worthwhile beforehand? And places a higher value on personally knowing rich people.

It's pretty easy to double spend until there's one confirmation though. You could just send one valid transaction and 99 others back to yourself, and have a 99% chance of not paying right?
Seems like it would only be a problem for medium-size transactions: you don't want to take them on faith, but are also annoyed at having to wait around.
@_date: 2016-01-05 03:03:57
That would be cool! I think it'd have to be a completely different protocol from email though. More p2p like newsgroups? You would have to have all nodes download all messages unless they're OK with revealing to the server which public keys their IP address is interested in. EDIT: Or it could just go through Tor.

No I don't have any problem with them existing. I think they should take a little more active role in voting on development rather than just assuming it'll work out OK. If I were them I would also be working on inventive ways to move packets in and out of the country more quickly right now (but I wouldn't advertise it). Maybe some kind of highly redundant setup where they broadcast from lots of places at once?
EDIT: I think [this guy]( has the right idea (for the short term):

Forking the network isn't (or shouldn't be) a process of arguing and justifying in the first place. There's a continuous vote on the consensus rules going on all the time, and everyone can vote for whatever changes they like. When the majority decides to change the rules  they can. If they don't want to, nothing Gavin or anyone else writes can force them so why get upset about it?

I'm not quite sure what the question means. Do you mean sending messages to the owner of a public key without knowing their email? That could be done by encrypting for that key and posting the message somewhere public. Don't think there's any way to fit email into it though.

I like microblocks. I don't understand the limitations exactly, but you have a series of tiny blocks (one every 10 seconds?) that miners transmit and build on quickly, then a "checkpoint" with higher difficulty every 10min like now. But I think your transaction could be orphaned at the next checkpoint.

There's no reason to rush implementation of the other scaling solutions by conflating them with a block size increase. That just makes it more likely something will go wrong with one of them.
@_date: 2016-01-05 02:16:11
Those "other 6 billion" also don't have access to any way to save though, and bitcoin would be great for that.
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:44:22
This didn't make a lot of sense. There are parts of it that make sense individually, but I'm not convinced of any of the overall implications.
For example, where would a technologically-minded socialist fit on this Luddite/socialist vs progress/capitalist spectrum? One common idea is that socialism could work, but only after machines have made manual labor and a need to work for survival obsolete anyway. Or what about someone who wants to go off in the woods and learn to kill their own food, make things with their own hands, etc. because they don't feel self-sufficient in a technological world? They're very anarchistic but not trying to be efficient.
I think there's a valid core to it, and it's basically just that making pronouncements about how people should live without thinking through the consequences and alternatives is bad. You could lump anti-vaxxers who eat organic in there too.
But once we've decided that, we have to call the author out on doing the same thing with capitalism and self-determination. Certainly he's aware a society set up that way has its drawbacks, such as becoming unfair over time (first generation works for what they have on a fairly level playing field, then each generation afterward is dominated by the effects of inheritance), or externalizing costs/tragedy of the commons (no one can be convinced to price global warming into their business model)?
Maybe someone can make a compelling case that it's still the best possible setup and those drawbacks are unavoidable, but don't just gloss over and ignore. Otherwise you're being ignorant at best, or maybe dishonest.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:34:46
OK, but that's exactly the problem bitcoin has to solve. If it can't be done bitcoin won't work long-term. The average user will get less and less informed the more there are (eternal September), and it has to still work in the face of that.

I believe it was supposed to be a temporary measure to prevent spam. It would be removed once "light" wallets that didn't need to download the whole blockchain were implemented.

Haha the internet should be fine then. We can't even all agree the Earth is round. No danger of total consensus on any complicated or important topic.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:52:31
Yeah. We really need protocol-level mixing. Or maybe just implementing it in the popular wallets would be enough. There are other coins better designed for that (Monero and ZeroCoin I think). I'm OK with doing it later, after too many people are using BTC to shut it down anymore, but the risk is we just won't get it done and then bitcoin becomes a giant money tracking system. It does put to rest the immediate "bitcoin is for drugs" PR issue though. ¯ \_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:14:24
Yup. It's worse than that though, because in doing so you also link those two .25 inputs together, proving that the same person owns both of them. Also if you don't need to send the entire .5 you will get some back as change, and later spending the change will link the next transaction with the old one.
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:14:53
Yeah if you have a lot of money and are willing to throw it around attacking bitcoin, why not just buy bitcoin and if it does well you get richer? It's really an ingenious social hack.

It's not a permanent solution, but assuming segwit, lightning network etc. come through it should buy enough time to deploy them. Also, the BIPS that don't need to be revisited every 6-12 months were voted down. This is a compromise.

I still don't see why people think it's bad to have multiple teams working on this independently. Personally I'd prefer as many as we can muster the resources for. But *at least* two is important if we're going to standardize at a protocol level, and it would probably help everything move forward more smoothly if the devs break into groups by management style (kind of like linux distros).
@_date: 2016-01-03 08:10:23
I think people might not be able to compare all those choices effectively. Maybe it would work better to ask a series of questions, and then map them to the matching proposals behind the scenes based on simple extrapolations of the blocksize? Something like:
Best guess at what blocksize would be too big (would cause unacceptable centralization)?
Best guess at how long until alternative scaling solutions (lightning etc.) could be safely deployed?
Best guess at what blocksize would be too small (limits adoption)?
Who should be capable of running a node: every device? personal computers? personal servers? datacenters?
Most concerning form of current centralization: nodes? miners? devs? countries?
It would be extra awesome if all combinations are allowed, but to enter some of them you have to click "Yes I meant that, and I know my opinion is not internally consistent" first lol.

@_date: 2015-08-08 15:29:25
True, it's a very conservative bet. Like betting on the house or buying into the casino kind of. It always works unless something unusual happens, like a stock market crash or a war or mismanagement of the country. But those risks are still there, they're just smaller and harder to quantify.
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:28:52
This would be cool as a [Sankey diagram]( (just learned what those are called!), so you can see the fees getting diverted away. It would also show the bitcoin fees in an honest way, making it clear that they're nonzero but still way smaller.

The narrative is decentralized too, that's the cool part! Everyone has their own idea what would be best and are  trying to pull the system towards that (pay lower fees, mine more easily, mint more coins, more or less anonymity...) but it's still really hard to move because of disagreement. If it were 100% centralized a fork would be 100% certain to work.

So it's like a separate OS that runs Android in a sandbox instead of the other way around? That does seem better but like it might prevent running a custom OS or even rooting the phone.

The deflationary aspect is only gone if some of them have more inflation long-term. If they each stick to the 21 million there's no extra inflation. It's like if you decided to call 0.5 BTC a bitcoin, then everyone would have 2X as much but the same proportion of the total so it doesn't matter.

Disclaimer: I don't know what I'm talking about.
But it seems like they would be mostly unaffected. The devices themselves don't do anything with mining; they just sign transactions. The only change would be that web wallets like [MyTrezor]( need to decide which version they use.

As long as it gets adopted swiftly everything should keep working the same. Maybe even lower fees? But in the worst-case scenario the network could split into two viable blockchains and you could sell your coins on one to buy more on the other. I don't think that will happen but it would be very bad, shaking peoples' confidence and totally tanking the price on both.

[This post]( finally made it clear to me. Basically the network will consume electricity proportional to how much people think it's worth, because when you mine you're bidding for bitcoins with your hardware + electricity costs. So if a bitcoin is worth 200X more, people will be willing to spend 200X the money to mine it. There's no way to make it any more efficient than that. (Of course it's a little more complicated because of block reward + fees instead of just block reward, but it scales with value of a bitcoin * both of those added together)

This still works better the more people join you, so you want it to be usable by everyone in every country!

What if the exchanges take a neutral approach and list the two coins as "Bitcoin Core" and "Bitcoin Cash"? That way people could choose freely. As far as I can tell, both have about equal claim to being the "true Bitcoin". They're both descended from the original codebase and have the backing of some of the early devs, and of course the same transaction history up until the split.

This is really the ultimate solution to centralization or someone "sneaking things in": learn to compile it yourself. It can be very difficult for some programs, but for well-maintained ones like bitcoin (+/- whatever other changes you want) you just need to follow directions. On Ubuntu, these are the commands, paraphrased from [the github site](
    # install other packages bitcoin depends on
    # (only has to be done the first time)
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev build-essential libtool \
        autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config libssl-dev libdb4.8-dev \
        libdb4.8++-dev libminiupnpc-dev libqt4-dev \
        libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev
    # download bitcoin source code from github
    # (can update to newest version afterward with `git pull`)
    git clone 
    cd bitcoin
    # build bitcoin
    # (or rebuild after changing something)
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
I haven't tested those because I don't run Ubuntu but the point is it's not some special thing only a couple people can do. It's just a matter of Googling as you go and not being scared of the terminal.
EDIT: code formatting
EDIT 2: There are many, many people with the technical skills required to take the "big blocks only" XT branch and distribute binaries. That could be a thing.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:04:37
I think so too, but I'm scientifically inclined enough that I want to test it anyway to be sure. :D
Plus I have this wild idealistic notion that one day this could be the backbone of an entire parallel "opt-in" do-ocratic society. Other people are thinking along the same lines (for example), but if any of that is going to work the system as a whole (including software and the people who run it) needs to be resistant to the full force of rhetoric/propaganda everyone will throw at it.
If it's destined to get popular but it can be taken over by demagogues, that *will* happen eventually.

Just download the program and run it, you don't need a special computer. If you want it on a separate system get a crappy old PC on ebay/craigslist. You do need ~40GB drive space and growing, but that's super cheap nowadays too.
EDIT: For example [many of these]( would be fine.
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:33:08
But doesn't prioritizing latency also create an incentive for mining to centralize into big farms in remote regions where electricity is cheap? Maybe a situation where some are limited by bandwidth and some by electricity cost would be better?
(Not saying you're wrong. I don't have enough of an intuition for the numbers involved to have a strong opinion either way.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:58:01
As I see it, there are two huge benefits. One is we're moving away from an informal, sometimes hostile development environment dominated by strong egos and toward a move professional foundation with a social contract. Second, we're committing to scaling the network so that it can be used by average people and not just as some kind of elaborate interbank settlement system. I signed up for a technology that empowers anyone anywhere with a cell phone, something with applications in third-world countries with limited access to banking. This doesn't make that a reality, but it affirms that that's still the goal and removes one big roadblock.
EDIT: Oh one more. If we can do this successfully it proves that hard forks aren't the end of the world, and that makes it much more likely that bitcoin can incorporate new ideas in the future rather than being replaced by an altcoin.
Non-benefits are mainly that if it *doesn't* work, forking the blockchain into two alternate histories, even temporarily, is a PR nightmare. And that if the small-block bloc is right, it will lead to more centralization.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:27:25
Yeah I meant MIT. But I sort of mixed it together with XT in my head while writing that... they're not actually related except through Gavin right? In my mind it's not whether there's an institution involved that matters. It's just that I'd rather have a set of stated principles most people can agree on, and have development proceed based on good arguments for how the changes best achieve those principles. That's what I meant by "social contract" and "professional". Gavin and Mike seem to be the ones making reasonable arguments, and the lack of any good rebuttals has been striking.
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:54:12
True, but we can't reliably guess what the net impact on the network would be. It might encourage bloat, but it might also boost the attractiveness of using bitcoin among security-literate types who would run nodes. Or it might fit nicely with some sort of sidechain or coinjoin feature, or fees could be set per-output so that more obfuscated transactions cost a little more. Or there might be legislation breaking up Comcast and suddenly everyones' internet speed quadruples, making slightly-bigger blocks uncontroversial. Or something else we haven't thought of yet.

I'm not convinced by the sandboxing thing either. Not saying it can't work for sure, it just *sounds like* it might not work. How does it prevent another app from replacing its content on screen? And it needs to obfuscate its resource use, but I imagine that could be done with some sort of "calculate how much we're calculating, and do some extra junk to bring it to a constant higher level" setup. Ledger probably does that already. And it would need a way to alert you if the hash of its own binary changes.

@_date: 2015-07-28 16:21:03
In principle can't this type of thing be prevented by proper testing? My first thought is "[QuickCheck]( would have caught it" but any other setup for randomly generating valid and invalid transactions and checking that all the builds agree on which is which would have caught it too.
(I suppose it *was* caught after all, but that was too close!)
I've never worked on crypto and hear it's really hard/subtle but I would have expected that to lead to a *higher* proportion of tests and people being really anal about restricting the number of valid transaction types, proving they always validate etc.
If bitcoin does succeed I hope one of the side effects will be that way more people are employed testing open-source security stuff (OpenSSL, PGP, Tor...)
EDIT: Maybe we could solve this, if only for bitcoin. Is there somewhere we can pool BTC in escrow as a bounty for found+fixed bugs? There would be incentive for anyone holding large amounts to contribute because a serious bug would probably cost them more money anyway.

Sounds like you're doing everything very well! I agree it's probably not possible to randomly test from the top down with all the current dependencies--it would have to have been done during development of OpenSSL and I naively assumed it probably already had been done. Your discovery of that OpenSSL bug was what originally alerted me that the foundations might be a lot shakier than I imagined, and I'm glad you're replacing it with a better-tested/more minimal library.
In my ideal world this stuff would pay much more than a regular programming job because it's more important and demanding and boring (depending on your perspective of course!) than adding features, but yeah that's not the current state of things.
Interesting idea with the bug-adding bounty too... testing the test framework instead of the code directly?

This wouldn't be for testing the core so much as a tool for people making alternative implementations so they can check that their transactions aren't consensus-breaking. It wouldn't fundamentally solve anything, just lower the barrier for being "pretty sure" your new library is OK.

Anyone running the new code is voting for the new rules, and disregarding a rival chain that doesn't follow them is the right behavior, as long as you can be sure the new chain has really started and has a good chance of success. You don't want to go back and forth accepting both chains, that would be crazy.

But then you're telling one or more electrum servers to associate your IP address with those bitcoin addresses. Running a node is the only way to do it without giving anyone a clue you own them.

I think the mempool is only limited by the machine's RAM, so not sure why this is a big deal. Sure you don't want it to be 4GB, but 30MB vs 100MB doesn't seem important.

There is a higher risk of bitcoin failing catastrophically due to a bug or well-funded attack or something, and it has privacy issues. But being transferred over the internet is a big enough advantage that I think it will be secured/anonymized over time.

If you have a free hour and a half [this talk from last week]( explains a lot of the technical details in an accessible way. I'm home sick and just watched it. Really makes you appreciate how many moving parts there are to this thing and how it's a little miraculous that it works.
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:01:47
Yeah I didn't mean to imply you could catch runtime consensus bugs, more along the lines of the low-level dependencies like OpenSSL. Though come to think of it there could be a set of dedicated nodes running all the popular implementations behind a web interface that you can test against, like the [HTML5]( or [acid3]( Would be super cool to include proposed changes too so people can make sure their code is compliant beforehand.
Also thanks for finding this!! Sure things could theoretically be better but you're actually working on it and that's worth a lot more than people just waking up and commenting on the results.
EDIT: Example was backwards. What I'm talking about would be more like a site where you submit HTML and get back "Your code renders with Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Opera and IE10 but not IE &lt; 10".
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:12:34
Nope that would be cool, but it just generates random test cases. There are libraries to do the same thing in other languages. It's easier/more complete in Haskell though because functions can usually be tested in isolation. There's also the related smallcheck which just tests the common edge cases like zero-length lists. I thought it would catch it because this:




















made me think that if the space of supposedly valid length descriptors were quick/smallchecked the test case would have failed on certain systems. I imagine "bigger than a C long int" would be a common smallcheck-style test case for C programs. But it's quite likely more complicated than I think because I'm just going off that one paragraph!
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:06:42
There's another kind of urgency too, which is that we need to show we can still make decisions and take (reasonable) risks to grow further. There are a lot of people and companies evaluating whether they can trust this thing now, and they probably all worry about whether the protocol is ossifying already, or whether they can be held hostage by a small group of developers in the future. Not necessarily implying this is happening how, but the possibility makes bitcoin much less attractive as a foundation for your company.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:03:39
The whole point is that there are no rules though, besides what is or isn't technically possible. If a fork is possible with a slim majority then when everyone gets all emotional about it that will be tried. And if it's a near-disaster, maybe better to know now while it's still small so we can look back later and be like "And no one tried to fork with under 95% again after 2016". Imagine if this happened once everyone was already using it.

I like the fungus analogy: it's everywhere all the time, but you don't notice it until some big store of nutrients builds up that the rest of the ecosystem can't use efficiently. Then it comes and efficiently breaks it down.

It's a pretty good analogy too, since Linux is *great* for the desktop once you spend the time to learn it, but turns people off because command line, not necessarily supported by a company etc. It's like "be your own IT department".

Thanks I was wondering how to do this!
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:13:47
Hey random idea: there should be companies that offer both POS systems and insurance against double spending. Then if the merchants commit to running a node on the POS system they get it for free/reduced price, like selling your solar power back to the power company. The POS/insurance company benefits by having them all talk to each other really quickly to prevent the double spends. Should work as long as their corporate meshnet is faster on average than anyones' cell connections. Could be a co-op?

There are other hashing algorithms less susceptible to mining farms (I hear Monero uses one that's limited by memory rather than CPU so it's harder to parallelize), but you would have to change the whole protocol and throw out existing mining hardware to switch, so no one who invested in the current hardware would want to.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:29:37
I think all you need is a Raspberry Pi flashed with an image that contains a bitcoin wallet + the blockchain. So whatever a Pi + 64GB sd card costs nowadays. Or you could skip the blockchain part if you're comfortable ceding control to a central electrum server. The mining part isn't at all cost effective. It's a benefit to 21 inc and a semi-hidden cost to the buyer.
EDIT: What *would* make sense is a business plan where they sell cheap devices to China or Brazil and subsidize the cost by requiring mining. The net effect would be they get cheap electricity and the buyer gets cheap electronics. But still no one would be buying it in order to mine.

This sounds cool, but I'm a little annoyed that in the spirit of proper attribution she didn't credit Mycelium for their name and/or the fungus analogy.... or was that a thing before Mycelium?
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:26:32
That's unknowable though because it's not currently limited by technology, it's limited by a cartel of large ISPs (in the US) and probably incentive to build infrastructure in a lot of other countries. If regulations change it could go up (or down) quickly. It also doesn't take into account the tradeoff between total number of users and fraction of users running a node. If network size increases by 10X and the proportion who run nodes is cut in half, that's still an overall gain of 5X.

Of course she knows about it. She's tech saavy enough to want to build a blockchain app, so she would have Googled her product name. I didn't mean it should be a legal issue or anything, just it would be nice to cite her sources (whether that's Mycelium or an old message board post or whatever) or disambiguate if she came up with it independently. Since she's building an app that's all about tracking provenance and extra metadata. But maybe she did and it's just not in the article.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:24:29
But it's almost certainly a lot more expensive to pay the upfront cost of one of these and then more for your electric bill than it is to "speculate" on a few satoshis to play around with. Or you could use testnet for free.
EDIT: Maybe we've reached a new level where devs speculate by investing experience, and everyone is just buying one to play with in case it ends up making sense?
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:00:20
 I think they mean they'll put hashes of official documents in the blockchain, [like this]( Which is a great idea to cut costs and keep people from illicitly changing things.

Yes, that's good. More safety, plus it puts them at a disadvantage compared to the ones that do it the smart/safe way.

@_date: 2015-04-19 20:23:32
Not sure it solves this, but general privacy for everyone would be better if we could pay people in bitcoin to run exit nodes. Is there an obvious reason that wouldn't work?
@_date: 2015-09-22 03:50:02
I really hope so. If they can get momentum behind that they could personally become rich from the mining while at the same time being legitimately useful for everyone else. They just have to make it so easy it's not worth setting up an alternative and pointing the mining to your own address.
EDIT: Of course if it gets really popular they'll eventually be replaced by a competitor that doesn't require you to mine for them, but at that point bitcoin could be really popular.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:00:59
What I said includes that possibility. They could do that, but they don't because it would kill their profits by lowering the value of the coins they earn. So their interests are aligned with the other players.
EDIT: The incentive system works reliably as long as no one controls too much of the hashing power. If they do then profit stops being a reliable motivator because a few people could behave irrationally or be coerced/threatened.

Looks pretty good! Basically instead of mining transactions directly miners are competing to be "blockchain czar" for the next 10 minutes and are authorized to sign off on transactions during that time. But then if they abuse that power by double spending the network cancels it and takes away their block reward.
The only thing I wonder about is what happens if a couple big mining pools are so much faster than everyone else that others can't catch up to verifying all their transactions?

Then you could hack it to show a different hash. With the blockchain that's basically impossible after a few hours/days have passed.
EDIT: Also you would need to manage permissions. With the blockchain it's only a tiny legal step to also count documents uploaded by private citizens as proof in court that a document existed at a certain date.

As far as I know none of the others have released any code, or even have a concrete timeline for when they will. Is there an alternative client I don't know about? Or does "supporting" them just mean supporting sitting around arguing longer?

Miners are the only ones with a real vote on the consensus rules, so everything else has to be done by making sure their interests are representative of the other players. It's not great but there's no other way to do it.

Yeah I think so too. If nothing else maybe we'll be able to come up with a more agile protocol where not everyone works on the same transactions or something. Because right now we have way more safety than we need and way less throughput. But it's still early days!

It definitely will be if bitcoins become valuable enough. There are early adopters sitting on millions in bitcoin, and their names are probably freely available from old forum posts and stuff.

I don't know about others, but I judge companies on bugs. Especially bitcoin companies! If they have a lot of minor bugs and fix them quickly or compensate people for losses, that's still a reason to stay away. It means they don't have proper unit + integration testing.
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:19:37
it means they create a transaction that requires the buyer + seller + purse representative to all sign it. then buyer and seller sign it and seller ships the product, and if everything goes ok purse signs too later and the money goes through. if not they don't and no money goes anywhere.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:32:18
That makes it even more obvious that for everyday use the blocksize will need to be higher. We're close to not even being able to handle speculation alone.

Yes, but:
1) Guns are much harder to get or make yourself once banned than software is, and
2) Encryption gets harder the more people you want to communicate with, so it's exponentially harder to protect your day-to-day communications than just a few targeted criminal ones. There's no equivalent gun metaphor.

That's why I put "wasted" in quotes. It's wasted in that it's being used just for mining and not for a side benefit like heating your house.
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:58:20
True, but that will still be taken into account by the economics. It'll lead to effectively cheaper mining, so people will mine more and the difficulty will rise accordingly. It's a self-adjusting system that always finds equilibrium at the point where you're spending an amount extra on computers + electricity equal to what you think the BTC you can mine is/will be worth. With some perturbations thrown in of course for uncertainty in technology, profit margin, hobby fun etc. But overall the amount "wasted" on mining will always roughly equal the market value of the mining reward + fees.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:36:39
I don't know much about central banking, but it seems like that applies equally to all central banks, so it shouldn't be problem. Like if bank A buys the tiny amount they can at a reasonable price, they don't have to worry that other banks bought significantly more already. So whatever amount you can reasonably purchase is the amount you need to ensure you aren't left behind. Does that make any sense?
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:24:04
This. It *is* wasteful (in that electricity is consumed for security with no other benefit), and will consume more power the more value we perceive the coins to have. There's just no better way.

When you buy BTC in person, so you really hang out for an hour+ waiting for confirmation? It's only 10 minutes on average but can be much longer sometimes.
EDIT: For the record, I think you should be able to up the fee associated with a transaction but not change anything else (addresses, amounts of other outputs etc). That would be the best of both.
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:49:47
But currently nodes most won't relay the second spend right? You just keep the same rules, and add an exception for the same addresses + bigger fee.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:05:52
Wasteful might not have been the right word. What I meant was it's a legitimate concern that if bitcoin were to get really popular it would use a lot of power. Not that I don't want it to be popular, but I think we should be honest it's possible it will dwarf the energy consumption of banks in the future.
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:29:50
But their power needs aren't tied directly to exchange rates. If bitcoin price goes up, so do the power requirements.

One thing I hope bitcoin does is force people to get better at computer security in general. If everyone had an easy way of managing public and private keys, it might become feasible to have everyone using them to encrypt their email, replacing SSNs for verifying their accounts, etc. Also maybe GPG wouldn't be so incredibly underfunded.
