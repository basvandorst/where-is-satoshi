Is there a way to use Signal without giving someone your number?

With Circle getting out of the BTC business and the IRS pressuring Coinbase it's only getting harder for everyday folks to jump in. The high barrier to entry is not good for BTC.

What if a coinbase user bought 1 BTC and then ran it through a mixer? Doesn't the trail for the IRS end at the mixer transaction? 
@_date: 2016-12-09 10:26:34
Thanks for the tip. Right now I have a wallet set up in Breadwallet that I plan to use for regular transactions. But that tip is good to know if I ever want to use Breadwallet to just monitor my addresses.

If Bitcoin were easily accessible the cost could be driven by everyday users conducting small value transactions similar to the way people use paypal. Because it's not accessible to the layman, the market will continue to be driven by hobbyists and investors with money.

The way I see it, there are two situations that should concern coinbase users:
1) A user sold bitcoin for a gain through Coinbase and never reported the transaction to the IRS. 
2) A user made a traceable purchase directly from his Coinbase address and did not pay sales tax. 
The second option will be very difficult to track. The IRS would need to know the retailers bitcoin address and then link it to your Coinbase address and then prove that you did not pay sales tax on the transaction AND did not account for the sales tax on your tax return. That's a lot of steps to investigate for a $100 purchase at Amazon or Newegg. 
I see this more as the IRS wanting to track high-value tax evaders, and, more importantly, harvesting data for the Dept of Justice. They are always interested in tying identities to anonymity and this court ruling will allow them to do just that. 
My recommendation is to run your coins through a mixer and begin taking steps to increase your anonymity.

Coinbase is much larger. Very different. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:20:25
Coinbase isn't going to jail for you or anyone else. They will follow the law. Never rely on anyone to put themselves at risk for your safety. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:41:10
No because it's not a supply issue. Bitcoin is accessible, but I believe that the average person will not put in the effort to obtain the currency. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:10:47
Yeah. The IRS won't be able to get into the weeds on whether a person still owns coins or not. They will have to stick with targeting people who clearly had taxable events. This will primarily be two types: those who sold bitcoins and those who claimed bitcoin assets for a tax break. There is simply no way the IRS will investigate every person who bought bitcoin to determine if the person had a taxable event. It's not only infeasible, it's nearly impossible. They do not have the resources. The only thing they could do is audit people who are on record as having a transaction and put the burden on the person to prove he did not sell or trade the bitcoin. How would he person prove he is still in possession of the bitcoin? There is no mechanism to provide that info to the IRS. Further, what if you lost your keys or password to your bitcoin software? Or what if you had it stolen via malware or a lost computer? There are many stories you can tell to plead ignorance of transactions or trades. Unless, of course, you sold your bitcoin and received cash for it.

.1 bitcoin for a 1-year membership plan? 
I like to pay for good software, especially one that supports a good cause, but these guys are pricing themselves out of the market.

The only thing that goes up indefinitely is government debt.
Pullbacks = buying opportunity!

Coinbase, can you please reply back here or on your blog once this issue is resolved?
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:54:34
Ha, I like and share your enthusiasm for bitcoin!
PS have to be careful to remember that it IS real money you're spending. When I first started using bitcoin I got carried away with sending money everywhere just because it was so cool. Heck, I found myself donating to causes I didn't even care about just because they accepted bitcoin.
Long live bitcoin!

+1 for your realization that it's YOUR cash and not Chase's. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:38:42
The bottom line from this post is:
If you're still in the bitcoin buying phase, you should wish for low prices.
Once you enter the selling phase, you should wish for higher prices.

Bitcoinity = smart

You betcha. I would use it as a buying opportunity.

Wow, that's awesome of you! Count me in for $100 too.

Sweet! Wonder how much they will spend on customer support?

Man, that's so awesome! Congrats to everyone for another bitcoin milestone!

Can you explain what you mean by "every word Electrum uses?"
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:26:37
It's all good right now. People are taking profits and others are getting shaken out of bitcoin. Let them go. I hope bitcoin settles at a low price and then moves sideways for months while the real believers continue to accumulate coins...then, once again, to the moon!
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:32:59
Wired needs to stop writing about this group of (formerly) homeless guys and write more about groups like seansoutpost who have benefited from the appreciation of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:22:55
I have an itchy trigger finger...want to buy so bad!
But, I don't want to catch a falling knife so I'll wait to see what happens.
However, if Bitcoin returns to 100, I'm in for 100 coins right away!

OP, interesting post. Thanks for sharing.
People are naturally greedy and want something for nothing. Not sure how old you are, but we experienced the same mood back in the late 90s with the stock market. Every tech stock went "to the moon" regardless of underlying company fundamentals. Every mom, auntie, and granny was talking about "this or that" tech company. They didn't give a crap about the company's service or product, only that it would keep going up.
Then, **CRASH!** 
And so many people lost money. I'd guess most never returned to the market after that. Some companies recovered, many disappeared forever. 
That's what I see now. There are many who want to make easy money. Some will. Many won't. It's ok. Eventually those people who don't understand nor appreciate bitcoin will get shaken out. Some with profit, most without. But the believers will continue to ride it out for the long-term because we understand the true power of a currency that is free from control and manipulation.

Man, I'm so sorry for your loss. It's a shame to keep seeing so many people scammed. There are some real smart people taking all the right precautions yet still getting hacked. 
We really need to make sure we're taking EVERY precaution. Use two-factor authentication on accounts...paper wallets..etc. And, the biggest one of all -- Do not tell anyone about your stash. No one. Ever. 
Sorry for your loss, my friend.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:29:37
OP, thanks for keeping it light-hearted.
PS cute wife -- congrats, my friend!

Good on Matthew Green for taking up this initiative.
The worst part of Truecrypt is the developer's attitude. They are very closed about the workings of the team and the future of Truecrypt. The software is becoming increasingly unstable with every new OS release, yet the development team refuses to make a statement about the future of Truecrypt. It would be nice to know if they plan on releasing future updates, or if we should move on to alternatives. 
I've sent multiple emails to the team but never received a reply.
