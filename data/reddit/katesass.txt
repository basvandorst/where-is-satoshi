This is old but I just saw it so I'm gonna reply anyway. And it's just a system in place with all UK banks. You could do it with your banks mobile app, or you could do it via telephone banking, or even go to your local bank. The method of sending the money does not matter, as long as it is UK to UK it will be free, and it take's less than 5 minutes. Usually instant.

In the UK you can send a National Bank Wire for free any time of the day. It's normally transfered into the account in less than a couple of minutes.  But for international wires it is much cheaper and faster to use bitcoin.

Yeah just figured that, thanks for the help.

That may be a good idea, I think I'll get two deposit boxes in separate locations and two Cryptosteel's.

Coinbase is one of the only exchanges that do this, it's 13-18 with parental consent, email them.

Heads up this has been available for a little over a month now :P

Are you serious! I use 600gb on average per month for just my Xbox One! My total average use is 6tb per month, I'd literally die if I had a cap. Node lyf is the best lyf. Feel bad for you man, who are you with? I'm with Sky UK.

^This, as long as you do the work tasked to you do whatever you want.

It's not that complicated? I'd say using Bitcoin has a smaller learning curve than Excel, and how many people are proficient in that?
It's not super simple but again it's not that difficult to use. A few hours and you can figure it out really, you've just gotta actually read relevant articles instead of price articles 24/7.

Ahahah that's just a commemorative coin. You can buy one for like $5.

33 BTC on 2011 would've costed maybe $200-300 depending on the time of the year. It's not that much tbf.

If Bitcoin was to be adopted as a global currency (no £, €, $, etc) the price would have to be around $2mil per 1 BTC, as how else do you store trillions of $ of currency in a system limited to 21,000,000 units? If you want to go with just all online commerce to be made with BTC each coin would be worth $50k-ish, or if it doesn't receive mass adoption it's unlikely to rise that high. Also I saw that you asked if anyone has made money, considering just a few years ago BTC was worth less than a $1 and now it's worth $290, to answer your question yes plenty of people have became "Bitcoin Millionaire's" but many people who bought BTC when it was close $1k a few years ago believing it would go up have lost a lot of money.

Take a look at some of the largest banks, tech firms, accountants &amp; audit firms (notably big 4). Search their careers for "blockchain". Enterprise blockchains is a big sector gaining steam quickly in terms of how business goes. More and more jobs are posted each and every year from when they started taking it seriously.

The fact you talk about trading crypto just shows you are new to the scene. Nobody 3 years ago was trading crypto really. Only over the past year and a half did it really become popular, and mostly to new comers. Personally trading shows a misunderstanding about bitcoin and other crypto. That's not what cryptocurrency is. Everyone back then was buying, hodling, or buying nifty stuff online.

Use coinbase pro. 0.25% fees. Used to be free, but still one of the cheapest.

@_date: 2019-05-09 17:07:23
Yes you can. There's instructions with them. Read those, safest way to be :)
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:42:40
Just like any other transfer.. not difficult at all.
