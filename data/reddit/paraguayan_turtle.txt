a bank is public and you can withdraw the money there/they can deposit there.
In addition everything is on camera and there's a fair amount of security.
a person would have to be a fool to attempt a robbery, bitcoin related or otherwise inside a bank.

I hope you got bitcoins

Thank you, this is the type of response I was looking for.  Just to be clear, legally I would only be able to sell 1,000 dollars worth per day.  I could not legally sell 800 dollars worth to one person and 500 to another in one day?
In addition, if I sold more than 1,000 dollars worth in a day to be classified as an MSB, what would that mean for me?
