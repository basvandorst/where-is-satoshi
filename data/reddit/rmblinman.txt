So as just a logo or icon on a website landing page, would the sentence of attribution at the bottom suffice? Thanks

Thanks, so for:

I would have to provide a link to where I got the image?

BITCF just changed their ticker a few days ago and ran +2,400% since then. It might be only the data under the new trading symbol. As far as google finance is concerned I do not know. Try checking out investors hub pages specific to the companies... they have PRs and other info on those boards.

Yeah, similar to the wild west MJ plays but like I have been saying I have been making very nice profit off those stocks for 4 years. I trade more than I "invest." For example I bought MYRY Monday at .046 and sold today .0585 and then rebought .05.... volatility is a good thing if you are trading.
Some of these bitcoin companies will be worth hundreds of % more than they are today later this year or next, it is just a question of which ones. Fortunately the sector seems to trade in unison right now. When one is big in the green the rest follow... just like the marijuana sector.

As with people who follow me on stock forums, I like making other people money (while I make it too of course). I am currently making money on these 3 stocks. I have gotten many messages this weekend of people looking for bitcoin stocks.

You need a free brokerage account with someone like fidelity, TD ameritrade, think or swim.
Trades are $7.95 each with fidelity.
