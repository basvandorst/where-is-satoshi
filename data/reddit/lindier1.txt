You have had 9 years to get on board. The demand is huge, the KYC process is STANDARD in many countries. Just like when you open a bank account, you need to go through the financial steps. If you should blame someone, blame the financial institution and yourself for waiting so long. Now I have got that off my chest, try localbitcoins com or bitsquare. Good luck!

Obviously the question your really asking is -Do I still have time to get rich?
Well @ 5USD, it's probably gonna take a while. However, it will probably be your best 5USD ever spent if you have brass balls &amp; hodl the shit out of it.
Sarcasm aside, if you want your money to work for you, Bitcoin should be a 1% to 10% exposure &amp; DCA.

Weak hands, panic, indecision, long time-preference.
I like that!
Those that can’t hodl an 80% drop don’t deserve the 1000% gains.
I want to see blood, capitulation, cataclysmic extinction of weak hands, Shitcoins &amp; day-traders. This should be the nuclear winter that kills all but Bitcoin as we are the hodlers of last resort. All that blood, weak hands, empty souls will feed the dirt into fertile ground from which Bitcoin will rise strong and faster. The feeding frenzy will begin, the sun will rise, Lambos, blow, hair transplants, whatever makes you tick will be closer than ever. 
A new era of superior hodlers of last resort shall rise from the ashes reaping the rewards of conviction, focus, steadfastness, dark winters. 
The superior HODLer of last resort shall be wiser, stronger, with knowledge that can only be gained through the process, education, patients only a HODLer can understand.
P.s Wife is scared? Fuck you, 
Do you have conviction, focus, strength, determination?
HODLer of last resort is a lonely state to be. But it is most rewarding .

Some truth to that. But more to do with shitcoins as they now understand that if Bitcoin bleeds, they haemorrhage. We need the shitcoins to bleed out...a cataclysmic event, extinction of shitcoins.
Then I will go back to work and buy up as much Bitcoin as my salary will allow &amp; get a loan and more Bitcoin still.

If you look at what has happened at exchanges, as for example -Coinbase. You will see that the majority if the hard-forks had not been issued to the "holders of Bitcoin" other than BCash I believe.
Where are all those forked coins, who has them...Small print my friend, the small print was invented by corporations. And it will carry on until it doesn't. 
Most importantly, the large holders, these will be ETF's will take advantage of the position of strength and try to do a SW2X. And we shall have UASF causing hard-fork &amp; the story will repeat itself.

It’s a bear market kiddos! Compare fractals ATH for 2014. 50ma is now above the current price on the weekly. This has not happened since the last bear market. We have a price target of 2300 which is the 69% price drop from 2014 50ma. The good new:
 -We are moving faster than before.
-A lot of new money coming in &amp; or want to.
-past performance is not indicative of future performance.

1. I’m a hodler and been so for several years now. I do have not sold any only to pay Capitol taxes.
2. If Bitcoin does go down, that is ONLY a good thing. Since you don’t get it, this means more Bitcoins.
3.  To dismiss the possibility of a bear market is plain simple reckless, coupled with long term indicators turning bearish.
4. I believe that the speed of this downtrend is at least 1/3 faster than before.
@_date: 2018-08-23 08:44:24
Better than that, sell me your coins! 
You see, most ppl have a short time horizon. Want results today, so if the results go against them now, they sell. Unwilling to endure the pains that investing bring. Only to FOMO at a much higher price than when they sold. Those creatures are the ones that cause parabolic moves that then help push the price much higher and lower than it should have done.
You can see that in the support area we have been ranging. This area is prior to the parabolic move. Coincidence? I don’t think so. So the sooner they capitulate, the sooner volatility will cease, causing day traders to go elsewhere. It’s at this point we get to accumulate and wait it out for the next bull run. Likely before summer 2020.
I know of no day-trader that has become a billionaire, let alone stayed billionaire. Only investors become so.
To all the doubters -get out!
To those with conviction -DCA &amp; strong hands.

Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that Satoshi Nakamoto vanished for my sins. I invite Bitcoin to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward.

This has a simple solution...we short the fuck out of BTC:

2/ �� $875 per $BTC is the point where it no longer makes sense from a long term ROI perspective to deploy new  miners

A very valid point. To me having a mining community controlling BU or any dev will always benefit them first and foremost.
Centralisation in its truest sense; they even plan to have a "President".

Roger Ver is paying up to 10% for miners to move to BU and it's working.
Has an aggressive PR campaign and it's working. 
Has some very deep pockets and it's working.
We just sit around on our pc's and doing nothing about it. He is.
That said, i'm a Segwit guy, but our camp will not win this battle as is the status quo. We need to find a solution we can all accept and yes, that means involving BU. Roger Ver is divisive and acidic, he has now put his reputation on the line and that is helping him fuel his agenda. Because in Asia, he lives in Japan by the way; losing face is a big NO NO.

Can Bitcoin go down 20-30%? Sure but personally I find unlikely. 
-if it goes to 0, you lose only what you have invested.
-The cheaper bitcoin is, the more you can buy.

Bitcoin isn't about becoming a millionaire at all. In fact, the true value of Bitcoin isn't it's fiat value. It is the underling technology that underpins Bitcoin coin. The Bitcoin network.

This is a marathon, not a sprint, start to DCA in at these prices. This is so reminiscent of my entry back in 2015. 
Hodl-gang, now is the time to build out those positions. If you do, you will be as chilled as me in the next bear market sometime in 2022.
Do NOT leverage trade in the short term. Likely to hit 4.2 resistance and retest lows. We should range between 2.8-4.2 for the next few months. Second half of 2019 should get interesting.
Hodl out!
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:46:22
Why the rush bois! 
DCA in now...
Get as much Bitcoin as you can!
Another point needs mentioning is too much attention is paid to the ATH and not to the lows. 
If you bought BTC in 2015, ur average entry price would be something like 500usd. What's the % gains with todays price?
Do I think 2019 is similar to 2015?
Scarily so!

As Bitcoin is so divisible the only thing that needs changing is our frame of mind.
The ability to purchase a Bitcoin will be found in the history books. Satoshis will be the new unit of account which will be accessible to the majority.

9 ETF’s scheduled in November for SEC decision will more than likely be declined. 
What we need to keep an eye on is the VanEck, scheduled for 1st quarter 2019 and of course Bakkt.
Personally speaking, it’s likely the VanEck gets declined too, we drop big time then we get a very similar situation as the Winkevoss ETF rejection back in 2017...we dumped them we mooned to 20k as we have the next halving in 2020.
DCA &amp; brass balls my bois!
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:38:53
Bitcoin is to be bought on DCA, preferably in a bear market. The reason is rather simple, when you buy in a bear market empirically the value will increase over time &amp; you will experience your first bubble, it will then pop &amp; you will find yourself in another bear market. But with one key difference, you will likely be several X above your entry price.
As for your FIAT, it is a guaranteed inflationary vehicle by default. Without even mentioning these other fancy inflationary vehicles such as "quantitative easing", etc. 
I can only suggest you wait it out till we hit the bottom, it´s possible we V bottom &amp; head right up, but it could bottom out for months too. Either way, once we have identified the bottom, then you should start DCA. Don´t rush it, just be consistent &amp; pls don't load up more than you can afford to lose. 
Good luck!

The Bitcoin oracle has spoken.
If you want to believe in this S2X character for his predictions, don’t review his calls. 
The guy sold at 3K, 
Backed S2X and is a BCash supporter even if Fake Satoshi has unfollowed him.
For the record: Despite his dead wrong predictions, I liked Vinny. He was measured, articulate and a rational person, I even bought CVC on ICO (I got rid of it at a nice profit once’s the writing was on the wall). Then he bet on centralisation, went rouge...Erik Voorheas &amp;  Wences Casares, big proponents of S2X apologised afterwards and acknowledged their shortcomings, not Vinny. At this point I had to let him go.
Vinny will feel at home with the BCash/BitmainCash camp. Make sure you know the horse your betting on. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 13:57:40
Price isn’t going up as they are buying over the counter OTC (usually from miners) &amp; since we are in a bear market demand for BTC has decreased. Consequently price appears stagnant. 
What really is going on is those OTC coins, coins that are minted every 10min have in the past gone to exchanges, supplying the ever demanding bull market, which were bought up like candy. Since 2018, this has not been the case. Consequently the exchanges have been deprived of new coins. This has created less sell pressure &amp; fewer coins to trade. So before the next halving, we will already experience a deflationary effect in the Bitcoin space.
You know what happens then....

This sub and all those invested in Bitcoin are not being petty. Bitcoin is being attacked on many fronts and Roger Ver together with his mates are attacking Bitcoin through misinformation, brand confusion, outright lies and manipulation.
Confronted with these facts, being annoyed with these shenanigans is a rather measured reaction.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Saying Bitcoin Core is even more immaculate. Particularly when u see it was Roger Ver who began referring to Bitcoin as such soon after switching to BCAsh. It’s indisputable he is using his second hand car salesman technique to confuse the populous.
Ironically, nobody is to refer to his altcoin in any other way than Bitcoin cash, whilst in his company.

Let me elaborate.
Recall when they all got declined at once?
Price just dipped, nothing spectacular either.
When it was informed SEC would review them all by an unprecedented move...price didn’t pump much. What I’m getting at is, market has pretty much priced in the decline already.
What is holding it up is Bakkt, Fidelity &amp; VanEch ETF scheduled for 29th December, which will likely be postponed, again priced in.

Oh boy...has Wence Casares lost brownie points in this community.
I used to think of him as a class-act, measured, smart &amp; patient. I don't know what they all smoked at this NYA agreement, but whatever it is, it has changed a few well respected players in this space. Look at Vinny Lingham or Erik Vorhees for that matter...

I think it's in the interest of the NYA agreement to either accept the polls or issue your own &amp; base your decisions on that. Keep those results secret if you must. So far, all polls I've come across have had an average of 75:25 as Adam Back has stated. The NYA agreement must (for it's own benefit) grasp the sentiment of the community ASAP. If it turns out to be in the region 75:25, ignore it at your own risk. The damage this contentions hard fork would cause to the community &amp; or chain/s will be challenging to predict.

Naaa....no bubble yet...look at the weekly chart on LOG scale. But, that's not to say it won't become one. 
Regardless if you compare the Crypto market cap total is just under $200B compares to the internet bubble of $6T. So if we are in a bubble, we are at the very, very early stages of one, one that to me barely if at all begun. 
If Bitcoin hold over 50% of all Crypto value &amp; we are in a bubble &amp; let's say the bubble top is half of that of the internet, that would mean $1.5Bmarket cap for Bitcoin  (which I personally think would actually be greater since). What would the price of 1BTC be?

Exactly, coinbase, miners &amp; payment companies...don't really care about the price of Bitcoin anywhere near as much as transaction volume...the more Bitcoin is moved around, the more they can cream off the top. Since Bitcoin is deflationary, miners feel the tx volume should be much higher. Those that hold Bitcoin are increase it's value since few people transact with it &amp; because of price increase more demand, fuelling demand &amp; price

If Fake Satoshi is a millonario it’s not because he’s Satoshi. 
Now, let’s get to the nitty gritty:
-Miners secure the network. 
 Incentive: fees per block + bitcoins per block found.
-Nodes: Validate transactions.
Incentive: keep miners honest
Remove descentralices nodes, u get a cabal of miners + very expensive centralised nodes that only a few rich can afford (again, miners).
You now have a  stripped away the one thing that makes permission-less, decentralised currency a centralised currency. Note: Jihan Wu and co, are positive to increase the issuance of BCash...just saying bois.
DYOR, read The Bitcoin Standard and stop getting blindsided by these con-artists.

Dear day traders. I've been at this for a while, one thing becomes very clear to me is shorting BTC is a very difficult thing to pull off. There is a reason why we HODL, apart from the underlying fundamentals. It pays to hodl bitcoin, this is an unpredictable beast.
Irrespective of what you do, I wish you all good luck.

Oh man, your ask for a lot. We don't even know what's gonna happen come first of August, let alone what will happen in November...
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:31:58
I've been in this for several years now. I would advice you to do your homework first, buy on DCA (dollar cost average) x amount of dollars worth of Bitcoin per week, or month.
I would advice anyone getting in now, to perhaps wait till after the dust has settled around the first/second week of August since we have a FUD coin named Bitcoin Cash forking. I'm guessing this will create some volatility to Bitcoin price and although this can present itself as an opportunity; as your getting started, you don't need to get caught-up with this mess right off the cuff. So wait it out and buy the dip on DCA.
Good luck from a HODLER

We deserve whats coming!
BTC should not have a centralised mining cartel that claims "We want to buy a fucking latte with BTC, but because of Core, it's too expensive, so we cant". 
When in fact it's because of Core SW, the latte would be "unfairly cheap"  for miners to buy a latte. a.k.a: greed.
Wake up gents, I don't care about the politics, I care we scale this baby for the world and to the moon. 
Don't you?

@_date: 2017-07-12 20:02:21
I can only hope they Fork-off on the 1st of August with that ABC.
What would happen is the value chain, that is economical majority &amp; dev team (core) will remain largely intact, thus removing all the toxic mumbo-jumbo from the usual suspects.They will unlikely have the same influence over bitcoin, as they will have breached the NYA agreement &amp; they can implement any code they want of the ChinaCoin.
Wish them luck.

If I own 1 bitcoin &amp; that coin doubles x amount of times per year. 
Why on earth would I want to spend it?
Why should I care it costs $1000 to send? 
My value increases exponentially &amp; so does the miners profits.
As Bitcoin is finite, this will pressure Bitcoin upwards as more &amp; more people will be willing to pay more for them.
Just a holders humble thought
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:37:44
Got it now!
U should give the security of your coins the same amount of thought as it’s value.
Actually no, when I first got in, I did the -don’t put more money in they u can afford to lose.
Well, the tables have now turned, my early investment is what I can’t afford to lose so I get the best wallet I can afford. 
I advice everyone to get the best wallets they can afford. If u can only afford paper wallets, then split ur coins into several paper wallets &amp; place them in several safe places. 
What u don’t do is leave them on exchanges. Not your keys, not your coins!!!

-If demand is equal to supply, then no price deviation.
-If demand is less than supply, price depreciation.
-if demand is greater than supply (in this case I’m referring to the halving event) price increases and then we get the FOMOS...which then magnify the shortage of coins on sale causing the bubble.
LSB stands for -Lambos, strippers &amp; Blow.

The year prior to the halving is ideal as we anticipate (those already in crypto) the event. As for the bull run after halving is simply supply demand imbalance. Bull runs should be big as the supply is literally cut in half &amp; the demand is the same as prior but because us humans only buy when it’s going parabolic, then the demand exponentially outstrips the already reduced supply causing the inevitable effect. 
Demand = supply  price 0
Demand &lt; supply  price -1
Demand  &gt; supply price +1
Demand &gt; supply + FOMO = LSB

I think Core needs to stay. Proven track record, flawless code &amp; creators of Segwit. The reason the miners are against it, it's because power is rested away from miners. The power to centralise fees &amp; manipulate price. Hence the resistance from miners &amp; of course Jihad Wu.

I got into Bitcoin because of store of value &amp; decentralisation. After following the scaling saga &amp; what the largest manufacturer has attempted to do overtly &amp; covertly, I find no value in providing the mining community any further concessions. They have &amp; are stifling the development of the project for reasons I will claim not to know of. Ironically, it is the miners that benefit exclusively from higher fees, coupled with the fact it appears AsicBoost might be in play which make the tx fees even more costly as full blocks must be avoided creating a larger backlog.
SegWit has proven so far it does what it says on the tin @ litcoin.
Order of scaling is simple to me:
1. SegWit (it's ready &amp; tested)
2. AsicBoost killed
3. Development &amp; testing HF to 2mb. Activation kicks in after an average block size threshold has been met. 
I have done C++ but nothing at this advance level. One thing I can take from my knowledge is in terms code you really want to take your time &amp; have the best team around you. Listen to the experts, just like when you go to the doctor, by all means get a second opinion, third.
Whatever you do, don't listen to people that are not educated for advice on your health or the health of your value...Bitcoin.

Miners don't want Core, it is that simple.
They need someone they can influence, that they can negotiate with, the Core mandate is simply decentralisation, which for influential reasons, does not sit well with certain groups &amp; not only miners.
I personally believe Core MUST stay as the reference client. They won't get a an A+ for social skills nor do we need them to be. You know you get the very best of the best in coding &amp; decentralisation. I know an awful lot of people in BTC for that reason, because of Core, if they get pushed out...well, don't want to FUD, I lot of early adopters will cash-out. It's not for any other reason than for the fundamental reasons of decentralisation &amp; the quality of products. Would you entrust the life of your loved one with an inexperienced surgeon?
