Hmmm, I live in northern Europe so not really sure what you're getting at here. Anyone who's ever dabbled in some form of pop culture (and wasn't raised by wolves) has probably heard of it (*e.g.* "nasty craig's list hookups" etc).

+1, underrated post.
@_date: 2015-12-09 10:16:58
Lol, what's there to get.

Seriously, what's wrong with this guy? He's acting like someone who's just had a mental breakdown from too much *PhDing*.

Holy shit though, gotta admit that this title is pretty fucking hilarious.

Would someone shut this whiny autistic manchild up already?

To be fair, it was their decision to make it not-so-simple. Could've been done in a much shorter way.
@_date: 2016-01-14 10:09:52
LOL, noone mentioned anything about big/small blocks in this thread. You cooking?
@_date: 2016-01-29 10:50:09
Lol, whoever thinks of these stupid names. Always makes me wonder.

Oh boy, you are so going to get minced for this.

Hey everybody, I found the millenial. Becuase that's totally Jackass's signature joke.

He probably thinks he's being super stealthy by outsmarting our 'top secret keyword detection module', which we obviously have, since we are both mere bots.
@_date: 2015-11-09 11:40:23
Yeah... if you fancy baskets made out of egg scramblers.
@_date: 2015-11-09 11:26:42
Yeah -- was thinking the same thing, *i.e.* whether it's that lying-stealing azn dude. Interesting that they would emphasize his "fame".
@_date: 2015-11-09 11:31:30
Noone cares about your shitty forum.

Go kiss Luke-Jr's holy butt some more.

Which is so original and unique that it was totally made up by them. /s
Fishslapping is one of the signature jokes from Monthy Python's Flying Circus.

Didn't the ZeroHedge guy(s) used to have a 'tulip bulb' attitude towards Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:32:58
Agreed, at least the scammers &amp; fraudsters have a place to congregate. Now if only we could get the shitcoin pushers to migrate there as well.

Nah, don't thank him. Go on gloating about your vast knowledge of life, the universe and everything. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:45:41
Lol, +1 for not getting salty about it. Was expecting at least a couple of Hail Marys.

That would be Bitcoinity, and those gifs have recently started reappearing again.
