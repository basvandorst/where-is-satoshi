get ready for the next mega dump that's gonna break your heart so bad you gonna hate bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-08 22:06:39
Bitcoin was the best get rich investment in the last ten years... lol
@_date: 2019-10-25 07:11:04
There are millions of ''investors''. 99% won't touch it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:46:49
Oh... people havn't ''realized'' it's scarce yet... hmm... once they ''realize'' that this shit mined on your gigihash will enter (drumroll) ''the halvening'' they will realize how smart you were and how dumb they didn't buy earlier. What fools!
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:36:31
WHAT I WROTE: bitcoin isn't doing a 2000% move again.
WHAT PETER PAN MOONBOY READS: Bitcoin is dead. 
Get a life, I'm sure I own more bitcoin than you will ever. Doesn't mean I think it's going 2000% from her, dumbass.
@_date: 2019-10-25 09:35:26
Comments like yours only validate my point more lol. You are in fact, probably the new one. But you probably consider yourself ''OG'' because you bought in 2017, like my grand mother. Look at your handle, pure delusional. 
It also seems you also spend most of your time on reddit in some pathetic diatribe of rants, trying to convince the 99% of world ''they just don't get'' because they're not as smart as you. Listen, I already bought at $300, sold some, made money, had epic times. It's the new peter pan moonboys like you I'm concerned about.Unless bitcoin goes below $300 I'm still in UP, bro.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:25:07
FUD = possible bearish sentiment. Got it. Have faith friend, it's obvious 99,9% of the world just isn't as smart as you to buy bitcoin after the mega pump to 20k.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:23:14
Typical, overplayed bitcoin arguments. MOST countries in the west have a very stable currency, and nobody with their head screwed on right would place all their hope in something that's essentially a big gamble hoping the ''system fails''. Most people in these broke countries don't have money to move bitcoin anyway. Can you actually name ''a dozen'' (you implied multiple dozens) countries that are ''losing control'' of their currency? I can, off the top of my head, think of about 3 or 4...
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:50:17
true :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:50:08
And assuming if the price change radically because sellers raised their prices? Sellers would dump just as fast as that scenario would pump.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:27:25
Of course man, it's the only reason any rational personal could disagree with bullish sentiment, or people just don't get it because they're too stupid ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:44:40


Just looked.. don't see double digit inflation. Pretty stable actually for the last year. Can you explain?
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:36:50
Who isn't a scam artist in crypto haha? Everyone is like some cartoon yogi bear trying to sell everyone a quick dream! ;)

Everything aside, I think Richard Heart is hella dope haha :D
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:03:01
Oh buddy.... tell yourself whatever you like. I already lived through two pumps. I can tell my children stories of the golden age of crypto. I'm not here to say ''I have more bitcoin or whatever'' or call me ''no-coiner'', that's so lame... seriously. And who said I sold btc? I was buying since $300. Yes, tell yourself ''I'm lying'' if that makes you and you 0,385 bitcoin dream feel better, bro.
And if $7k is blood in the street for you, it seems you've made some risky decisions in life. Good luck! But don't worry, it's obviously gonna be $50k MINIMUM in 12 months max! ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:55:23
Ok, maybe I went a bit far. It's because I care about bitcoin, not because I hate it. But be real man, isn't it refreshing to test your thinking on the potential negative side. If you ONLY keep telling yourself positive things it's intellectually dishonest imo. I'm sick of seeing posts about HODL and people convincing their grandparents to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:17:07
No, teach me great wise man! Your knowledge of market cap is amazing!
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:44:13
Yes, my hands where weak at $20k and I sold them to a ''strong person'' ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:04:27
Sure... any day now...
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:11:18
Anyone who is certain of something will probably get REKT BAD
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:21:56
As long as you are ok that 0.25btc might drop by 80% regarding BUYING POWER then sure, 0.25 will always be 0.25btc. That doesn't mean the price will go up though LOL
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:56:30
You call $7k blood in streets?! :D hehe you must be new around these parts ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:34:08
Sure... I just made it up! Great! Tell yourself whatever makes you sleep well! Guess you're just so smart and always a step ahead of everyone ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:37:39
Dude, everyone KNOWS the fed is BS, I never defended them.95% of people in the bitcoin space just repeats the same handful of argument they have been handed. FED, MATH, SCARCITY! They chant it like some mantra to sleep at night. Reality? Most people still won't touch bitcoin, sadly, because most people don't give a crap HOW MUCH money the fed prints as long as they can watch survivor island and eat a burger tonight.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:47:06
Because I was NEVER discussing bitcoin tech, I said it was SOLID. I don't need to discuss the ''underlying tech'' because I understood in 2012
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:28:57
who the hell is gonna pay $50k for a bitcoin? YOU? Nooo... you're too smart, you're waiting for those suckers ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:49:14
Great comment, I agree :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:14:38
Maybe not perfectly, I never studied financial markets really, can you explain it please?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:10:45
Maybe you should read what I wrote. I believe in bitcoin. And yes, most people here are new lol. Do you know how big this reddit was in 2013? I bet my nutsack you dont! OBVIOUSLY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HERE ARE NOT LONG TIME HODLERS LOL :D WTF you think MOST people here are hodler from before 2013? You are fcking delusional man.
Oh wait, you probably bought bitcoin somewhere in or after 2017 and that makes you a ''long time hodler'' hahahah that's classssic
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:42:49
Cool, so you would be fine if one bitcoin = $50? OH WAIT, correction: THAT isn't possible. The lowest POSSIBLE low is $5k right? ;)
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:23:38
Ok, bro.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:15:15
I honesty hope you are right.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:49:28
You mean a post that isn't super bullish? Haha, most of your comments are only proving my point.
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:51:40
Except that baby is at least twice as smart as the average person here ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:22:05
Exactly my friend. These broke ass losers with a dream and 0.0865 aint taking us to the moon :(
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:56:52
I bet you've lost money in bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:15:33
I'm calling anyone who doesn't ONLY see MEGA bull predictions as accurate reasonable.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:13:38
This is a voice of reason, thanks. Unlike others calling me ''no-coiner'' ''stupid opinion'' etc. BTW I've heard about the book, I should try get a copy :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:32:56
That's exactly my point. And the fact that I'm still saying it's possible to hit 100k and people and people are STILL hating me for ''being a bear'', a ''no-coiner'' or whatever names are thrown about. They believe they are on a rocket ship to 100k and beyond and if you don't get on-board then ''you just don't get it'' as many have told me, even though I said I hold bitcoin. 
Man, saying anything bearish is like going against a pack of wild dogs with rabies around here :D
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:33:59
OH! HAHA that's sooo funny! Why invest in bitcoin when you can become a millionaire from you comedy?! Looking at your account, it seems the only thing you do is lurk r/bitcoin and post all day about it. Guess you're, an ''expert'' ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:20:21
Haha :) Imagine that...
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:31:01
He really ''thought'' you about money. Yip, this is why I'm bearish on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:14:37
 That's for sure, bro! Moon incoming!
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:12:28
Soo... you are spending bitcoin every day? You don't care that it might be worth 15% more or less in 24 hrs? Doesn't matter at all the price right? Just keep  throwing at it and 1btc = 1btc = $1000 or = $100  and you still ''in it for the tech'', right? ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:26:24
Of course, nobody in the world knows what they are talking about except the people on r/bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:09:25
I still hodl bitcoin, I believe the tech is sound. I would love nothing more than this post to be proven badly wrong very soon. But I'm just being real here and stating how I see the game atm. I was waaay more bullish buying btc at 300usd, I just don't have that feeling anymore. Things feel... saturated...
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:49:55
It's like, math and shit, bro!
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:30:55
You honestly believe the average hopium meme peddling moonboy in here is as mature as you? And I was referring to the youtube result for typing ''bitcoin'' if you read my comment...
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:30:25
I love how all these people living paycheck to paycheck with 0.347btc and 200usd in savings are SOOO worried about their ''portfolio'' HAHAHAHA :'D
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:56:35
The ATH market cap was something like 270 billion? But hey, I'm not a financial expert like you right ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:23:52
You realize that I would, for obvious reasons, not use my account from back then. You probably didn't realize that, you don't know what it feel like to hold bitcion 5 years+, you only know hipium, memes and having the market crap on your head.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:34:10


I have no idea...
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:26:43
Obviously, the rest of the world isn't buying bitcoin because they are just not quite as smart as you, but one day they will all see the light aaand... take their money to buy bitcoin... because... err... its... scarce!
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:04:59
I watched this video when it was released, before everyone heard of bitcoin. Now, even my granny heard of it. That's the difference... anyway.. I guess everyone will start buying again once they realize the halving took place... they're just... not as smart as you.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:43:44
Where did I go bonkers? I never once attacked bitcoin, I was critiquing the scene of perma bulls.
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:54:29
Yes buddy, let's see how excited you are when we drop to $1k ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:50:41
As if you bought bitcoin at $4 usd lol
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:43:35


Nice point, loving your arguments, you just made me bullish.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:48:40
You are one of the more switched on people in here then. This was more or less my argument I alluded to in the post from a few months ago.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:48:13
I have no idea and I don't invest in Hex. Meh...if he makes money off a bunch of losers put more than they can afford into a get rich quick scheme then good on him.

Man dude! :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:28:52
ALWAYS ;)

NPC confirmed
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:51:08
Holy crap, you mean there is roughly 2% inflation per year!? Oh damn, only the people on r/bitcoin know this secret! Go burry your money in bitcoin -it could be worth 90% less in 6 months! OH WAIT - MY BAD -  I FORGOT CRUCIAL REDDIT ADVICE - ZOOM OUT. Ok, it makes sense now, bitcoin will be one million in four years! Yaaay!
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:23:02
''Tech savy'' but didn't buy bitcoin in 2013. Hehehe... you sound more like a technophobe who just got a dose of FOMO...
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:52:53
Because mate, those people are, whether you like it or not, in the spotlight of the scene, same as youtube videos -they reflect the culture. Unless you believe secretly ''institutional money'' is just waiting, getting ready to buy, which I don't believe.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:32:59
No, bro! $50K and Labos for the smart people!
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:58:16
Ok, bro.
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:37:12
Maybe 99% of the world is smarter than you. I bet you won't be grinning then lol
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:10:30
Sure, bro, 99,99% of the world just isn't as smart as you! ;)
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:47:33
Indeed, but the price is arguably rigged? PS I'm not saying ''THIS IS 100% FACT but I have to say the video made me think about it deeply. Sure, they move the market in whatever direction they like if the theory in this video proves true -and the futures seems to work as described. If this continues, it does not concern you that the real demand in bitcoin might not be reflected by the general public, but a cartel of stupidly rich people who can trade it in any direction without ever opening a bitcoin wallet? I'm looking for a smarter guy in here to tell me why this won't work -trust me, I want the best for bitcoin and not pushing any other coin. To me, it's basically bitcoin or die and that's why this concerns me. According to some gold bugs (not sure how true it is) the gold price is already rigged. It has been suppressed for years. I'm curious if you watched the whole video?
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:02:03
dude, did you watch the video? Rather than call me clueless tell me how the theory in this video is clueless. I'm looking for answers from people who can shed light, not demean others.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:44:31
is it that hard to believe? I'm a 30- something guy who's been around tech for a while. Unless you've been living under a rock you would have heard about bitcoin at least 8 years ago.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:56:40
Well, I believe it might have been alluded to in the article that enough short selling would also squeeze out miners because it won't be profitable for them to continue burning electricity.  
I agree 100% that in theory bitcoin is scarce commodity and that's what is so eloquent and beautiful and why satoshi was a genius. Overall, bitcoin held is bitcoin held, but, as I was in the beginning, do not take the ideas in the video lightly. 
There are some good points, and evidence. We already don't fully trust the system, so that's why we turned to bitcoin. It's not that difficult to the powerful, rich elite cartel of government / wall street thugs who've caught wind of our little experiment and are taking every turn to rig this market in their favor. Far out, perhaps, but I wouldn't be surprised.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:00:44
dude, whatever. I'm not here to please your oxford standard, or bicker. Have a great day. Good luck with your 0,347 bitcoin and dream of being a millionaire ;)
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:59:58
I'm not very familiar with trading futures, since I've never actually traded futures. I'm hoping some people on here can guide my understanding in this more in this area. I want to understand this as best I can so hopefully some futures traders on here can tell more.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:06:26
The miners lose.
