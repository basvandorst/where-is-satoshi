it should show the contents of the trailer as the transactions. bcash would have a bigger trailer than bitcoin but everyone is still using Bitcoin. In the long run, or even short term, 8mb is not a meaningful scaling solution. btc can do about 500k tx/day max bcash could do 3-4mil tx/day theoretically

I would stop talking to people you know about BTC at this point. Unless someone else expresses interest independently and just has questions, It's not worth it &amp; in a few years you'll be glad you kept your mouth shut. It's not worth being known as "the bitcoin guy" to almost everyone trust me. Also grandiose claims without specifics don't really help. Don't oversell it (even andreas antonopolous is guilty of this, back in 2012 he says "BTC is free and instant!".couple years later..."so it's not actually free or instant but..."), It might make sense to you because you've probably spent a ridiculous amount of time looking into this - but to most people who only hear about BTC in passing it makes you kind of look like someone who drank too much of the cool-aid and is just trying to reel more people in. promises of "financial freedom" are a hallmark of many scams so it's not the best look to frame it that way imo.

If you're a *good* trader, you will make more than a hodler. thats an important distinction, i don't mean to paint riding the volatile crypto waves as a walk in the park, it's not easy to be a *good* trader. it is very easy to be a good hodler.
I guess it's necessary for me to clear up that I mean trading with the goal of accumulating more BTC or crypto in general, not fiat. You may be down in fiat at times because BTC goes down but still have more BTC/crypto than you began with.
As for you example with the XLM guy, it depends on when he exits. and when he entered the trade. two unknown variables in the example you gave. A good trader is someone who can enter and exit a position profitably more than 50% of the time, and end up with more BTC/Crypto than they started with.

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:34:40
Yeah was kind of a shitty realization actually once I understood just how little transactions Bitcoin can do in a day before blocks are full. It's crazy. There are so many people around the world buying and trying to use bitcoin right now, millions of people. tens of millions probably. And bitcoin can't even handle 1 million tx/day. blocks are full at around 500k-600k tx/day...
Also the main problem with a blocksize increase is it's not backwards compatible with nodes that didn't update, therefore requires a hardfork. this is why segwit being opt in is so important i realized a couple weeks ago as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:45:46
The only hope for bitcoin scaling to compete with fiat and visa/MasterCard is off chain scaling solutions such an lightening network. We will have to wait and see how long this tech takes to securely build and implement but there are people working very hard on it right now. For bitcoin to scale onchain blocks would need to be about 100gb-1tb instead of 1mb, it’s not possible from a technical reality perspective. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:31:28
133mb blocks? linky that LN paper? from what i understand We would need far far far bigger blocks than that.... at 1mb we can do about 2-3 tx/s. We need like terabyte block sizes to truly scale to global mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:52
wtf are you talking about everything is dropping low, everything is pumped so fucking hard right now. there were like 10 altcoins that did 10x this week, and btc is down what, 20 percent?

sure we can. we just need 1-10tb blocksizes. easy peasy
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:36:49
As long as you keep it on the exchange the whole time you're fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:15:22
Monero is good for privacy but has even worse scaling issues than bitcoin or litecoin.
Litecoin is like bitcoin cash, block sizes are bigger so you could fit more tx in a block. they differ though in that LTC has 2.5min confirmation times with bitcoin cash in 10 min confirmation times. 
So yes litecoin does not have as many tx performed on it (though it has been risiing significantly lately), but theoretically it could handle about 4x the tx volume that bitcoin can. so ltc blocks would start getting full and tx fees expensive at around 2million tx/day for Litecoin. it does around 100-200k tx per day right now. 
The only coins that can support very very high tx volumes are proof of stake coins i believe, which are fundamentally very different than a proof of work coin. not sure how i feel about proof of stake at the moment. 
The best we can do at the moment is have a handful of reliable coins to use when blocks get full on a particular chain. and wait for second layer solutions.
Bitcoin cash plan is to eventually raise blocksize to 1gb plus to attempt to handle all tx volume on chain. meaning they'd have to add a Terabyte hard drive to their set up every week. I for one feel like 1gb blocksize is probably unfeasible from a tech standpoint but some people are swearing that it is doable even right now.

@_date: 2017-12-26 01:07:00
Yeah totally. I actually think Bcash argument is worse because it was a hardfork of bitcoin. That makes it even shittier than altcoin imo lol. 
hopefully by 2020 we will have some good scaling solutions : ) looking forward to second layer on btc and ltc and what Eth will have in the coming years. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:50:12
That's where Litecoin shines imo. It didn't just magically get added to all these fiat on and off ramps. LTC is like the only reliable and usable decentralized coin left on the major fiat exchanges. ETH is somewhat reliable but has its moments. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:31:18
It's cheaper because it's blocks are not full. I believe it could also handle about 4x the throughput but still that would not be enough to handle mass adoption imo. Bitcoin can only handle about 600,000-700,000tx per day right now so when blocks are totally full on BTC there are loads of unconfirmed tx and people pay high fees to get included in a block quicker. If LTC shot to $10,000 tomorrow and there were over 1,000,000 tx per day I think it would face similar scaling issues that BTC is seeing now. seems to be just a technical reality of decentralized blockchains. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:44
is that why my bitcoin node got to 25% in one day then stalled and never got past 35% for the next two weeks? I feel like they started throttling my internet or something.

rest of the video?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:58:35
I like this trend comparison
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:14:12
I've been saying this for a few weeks now once I realized it. If BTC were to scale to visa/mastercard levels (peak capacity around 100,000 tx/s) onchain blocksize would need to be about 50-100gb. thats 5000 to 10000x what it is now. 
At 1mb BTC can only do abut 2-3 tx/s so if we raise blocksize to 8mb like bcash just did that means it can do about 15-25tx/s max before blocks are full. even if blocks were 1000x bigger than they are now, it would not even come close to being able to scale to visa/mastercard levels. How many of us have tried running a full bitcoin node? Even at 1mb it is a pain in the ass (I actually gave up on mine after a month of syncing and my ISP clearly throttling my bandwidth), 8mb requires thousands of dollars per year and extremely fast reliable internet. imagine what a 10 or 50 or 100gb block size would require. scaling onchain in a really meaningful way with a decentralized proof of work system is unfeasible from technological reality standpoint it seems. 
Layer two solutions seem to be the only hope in scaling beyond high fees and at most 30 tx/s.
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:19:56
not bad!
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:04:16
The second point you made is wrong.
1mb blocksize BTC has full blocks at around 400-600k tx/day
8mb blocksize btc would have full blocks at around 3.2-4m tx/day. 
bcash would start getting expensive and slow in that upper range, not at 400k tx/day. And im no bcash shill... just objective observation...
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:12:52
this is right?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:06:46
well when you think about it 1m tx/day vs 500k tx/day is not really a big difference. There is no decentralized proof of work crypto currency that can scale in any meaningful way right now. they are all slow an inefficient by design
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:34:53
A blocksize increase that is not opt in like segwit would require a hardfork because the update is not backwards compatiable to nodes that did not update. scaling through blocksize increase is not sustainable. Bitcoin can do about 2-3tx/s at 1mb, 15-25 at 8mb. We need literally terabyte size block sizes to truly scale to global mass adoption on chain. This is not possible from a technological reality perspective at the moment. even 8mb blocks makes running a node cost thousands of dollars a year. 
edit- sorry so it doesn't cost thousands of dollars to run a bitcoin cash node. Not yet at least : P That is inevitably what will happen if they continue to increase blocksize as they intend. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:37:18
it still can't even do more than 1million tx per day without blocks being full though. 
There is no decentralized POW cryptocurrency that can meaningfully scale in any way on chain. 
even 8mb is not even close to enough and requires a hardfork since blocksize increase is not backwards compatiable to nodes who did not update. thats why segwit being opt in is pretty important.

Another way of looking at going all in on risky investments is that it can either make you or break you. For most, putting only 1-5% of their networth into something that goes up 50x won't change their life really. People who go all in deserve whatever they get. If you are willing to lose it all to 50x your networth and it works out, that's awesome i mean you risked literally everything... If you're willing to lose it all to 50x your networth and it doesnt work out, also great you knew this was the risk beforehand. I would just make sure the upside is really worth it (like don't go all in on herbalife or some shit) and the other thing is that this method is probably only realistic to like 5% of the population, most people should never do it. If you are a young man or woman who doesnt have a lot or any financial obligations like debt mortgage house kids etc, these people are in a much safer place to pretty much risk everything for bigger gains. You have a lot less to lose and a lot more time to just work back whatever money you lost, sure it would suck if you lost everything and had to start over but thats pretty much the level of risk any person takes who end up making life changing amounts of money very quickly. There is definitely not a one size fits all solution how people should save and invest their money, it really depends on their over all situation and the level of risk they are comfortable taking on. But yeah many people who would qualify in that 5% who have no financial obligations rightfully would still not feel comfortable just risking it all, realistically only a very small amount of people would probably feel comfortable doing this and i say if they want to do that more power to them. but it would be pretty irresponsible for people who can't really afford to lose everything due to being in a lot of debt already or having to take care of kids and what not.

Imagine the first small BTC in the cartoon as year 2011 when the market cap was less than $100million usd &amp; there weren't really any altcoins. Today even though historically speaking the btc dominance is very low the immense amount of interest for altcoins has turned BTC marketcap into a behemoth that cannot be ignored (from $100million to $200billion in 6 years...)  I don't see it necessarily as BTC giving birth (other than to LTC and shitting out BCH) but that XMR &amp; ETH &amp; EOS developed separately &amp; a lot of their capital naturally flowed into BTC. Also BTC may be able to implement all of the tech these altcoins are experimenting with one day through side chains and second layer. Not saying that's gonna happen any time soon but it's in the realm of possibility. I know for sure all the hackers who are sitting on thousands of btc stolen from exchanges that they won't move are hoping privacy features at least come to BTC as soon as possible : P

supply and demand. Instead of 12.5 new btc being created every 10 mins there will be 6.25 new btc being created every 10 minutes and miners will be using the same probably more energy to do it. In an environment where there is still demand or more demand for BTC , and now there is less new supply coming into the market this will naturally make the price go up. We are still pretty early in the supply of BTC but as you can look forward by year 2032 all the miners around the world will only get 0.78125BTC every 10 minutes. At this point most BTC will have been mined, So mos demand has to come from the supply that is already there. And if there is still like a billion dollar industry using 1% of global electricity for only 112.32BTC a day (and tx fees)... Damn.

This has been a pretty disheartening feature of the exponential growth of bitcoin to me over the years, wealth distribution, that the people who just happened to know about it before most everyone else are imho rewarded far too much. it does seem to be kind of conflicting with the whole wealth distribution argument. sometimes, especially at this point of volume, it sometimes feels like the newcomers are just giving more money to early adopters and the day traders. i know thats not the whole case but it just feels like this sometimes. there are still many early adopters who paid very little for few thousand btc able to sway the market a lot if they wanted to.

Honestly, I feel secure enough, and have never had problems using blockchain.info with only a primary password and secondary password. Never access it thru tor. never registered a wallet to an email account. just save the wallet identifier and your login and withdraw password on an offline application on your computer (maybe encrypt that info if you're paranoid). 
So again, i have never lost coins with blockchain.info with this recipe.
1. Use clearnet only while accessing wallets
2. Use at least a 16 character random primary password
3. Use at least a 16 character random secondary password
4. Then save your wallet identifier and passwords in an offline application. (Definitely keep backups of the login and withdrawl info on other harddrives as well)
5. No 2FA or Email registering needed. 
It is stupidly simple compared to the other complicated ways i see people trying to store their coins.

Like i unfortunately subscribed to kitco news on youtube and the daily videos they come out with are so repetitive and useless, i imagine there are thousands of examples like this in financial markets. you can get sucked into it or just look at the big picture, i think the latter is a better financial choice of course ; )

i get calls from my bank when i buy stuff on euro denominated websites from the US. pretty much every time i buy something from a euro website my card gets shut down temporarily until i get ahold of them and tell them that it is actually me using the card at this or that place. thats a big difference about bitcoin and banks. in some cases them shutting down my card and calling me is good but its mostly just been annoying so far. just give them a call back and see what they say, they are probably just wanting to make sure it is you and not someone else doing the transactions. then again i know nothing about SVB
good luck

after each one of those dips it appreciated about 25 percent each time though so you had the opportunity to realize gains all the way down. try doing that next time my man. and what did you expect? bitcoin hits a ridiculous never thought we could make it $1000/ath and it starts correcting and you think it will go back up right away within a few months? being present for 2 out of the 3 bubbles i expected it to atleast be half of its ath and it has done just that. chilling out around half its ath +-20 percent. thats what it did in the last bubble too. tho i do sympathize with your red candles bro. sorry about all your negative friends and stuff!

coinbase charges 1 percent fee plus 5 dollars thats why you are charged more. bitinstant which was also a convenient service (that you could only do $500 a day with) charged 5 percent. localbitcoin people these days are typically charging 10 percent which is crazy but there is a small market there for that. 
edit-Oh but i see you are just talking about the price changing quickly. Pretty sure that is just the internal exchange price changing really quickly, it doesnt seem to refresh as quick on the web interface especially on the top right corner

what if you just enable a second very complex password for sending funds out of the account. so even if they get the first password they need the second one to send anything out of it. unless they somehow know that one too. but in that case, you'd think they'd know your password to your email as well and just authorize from there. 2FA does not seem totally secure

ive always thought it to be kind of a questionable stretch to compare horizontal and vertical gene transfer and say they are basically the same thing with the same outcome. One of those takes generations and generations of hand picked natural breeding of the most resistant plants out of all the ones planted, The new modern way is to just simply change the gene structure in a lab, while most of the fear i always thought is that some of the genes that are being genetically modified into plant cells are toxic (e-coli) and thats why you dont have to use pesticides as much because the plant itself is basically toxic to much of the natural environment.  meanwhile the massive monocultures of these plants, GMO or not, are also terrible for the natural ecosystem. to destroy a whole ecosystem to toss some tiny seeds on bare dirt EVERY YEAR is not smart.  monoculture is necessary to point but not to the point it is abused today. 
like that video of neil degrasse tyson, im a little baffled how even he can compare those two gene transfers and say they will have the same outcome with no evidence (besides maybe the last 15 years of gmo use, on mostly americans) to back it up. people always say we have been messing with plant genes for thousands of years.... while that is true, we had not been doing it in a lab speeding up the natural process 10000x and it seems a bit silly to call those two things the same thing.

i wish i would have realized this more in my early days of dozens of trips to my local cvs... kinda funny thinking about it i remember after like the 8th time the cashier asked me if i was buying bitcoin (since it was always going thru zip zap), turns out his brother was a miner in early days and sold all his bitcoin (this was before 2nd bubble), all the cashier had to say was that i should sell as soon as i turn any profit and not to hold on to them "kuz you never know"... i wonder where he is now and if he remembers the guy who came in like 30 times to buy bitcoin. if he remembers he probably thinks im rich now, but if you are reading this cvs dude, i am not because i took you and your brothers stupid advice!
cheers. desperate times, not enough blood though. decent time to buy. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:23:44

I dont know if you really know what you are doing and have half a million dollars to spend on a farm that you can get up and running within weeks im sure you could make a significant difference. that said its not necessarily too late. Though it is past the days of investing hundreds of dollars in hardware to mine and secure the network.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:31:46
small volume on exchanges. more selling than buying. large whales hopefully taking profits and letting their bitcoin flow to a new larger breed of investors. this will be the longest phase imo between bubbles (if there will be another) since there are still many people who own a few thousand btc with the ability to move the market at their will. 
though there is enormous buying pressure below 300 dollars. 
Quite a lot of money has to come into the bitcon space to even keep up with all the new bitcoins mined. 3600 new ones every day or so? thats 1.35million new fiat a day just to keep the price stable at 375. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:50:27

you need to relax my man. You decided to join at the peak of one of THREE bubbles that has already happened. did you really think it would break thru its ATH within 6 months?? i mean heck, inbetween the 1st and second bubble there was more than a year of time where btc was just going up and down not doing much like it is now. this stage especially will take a long time if it gets thru it even. btc is not little anymore, $100s of millions is nothing compared to the $10s of billions it will take to get btc to appreciate now. why do you listen to your friends and family negative perspectives on bitcoin so much anyways?? just tell them its a speculative and volatile currency, if you don't admit to these things you are drinking the cool-aid anyways. there have been many opportunites since Nov 2013, even if btc hasnt gone to the moon lately to buy and sell and be profitable. or to buy bitcoin and buy something with it while you are in the black. the average joe just wants their dollar to always be a dollar, and not 5 dollars or 50 cents.

It's not photoshopped you can check for yourself. As long as you are running their new "labs" interface or whatever. I dont really have anything against grubhub (or bitcoin) I just noticed this when I was on their website today. I'm a little surprised this has made it to the top of r/bitcoin...its not that interesting imo. They probably mention it partly because people have been asking them since 2012 to accept it. IIRC there are multiple threads about getting grubhub to accept bitcoin on here. foodler&amp;bitcoin are available in my city with  all the same restaurants grubhub has. Even if grubhub were to accept bitcoin it probably wouldn't make much of a difference.

"I sold 15,000 BTC on Bitcoin Market for ~0.003 USD: the all-time low on any market, AFAIK. I had measured my power consumption and determined that it only cost me ~0.001 BTC to make one BTC, so I thought 0.003 was a good profit margin. I knew the price would rise over time due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, but I didn't think it would happen so suddenly."

@_date: 2014-09-30 01:20:00
sounds like an issue from your banks side. they must have limits for online transfers like you said. do you think this is exclusive to bitcoin transfers or do they block transactions for things besides bitcoin also over the "online transfer limit". i guess you'd have to make smaller deposits. banks dont want you to take all your money out of there right away, especially if you are just using a bank to turn your fiat into btc ; )

bitinstant was available in the US since 2011, which basically was just a moneygram with cash at cvs/walmart etc. Not exactly extremely difficult imo.

LOL. Such massive risk investing money you are prepared to lose anyways? many investors have 10s of thousands lying around they are prepared to lose on a dime. just like the other guy said investing in bitcoin and reaping 30,000% profit is "strong and bold" haha. its honestly not. oh you happened to be privy to information about a brand new technology almost nobody has heard of at the beginning and how to obtain it? such insight, such hard work? theres not much hard work if any, and a lot less learning than if you actually had to work for your money in a skilled environment. im not whining, im not even saying i missed out completely on the last few bubbles as both of you assume. I am just questioning the proportionality of wealth of all early adopters like you say, its a two way street but 1 way is making off like a bandit, making the whole thing seem a bit questionable from the outside. and of course you people will tell me "oh you'll be saying the same thing when its 50k" blah blah blah. well getting bitcoins fiat volume from 100 million dollars back in 2012 (valued around 10 dollars) to roughly 10 billion in 2013 ($1000) was really a lot more feasible than what we will need to get to 10,000 dollars per bitcoin, which is something like a 100 billion dollar market cap. where is the next 90 billion coming from my friend? the FED? goldbugs? Argentina? Africa? China?
let me stab at your last thing again.
Investing money you are prepared to lose in a volatile instrument does not directly equal massive risk. mostly because if you lost the money it wouldn't affect you anyways. Massive risk would be more like trying to start a peice of shit multimillion dollar business all on bank loan, or trying to jump a 15 foot gap with a 2000ft drop below you. that is massive risk. you are just justifying your greed, its normal. 
Being privy to a technology before every one else is not "massive insight", seriously most people have not even heard of it, especially the ones the community touts it will help (remittances etc)
Hard work? lol. maybe for the Devs and miners and the like, but im talking pure early adopter. 
There is definitely a bit of learning involved (to secure coins correctly etc) but like i said not as much as if you actually had to work for your money, a la go to college get a degree blah blah.

I believe it's for people who want to be a part of bitcoins volatility without having to actually do anything that involves buying storing or trading bitcoin. it also opens up new ways to invest with different tax implications such as being able to buy the ETF from your 401k. Probably a couple other reasons as well, im no expert.

I think the only purpose this ATM is serving is a way to get bitcoins instantly. After circle stopped selling bitcoins instantly with debit cards there is no way to do it without signing up with an exchange, visiting an atm or a person from localbitcoins. I think people are buying bitcoin for more than the scenario you just described, that should be obvious? I mean, bitcoin is commonly called "the money of the internet" which is not too physical of a place IIRC... Of course it would be great if everywhere accepted it natively (you can still spend it everywhere with a shift card as im sure you know, just not "natively"). What is the point of gold if I can't buy food with it at the grocery store or pay my taxes with it? There is no way a currency designed like bitcoin would just be accepted by everybody everywhere only eight years into the experiment.

@_date: 2016-03-18 22:37:10
For sure. I remember the days of bitinstant where one could only buy 500 dollars worth per day with tha red phone for the same reason. I think most bank atms allow up to around 50 bills per deposit now though at least with my local bank and a few others i know of, but i feel like it can get messy. there were times where i know it didnt count everything and when i redid it it would count my extra 20 or 50 that it forgot on the first one XD baahh. I guess there used to be a btc atm at cassava cafe in chicago that did 3k per day per cell phone number at 5% and it accepted a lot of bills at a time. that was only open for like a year before it got shut down i guess, all thats open now in chicago is these shitty redleaf btc atms. who knows maybe btc will be worth 100x more than it is now like in the bitinstant days and looking back the fees wont matter with these atms LOL. doubt it 
edit- where are your atms located?

Yeah you might as well sign up for Gemini or coinbase at that point since you have to scan your id. I would have to be really desperate for instant bitcoins to get them from any bitcoin ATM in the Midwest. Its kinda cool to get the exposure but I can imagine for a first timer to see they have to pay a 200$ fee to buy 1 bitcoin may turn them off a bit. Was a little surprised to see you can buy up to 10k usd worth at these atms in Madison. Maybe it's different now but the one I tried last year in Chicago was no ID up to 500 usd a day.

bitinstant was my jam back in the day, which works just like libertyX if i understand correctly (there is no liberty x location in madison though). I actually used the CVS with bitinstant right across the street from where this new BTC ATM is like 4 years ago with only a 5 percent fee : P

That clickbait 4 bln usd number is obviously inflated. You realize they are using todays $3,500 bitcoin price for transactions in 2011-2015 when btc was still very cheap. The true figure is probably less than 100 million. Still a lot for sure but not as newsworthy sounding. Just as much "laundering" in that sense going on with any other exchange, it was just a bit more blatant on btc-e. Would KYC/AML regulations really stop the buying and selling of stolen mtgox coins? I doubt it. Mt gox coins showed up on all the exchanges, just majority of them on btc-e. Also if im understanding how the whole mtgox thing went down, it's much more likely mtgox "hack" was an inside job imo. How is it possible Mark didn't notice funds disappearing from cold wallet for *2 YEARS*. Also he didn't even password protect the cold wallet holding 800,000 bitcoins. just sounds all too convenient and suspicious to me.

It took a lot less money to crash Bitcoin back in the day. 
for example back in 2014 for bitcoin to crash 80 percent people would have to sell 8 billion usd worth of bitcoin.
now for bitcoin to crash 80 percent people would have to sell 64 billion worth
percentage wise the "crashes" corrections will get less severe as btc grows.

Any ATM that is not owned by your own bank will charge at least a 1.50 fee up to 4.00 i've seen. My bank is only in one part of the country so that kind of sucks. I just paid $5.75 to take $120 out of an ATM out of state. 3.25 atm fee and 2.50 fee from my bank. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:12:48
Sure, but if you want to take out more than like 1,000 usd per day worth of crypto you still have to do identity verification on most sites, (not bitfinex or btc-e). even if its all just crypto-crypto and no fiat is involved. are they any exchanges left that let you withdraw 100btc per day with no ID Verification? I'm not worried about sending fiat to exchange.

He had btc on bittrex during the fork. Those were the only people to be able to sell their bch. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:59:16
Do you know of any exchanges that still allow this? honestly this is why a lot of people liked btc-e and bitfinex, its incredibly convenient if you have a lot to worth with, not just for criminals. I was able to get my bittrex verified easily up to 100btc withdrawl per day but polo verification i've given up on.  what about the chinese exchanges? should i finally make an account on those, I've always been nervous doing that since the web pages need to be translated first XD

Right im aware of this it's obviously just a bit ridiculous. "quick lemme sell my position on 60 different polo accounts." lmao. Polo is 2k per day with no id verifcation, bittrex is like 750 usd per day LOL. Any exchange run in the US rapes you for your identity. this is why btc-e and bitfinex were so great. You truly had easy fast access to a global market with not alll that waiting 2 months for verification bullshit.

What's your source proving that USA is currently in control of the BTCE cold wallets? Of course im sure they would love to keep all the coins from there if they can.

I also feel this way. when I got into the community in 2012 there was way more wildly optimistic idealism. It felt like we were really onto something revolutionary here. The longer I have stuck around the more I realized 99 percent of the community is here for self gain. It's a little sad now that when i hear people talking about how btc is going to help all these third world populations and etc, &amp; I can plainly see there are zero solutions in that regard at the moment, that people are saying these things out of greed. They really don't care about people in third world countries. they mainly just want their btc to be worth more. I started my btc journey a very naive idealist, totally convinced we'd soon have our own huge bitcoin economy where people have finally decided to stop supporting the petro dollar and funding the war machine etc etc... but now I realize that idea sounds batshit insane to most people (even a lot of people involved with btc) and not to mention would be an extremely dangerous and volatile thing to attempt to do on a societal scale.

It only let you take out $100 dollars at a time and I had to pay a $3.5 fee from the atm and a $2.50 fee from my bank for using an atm not owned by them.So i ended up paying about 30 dollars in fees to withdraw 500 dollars.

Unless someone can describe a good way to launder with btc I think most people get "hiding money" and "laundering money" mixed up or they think its the same thing. BTC is indeed a great way to hide or keep value out of the traditional system, but i don't see how its a good way to pay taxes on dirty cash. The way to do that is still definitely any kind of cash business

Things to consider when thinking about the United States government specifically outright banning and or criminalizing the use of Bitcoin. 
1. They have let this thing go on for 10 years now, wouldn't they have banned it by now?
2. They have collected billions in taxes relating to crypto business &amp; have allowed billion dollar crypto companies regulated under their scrutiny to operate
3. When the Government seizes Bitcoin (for example the first silk road closure in 2013), they don't destroy it like they would anything that is illegal, they auction it off to accredited investors... 
We literally have the people who run the New York Stock Exchange looking into creating Bitcoin trading products for years while companies like Fidelity have been also actually mining BTC and ETH and accumulating crypto for years. At this point to backpeddle all this legitimatizing of the space, would do so much harm, people would lose so much money, it won't happen in the USA (maybe 0.01% chance). Of course you can't stop people from using it but if its criminalized in the USA and you go to jail or banks stop all business with exchanges and people suspected of using bitcoin it will end the experiment even if people could "technically still use it" but think how extreme that sounds, even though things aren't perfect with the govt in the USA i don't think they will do anything that extreme. like haha jk thanks for all the tax money the last decade we're just gonna erase a couple hundred bil/trillion and now tens/hundreds of millions of people are now "criminals" lol.  There are maybe a couple of people in goverment who might want to do that but those with that extreme of views (like brad sherman) are far outnumbered by reasonable people. Many politicians in the states are definitely in favor of it and most are open to it it seems. the people who are super against it seem to be in the minority. In my view they will just definitely do their best to pick the winners and losers in this whole process regarding any bitcoin related services which may be good may be bad may be both. We don't want super sketchy companies growing into trillion dollar companies but also don't want total survelliance state like super strict cant even withdraw your BTC type stuff. Next decade will be interesting that's for sure

So let me try to maybe reposition the angle you are looking at bitcoin from. So in short I got into BTC because i believe it could eventually be a demilitarized competitor to State fiat money. Many of us are very passionate about the downsides of corporate lobbying, Nation building, the military industrial complex and so on but we can't really do anything about it because we all use US dollars. If enough people choose to stop using US dollars we are essentially taking away the power at the real root. We could essentially bypass the Fiat money systems and create circular economies dealing just in crypto if we get enough people to adopt this technology but if I'm being honest that probably wont be for another 10 years at least (satoshis vision was that it would take 100 years for majority of people to adopt) and may never happen if something catastrophic happens or if USA criminalizes it etc... BTC still just barely a toddler in dev phase imo and very much a baby adoption wise. but This is also why its' interesting to note that in the ["genesis block"]( the first Bitcoin block mined by satoshi he left a message for us that is a headline from an article back then "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
have you ever sent or received crypto before? I'd be willing to send you 0.1LTC (about $5.5) if you have never had the experience, just download Loafwallet on your phone and send me your public wallet address : ) this usually helps people understand the utility a little more. As an idealistic early adopter myself I can assure you I did not get into this just to dump everything back in State fiat money. Maybe like 10-20 percent but certainly not all of it : )

With charts that have a really large range the movement in the lower range becomes invisible if it's not on the log chart. if this chart wasn't on log for example and the highest figure was 100trillion the blue bars of 38 billion to 1.2 trillion would hardly even register on the chart. you wouldn't be able to make the distinction between bitcoin or paypal or discover. 
For example look at the btc chart on log
now with regular scale
the price movement before 2014 is basically invisible with regular scale even though there was more significant price movement % wise up and down back then.
So to me in this respect there is definitely a reason to use the log scale when looking at any chart that has a really long and wide price history

Though I have no kids, house, major bills, wife, etc... Lots of time to save up money working a job before im old if this all goes south. I can take on a lot more risk than say someone living paycheck to paycheck with kids and house payments and health insurance payments and credit card debt and so on.

mining difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks based on how many people have joined or dropped off as miners so no it doesn't necessarily require more energy over time. If people drop off the network then it is using less energy for the same supply inflation if people join en masse then its using more energy, it doesn't really have an "energy requirement". with btc inflation at 1800btc per day still I think btc uses so much energy right now because there is still a lot of BTC left to mine. once most of them have been mined in 15-20 years I could see the hashrate actually start to decrease.

actually having 1800 new btc mined every day creating fresh downard pressure is A LOT different than knowing 20 years from now there will be basically no more downward pressure from new coins and any selling will have to come from supply that already exists (by year 2042 block rewards will be 14 new btc per day compared to 1800 now). it won't be truly priced in until it actually happens as is the case with any instance of changing supply and demand.

yeah i know. just emphasising that you need to have traded at all for it to be taxable, whether its fiat or crypto. some people may think they owe taxes even just for holding bitcoin because the price of it went up so much, even though they have not done anything with it. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:16:56


exactly what it sounds like. hold the bitcoin for more than one year and you sell into fiat or another crypto its considered long term capital gains, less than one year is short term capital gains. Here in the USA its about a 50% tax difference between long and short term. short term about 30-40% in usa, 10-15% for long term.

similarly how do we know they didn't pump the spot price up into the paper futures event to get the best entry?  But mostly I think the fact that at $17k per btc the amount of new supply being mined every day was worth $32million was enough to know those high prices weren't going to last long. The demand was not going to remain that high, thats more value being created than actual gold mined per day. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:32:32
Its worth pointing out the amount of money it took to crash btc price from 1200 to 130 is A LOT less than it takes now to crash a similar percentage. not sure that happened over night either, it took like a year i believe actually for the price to go from 1200 to *180. 
back then for price to crash 80 percent it took about 6 billion dollars of selling. to crash price 80 percent now it would take over 60 billion dollars of selling. We also don't have any serious setbacks like mtgox this time around.

Well I think buying btc from an exchange and holding it as savings is one definition of "being adopted and used". Of course using it to buy and sell things helps with further adoption and network effect but it's not technically making the price of it go up, especially when majority of sales sell straight back to fiat.

I think it's possible this could be more of trying to "Weed out the bad apples" like we saw with btc-e, multiple drug markets being taken down this summer, increased kyc/aml standards it seems across the board for US exchanges etc... I don't know if okcoin or huobi are actually shady but maybe because that. Also could be because so much money is flying into the crypto space this year it has grown to a point where you can not call a 150 billion usd economy a mirage anymore and they need to choke the entry points. Aware that they cannot "ban" Bitcoin since that is impossible to police anyways but the on and off ramps are the best targets.

Yes. I think thats going to be part of the pboc actions when looking into these exchanges &amp; will ultimately be good for bitcoin to get rid of the sketchy exchanges that use your money for other things while keeping it on their exchange. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:01:50
2x just doubles the block-size to 2mb, immediately. segwit is also a blocksize increase but will happen slower over time as people need to actually use segwit addresses tx for that to happen. currently i believe we are at about 5 percent segwit txs. many popular web wallets and exchanges have not implemented segwit wallets yet. ledger and trezor have already. currently ln features are being built out into user friendly apps, so it is just a matter of time before some consumer ready implementations are released. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:02:01

No where in any of the news reports implied that China is "banning bitcoin" 
From what I understand they are simply putting all exchanges on hold temporarily and shutting down the dozens of sketchy ones out of china in the process. The big ones will get a chance to prove themselves and will likely to get continue operations before the end of the year im guessing. Sounds like they just want to clean up and mature the space a bit, certainly not criminalize crypto currency. they wouldnt have exempted miners and otc trading in the meantime if they were going to ban bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not banned in Australia at all.
it just seems like gasping at straws to make this argument. Sure they could use it, but they will and do use anything whether it is nefarious or not. It's very common for terrorists groups to use non profit charities to raise money, shall we ban those? it just seems if you're going to say there needs to be a ban on crypto because it might help fund "terrorism" then you should be consistent in your reasoning and be for banning paypal, paper money, or literally anything that could help "terrorists".

lol no. we will still see like 20x return over the next 5-10 years with bitcoin i believe but you missed out on the 100-10,000x. the market cap was like 5 million usd and a few dozen people were interested back then. now the market cap is 85 BILLION.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:03:40
I'm almost convinced we won't see a significant bear market anymore as the amount of money in the bitcoin ecosystem now is so high that it would take so much more money to crash the price. for example for bitcoin to crash 80 percent now the market cap would have to drop from 75 billion to 15 billion. 
Also the fundamentals this time around are a lot more positive than the previous bull phase. We all knew mtgox was going to implode one day and having 800k bitcoin on the loose is not comforting. 
might be crazy to say but I think it's possible we may just see corrections from here on out and no extended bear market.

Actually this is an ICO that might make sense to me. ASICs are extremely expensive to produce and therefore largely unavailable to the public. If a much wider population can get their hands on asic computer chips by contributing to this ICO this could be a game changer. Not sure how they plan to execute it though or what the ICO is for if they have already built and designed the chips. 
"We will launch the mining based on ready-made mining computers by December 31, 2017, which will lead to the full-scale entry into the bitcoin mining business."

the dollar is worth 5 percent of what it was 100 years ago but that conveniently ignores the fact that the monetary supply has drastically increased over that time as well. I used to tout the same stat. Our current monetary system highly encourages investing or spending instead of saving. If you had invested that $100 100 years ago into a good company that would likely be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. My grandpa invested $500 into wrigley gum in the 50s and that turned into over a quarter million dollars by the early 2000s.

Right. It's about making the network more decentralized and verifying and relaying blocks to other nodes. the more nodes running core 0.15 which won't accept segwit2x blocks the better. People running nodes are exactly what make btc peer to peer. spv and liteclient wallets are totally reliant on these nodes. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:56:16
its built into the bitcoin protocol which cannot be changed unless there is 100 percent consensus which is basically impossible to achieve. 
To put it another way, if someone tried "double spending" bitcoin (spending more bitcoin than they really have), the network of bitcoin nodes that relay blocks full of transactions would notice that "hey this guy over here just tried to double spend, &amp; they won't accept that tx into the blocks"

Does anyone else see this having a positive effect on bitcoin atm prices? I could be wrong but I believe the atm prices are so high sometimes because of this wait period or because they buy in bulk from a miner and hope price stays above where they bought. It seems with instant low fee buys on coinbase you could build that straight into a crypto atm where people are essentially buying from coinbase with atm owners bank account and we could have maybe 4-6 percent fees instead of 10-15 percent.

You need an ASIC miner to mine bitcoin. They are literally millions of times more efficient than graphics cards. If you get in early on a presale you can get them for around $2000 I believe.

@_date: 2017-09-26 02:27:16
It actually potentially makes it something a lot less volatile like something like bitcoin, and also less of a store of value type assett like bitcoin. The whole point to the eth tokens originally was that they were supposed to be used like "fuel" for all these different "smart contract" applications. so if you wanted to run one of these smart contracts you coded up, you'd have to input some eth tokens into it like you would gas to make it work. This is why eth in a lot of peoples opinions isn't actually a very bullish asset long term. Also with all the ICO raised with Eth im sure that certainly creates some downward pressure because these projects need to sell eth to get fiat money to fund their project.

I think the amount of VC funding into bitcoin companies in the last year or two and governments around the world generally becoming much friendlier to crypto is a decent indicator that Bitcoin isn't going to zero tomorrow. Also Japanese tech giant GMO is going to spend a buttload of cash designing and producing better mining chips Q1 of 2018.

@_date: 2018-07-17 20:43:39
It helps a little bit but it definitely hasn't fixed it. LN isn't adopted yet and that will take years i imagine as it should, and with segwit it only helps btc do about 2x the transactions it could before definitely a step in the right direction. the 800k figure is closer to what btc with segwit can handle, before segwit it was around 400-500k IIRC. In the grand scheme of adoption all decentralized cryptos have a long way to go in being able to onboard everyone gracefully. The only reason LTC is a decent alternative/back up is because it has so much damn hash power securing it's blockchain, its on every exchange, and it had a fair launch. It could be any other coin LTC just happens to be the one w/ those qualities that miners and exchanges have accepted. I think some day though BTC may be able to do virtually everything any other alt-coin is working on at the moment through btc side-chains and second layer stuff. In my mind thats like 15 years away though.

I'm not actually saying these things should be banned, i'm just using your retard logic and extending it to cash and charities and saying you should be consistent. That's why it sounds dumb, because it is. You're incredibly naive if you think crypto is only used by criminals or that blockchain tech has no real world applications, or that if we banned bitcoin it would only affect those invested in it (its up to 200billion usd now by the way, good luck wiping out that wealth with no repercussions). For example a couple computer chip stocks fucking exploded in these last two years because of crypto currency mining and im going to remember this comment when the Japanese tech giant GMO spends 30 million usd designing even better crypto mining chips Q1 of 2018 and you'll still be here thinking this shit is going to be banned because one or two bad brown people asked for some btc donations once.  


fucking lol. this says it all, Idk why i'm even responding to your blind-ass. username checks out I guess? lol.

Of course you can't actually enforce bitcoin internally but if anyone thinks that good relationships between exchanges and government or exchanges and banks doesn't matter you are naive unfortunately.

When you can't fit more than around 800k tx/day on the btc blockchain without it getting super expensive, having more than one blockchain at hand starts to make some sense imo.

The thing is, these exchanges are already regulated like you suggest as money service business's, abide by kyc/aml regulations and pay their taxes. 
If the governments were going to try and ban them it would have happened five or six years ago. In my view they legitimatized Bitcoin back in 2014 when they auctioned off 144,000btc from the Silk Road to institutional investors. 
Plus attempting to ban or criminalize crypto worldwide at this point would be a logistical nightmare and next to impossible. It grew too big too fast and government is too big already and too slow to react. you can't just criminalize 200billion dollars worth of value because 1-5 percent of that value might be buying weed or heroin with it.

All I have to do to transfer cash is hand it over. thats a totally untraceable activity. transfering money digitally is another thing, which they'd end up having to do anyways if they wanted to use their btc and switch back to cash. What you're saying is ironic because you can't even point to any examples of terrorists using bitcoin, but we have proof that air-dropping pallets full of us dollars and weapons and ammunition in the middle east has ended up directly funding the terrorists we fight today. Also in my opinion saying that  "terrorists might do this or that so we need to ban or this or that" is useless fear mongering. Bitcoin may be virtual but it is a lot more traceable than people think. Cash is by far the currency of choice for terrorists.

Maybe if there is another bull run in future the btc atm companies (assuming they hold btc) will be able to lower their fees. Wealth disparity is a problem in Bitcoin and we all sound a bit greedy trying to get everyone to use our system because a and b we know it's because you hope to be much more well off because it. I'm not sure how it all works though I think I've read the atm companies have to source their coins from random people/places so they are usually getting it fairly close to spot maybe (which doesn't help selling them at a fair price I imagine ).

Its traceable transactions on local bitcoins. Some people do use LBC to just find a good seller and meet up with cash, that would not be traceable. However it seems to be more the norm these days to do cash deposits/wire transfers then btc into recipients LBC wallet, which would be traceable. 48,000 SAR is only about 10,000USD as i'm sure you know so to me it doesn't seem all that significant.

Yes but one thing is that the market cap at 12 dollars was tiny. I'm pretty sure it took much much less capital to make price move back then because the scale was so much smaller. Not to mention when the mrkt cap is 50 million or so as it was, thats a very attractive amount for future growth, and btc was young and enthusiastic. now the market cap is so much larger, different story.

@_date: 2018-04-22 22:34:17
The point is that you can set up a BTC wallet that can only spend if you have signatures from multiple people. So they can pull all the teeth out they want or just kill you, if they don't get the sigs from the other necessary parties they will leave empty handed. depending on who the other parties are that need to sign to spend from the wallet it complicates things for the robbers significantly. If they were really brutal like a cartel or something they'd prob murk ya just for wasting their time i guess.

I'd hold onto the crypto over precious metals tho personally.

Really depends on what "world uncertainty" translates to. If people are simply worried about too much fiat being printed and the they are uncertain of the economic effects it may have on the world, buying something like bitcoin for that makes sense imo.
For people who are worried about a true collapse of civilization it will take a lot more preparation than buying bitcoin to be ready i.e. Living a completely self sufficient life before the collapse even happens.
Personally I don't think it'll ever get quite that bad, but I imagine there will be various effects from pumping so much new fiat/debt into the world economy.

This is what Ross actually put himself in his Linkedin....
"I love learning and using theoretical constructs to better understand the world around me. Naturally therefore, I studied physics in college and worked as a research scientist for five years. I published my findings in peer reviewed journals five times over that period, first on organic solar cells and then on EuO thin-film crystals. My goal during this period of my life was simply to expand the frontier of human knowledge.
Now, my goals have shifted. I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression amongst mankind. Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force."

Judging by how the total market cap for crypto has gone from 30 billion to 50 billion usd just in the last couple of months it's probably fair to say a good chunk of it is fiat. The market cap for the top alts have also only been going up. If money was going from alts to btc, litecoins mrkt cap wouldnt have doubled in the last weeks, eth doubled in the last month, ripple trippled. etc... 
Though I'm sure if everyone really did get rid of their alts all at once back to bitcoin there would be a huge increase in the btc price.

Just pulling this out of my butt but judging by the way the last 3 "bubbles" played out I would say we're still just getting started. I don't think it would be unusual if we hit 10k then corrected back down to 3-5k. 
Maybe it's just me but a 30billion usd market cap for bitcoin seems very, very tiny compared to what it could be if only a small amount of people decide to buy bitcoin.  So it may seem like a bubble, but is it really if the potential of new money coming in being so high and so likely?
bitcoin doesn't need new features or corporate endorsements or whatever for the price to go up. The idea of it and the ability to buy it just simply needs to reach more people &amp; that's whats happening and will continue to happen imo.

All they would have to do to be like other exchanges is lower the daily withdrawal limit and ask for a name/address.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:52:33
Sounds like one of the better scenarios to play out. That would be excellent if they came back just with lower withdrawal limits and KYC enabled.

the fresh btc being mined is of course not for sure going to be sold on the market immeditely but they are all potential sellers. Whereas in the future when almost all the BTC has been mined (about 2050 is when block rewards become near zero, or only 3.5 new BTC mined per day compared to 1800 now), then any sell pressure will have to come from supply that already exists. 1800 new BTC a day is A LOT of new supply in the grand scheme of BTC long term game.

I think people who can prove their funds on btc-e were legit should be able to get their money back as long as it is still there. Who knows though. As long as there was no hack I don't see why people who were trading there should see anything but a maybe a slight haircut for "trading on an unregulated exchange". I can't imagine the us govt just seizes everyones coins good and bad. they are probably sorting all that out right now, maybe marking accounts that are suspicious &amp; connected to all this criminal activity.

thats true but those coins don't have a 1.6billion dollar market cap and loads of bitcoin developers working with them. it probably took a lot more people to come to consensus to activate segwit on litecoin than vertcoin for example.

It's definitely worth noting you can't withdraw fiat from polo or bittrex these sites deal with purely crypto. If you wanted to trade back into fiat you'd need to send the coin back to bitstamp gdax etc. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:27:52
I could be understanding this wrong but I think you have higher fees like this when you are sending from a wallet that has received lots of little amounts spread out over time. So each time you send from that wallet it has to pass along all that other info as well making the transaction a lot bigger than it could be.

&amp; just as silkroad was the original catalyst for bitcoin being useful and valueable the issues affecting buyers and sellers with tx speed and fees will probably also be the catalyst to fix the current problems (or maybe move to a new coin entirely for dn purchases, which is happening with eth monero and zcash atm). whether people like it or not buying drugs anonymously and having them shipped to you from the convenience of your home was and still is the main use case for crypto.

sold/used every single coin right before the run up to 260. I don't know whats worse. Missing out on buying coins altogether, or buying thousands of coins when they were cheap and not keeping any of them.

I have a ledger &amp; I can say from experience the main downside is you are reliant on ledgers servers or whatever working properly to access your coins.

Maybe offer a discount on your normal rate to give people an incentive to pay in bitcoin? like advertise a 20 percent higher rate in us dollars vs bitcoin or something. 
If you think its a hassle to buy from an exchange than you have to give those students a reason to do it themselves? It's really not a hassle, you just sign up and wire them money from your bank account. Of course if a renter just paid 6 months or 12 months upfront in bitcoin that would be preferred but i think your chances are pretty low of finding someone who will want to do that.

Im a dreamer, what can I say? 
So your saying, if i create a regeneratively designed community that sustains itself and mother-nature around it, Lots of people will get hurt because of this?  I don't really understand... 
I accept the alienation i receive from people on this topic in the same way a slavery abolitionist would in days slavery was socially acceptable. Please, if you told people back then that dinosaur fossil eating machines operated by 1 person could harvest thousands of acres by itself, without the need for slaves, you would sound like an absolute crazy person. The point being, I could not possibly have ALL the answers to current societal/political/financial problems figured out overnight, because these things either take care of themselves over time OR get worse over time, things change, quite rapidly sometimes. Who will watch the watchers? who will make sure bad people don't do bad things? I dont know, man. 
I cannot predict the future, or facilitate the empirical change that should happen across the world. But I will do what I can to foster the most positive rational alternative to a violent and coercive system.

with that said after moving from coinbase to kraken last spring I can still say with confidence that anyone who wants to be treated with respect should move their business to kraken. Their customer support is so fast i don't think i've ever received an automated reply. After dealing with literally 5 months of automated replies from coinbase when i tried to contact them about extra money they sent me which i was trying to send back (yes, they sent me a duplicate wire... and didnt contact me/actually my bank about it for 5 months, even though i told them about it a dozen times already at that point), I was flabbergasted with Krakens customer support a real person replying with a real response in under an hour. They even gave me a direct contact to a "kraken client success specialist" and will encrypt messages with my pgp key or communicate thru any other medium i prefer. From what I hear their trading platform used to be not so great, but with their cryptowatch interface I don't have any problems and the volume on btc and eth pairs are actually pretty decent with the orderbooks usually being thicker on kraken vs coinbase.

The military industrial complex and the Federal Reserve are quite possibly the most evil and repulsive duo in history and you are forced to prop them up when using fiat; although this logic may not be convincing enough for some, I think the more you learn about the way money  and the military industrial contracts today really works, the more you want to use BTC. Its like...buying organic food or something. its more expensive/harder to get and you can get everything else not organic for cheaper and easier most of the time, but some people don't want to support the spraying and killing of ecological systems. In the same way with bitcoin people don't want to support insidious/deceitful financial systems so they create alternatives that are self-reliant. 
But thats just me, the ethical front is the most important factor for incentivizing the use of BTC but that is just because i know how evil the system really is.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:31:19
just because you should have done this last year doesnt mean you should do it this year.

Thanks. I'm basically referring to "Permaculture", or "regenerative design systems" with the whole "counterculture communities" blah blah blah stuff.
You should find it interesting! (anybody should) This knowledge is what allows me to have a positive view of "what could be". I really hope you look into it deeply and enjoy it! 
I also tune into the prolific Stefan Molyneux whenever he releases something. He has been a significant influence in my "making sense of the world" and refining my view of humanity collectively, political systems, financial systems etc... HE actually does have a lot of answers, and solutions to what would take place for government programs in a free society; thats all to be debated. Check it out! you may have an epiphany or two over time.
I sympathize with your sentiments, but don't be afraid to sound radical! its usually the radical people that change things. newton and galileo were absurdly radical for there time, but look how much they changed humanities perspective. 
And obviously im very into cryptocurrencies = D Which have helped me acquire funds for my permaculture community (been in BTC since 7$) = )

1. depends what you want. Polo and bittrex are the best exchanges for altcoins. Any of the major exchanges will be fine for bitcoin. GDAX, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTC-E. learning how to read the bid and ask order books and how to place buy and sell orders is pretty easy.
2. You can keep your bitcoins on mobile if you want. mycelium is a good wallet for this, bread wallet is ok. you could buy a hardware wallet such as trezor or ledger and keep them on there. blockchain.info is a popular web wallet and there are many others like this if you google bitcoin wallets very easy to learn more. the main thing you can't forget to do is write down and securely store the recovery phrases for your wallets incase your forget the password.

4. yes you can buy fractions of a bitcoin.

Okay, but do not all of those things happen on a large scale already anyway? 
I have the beliefs of full on NAP utopia anarchism, (however unrealistic that is in our lifetime, to say its unachievable is extremely ignorant in my view, similar to abolitionist in slave days imo), so this significantly affects my view on "what could be", and largely puts me in a radical group of thinking in current culture.
Of course if you take an existing system that takes care of a lot people and abolish it overnight, there will be a lot of consequences. 
The fact that so many disabled and innocent individuals are dependent on state payouts/programs does soften my view towards taxes a lot 'in the now'.
But i suppose i still strongly believe we could accomplish 1. disability programs. 2.rehab centers 3.social disapproval of slavery 4. peace in multicultural communites 5. maintenance/implementation of public/energy services 6. Less pollution, without Government or taxes forcing us to do so; we 'NEED' taxes in the now to keep this system from exploding, is that sustainable/a good game plan? does that justify the immediate "need" for taxes? sort of, but not for a good reason at all. It reveals to us that a new design/system needs to be implemented gradually, so as to reduce the suffering of those dependent.
I'll pay taxes, but only because i don't want to get myself arrested and thrown in a rape cage; Will I remain complacent and quiet and convince others taxes and monopolies of coercion (government) are necessary and good in the now? Absolutely not. 
What needs to happen is smart, independent and regeneratively designed counter-cultures who are not dependent on government services whatsoever (grow/process and trade their own food, fibre, medicine, energy), peacefully reject the coercion that is so rampant in state environments, and grow to a point where the amount of people living this way is significant. I honestly don't think communities in the past could have organized the way we can now with the internet and their failure to eradicate immoral state coercion was predictable and makes sense, but now that we have the technology to organize and see the truth in what would be impossibly complex subjects otherwise, I just see we don't have much of an excuse anymore, and people should start living the right way, anyway, regardless of societal norms. I hope more young people like me have this view over time, because the state WILL NOT take care of them when they are suffering and in need 10 or 20 years from now. There will simply be too many people in need, too many stagnat dependent consumers with useless jobs. 
So although we both have compassionate roots in our reasoning, I still prefer to elaborate a more peaceful world without coercion and how to achieve it, than accept the current system for what it is and suggest sustain it for "the greater good".

amagi metals is great! i have good experience with them.
-I also wonder why there arent more people talking about converting btc with gold and silver. perhaps they don't want a lot of people to know; you can get mad deals this way with the volatility of btc.  for example think of how much gold you could buy with a 1,000 dollar investment of btc when it was 1 or 2 dollars. Obviously the price jump was not predictable, but all of a sudden you can buy 100,000 dollars of gold and silver from what was just 1,000 dollars. Finding gold at spot price is hard enough, but 100 times cheaper or more? now thats a deal... seriously has anybody else thought about this? its kept me up at night thinking the deals i could have had if i had been more aware (early adopter at 7-10 dollars, had a good chunk thought i did really well at 4x my investment then it shot up 16x more and i had such bad sellers remorse.)
Some of the largest amagi orders were when BTC was 200+, i imagine some smart people got A LOT of precious metals for an unheard of deal in relation to their initial btc venture.
I too think its a good time to buy PM, but I think we might see some complicated bottoms over the next two years or so, but obviously everybody is bullish on gold and silver longterm on the inside because of the FEDS policies and asia's persistent buying of gold and silver and what not.
Gold, Silver, BTC, the mighty three!!

in the feb/march/april rise the high was like 260? lots of people bought above 200... crashed more than 3x from its high (260 to 80) then balanced in the 100-200 range. if we were to crash 3x from our high of 1240 we could expect a reasonable bottom of 350-500...(then back up somewhere stable for awhile?) the bubble 2 years ago rose from like 50 cents to 32 dollars back down to 2 dollars so... some people are making out nicely i guess ; P

litecoins low fees and fast transactions certainly make it a better coin for "every day use" than bitcoin at the moment. lately my litecoin tx's are only about 2-4 cents fee and are confirmed in a couple minutes instead of potentially hours and a 5 dollar fee with btc.
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:36:52
It depends on the way you look at it. short term its not a great deal, long term if you think btc will succeed 261 dollars would be a good buy if years from now btc is 1000, 10,000, 100,000. If you are interested i would at least get some fiat into an exchange and try to buy at a good dip.

I am so appalled and devastated, i got rid of all my coins... a lot of them...
I knew it would happen... Why did I do this....
They are speculated to soar far past the hundreds....
But i knew everything bout them when they were at a measly 5-6 dollars a bitcoin last summer!!!
fuck me
@_date: 2013-08-02 06:43:50
probably a few dollars.
I had something similar on a slightly smaller scale happen to me. and, I still toss and turn at night. but not as much hearing other peoples stories : )
These casascius coins are... neat. Cooler than my silver eagles ; P I will have to get some!

If you know what you are doing with the BTC before you get them you can spend them right away and usually not deal with any volatility. Like if you wanted to buy a laptop or a TV but wanted to use BTC instead you could probably in some cases find them for cheaper, and many people can use the volatility to their advantage. For example if you knew 70$ was going to be a short bottom a few weeks ago and knew you wanted a laptop, you buy enough BTC for the laptop say "well it'll probably correct back to 100 soon so ill wait a week or two" now it does, and your not so mad about the volatility all of a sudden because you have 600 more dollars to spend. Not bad? 
Also I am happy spending BTC on things instead of USD because i know that there isnt a murderous and deceitful government/military industrial complex spending trillions of dollars just on murder machines and occupying poor countries outside our view; so to me, the more wealth being spent in BTC the better because i do not support War, deceit, Theft, or institutions that conventionalize and normalize these very things.

I dont think so. have you seen the website bitcoinstore? you cant buy computers, televisions, digital cameras, communication services, and a multitude of other things with early 90s baseball cards. All the recent news articles do a really poor job citing the websites that are actually selling a bunch of legitimate stuff for btc. Bitcoinstore has sold almost 400,000$ worth of electronics on the clearnet this month and nobody has reported on it its kind of frustrating lol. I honestly think Litecoin would be more comparable to "early 90s baseball card" i think thats a funny metaphor haha

I think people who are against the general idea of coercion/threats onto groups of people to achieve specific political goals is really quite simple. So let me ask; if you were raped, or your family was murdered by someone... would you go and ask them to provide healthcare, education, public infrastructure, etc.... for your population?? Governments are there to create a space for upperclass criminals to break the law without punishments; IT IS BEYOND MY BLAZED MIND HOW PEOPLE COULD ASK/DEMAND MURDERERS/THIEVES TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN AND TAKE CARE OF THEM, create infrastructure etc... i believe quite strongly in this metaphor.
Sales tax, or consumption tax is not a big deal and governments that dont operate a military industrial complex (using as much fuel as INDIA PERDAY) would be more than just fine collecting revenues this way, especially since citizens would have 10-40% more income (if no income tax was in place). 
I think people who believe "Taxes create kind of democratic structure in which we can all help each other live peacefully" just have not been saddened enough by the realities of political infrastructure and the bullshit that comes with it. Listen to some Noam Chomsky, or something.

I don't know if its true, but even if it were it doesn't matter because thats not even close to actual proof of your holdings. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:30:49
No, but i don't think it should be speculated for its price so much or as an investment because these things are whats driving its price up so much which could potentially come down. I think it should be treated as protection from central banks stealing your money. So if the price goes down comparatively to fiat currency well at least you still have your money and you can spend it and do whatever with it, instead of it being blatantly confiscated, put a bunch of new rules on, like it was with the test balloon which is the current events of cyprus. their economy is tiny so it was just a test to see how much they could get away with in other countries like spain, italy and portugal where the debt is much more significant. Because the Euro cannot infinitely print in all euro nations like the US dollar in the USA, they cannot steal thru inflation, so people are waking up because its so much more blatant and this could happen potentially anywhere, but likely debt based euro countries the most. Could you make profit on bitcoin longterm? if it stays intact? i mean, of course. It is still so small compared to the potential, so yeah i could see it being $500 usdollars/btc easily by the end of 2013, and in the thousands for a longer 3+ year estimate. if you google bitcoin under "news" you'll find sooo many legitmate legal business's accepting bitcoin now that it is very sobering that this is not "just a fad" and that in an increasingly less private society the things that have the most value are the things that give you privacy, security, and efficiency and this is what makes bitcoin so valueable. I think its qualities far exceed what is acheivable with gold or silver, even though they will still have their place. but what is important to move forward with is an open mind about crypto currencies and the many that are already following in bitcoins place, like litecoin, terracoin, namecoin. litecoin is considerably still tiny, and the others i would consider are still in developing stages (dont have solid exchanges, or wallet systems, like btc has inplace), but they essentially work in very similar ways to bitcoin and i think could offer not really competition but diversity and flexibility in the virtual crypto currency markets. I think if your looking for btc to be a stable price, or to rise for your incentive to make profit as per hedged to the US dollar or euro, you might have a tough time because the US dollar and Euro are such baseless valueless currencies that are driving up or down the cost of crypto currencies in the exchanges based on what kind of nonsense is going on with fiat monetary policy (QE, stimulus, etc).
hope that helps

I thought i made a solid return at 60 dollars on the last bubble. boy was i kicking myself in the nuts after that. but it happens, its pretty difficult to predict this stuff imo. and its especially hard to time when it can take days to get btc when the price can move +-50% in a matter of hours. It would be smart to have a balance that your always adding a small amount to over time that you don't touch. that way you wouldnt always be gambling everything. thats the mistake i've made myself, If i would have done this since i discovered btc at like 7-8$ i would be doing very very well. oh well.. happy to hear you made a solid return, u should spend some of your return on something in btc maybe.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:47:41
It seems everybody who gets involved with these regret not just holding on to the coins because the appreciated value can be way more than the payouts. if anybody has positive light to shed on mining contracts lets hear it. Seems like something you might wanna only put like 20% of your btc money into at most if it were legit. it would be cool to constantly yield more coins without having to buy them, especially if it actually pays off in a reasonable time.

Well im not sure how representative that fact is of people who ethically and morally disagree with widespread coercion. I think its morally cutting corners in the long run and is a big part of why humans act so much out of greed. 
I do think people who genuinely believe taxes are doing good are naturally generous people and have money to spare;  does this justify the taxes and what are done with them? I don't think so. I just think those people are misinformed. 
Im a young person who has not had any true freedom or rights most of my life here in the US, so taxes are a relatively new thing to me; I have not had the sustained anger towards the (truly) imaginary state long enough to translate that to hatred towards common folk yet. Im aware this happens, people become bitter over the years in relation to these topics, and with good reason. 
Also, measuring what a country needs by its tax rate im sure is not accurate, you're making all sorts of cultural/infrastructure assumptions on what the needs of the population really are. 
I think the idea is that humanity collectively doesn't need to be coerced to do good; and creating this contradiction (government/banks can break the law without consequence, regular people cannot) is morally and ethically extremely dangerous to any given society, especially within youth population (once they grow up and realize there parents/adults/leaders are SERIOUS fuck ups). But the fact that many people do not believe in humanity as such, and there are many who are very pessimistic and dont believe people can collectively do good without being forced, i think this is societal conditioning and usually only disheartened adults say things like this; and it seems so true. Is that a productive or progressive view to have for humanity? If everybody adopted this view, would this be good for humanity? 
The fact that people can say with a straight face that their money which in most cases is paying the interest on central banking debt (in the US atleast) is doing good, is a very good picture of how well conditioned some cultures are; how well propaganda really works. 
If taxes really were fine and dandy and really did help people, i wouldn't have this view; people have such a negative view of them because bad and stupid things are justified with the financial consent/complacency thats been conditioned into specific populations. 
Woah wall of text....

great post haha.
Id have to agree with those four statements especially number 4.
After buying and selling at the peaks and valleys throughout the day and watching people get fucked, I too realized how unethical of a job day trading is; just the fact that they can  profit so enormously just from sitting on their butt on all day, just like i was doing (compared to working in a tomato field all day for min wage, which ive done as well).
So Im happy you posted your sentiments i agree with em, my interest in cryptocurrencies alone has taught me a lot (while exciting me for the hope of making extra money).

I seriously dig that when every time something happens with BTC there are a bunch of people here to discuss it and try to sort out discrepancies/get to the bottom of it/figure out how to make it work better etc...
Volatility aside, Its so great that monetary issues are ACTUALLY being discussed now much more in the open. I think its great that satoshi left parts for us to finish because all of these learning experiences within the BTC economy the last few years and the coming years are having/will have profound impact on our understanding of currencies &amp; exchange. 
even if BTC were to become Irrelevent in 10 years its existence will no doubt have made a large footprint and its existence right now is forcing say... conventional mediums? to levels that are threatening to their unethical foundation and force questions on them that they don't want to answer; its good.
exciting! keep stoking the fire...
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:59:12
explain it by telling those people you shouldnt invest your life savings in somebody elses hype? nobody forced anybody to buy bitcoin at any point in time. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:14:48
you could buy a lot of gold and silver pretty anonymously. and maybe the 6000btc is worth more by the time you spend it so you get more bang for your buck. then gold goes to 10,000$ in 10 years and your like woowooweeewooo! 
I always thought... When i saw the bullion people accepting BTC... Damn... I wish i invested a few thousand when BTC was only a few dollars, then cashed out on gold and silver than i bought at 2000% discount. seriously.. some people probably got precious metals for maaad cheap.

Government organizes itself around individuals, as a sort of parasite; not the other way around. People self-organize, then the government takes their part of the pie, thats it.
 I think its illogical to assume if people weren't forced to organize (and they necessarily are not, they are just forced financial consent to the government), that nobody would do anything (and everybody would become criminals! ah!!!!!!!). 
This is just a really irrational view to me, but I am young and it seems like only disheartened adults who've been dragged down by the world for so long say things like this, because maybe they just don't know any other way.
I understand its a necessary question, and it makes people think about it which is good; but to me I say "Well of course we could organize without government" in the same way a person is better off WITHOUT cancer, instead of "How could we possibly survive without this cancer?" its just kind of an odd question, you know?

[you'd have to have millions of little sustainable enclaves.]
MAAN and thats what im shooting for = D. how beautiful would that be? everywhere you go, beautiful food forests, wonderfully designed water ways? abundance everywhere??! (corn fields are not abundance lol) Whats wrong with having millions of little sustainable enclaves? surely this could be done as well; convincing that many people to live this way is the difficult part for sure, and probably won't happen. But WHAT IF it did happen? The number of good, innocent, regular people out their FAR outnumber the amount of bad, elite ruling class people. It is just a matter of awareness and education; So i guess I am reluctant to firmly say this is not possible on a large scale. However, your novel sounds plausible, this does not scare me! This only makes the case moreso for people like us, and if everybody else doesn't see it that way, im happier dead than living with a bunch of spineless people like this. Would you want to live with a bunch of nazis? haha probably not...
There will always be this threat, People cannot allow this to scare them into stagnation. It wont scare me at least!!

Longterm i ment at least 10 years. 10-30 year forecast for gold i think most people are pretty bullish. Of course not everybody. 
It could definitely hit a 400-600 bottom in the next 4 years. A lot of new mines being discovered with better technology are finding much denser deposits (the average cost of mining $1080/ounce), these mines can produce for about $500 an ounce. 
Also who knows, it was only 10 years ago gold was like 200 dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it went back to where it was. Especially with the silver gold ratio 1 ounce of gold for 65 ounces of silver when historically its usually 15-16 ounces of silver for ounce of gold.

Personally this would be a great alternative for me and i would certainly use the service (5%+5$ sounds good, 10% definitely not). But publicly as someone as stated before, there is a HUGE demand for this to the average joe; all my friends who know about bitcoin but have not used it yet just never really understood how to use dwolla or bitinstant; soo many people (who dont use btc) ask me if you can use paypal on any currency exchanges and something as simple as that just does not exist in the US. I think A LOT of people would use your service, hopefully you'll be able to keep up if this does get started soon! 
Would there be a max limit to the amount you can purchase at once? Will large BTC orders be available thru this method (1,000-10,000$?)
Thanks a lot! good to see solutions being brought up and discussed all the time!

This is very true and frightening. The fact that the cause of the massive increase (advanced fossil fuel technologies) in human population of the last 200 years is basically the only thing sustaining the current population (Oil=food and water transportation, globalized food system...) and will likely be very hard to get or run out in the next 100 years...
