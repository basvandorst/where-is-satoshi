why not use Bitstamp ?
@_date: 2019-03-18 08:03:50
A year and a half ago 4000$ was a hype, now 4000$ is a dip. Bullish! 
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:12:22
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:30:48
No, they don't accept bitcoin as payment. They just sell bitcoin. It is written on the sign in slovene.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:12:06
Trade it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:48:21
Its called 21 million club and anyone who has 1 Bitcoin is in it
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:56:27
At least short term, time will tell. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:25:27
That Dick guy is really a dick.
@_date: 2019-02-03 00:32:34
Price gains during “good years” is purely hyped
Price gains during recessions is maintaining value 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:22:09
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:41:29
Its because halving is right around the corner for LTC
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:31:38
Welcome to the club brother, good to have you here :)
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:11:17
don’t take 100k in 18 months for granted. I think we will see that kind of value end of 2021/2022. But thats only my opinion.
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:31:25
well.. being pessimistic doesn’t hurt as much as being optimistic would but hey, time talks.
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:18:21
3115 EUR per BTC
@_date: 2019-06-09 08:47:41
All time high in pesos, not in true value.
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:45:16
oh man :/
@_date: 2019-02-03 00:30:17
There is a reason, the last recession investors needed a new bubble, that was real estate in 2008 crash. People invested in to stocks will want to keep their value so they will put their money somewhere else, in something that is gaining value. Things like Bitcoin are perfect for this type of situations, but only time will show us if that will be the next step.
@_date: 2019-02-06 22:25:34
Small demand, cheap price.
Big demand, expensive AF
@_date: 2019-02-03 00:39:33
Yes, you’re right. You never know, time will tell.... But you need to look at countrys like Venezuela, do they pick gold, real estate? when their country broke down? no they went for bitcoin, because you can still pay for stuff, unlike gold you wouldn’t be able to pay small amounts in gold or real estate.

What a fucking dick, I bet he bought the top.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:59:57
I see just never heard of it really. Thought he got it wrong, thanks tho
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:10:07
I’d say Gold. But thats only my opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-07 09:25:21
Roll the dice :)
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:46:54
Yes, one more time to re-test 5800 level, thats only my opinion tho. We are in the 5th Elliot wave. Maybe A,B,C correction will take us to the levels I mentioned before. After that it should rocket away.
@_date: 2019-02-03 00:51:03
long story short no one rly knows whats coming and how people will react.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:46:11

you need to download an app called: Google Authenticator found on Google Play for Android and on app store for Iphone, you will have to scan qr code or enter a password given by bitstamp to obtain 6 digit key. Good Luck 
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:12:05
2140 with todays tech, 2045 if tech follows the Moore’s law (and it will).
Incredible how many people still think computers will not advance.

I opened mine in germany (N26 Bank), few months later I got a letter from tax administration from my country to provide them with details about the account.
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:54:41
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:10:30
Anytime :)
@_date: 2019-04-01 05:19:45
I don’t know about that, but use stable coins to keep the value and sell only when you need and how much you need. Keep it safe.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:52:12
someone is broke and cant afford bitcoin, making shitty posts on reddit, butt hurt AF
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:33:23
Hmm Slovenia? But even if you manage to open a bank account in EU you are gonna have to connect it with your tax number id..
@_date: 2019-04-01 05:32:01
Well, there you go... I don’t know alot about tax thing because my country does not tax profits from crypto. So maybe you should help him out?
@_date: 2019-04-20 00:06:18

@_date: 2019-04-04 10:03:05

My view is the same, but still might have another leg down you never know
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:36:26
I can make some, I have 10 pairs because it does not make sence to make only one, but EU numbers for size is only 43-44

@_date: 2019-01-25 11:33:10
I’d rather take Bitcoins, you’re right
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:05:25
at every point is guessing my firend, I’m just curious what people think
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:17:16
Made them
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:08:51
Yeah it's a great thing in my opinion even if it raise only for 20 dollars it would still be great dude we're UP. I think people are way to greedy to be happy with &lt; 100 bucks up. Just my opinion. I'm always happy even when it all goes down, still making profit. Peace out.
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:12:17
Can't be all ups mate. It's collecting fuel for later launch. HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:29:01
try google chrome and check desktop page in settings. hope that solves your problem.
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:29:11
We’ve come to a point where price does not react to FUD for the past 3 months... Most of the weak hands are already out.
