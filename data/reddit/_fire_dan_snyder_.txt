lol I know that's what the Reddit shills/bots have brainwashed you into thinking but the reality is Net Neutrality actually takes away internet rights from the people/free market and gives it to the government. Government regulations caused these problems in the ISP space to begin w by creating an environment where only a select few companies controlled the entire market. We should be cutting regulations to foster competition in the market place, not adding more.

Are you really brainwashed enough to think that we wouldn't have fucking roads and indoor plumbing w out the magical government? Because I'm pretty sure there would be great demand for these things in a truly free market economy... the government is little more than an inefficient middle man in the process. If I got sick I'd want to use the money that I worked for to buy the medical care product that I wanted. Instead we have the government forcing everyone to buy shit care.

You're using the term "investment" pretty loosely there bud. I hold a significant amount of bitcoin myself but I understand that it's speculation, not an investment. I love the tech and ideas behind bitcoin but the reality is it's very different from other asset classes where you actually own equity in a company, physical real estate, bonds backed by the US government etc. Guys like this give the entire community a bad name by thinking they're Warren Buffet after getting rich off magic beans.

The difference between speculating and investing is the amount of risk undertaken. You're straight up delusional if you think bitcoin carries the same amount of risk as those other assets. Stop making the community look bad w your financial illiteracy/accusations that I'm lying about my bitcoin.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. The blockchain is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the nuances will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Satoshi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these cryptos, to realise that they’re not just magic internet money- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bictoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bitcoin's existential catchphrase “HODL,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi’s genius wit unfolds itself on their coinbase screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bicoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:12:02
No I'm speculating on that technology. The difference between investing and speculating is risk. There is far greater risk in crypto than traditional asset classes. We need to stop pretending like that's not true. It's not even necessarily a bad thing as risk carries greater potential returns.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:45:26


Then don't go to college if you can't afford it or are studying to enter a field that doesn't offer ROI... pretty simple stuff bud.


You can have free education now. The internet is available for all to use. Free healthcare implies a right to the labor of Doctors. You're advocating for slavery.

How often is gold used as a medium of exchange? Or land? Or any other store of value? Bitcoin doesn't ever have to be used in actual transactions for it to be a viable asset.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:24:54


Yep, this is a big part of the reason I started throwing money in bitcoin as well. Not sure what this has to do w bitcoin being a far riskier asset than traditional investments tho? Are you just conceding that you were wrong and steering the discussion to something completely irrelevant?


If you don't believe that crypto carries more risk than traditional asset classes than you are delusional. Risk isn't necessarily a bad thing bud, that's why my crypto portfolio has outperformed the rest of my portfolio by an obscene margin... greater risk demands greater returns.

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:16:43
I obviously agree or I wouldn't hold bitcoin myself. The only point I've been trying to make in here is that risk management is a thing. I'm young w a high paying job and few monthly expenses so I can afford to dabble in risky asset classes. The problems come when people who don't have that safety net go all in expecting guaranteed returns.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:57:13
It may seem pedantic, but in the financial world there's a very important distinction between speculation and investment. And that distinction all comes down to how much risk you are incurring.

Yeah the reality is the term "invest" should really never be used on this sub. At the end of the day this is all speculating not investing. That's not to say it's a bad thing but let's not pretend that putting money in bitcoin is investing anymore than going to Vegas and playing Blackjack is. No one should be throwing in more than they feel comfortable losing. I bought in somewhat early and have sold off enough to cover my initial investment. The way I see it going forward I'm playing with house money and even if it goes to zero I'll be content.
