Compared to the metal parts needed to make a cellphone? What do you think?

That's what you think cellphones are made of, aluminum?

No, it's a business decision. Software is also not a physical object, it's code. A cellphone is made of plastic and metal parts, some of them rare, and its production had an environmental cost.

How? How did he contact them? What proof do you have that they will receive their Nexus?

Let's see how this goes. I'm gonna give OP the benefit of the doubt but it is simply amazing that people will smash their phones because a person on the internet (a new account no less) told them to in exchange for another phone.

Human resources basically, nothing that even remotely compares to the amount of parts that have to be assembled to manufacture each individual cellphone. Software is infinitely duplicated, whereas cellphones have to use material resources every single time another one is made.

This absurd idea is going to be the butt of one trillion jokes on r/circlejerk, particularly if OP doesn't deliver and leaves a bunch of dumbasses w/ broken cellphones. 
edit: and OP is gone! It was a new account and yet some people actually fell for it.

You have absolutely no fucking idea what you're talking about.

Wasting resources is very stupid.

Who guarantees that OP, NerdfighterSean and the 1st guy aren't the same person? Let's wait and see, but there is a strong possibility of scam.

Latin America is highly regulated. The EU is currently suing Brazil for protectionism.
