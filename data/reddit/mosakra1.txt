And do you not care about bitcoin gold? Or is because they aren't successful enough yet for you to care?

I tried that but the ambient air was makinging the miner run at 100c+ I added two fans to blow air out of the cooler and it now operates at 75c
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:45:45
It is down from 100 db
To 65-70db, which I guess isn't exactly 50% but it' unless it's measured it sound half as noisy
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:04:00
Yeah, I'm not worried about the dip. Just mad I don't have any money to buy in this time
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:39:03
As for the miner. I've only had it running for 4 days. It took me 2 days to figure out a way to keep it cool and quiet. The cooler idea with a.c. routed into it is nice, but if you have no a.c. the miner will over heat. In the 4 days I've been running it, I've got nearly . 015btc around 190 dollars,  yes it will be worth it. It should be paid off in a month or 2 depending on the price of btc

I was so stoked when I got an email from robin hood announcing this. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:21:32
It didn't used to cost anything extra, if you were planning to use that money in your account to buy something, it's not like you ever get charged a fee to pay off an account. So why not do it in a way that pays you twice? Once in crypto and once as rewards points
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:36:14
No I'm serious.  The noise from the fan has been reduced 50%. The temperature is at  a decent 75°c I'm thinking of wrapping foam around the dryer hose as well to further reduce the noise
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:01:58
Omg this deserves all the ups
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:15:52
Switch to Chase 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:30:39
I recently did that, but I had already put the two fans on the cooler to blow the ambient air out. So I don't know if  either is the reason behind the recent operating temp.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:59:34
Lol, your so funny, it's something I do maybe twice a day when I turn on my computer and when I turn off 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:57:31
Yeah, at least they did yesterday, their site is being dumb right now though I can't pull it up to double check
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:31:41
It will be 20k in 3 hours
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:02
It went to 14200 and now is resting at 16000
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:06:23
But I actually do do painting for charity quite often. It's one of the things people appreciate the most
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:51:41
Well that's nice and all but I was thinking more like an eBay for bitcoin. Or a yard sale if you will. Like someone posts an item with a price and they accept the transfer fees as part of the price for the item
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:02:19
That would be like 100million usd-btc wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:05:53
Bruh I'd just keep it omg
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:31:01
Since you told me about moonbitcoin, what's your referral to their site? I was about to setup an account and I noticed they had a referral section. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:01:39
Perhaps they are sold out, HARD to believe it happened that quick even with the price increase.  But if you go to their support and message them asking to be informed when they have some available that will be the quickest way, that's how I got in on the supposedly january batch. It was sold out and then they must have had a cancelled order or something
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:22:20
Mempool is far from empty. Go to  still over 114 million. Fees aren't low again either 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:30:58
This was great, you've great skill at prose sir. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:37:45
Except it would be as corrupt as any other game show, requires a 100 dollar ticket by everyone and then only ones that guy in the back chooses because they fit a wide demographic
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:10:09
Well, I did it, before this big drop across the board I held 200 dollars of bch and btc each in coinbase. Seeing this drop, I totally sold some bch so I could buy btc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:17:28
All I want to know is, what keyboard is that?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:43:37
I'm still using them as my gpu mining pool. I have them set up to send to an external wallet, so yeah, they didn't lose much of my money, and they won't ever lose much because I'm stupid enough to use them as my wallet
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:55
I do t care about time on this, it's going to my other wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:35:52
Bruh come to Virginia
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:17:59
I had .187 and exchanged it at a poor time to get bitcoin cash and purchase the antminer s9... I'm kinda salty that I could have waited a week and only sent around .1 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:56:11
Because I don't trust coinbase anymore
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:33
It will be back at 17k then
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:02
Yep about 40 seconds I think.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:22:34
I've 1000 dollars of my friends money and a green light to buy in whenever I feel the market is right.  Having absolutely no risk makes doing this so much easier. You guys should just clear your minds and say "it's someone else's money, what do I have to lose?" 
And yes my friend  understands the risk,
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:41:46
They have some now, but they are double the price I paid for it
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:15:07
If something crosses your mind more than twice, (or even three times if you want to be conservative) you should probably do it... just saying. Regrets will cause undue stress
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:42:11
The latest batch had a major price jump
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:53:47
Also if you use coinbase merchant you get even lower fees as a buyer as well. Especially if you are using coinbase to buy with
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:25:04
Eta on next dip: 1 hour and 15 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:23
With some captain Morgan sitting next to
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:30:28
The only thing they are really looking for is illegal activity. Trying to see if transactions go to various addresses or to the same address. It's their attempt to see if it us being used in sex trafficking and drugs. 
I'm not defending the government, if you have purchased from any known or suspected addresses on their watch list you'll be good.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:17:48
Mom's spaghetti 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:01
It was sent to an exchange to get BCH it didn't really give a confirmation block 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:12:02
If it keeps going like this it'll be 10,000 by tuesday
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:26:31
What is the dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:24:17
After you have been a "loyal" buyer on coinbase for some time they will send you an email stating your are approved for Instant bank purchases.
 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:39:52
I know, I didn't want to ask for handouts but I have to try man.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:43:23
I'm thinking we will do a fixed btc price adjusting quarterly, set slightly lower then than the USD price will offer as well. As an incentive to get more people into bitcoin. But open to opinions, this is a few months away.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:44:18
Are you from the U.S.? It was from the US section of coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:43:41
Holy shit, why wasn't I into bitcoin back then
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:52
Okay thanks to everyone except that last guy, fuck you
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:05:59
This is recently developed by coinbase, it started last month, so it may take a while for you to be chosen
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:53
I don't know if I did, I sent .17 man it's kinda stressful
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:11:58
No I was sending to an exchange, I bought at 8k
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:17:15
This is astonishing, and quite the story, I think you did well for yourself.  But I think there should have been a way for you to avoid paying such high taxes, you should have treated it like stocks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:20:24
That's why we would offer cash payment as well, but the idea here is to open people's eyes to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:01:43
I know this is old but it's is possible to get your data back. Everythi g is rarely ever truly gone forever. Would you happen to still have the harddrive?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:47:08
Also this is new, that blog was from last month
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:22:30
Sorry to hear that
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:11:30
I recently bought 1500 USD worth when the market was at 8000, I haven't sold it already or anything but between that and hobby mining I've made over 400 dollars in these last few weeks. At least I look at it as "made." Perhaps one day I'll really be able to rub it in his face, the only issue now is, this new value hurts the small time investor unless this periodic up-value continues
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:13:28
Only now the value of bch has dropped so much I don't have enough for the antminer... sigh waiting game
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:00:48
The government  would be missing it's cut, aka taxes I don't agree with the system this is just what I've learned from FinCEN 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:27:45
Likely so, either way I wish to not have a situat ion like this. But being how this guy was selling almost a whole btc he was probably doing it as a business anyways 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:48:55
It's still pretty low
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:47:53
Well technically, he did break the law. But only because he was exchanging a currency by acting as a transmitter as a only licensed businesses are allowed to exchange one currency for another. This isn't like selling a collectible coin or antique dollar.
Edited to add the word transmitter
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:18:51
No, not really, you can only day trade on robin hood, you don't be able to move it out because it's not a wallet. You never actually take ownership of the coin, just like the stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:53:39
I know how we solve this mystery, get that guy that came from the future who was all over the news to tell us if CWS is satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:24:12
There are ways you can treat it like a yard sale. But it's very tricky business. I recommend reading this article by the government considering the topic of crypto
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:30:00
Also if anyone has sent this guy any support via his cellphone. I would ask you to also send him a link to this website that offers legal help with crypto. They are called Atlantic city bitcoin  
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:21:11
As long as you aren't acting as an exchange you are legal. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:51:49
In the event they do that I'll hop on that train too. They are where I do my stocks just because it's free. And I don't plan to buy and sell,
