Have some but not really my primary focus.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:21:58
More Tezos than ETH. I do have some ETH tho.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:21:36
Recommend by a friend so I bought a little.

Significantly more. Took shit from people for 2+ years who thought I was crazy... I'd do it again ;)

1031 exchange into a larger deal when the opportunity presents itself. That resets the 28 years and will increase the size of the investment and in turn increase the size of the depreciation.

Don't let that thought blind you from reality. Work hard. Work smart. If you don't have money then you trade your time for it until you do have money.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:02:31
Ah, I think have seen that but don't know anything about it. I'm pretty skeptical on most of these new coins but there are some gems out there. Thanks for the tip.

You can see videos here. Not crypto related. Will be adding in how to set up passive income streams tho soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:22:44
I really want to get into traveling and making money while doing so. How to create passive incomes so that way the income never stops for people.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:01:00
haha 40 in that transaction. I wish 40,000
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:27:39
Yea, trust me I was nervous. But i've always been a believer in Bitcoin tech and I knew that halving was coming so I went for it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:19:13
Well all in anything isnt good. Real estate I can convert some crypto over for solid returns (~20%+) and also depreciate the asset. The tax benefits around property will allow me to convert to fiat whenever necessary and be tax free.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:00:16
LOL! Yes, I've heard some stories already. I just keep my head down and nose to the grind. My goals are quite a bit ambitious. :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:03:16
haha thanks. I was a believer in 2013/2014. I traded the Litecoin halving and did well. Then Bitcoin halving was coming so I went all in. Haven't sold since.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:47:52
Few main ones are: BTC(never sold BCH &amp; BTG), NEO, DGD, FCT, STORJ, TRST (still have my ICO tokens), XTZ, couple others...
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:09:03
Honestly, I can't believe we are going to hit $10k soon. But I'm still holding. Need to slowly sell some though and spread around a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:20:17
I plan on making videos on this topic actually. But a light explanation would be that you can depreciate a home (in the US) over 28 years. So take the value of the house $280k (easy numbers) divide over 28 years and you get $10k tax deduction on your taxes every year for 28 years. That creates huge tax return checks for people working a traditional job and for guys like Donald Trump makes the rich not have to pay any taxes. Thats one particular bullet point besides writing off interest paid, expenses, etc. Hope this helps!

This is part of the Bancor project? I forgot to mention I do have BNT actually as well.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:23:33
Thanks! I put a lot of effort into it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:03:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:10:09
I remember staring at LTC charts nervous to buy at $1.15... I loaded up then road the halving wave to $9 before liquidating.  Made money learned and moved on. I wish i held up until today but I don't regret the decisions I made. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:15:50
Haha can't wait! Always been self employed but now full time into investments. Want to get more heavy into real estate.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:36:10
Still much more to do! But I started traveling more and making YouTube videos. Just trying to live a dream. :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:26:51
Worked my ass off and saved every dollar. Why you don't see Lambos and degenerate spending in my YT videos. That day will come but right now save and re-invest.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:00:23
Who says its for money alone?
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:10:36
Plenty of crypto millionaires not sure what to do about taxes and handling them the most efficient way. Tons of them moving to Puerto Rico and I've met plenty already. Making friends in the community out here they literally all have been asking these questions as they are learning what they can and cant do under the act 20/22 program. $10 million isn't enough. Most of these guys got bigger dream than $10mil.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:17:26
We are planning to go out soon with these guys. I have already contributed and will be adding more to it. Expect videos soon on when we go out!
EDIT: Forgot the link!

Exactly why I came here. I purchased 9 houses in January
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:32:20
Ah, I've been in crypto since 2013 so honestly holding has been the main thing for me. I've done some trading but haven't sold until December. Still holding most of the portfolio tho. I recommend dollar cost averaging which is basically just buying the same amount of BTC or ETH every single day from fiat. I did that for about 18 months straight. But this allows you to get the best average price and deal with the spikes better and in the end hopefully prosper! Hope this helps! Good luck!
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:23:34
Sorry not sure the question. Paid cash?

No one truly knows future prices of crypto and im not going to even begin to speculate. What i do know is that it is a great investment and a much better place to put your money vs blowing it on some frivolous expenses. So at the very least you should get your feet wet with some form of investment imo. Same with real estate and other assets. Crypto is way more volatile so more potential to win and to lose. But looking long term I think there will be some great gains.
