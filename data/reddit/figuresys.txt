I really can't, there's private stuff in there.

Depending on how long ago you've made the transaction:
Don't worry, Bitcoin transactions can take up to 30 minutes to be in the recipient's account.
And since you have Bitcoin core, the syncing will take a long time. I think I read on their website that it needs hundreds of GB hard disk space, so I'd imagine that'll take a long while to sync. But don't quote me on that, because I'm not sure about that at all, regardless, it'll take a while. So assuming you didn't enter the wrong wallet address or made the transaction at the wrong process of wallet creation (somehow), you'll be good, just wait.

So basically I'm saying, we don't need "actual evidence" for it, it's something natural that we all understand.
However if you really want actual evidence, search about how scarcity increases value.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:08:34
I believe you

Never heard of it, but I assume the service will just take the .5 away then
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:08:14
I LITERALLY said DON'T quote me omg.

Imagine you're with 20 people in the desert, and there is a water pipe that gives out water 6 times a day. And with that six times, all 21 people have learned to ration to give to everyone. After two weeks, the water pipe now only gives out water 3 times a day. And the people will have to adapt to that. But soon, after several halvenings, the amount of water given out won't be enough to share. So some people will start trading or killing off other ones, because every drop of that water is now more valuable to them.
Hope that helps.

Okay, so there is no 100% absolute connection. Because it is always up to the market for this to work. It's just like how if I threatened to take away your access to water, it would be very hard for you, but if you decide you don't want water anyway. Then yes, it will not make that water any more valuable and maybe even not valuable at all anymore.
But speaking of majority and a whole market here, that people have invested in, people can't just pull back from their investments. So if the amount of what they have invested in is halvened, or harder to acquire, it makes that necessity even more valuable.

Guys, forget the bad grammar, it's understandable. And it makes a lot of sense too.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:10:36
Please tell me how... I have a personal document I have I wrote years ago that I can't remember the password of but I really want to. I've tried various softwares online. I've been trying to open it since early 2016.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:15:49
I'm sure you are a trustworthy person, it's just private and personal life stuff so I can't have someone else see it... It's not confidential info, just personal stuff I wrote a few years ago. Like a one page diary.
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:52:15
Sure, my bad.
Do provide the correct answer to OP though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:15:46
True, true... But the whales though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:46:59
Mate, maybe not as long as you, but I've been doing this for almost 2 years. So thanks for the "welcome" but no thanks. Yes, this is Bitcoin being Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean a sudden growth of over $2K in less than half a day isn't a bubble. It is certainly not a supportive and stable growth. According to long term trend means that it's going to have a correction, or as I called the burst of the bubble. If you've not noticed that trend, then I welcome you. And before you say it, yes I also understand "past performance doesn't guarantee future results", but that's what we have to go off of for now.
P.S.: I never said "crash".
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:07:39
My man.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:06:09
Point isn't that it already happened. The whole point of the post was to ask when YOU think the burst will happen. Jesus, man. Others aren't responsible for you misunderstanding something. "What do you guys think?"
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:20:14
Could you please provide some reading material?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:14:19
Thanks, you too
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:16:26
I don't get you, is that sarcasm? Haha
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:19:19
Possibly though. I've been thinking that just like before, it's a trend that when it goes up so fast, there will be a dip, but I've considered the chance that this time it went somewhere it never went before, so it's possible that there won't be a dip, because this is new grounds and things might be different here. But it still has good chances of dip.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:07:02
Of course, but that's what I'm hoping for. So I can buy more.

Not the comment's OP, but sure, [try this](
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:58:23
I'm not talking about the 1.5K drop. Please make sure you read the post before you comment. I even mentioned that the 1.5K drop was nothing and that is NOT the bubble bursting. But the RAPID increase of Bitcoin price is certainly not a supportive and stable growth.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:06:28
True, true. Well I'll look for you, let me know if you find anything as well please.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:58:46
You're absolutely right. Unfortunately.
I looked really hard for such a thing, and couldn't come across any. Granted, you live in Canada so you may have more options, but I couldn't find such a thing with a simple process in Malaysia (where I work).
I was going to ask you more information so I could do some digging for you, but from your question I assume you mean your standard Visa debit card, and to that, well I can say bitwala.io might work for your situation. You can send BTC directly (converted) to your bank account, and have it to use. Although the catch is that you'll have to pay for exchange fees and there's like 2 or 3 days time it'll take, if I'm not mistaken. I've transferred from my BTC account to Europe bank account with ease in two days though.
However if that doesn't fit you:
Since I assumed that you're talking about a standard Visa debit card, I'll look for such a thing for you anyway... Feel free to give me more info
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:54:47
Good luck, then. I'll update you if I find anything though. It really does suck because I've always been looking forward to using BTC as daily currency.
