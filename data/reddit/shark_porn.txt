I might've caved and bought 100 bucks of BTC on impulse when they were around 900. So now I'm HODLING with 11.177BTC, but probably won't buy again until BTCs drop below mean again.

HODLing is as much as holding onto the concept of crypto as it is actually holding on to the BTC. The idea is to resist trading BTC for fiat until there's no longer a need to do so. Buying things with BTC is the entire point of Holding on for Dear Life. 
Also, how often do you bottom out your bank account when you buy something? Buying with BTC probably doesn't knock you out of the crypto game. Selling out does. 
Spending BTC directly furthers the goal of strengthening the currency. Trading it for cash sells it out.

HODLers aren't talking about buying stuff with BTC, commerce is the currencies lifeblood. They're talking about selling out back to fiat for mad gainz.

If you fail to see the difference between using a currency as a currency to spend on goods, and using a currency as an investment vehicle to be converted into a different currency, I can't explain it to you.

Cash out enough to sit tight for a few years and hodl the rest. They'll go back up.
