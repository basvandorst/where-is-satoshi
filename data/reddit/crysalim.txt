Translation: "We don't make as much money using Bitcoin.  We hope it goes away, despite a severe lack of understanding in the technology."

Dude, I'm just not going to drink your kool aid.  You are trying to do what the """"primary political parties"""" are trying to do.
If you actually care about Bitcoin in terms of a political ideology, you'd promote it in those political circles.  Not the foundation ground - which, supposedly, a subreddit named after Bitcoin should be (but perhaps it isn't...)
Libertarians were the first to intercept Bitcoin for their agenda.  It's fucking bullshit.  People who use critical thinking have no prejudice about new ideas.  
Stop trying to make it a libertarian thing.  This entire sub is trying to do that.  If you actually care about Bitcoin - **just.  fucking.  stop.**

Bitcoin != libertarian

Well that was a curveball.  Ignore a discussion to talk about something random because you don't like what I said.  
How insightful of you.  This surely hasn't been done on Reddit before, ever.

Haha, you make it sound like a virus.
Really... if any other political figure pimped Bitcoin right now, would they be as loved here?

Okay.  I guess this is pretty hard to understand.  Simple sentences.
Any monetary policy is a product of personal opinion.  Extrapolating that to a political party is manipulation.  
Your opinion is not others' opinion.  Bitcoin has nothing to do with being anti to "excessive government spending".
It's a goddamn fucking currency.  People who are money hungry are, quite honestly, too stupid to understand that **wanting money does not mean money influences what they want**.
Do you hate government spending?  Then why would you be happy about a presidential candidate advocating Bitcoin?  Is logic like.. gone here?
I can't tell how many people posting in are legitimate.  Critical thinking is not prevalent here.  
is the place to sing praises of Paul talking about Bitcoin.  This is **not** that place.

Actually I'm just going to talk to people who put forward points with evidence and critical thinking on their own without being so lazy as to beg for Google, thanks

This guy is getting a lot of free advertising today.

Um.. that sub is pretty garbage, yes, but I think the fact that bitcoin donations have been in PACs for at least a year a bit more relevant here.  Rand Paul has nothing to do with being "first" and no one in this thread seems to even be questioning the story.
Hate to say it, but just creamed itself over its own buzzword.  That's a very thing to do.
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:07:08
Even more irrelevant.  Anyone who got PAC bitcoin this year could announce their primary race tomorrow and fulfil this "requirement".  
And by the way, due to the nature of PACs, this information is 100% unverifiable

Um, again, I have to reiterate that Bitcoin has nothing to do with any political ideology.  It is a currency.  
Any overlap is conflation.  In other words, people are pretending Bitcoin has anything to do with ideas.  Bitcoin **is not libertarian**.  It's almost infuriating to see this happen with such a promising concept.  You really can't go anywhere without people haphazardly tying ideas to innovation these days.
@_date: 2015-04-20 13:23:54
If a currency officially aligns with a political field it has already failed.  Bitcoin isn't going to fail.
People here are trying SO hard to stick Bitcoin with libs.  It's not the real world.  For fucks sake, read the sidebar.  Read the wiki article.  Just *read* in general.  Something outside the echo chamber of this subreddit.
What's going on is that libertarians in this sub are using Bitcoin to advertise their political beliefs.  This is the lion's den of libs &amp; bits.  No one speaks up because of that.  I truly wish the mods would eradicate the political posturing.  
Popular subs have to implement the rule "no politics" because of this kind of bullshit.
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:04:45
was the last place I thought would eat up Paul's lip service because he keeps saying the word Bitcoin.  I was truly wrong.  
Ignoring this guy's inhumane political stances because of money money money, Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin, makes me believe this place is just... well... a shill sub full of shills.  :(

This thread is honestly tripping me out for the exact reason you just stated.  
Bitcoin donations have always been accepted, they just have to be converted to cash, and that is *not* changing because Rand Paul decided to do an interview.  The CNN article is false.  No one seems to care.
Check out this link:
This is when the FEC unanimously "approved" bitcoin donations last year.  Bitcoin donations were **not** illegal before this decision!  This was just a committee reviewing whether to ban them.  The only concern was limits on individual donations, which are unfortunately already skirted by PACs with multiple small donations.
It's honestly a bit depressing to know no one fact checked this stuff and this thread is bandwagoning like crazy because the word Bitcoin was used on CNN.
