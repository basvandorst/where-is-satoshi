No it's not that, my point is we are experiencing some emergency cases like health and accidents or unwanted situation that we need money right away... If you have Bitcoin ATM around then there is something to used to cash out your Bitcoin even in a lower price, I think some ATM offer there service to their user... That anytime you can make transaction with them if you needed money for emergency situations... Because not anytime we are not having enough money with us...

One reason why we want to use Bitcoin ATM machine is to withdraw easily, when we need money during emergency times, specially if this ATM is operating 24 hours a day because almost most of the outlet or banks are closed during night and you can't cash out from your digital wallets.

Exactly!!!! That's one reason why they offer this kind of service also, fast withdrawal is there point... Now it's up to the user when to use them.... And for me that is for emergency cases!!!

I know that also my friend my point is sometimes the most you trusted on times of need sometimes have their problem when it comes to technicalities... Either on both side, since you know maintenance often happens, when you come to encounter such situations then at least we have third choice.... Just imagine you have pencil case with pens and a pencil. Suddenly pens were become useless all of a sudden... At least you have the pencil to use for a moment while you buys new pens from the store...
