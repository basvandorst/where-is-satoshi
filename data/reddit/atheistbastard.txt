I just got verified on mtgox yesterday and now this (lurker, but learned a lot).
Getting paid tomorrow and putting some money into bitcoin.

I got my first coins on a local exchange last week, bought 0.09 BTC
It's dropped in value, but it's money i can afford to lose so, not caring much either way.
I hope this is the down before a long trend of ups.

As a skeptically inclined guy myself, what are your "favorite" topics to debunk? 
Homeopathy? 
Anti-vaccination nuts? 
Ghosts? 
Aliens? 
Any others?

Interesting to know, thanks. 
In my country I had to submit copies of national ID and a tax authority statement that I'm not in the system with any known tax cheats. 
Among some other docs of course. 
This is all for an NGO

Not familiar with laws in US , but wouldn't founding an NGO / foundation require you to provide some legal documentation? Like ID?
So someone in the government knows who Satoshi is (by process of elimination) ? 
It's not that I care, I'm just curious.

Is the banking landscape in US that bad? 
Transfer between my own accounts is instant, within the same bank : instant. 
To other banks : same day if within cutoff time. 
Swift / SEPA take 1 or 2 days.

I've seen instant payments across banks discussed (and even offered)  in the EU landscape. 
Poland does it for example. 
But I don't know if the consumer cares, I'm not seeing a big rush to do instant payments elsewhere.

There are security features in GSM. For SMS M-Pesa uses USSD.  
It's not password based, I think you send and sms to a number and then punch in a pin. 
Takes seconds and it's extremely popular in Africa.

I highly doubt STK which is used for mobile banking is insecure. 
Same goes for USSD and the most interesting part is that this is all several seconds of connection. 
I think it's fit for purpose and probably deemed secure enough.

Same Wikipedia article says this :
The user interface technology of M-Pesa differs between Safaricom of Kenya and Vodacom of Tanzania, although the underlying platform is the same. While Safaricom uses SIM toolkit (STK) to provide handset menus for accessing the service, Vodacom relies mostly on USSD to provide users with menus, but also supports STK.[17]
