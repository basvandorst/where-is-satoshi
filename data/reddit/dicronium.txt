There are 29 forks of bitcoin as of writing. The vast majority are scams and attempted pump and dump schemes. There is no practical way to consider forks as income for people. People writing software cannot create potentially unlimited tax liabilities for people. It has to be treated differently. A 0 cost asset or some other classification.

It is evident that bitcoin gold is a criminal enterprise and stealing money and pre-mining. Your position on this is naive. You expect people to get involved with a criminal operation to steal money in order to sell their assets to cover supposed 'income'? If I create some software and make one of the private keys for 50 bitcoin platinum be the password to your gmail account, have I just given you income of 50 bitcoin platinum at its market price on the first day?

If someone creates a fork of bitcoin and arbitrarily chooses the former public addresses that will contain the values for the new currency, they may attribute vast quantities to certain holders and relatively tiny amounts to newly mined currency. They may also have complex time-based adjustments to the value of the currency such as extreme inflation. It may be designed in such a way to have a huge initial value but rapidly decrease over time. People will in many cases not learn about such forks until a significant time later, if ever. At that point, you expect them to amend their return to pay income tax on someone's financial experiment? And then they have to only recover a loss on capital gains when they eventually realize about it and have to sell that coin? If the coin is called titsuckalotcoin, you are forcing them to get involved with someone like that just to get some of their money back from your naive interpretation of income tax?

Presently, the news is treating it as $500 income tax for that scenario. The IRS will likely pick that definition up unless people advocate for a more sensible approach.

They can charge penalties if late. Current news is reporting it as a taxable event.

It seems to be the majority method reported in the news. Could be just attention seeking, but without strong arguments, the IRS will gladly take that assessment because it results in the largest income for them.

'you fed' implies an action on his part to receive the gold. That he made income. Somebody chose to create a gold cloning machine and named him as a recipient of that gold because he holds that particular private key. Someone might come along at any point and create software that lets the owner of a particular gmail account get a certain amount of money. This is no different. That is a gift. The owner of the gmail account has the key (username/password).
