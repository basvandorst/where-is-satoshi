thanks man:)

the point of the latter would be choosing to support bitcoin economy instead of USD economy for ideological reasons. Currency's strength is tied to its usage

And with centralized mining it will be a lot easier to hit it for the status quo financial and political system

at first i read the amount as 5 Bitcoins. I thought you must really like the article.

I agree, but wouldn't it still be appropriate to encourage the readers in here to move to another exchange to weaken MtGox's market share and improve the network resistance against such Ddos as today? 
I mean surely market split 70% Mtgox 30% other exchanges is worse for bitcoin overall than let's say 50 % Mtgox 50% other exchanges.
Sure, all the others can get Ddosed as well but say if Mtgox was hacked that would surely hit bitcoin more than if Bitstamp was hacked.

exciting news, but is this subreddit really the right place for it?
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:33:33
any plans for adding litecoin? would be great to have both my btc and ltc in the same wallet

please don't support mars-one. it is a media company without aerospace industry people that hopes to buy all the stuff from other companies and pay for it by big brother reality show on mars. it is dreamware.

There will come a day when rappers brag about how much bitcoin they have you'll see :)
@_date: 2013-07-12 08:19:52
That is true. I really hope some companies sell majority of their asics but I'm pessimistic

The price of bitcoin/usd doesn't matter for him if he uses bitpay. The power of bitcoin is in people accepting it. The price drop didn't change that one bit.

i bought for 220$/BTC 12 hours ago :/. I could get twice as much bitcoins now..
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:12:25
I disagree. I don't have the means to create ASICs I just don't know how. If I was able to make them I certainly wouldn't sell them because they are money making machines. I would only ever sell them for more bitcoins than I expect them to produce and no one would buy them at that price. To conclude the only guys doing asic mining will be companies that create asics.

this picture's design reminds me of old soviet propaganda posters. not saying that as a bad thing, who doesn't love propaganda posters :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:10:39
How does that affect Bitcoin? I don't follow.
@_date: 2013-07-13 09:21:17
Stocks. I want me some Tesla stocks and It's too complicated to buy them from Europe
@_date: 2013-05-28 13:20:46
i wasn't meant as a conclusion really. If you think mars-one is legit i recommend to read their AMAs (they did 2) or ponder the fact that they require 30 bucks for registration for "astronatus".
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:57:18
while I'm happy they accept bitcoin, if you are thinking about donating, read their [AMA]( first. This company has little chance of fulfilling their promises, don't waste your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:06:43
damn, yeah figured as much. I always planned that I will move my btc out of coinlenders the next month then the next. Guess that it serves me right for being lazy and naive. Nothing else to do but learn from my own mistakes..
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:42:54
And fail to crash the price.
@_date: 2013-07-10 10:17:26
Look at it this way. In an inflationary currency each month your money is worth a little less. It may so happen that USD rises in value any particular month but as a general rule your dollar value keeps going down by design of the currency.
The opposite is also true for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:46:56
a bitcoin is arbitratily divisible man..
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:25:01
if it outputs fiat currency then it is an ATM and there are generally many more regulations about ATMs than vending machines :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:33:11
well my Grandma keeps bothering me on facebook, skype and google+ for what it's worth :D
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:42:17
Tech savy will benefit most. Everybody benefits from a deflationary currency no matter when you get in your money will be worth more a month later
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:12:18
looks pretty neat :)
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:14:49
Which is sort of the definition of a tax evader anywhere isn't it? Just the name of the people on top changes..
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:35:37
How could it possibly hurt?
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:54:17
elaborate? I don't see how this would influence Colored Coins.
