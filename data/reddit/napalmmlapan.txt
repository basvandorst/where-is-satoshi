The Hodlers are here. They remember. 
This is literally the first stage of what we all wanted. BTC is in the media, people are taking an interest, word is spreading faster than before. 
The worst part about the world adopting bitcoin and blockchain is that the other 99% will have to adpot it. That means we will have to explain to soccer moms and old men sitting on their porch and that 12 year old starting to save money from mowing lawns or prostitution or whatever it is 12 year olds do these days. This isn't just miners and silkroad anymore.

Anyone else having issues with Kracken this week? Right now, withdraws are disabled. Last time I saw this, it was bad.

1. You have 0 idea of my financial situation.
2. Fuck off. 
3. I don't make bets with money I'm not willing to lose.

I mean, I hope I'm still not paying student loans over the age of 45.

The early adopters have the mentality. Right now, this subreddit is in chaos due to a flood of newcomers. Wait it out and you'll see much more discussion about the future of bitcoin and it's potential on a global scale.

Not really. 
It all comes down to the rate of the interest on the student loan debt from a given payment amount vs percentage increase on investment of the same investment amount. 
Let's  assume I have a loan for 5,000 dollars at 3% interest annually. I have 500 dollars extra. I could either put it towards the principal or invest it.
Case 1: I put it towards the principal and my annual interest is $135. 
Case 2: I invest the 500 dollars. I pay a total of $150 in interest. If my investment can make more than $15 dollars, this path will be profitable. 
For someone who has bought/sold bitcoin since 2012, I was fairly certain that case 2 would be true and my net profit in the investment would exceed the interest paid over time. 
The complete collapse of bitcoin was considered an acceptable risk. All else fails, I lost my investment amount and move on with life. All succeeds, I pay my loans off or run to a foreign country and start new. 
I simplified this case. In reality, you'd also weigh in the term of the loan and net interest saved over the entire term. However, that requires exponents, which I am currently too lazy to use since it's nearly 5 pm on a Friday. You'd also consider the fees involved with trading and equipment.

I did the opposite. Ignored student loan debt to buy bitcoin. So far, the unrealized gains far outway the intrest I'd have paid on the loans. 
Or we wait for the government to collapse and run to foreign country and never pay back the student loans. That's definitly not my plan. Nope. 
Edit: Immediately noticed I replyed to a comment instead of the post. I'm lazy, so I'm leaving it.

Damn. I'm in Dallas or I'd take you up on it.

It was a disgusting video. Gave my nightmares for weeks. It counts. 
So what if he didn't technically finish the ball. He made far enough.

Personally, I'm buying alt coins until the correction hits. There will always be price fluctuations but this seems like a bull market. 
My plan is to get alt coin on the cheap, hodl bitcoin and probably in December/January  buy more bitcoin.  
Let's not act like ETH/LTC are worthless though or that we haven't seen a bitcoin bubble before. 
Long term to the moon. Fuck FIAT.

Fair enough. I just dropped a down payment on a house, so that's my excuse.

Y'all can thank me for the rally. I sold some partials last night. 
Good news is, I sold my initial investment. So now I'm just playing with profit.

Can confirm. I math good. I spell shit.
