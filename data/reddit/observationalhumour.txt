Well first of all I wanted to know how many I had, but I didn't know how. I also wanted to know how I could send the coins elsewhere. No need to be so confrontational.

Happy for you, man. Can't imagine that feel. Oh wait yes I can, I mined 1BTC then stopped all those years ago.

Grats! I found my wallet from 2+ years ago with exactly 1BTC in it. I turned that into 1.1BTC (lol) on sealwithclubs.eu, but that .1 is still like $20- unbelievable. It makes me sick to my stomach to think how I stopped my miner for good after 2 days mining with a 9800GT. At the time it wasn't profitable. QQ

Captain Hindsight strikes again. Buy now if you want to get involved.

Same mate. Have a look at litecoins ;)

Last time i checked, BTC transfers are far from instant.

I got out of here ages ago, don't look back. I just heard about this ridiculous top post and had to see for myself. BTC might be worth $10k this time next year, today's just another day.

Ha I'm not that stupid, I managed to start mining all those years ago didn't I! I'm debating just playing bitcoin poker with the bitcoins I have.
Edit: Thanks for the info btw!

Try harder at typing.
@_date: 2013-03-16 10:42:06
Everyone else seemed to understand. Maybe you should have tried harder in school.

For me, student debt is the one thing i don't worry about. I pay a very small fraction of my debt off each month and it isn't offset against assets or a factor on my credit rating. This is the last thing i will do with profits but congrats all the same.

Aaaaaand BUY!

I can't remember, I'll try and find out later tonight. I don't think it's anything to get excited about!
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:42:17
2BTC! Can't complain.

Seeing as you seem to know what you're talking about- is there any point in mining any more? I have a nvidia GTX 560ti now which I know is inferior to an ATI card so it's probably not worth my while at all. Just thought I'd ask!
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:12:41
Ha I can tell you now that I don't, but now you've got me all excited before the inevitable disappointment! Also, shit, they're in my dropbox!
