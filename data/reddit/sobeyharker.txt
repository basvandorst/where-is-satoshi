Blockchain was the wallet I went with. 
Acquiring was really tricky as I needed some bitcoins fairly quickly for this guy and as I'd already left the office I didn't have any ID/etc for the work card. Luckily though skrill + localbitcoins.com I found a way around that.

Wow, awesome response!
I'll look up on those options from that site you linked. Thanks a lot man, appreciated!

To buy them? Not initially if you don't have much understanding of how bitcoins work and where you can get them from. Last time I knew much about bitcoins you could only really get them via a mining rig. Didn't realise they had taken off as much as they had.

Whoa you shouldn't tip me man I've had more than enough support but it's appreciated! This can pay for someone else to get a pizza though so I guess we'll send one more out because of you you wanna pick someone? :)

Really should. Going to buy 2 now and see if it works fine and if so I'll go from there. 
Edit: Why the fuck is 2 bitcoins like $500...bollocks. Oh well. My boss is totally going to love this.

localbitcoins.com is pretty much your saving grace as you can use payment transfer options set by the trader.

The U.S has AVS in place which means as we don't have a U.S address our cards don't work.

I don't know much about wallets. Why is that one not so good?

Actually learning quite a lot about bitcoins. Interesting stuff.

No go :&lt;
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:58:27
Well how else can I buy them pizza?

Cheers, appreciated! :) 
Don't worry about it though I can see why - having people coming in and ask all these questions over and over must get annoying.
