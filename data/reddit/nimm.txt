You're way off with 2^2048 , Bitcoin ECDSA sk is 256 bits meaning it can be broken in 2^128 time, which is still infeasible to break.
You were probably confused with RSA where 2048 bit keys are common, but you're also wrong there, because it wouldn't take 2^2048 time to break (the whole reason we use such large keys with RSA is because integer factoring can be broken much more efficiently than by brute force).
No idea what specifically you refer to in your additional note.
@_date: 2012-09-24 05:27:38
you're partially wrong: it's true that you need 2^160 iterations to bruteforce the privkey from the address hash, but you only need 2^128 iterations to recover the privkey from the pubkey (the pubkey resides in the blockchain after the address spent coins at least once).

What's the status of the android tablet product line that you planned to sell for bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-09-24 08:20:03
what you said is correct, but it doesn't cover all the scenarios: take for example the common scenario where you have some address with which you receive payments (from mining pool, or from your customers), so even if you spend all the coins, after you receive the next payment you'll re-spend from that same address (if you're paranoid you can e.g. give each customer a different address each time, but bruteforcing 2^128 iterations is also infeasible anyway).

Mathematical solution that gives ASIC resistance? Yes, memory-hard hash function:
@_date: 2012-09-24 14:38:09
it's a collision attack for a discrete log problem, we can disregard that it's with elliptic curves for this argument: given g,b we want to recover x that satisfies g^x = b (mod N), so write x=y-z so that g^y = b g^z (mod N) and enumerate random sets { g^y_1 ,..., g^y_n } and { b g^z_1 ,..., b g^z_n }, and therefore if n&gt;sqrt(N) we find a collision between these two sets w.h.p.
@_date: 2012-03-17 18:28:00
you're way off... secp256k1 privkey is n=256 bits, and (unlike AES and other symmetric encryptions) all known pubkey cryptosystems have sqrt(n) attacks due to their structure: simple example is RSA with n=pq therefore using sqrt(n) iterations of division attempts you can find either p or q by brute force, though in the case of integer factoring there are better attacks.
so the strength of secp256k1 is 2^128 , though in bitcoin you get 2^160 resistance to attacks if you never use the same receiving address twice (unless someone listens on the network and tries to attack in less than 10 minutes).
@_date: 2012-06-22 15:57:20
With RSA bruteforcing (non-naively) by factoring n=pq takes min(p,q) division attempt, so if the privkey is 2048 bits then the time complexity of bruteforcing is 2^1024
We can do much better than bruteforcing with RSA, but all known PKE systems can be broken in 2^sqrt(n) time where n is the privkey size (unlike 2^n time with symmetric encryption like AES). With ECDSA we don't have non-quantum attacks in less than 2^sqrt(n) time, so 256 bit keys are secure.
It's be easy and safe to do protocol change in Bitcoin so that the miners would respect a more secure privkeys option, when it'd be needed.
@_date: 2012-09-24 12:42:46
ECDSA privkey is 256 bits, can be broken in sqrt(2^256) due to the birthday paradox (actually Pollard's rho algorithm, to avoid 2^128 space complexity), there aren't better attacks as far as we know.

nah, it was incoherent nonsense... he could have said exactly the same thing about gold: people can spend their time and energy to mine for gold, then use it as medium of exchange (gold has desirable properties for this purpose) to trade it for other commodities that they wish to obtain, or alternatively spend their time and energy to create their own commodities or services and trade those for gold, so overall the value of gold is set according to supply and demand in the free market.
reading this basic explanation might also be useful:  
regarding what he said about the fed , it's true that they loan the money that they create with interest, which mean that the supply of money has to expand (i.e. inflation) unless people default on their loans.
@_date: 2011-06-24 22:53:05
His point was that gold has value because of industrial/jewelry use and because of unique scarcity/divisibility/non-rustiness properties, and that fiat dollars have "value" because of a different reason, namely that the government forces you to use fiat money to pay taxes. On the other hand, bitcoin doesn't have those valuable properties (bitcoin is not scarce in the same strong sense as gold, because you can create additional distributed networks such as namecoin). What Peter Schiff misses is that bitcoin has other valuable properties that gold doesn't have, namely being able to transfer it anonymously without any control by a central authority. Peter said that he plans to have gold bank accounts for his clients, and the ability to transfer gold electronically, but obviously you wouldn't have anonymity as with bitcoin.

if improvement is needed because of cryptographic security concerns, then assuming that it's broken gradually, you could patch the original bitcoin network by releasing a new official client that everyone needs to start using at some point in the near future. For example, if ECDSA is broken in theory, each user could generate a more secure pk/sk pair, sign the new pk with his old sk (which no one else can do because it'd be a gradual process untill ECDSA is actually broken in practice), and by being the first who broadcasts the new keys signed by the old insecure sk, he retains possession of his electronic wallet.

Put the address that the bitcoins were supposedly sent to in  and see if there's any transaction history for that address.
Then make sure that your client has this receiving address, and that your client downloaded the entire blockchain (easy to see in bitcoin client 0.5, and with 0.4 or below verify that the block count in statusbar corresponds to latest block in

If messaging is supposed to be a useful addition then it can be added to Bitcoin too via a soft-fork, there isn't any difference between adding such a feature to tenebrix and to Bitcoin because tenebrix forked the Bitcoin codebase like the other altcoins.
Yes, ArtForz and Colin Percival deserve much of the credit, in fact Charlie does credit ArtForz in the source code:

With 100% reserve (as opposed to fractional reserve), the bank will lock your money for X time and give you Y interest after X passed, but the whole purpose of banks is that during the time that your money is locked the bank will lend your money to someone else (so the bitcoin address will indeed be spent by the bank).
@_date: 2013-08-11 05:55:00
True, but it's better to assume that miners will have custom fee policies in the future. Think of the extreme case where we don't use asymmetric signatures at all, you just reveal some pre-image value (meaning that it's not important that this value is a pubkey) to spend your coins. In this extreme case miners who use modified code will pop up immediately, because it'd be easy to steal coins by replacing the transaction that a user broadcasts with another transaction that takes the pre-image that he revealed but sends the coins to the attacker's address instead.
The bottom line is that if elliptic-curve signatures become insecure, then users who re-use addresses (for example a merchant who gives customers the same receiving address to send payments to) will be vulnerable, and users who follow the more secure guidelines and don't re-use addresses can only be attacked during the 10 minutes until their transaction is confirmed.
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:39:32
if you're curious then you will have to go into the analysis, if you care just about the bottom line then it's simply that if the market cap of the ppcoin network (without the centrally controlled checkpoints) was big enough for anyone to care then it would be easily destroyed by double-spending attacks.
You can see that whenever the actual protocol is analysed, the vulnerabilities become more obvious: 
And here is a thread with analysis of the source code:

How do you know that it will include cryptocurrency discussion?

Not really, deterministic wallets are provably secure against related-key attacks, see:
@_date: 2013-08-11 06:09:12
See what ravend13 and I said here, I hope that it clarified things a bit further.
Usually when a crypto method becomes broken it's gradual and still takes a significant amount of time to break at first, but if elliptic-curve signatures suddenly became completely broken (that's an unlikely scenario that won't resemble anything that happened in crypto research so far) then yes, users who re-use addresses will have their money stolen, and if the attack is so fast that it can be done in several minutes or less then other users are at risk too.

ppcoin is an obvious scam, all the clowns who try to pump-and-dump it have no idea how it works. If you analyse it you'll see that it's trivial to double-spend (see  it's just not worth the bother for anyone to care.
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:27:15
Even if you (the sender) personally don't care about your anonymity, it can be important for the merchant (the receiver) that his customers are anonymous.
Anyway, sending the change back to the sending address isn't even well-defined, because the transaction could have multiple inputs.
About those 90BTC being lost, here 7208BTC were lost in part because of a client bug: 
Deterministic wallets mitigate all of these concerns, have other features that are highly beneficial, and don't really have any drawbacks. So the entire discussion here is redundant.

read the "faster transaction time" section here:
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:22:08
no, ppcoin will always be trivial to double-spend because the protocol is defective, try to understand it and you'll see, it's not related to market cap (the only relation is that no one cares enough to do it because the market cap is tiny, even novacoin which is a scam that is based on the ppcoin scam appears to be more successful).
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:51:26
It is trivial to double-spend after you understand how it works, see the links that I mentioned in my other comment here: 
Not sure if he's a scammer or just emotionally unstable or whatever:

It's a bad idea both for the overall health of the network and to you individually to send the change back to the sending address, certainly as the default behavior.
The real solution to your concerns, that's being worked on, is deterministic wallets, where your master address can be used to restore all the derived addresses (so your initial wallet backup will always be good), see:

There was nothing impressive about tenebrix either, the mixing pool was supposed to be centralized (controlled by the millions of premined coins), in fact the person who launched tenebrix also launched at the same time another altcoin called "Geist Geld" with unsound 15 seconds block time, so his efforts didn't seem serious anyway.
Charlie should be credited with handling the launch of scrypt / 2.5min blocks altcoin in a fair manner, so that Litecoin is decentralized and sound, unlike the other altcoins that came before and after it.

Hardforking Bitcoin to upgrade the digital signatures crypto is indeed very easy. Just have a new protocol rule that says that starting at block  in the future the users are allowed to send their coins to the new variant (i.e. the output is redeemable by a new Bitcoin script op that uses the more secure signatures scheme), ask the miners to upgrade their client before block  and make sure that the majority of the miners upgraded, as was done with BIP16.
Unlike the SHA256 hash that's used for mining by ASIC devices etc., here there's no problem and probably no one will object to this change.
BTW if don't re-use your addresses then your in-use pubkeys are not reveal on the blockchain, so even if elliptic-curve signatures become insecure, an attacker would only have 10 minutes on average to try to steal your coins (by breaking the pubkey that you revealed in the transaction that you broadcast when you wish to spend your coins, before it was included in a block, and then broadcast another transaction with a higher fee that spends your coins to the attacker's address).
