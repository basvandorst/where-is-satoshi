No, sorry, I didn't mean you. I was talking about my initial comment where I said this is definitely good news, when I actually had no idea how this would impact bitcoin. .

Really? Downvotes for speaking the truth, even when it's hard to hear?...

Think about it like this: If you just baked some cookies, how many would you have after you ate a certain amount and then gave a certain amount away? 
3? Who knows. It's hard to say.

Sorry guys. I actually have no idea. Just making silly comments is all.

Okay, I'm an athesit. Therefore-- I, for one, am happy to see mt. Gox finally, and inconsequentially, be demised to a role less impracticable via the bitcoin world. Call me pedantic, sure; but don't call me anti-pragmatic. No. This perspicaciously meandering event will likely, and most probably, result in a more pure focus on what's at the height of true, and utter, importance for our community. A new paradigm, less grossly insignificant and inseparably occurrences which work only to serve those interests of self-misleading and misdiagnosis of bitcoin health, will be ushered in henceforth. 
In summary: It will, henceforth, allow the aggregate community to allocate resources, time, and energy to that which is most promising; and potentially productive. Bright days are ahead imho.

Looks like somebody forgot to log out of their main account before trying to up-vote their own post and author fake comments to create the illusion of interest. Tisk Tisk.
