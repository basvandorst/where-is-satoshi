My order that I placed on Tuesday has finally gone through.  Although I see my bitcoin finally I feel like bitinstant kept a larger portion of my transaction than deserved. They advertise one thing but completely fell through on their word when it comes to respecting me as a customer.  Bitinstant says "time is money." How ironic. Bitinstant should credit my account generously since they were not true to their word nor were they able honor the responsibility that comes with accepting a customers money.  I will be switching to Virwox.com as I suggest anyone else who had a similar problem with bitinstant to do. Thanks bitinstant it was fun while it lasted but I deserve better customer support as well as to be treated with respect when returning to do business with your company. I gave you my hard earned dollars for you provide me with a service but you fell short on honoring our agreement and when you finally "got your shit together" you didn't even have the decency to give me more bitcoin than I had actually paid for. In fact you gave me less because you waited so long for the price of the coins to rise and/or fall while I watched helplessly and hoped that my bitcoin would appear in the address that I provided. PLEASE BEWARE AND BE CAREFUL WITH USING THIS SITE. I WOULD SUGGEST DOING MULTIPLE PAYMENTS OF $50 OR LESS SO AT LEAST IF THEY HOLD ONE OF YOUR PAYMENTS RANSOM IT ISNT LIKE THEY HAVE ALL OF YOUR MONEY TIED UP IN CYBERSPACE.

Wow how many days does it take for anyone to get their money now?

I agree with this spaz0 110%. Although I am a little mad I am more relieved and curious at the moment. You think that after misleading soo many people that some form of compensation is in order but I think that is far from ever happening. It took 3 days for me to receive my coin which makes me sad because it was so easy before.  At the very least they could have credited our accounts with extra coin for the hassle and frustration that goes along with having your hard earned dollars held for ransom in cyberspace!

My payment finally went through. After 3 days of waiting. Hope yours shows up soon too. I do think they gave me less than I paid for though. Probably because of how long it took for my coin to actually appear in my wallet but the price of bitcoin most likely rose and fell several hundred times before it made it into my bitcoin address. Let me know if you notice that you received less than you paid for please. Good luck!

They should have done this from the beginning of the problem but kudos to Bitinstant and ZipZap for finally giving people refunds if they want them.

I received my bitcoin in my bitcoin address today. After 3 days of waiting so there is still hope for you my friend! If you notice less coin than you paid for please let me know as I think the value of bitcoin rose and fell several hundred times before they actually put the coin into my address.

I just made a payment of 239.95 processed by zipzap through bitinstant. I was depositing it into a bitcoin address. I received a Successful Payment email from zipzap but my bitcoin was not deposited into my account.

This is absolutely ridiculous! RESPONSDING TO MY EMAILS AND SAYING SORRY DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT I PAID YOU FOR SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY DID NOT RECIEVE. What I don't understand is that if you knew that you were too incompetent to put peoples bitcoins into their accounts in a timely manner then why would you have kept taking orders that you cant even process? That's what people call a scam. Good job over there at bitinstant; I have still yet to receive a refund or my bitcoin or even a real answer as to when I would receive what I paid for. The only revealing detail they gave me was "we definitely have your order;" so its good to know that you have my money but you wont do what I paid you to do with it. If this issue does not get resolved I am going to join the others who warn potential victims about how terrible the bitinstant customer service and support are and the fact that their webpage tells you completely false information about how long it takes them to do their jobs.

Just be careful I would start out by making payments of $50.00 or less each time. That way if there is a problem that needs to be resolved it wont be a big one.
