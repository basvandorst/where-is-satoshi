Similar to judging a book by its cover. Nice strategy bro. It might promote selective perception though.. eh who cares right? As long as you think you’re right!

What do you think is the percentage of people in r/bitcoin that can articulate their views intelligently without ad Hominem attacks. It’s certainly the minority. I’m guessing it’s in the single digits.

Well, we all know what they say about opinions

Hmm.. I learned about it in high school economics class 20 years ago. Not saying everything we are taught is true (Columbus).but just saying, I’ve known about the tulip craze before Crypto came around and people started comparing the two.
Also, the content in this article still stands. He mentions tulips in the beginning

The arguments presented in the article still stand. If they are drowned out by his sea of meaningless emotional statements, and you can’t sort them out, that’s fine. I brought forth something but it’s not to your liking. And that’s ok ����

I think it’s important to read opposing views. I think it’s good to be extremely critical of your own investment. I’ve never posted on this sub but what I’ve heard is, it’s fingers in the ears foot stomping ad Hominem when a critical article is posted. I see this is true. 
I scrutinize my investments thoroughly and read all opposing literature on it.
