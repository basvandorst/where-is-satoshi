Thing is you can actually download these maps for free all around the world and their main goal could be 'enjoy the most of our city and save your money'.  For me it just seems close to bitcoin idea, especially while these maps are usually seen on traverells meetings, couchsurfing events and so one..By age the main group of people interested in bitcoin, technologies and so.  What is the better way to spread it and explain than this? Yeah, you can send them 10 usd but you can save charges and send them some bitcoins)

their goal is completely independent summary of the recommendations of local people / students who get together and make a map - no paid recommendations that are common in other guides.
I do not know if it would be good to explicitly state all merchants who accept bitcoin, except in case that it was on the recommendation list by locals. 
The idea is rather to accept bitcoin (of course get some funds and expand) and include, for example a link bitcoin with mark to it on the map so that people who see and use the map know about it and ask or google it... this link might refer to some summary web with mention of coinmap.org for example..
The maps are going to pe annually updated, so there is always option in the future to change it..

Thanks a lot! I'm just friend of one of them who just found out what exactly they are doing and I was impressed! This idea just came up to my mind right away as a way that could help them do great things like this and also help bitcoin to expand.. Everybody wins :)  I definitely send it to them, show them the answers and also messages I got and help them get it together.  They actually didn't know about bitcoin much, just heard a bit but I will explain and and help with that..  Think they will like it.. And as someone said here.. Let's just see what happens then..  :)
