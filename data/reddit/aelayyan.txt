I guess you are right. You can only rely (to some extent) on the current charts.

Contact her then and make a $25 loss lol

Very interesting. Thank you for the link.
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:26:19
No thank you..

In which subreddit should I place this question then ?
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:45:11
I suppose you have a Visa card, enabling you to "instant buy". I have a mastercard and have to wait a week before receiving my funds (ridiculous from a trader's percpetive). 
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:28:44
Well they have your bank account information so they can simply contact the bank in such a situation lol
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:21:02
It's actually 1080p

Unfortunately not at this point. But we plan on adding a bitcoin wallet for ticketing purposes in future expos.

Does that mean that a verification process of the cc will be completed only when adding the card ? Whatever happens to the card after that will not affect the instant buy function ?

Thank you

We are currently looking into it. Will inform you when I have more information. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:51:08
You are right. I received 12 emails after 6 hours lol (resending too many times)
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:29:13
Yes, the weather isn't too great. It's in 54-100 at 6pm.
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:17:30
Are you coming to the Andreas Antonopoulos presentation today ?
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:11:32
