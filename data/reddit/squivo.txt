Without power? Hmm
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:13:11
All I’m saying is that without electricity the transfer of bitcoin is severely crippled. It doesn’t ‘fix’ this problem, in fact, the destruction of power plants is probably bitcoins biggest threat.

I've done it here in Canada - fees are basically 10%... but all I needed was cash and a QR code
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:26:47
It's for sure expensive if you're doing large deposits but it's not bad for $250 and under - minimum Quadriga deposit is $500 and they want 5% so... either deposit and start trading right away at a premium or wait and save up and spend less on the buy in.
Edit: I made a $750 at Quadriga for %1.5 fee just now

“Consensus decision making is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement between all members of a group. Instead of simply voting for an item and having the majority of the group getting their way, a group using consensus is committed to finding solutions that everyone actively supports, or at least can live with.”
Taken from seedsforchange.org.uk regarding what consensus means

The real win here is that people who would rather invest using lira, rrsp or tfsa money can get their feet wet in the crypto world. I might put a few bucks in actually

More and more I believe that btc is so valuable due to the amount of money invested into mining it ( combined with it's trustless secure dencentralized database ).
