Not sure what you mean by "runs bitcoindark", but jl777 is developing his tech using BitcoinDark and Bitcoin both.

I'm technical person building SuperMESH project. Don't like political discussions. I better invest my time in learning and using it to better the tech I'm building. If I don't find the argument backing fact, and more of an opinion, I won't answer it. As everyone has their opinion. I don't think I need to invest time in changing opinions.

Yes, Iguana is built from scratch.
Total independent full node of BTC can be made.
It does not affect which version other BTC nodes have, it will not have any issue with blocksize limit or forks etc.
Iguana will sync and act as a full independent node on BTC Network.
It's not just limited to BTC, and other Blockchains can be added to it with some JSON input.
For now Bitcoin and BitcoinDark are supported by Iguana.
Later you can name any Blockchain which supports Bitcoin protcol can be added to Iguana. Like I'll be trying to add and test Namecoin to Iguana, just to test and learn Iguana tech and API.

Light speed!

If you want to know HOW it syncs the FULL Bitcoin Blockchain in 30 minutes, head over to this [iguana thread on bitco.in forum](

[Gavin Andreson : There are lots of optimizations needed, and lots of ideas for best way to optimize. I am very happy to see things like the 'iguana' project that is single-mindedly focusing on techniques to improve performance](

That's James Lee (jl777). :D
He's the ONLY core developer of Iguana. And you won't find any other developer around who is as fast as him developing C code with multiple commits in a day.
He alone wrote 50,000 lines of custom C code in Iguana tech in around 8000 hours. The way he write codes is a compact C code structure avoiding new lines etc. If it was written without compacting C code, the code could have been 200,000 C lines of code.
On top of that a large percent of C code has been re-worked and much line of C code has been removed, which reduced the custom C lines of code to current 50,000 lines.
Being as fast as this C coding I understand one person won't have time to draft a commit comment when doing 10s or 100s of commits a day fixing bugs and issues, with also adding new code to it implementing new features in Iguana.
Iguana has more than 100+ features and improvements coded in it's C code over Bitcoin core already.
What you just read in CoreMedia.info articles SuperNET Weekly No. 1 and No. 2 only give you around 5% of the tech info which has been coded in Iguana.
It's that big project, and it's solving that much of problems in code.

MGW is finished project.
Many of the [Iguana Core APIs]( are finished and in debug and testing mode.
If you consider a GUI unavailability an incomplete project then true. Otherwise false.
As the Iguana Core APIs are mostly complete and are in testing mode, I'm developing tech on top of it already. I don't understand what 'never finished anything' means.
Either it's your opinion, or you are very Uninformed, or you are trolling. In all cases, nobody can help you, only you. Keep it as is. We get a chance to buy more cheap BTCD for longer. :)

It's really not just a wallet.
Saying Iguana is just Bitcoin Wallet is like reading first page of the book, and saying I read the whole book! :)

I wrote an article last year on IOTA and published on meshbits.io. I just came across this tweet today:
Bitcoinist.net (bitcoinist)
IOTA: Internet of Things Without the Blockchain?        
09:16 - 4 mrt. 2016
The image is taken from my article  which was written last year.
The image on the article is cropped erasing any reference to meshbits.io and mentioned in article as
"Images courtesy of Twitter, IOTA"
It should be "Images courtesy of meshbits.io, IOTA"!
Or DON'T use the image at all, use any other image or make one yourself.
I specifically mentioned on image to put reference link if using image. That's clearly violation of copyrights, and stealing artwork.
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:01:58
In addition to [code from github]( you can also find iguana core API here: 
Right now documentation is being written side by side by volunteers.
@_date: 2016-03-03 10:32:02
Plus, as I understand, the blockchain size can even be further reduced. the same bitcoin-core 0.12.0 pruning is not yet put into iguana, as for the first case a full node is good. when pruning is active the size of blockchain will be even less! :)

This post is just a small part out of many iguana features.
There are even more solutions being built in iguana. Atomic Swap is the latest work I know of.
And the next is [Atomic Cross Chain Asset Standard](

I don't care if people use my artwork anywhere without asking me. But, I care they mention the source. Or make their own original content to publish.

Disagree. Works.
I'll wait for that point. :)
Nice to read your opinion.

Thanks for your reply on this matter ManeBjorn.
I stopped discussing issue after image was removed. That's all I wanted. I don't have time to waste on texts/tweets/posts. I have much much better things to do than these useless discussions.
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:42:39
You are getting it right mate! An Excellent idea indeed. :)
@_date: 2016-03-15 21:39:46
IF you haven't tried the test code which is giving you result.
IF you haven't explored what has built and what's not.
Iguana is UNDER DEVELOPMENT platform. Many parts has been completed already, and are in debug and testing mode.
It's not yet open for public release. As it's GUI Complete will open to beta soon and people will be informed on all media.
If you want to test the Majority part of the code developed, you can compile it and try it yourself. Would be nice seeing more people testing Iguana.
If you are a user who can't compile and test, just wait till a build gets released for users.

As jl777 says it's about solving problems of Bitcoin and Crypto currency all together: "privacy, speed, scalability, adoption".
- Iguana is UNDER DEVELOPMENT platform already including many solutions and features in it.
- Iguana is full MULTI Blockchain Wallet.
Right now Iguana supports:
- Full Bitcoin Wallet
- Full BitcoinDark Wallet
- More Blockchain Wallets can also be added with some JSON configuration.
- It is BLAZINGLY fast!
- Provides Bitcoin RPC API
- Uses a lot less disk space
- One Click installer for ALL platforms through Google Chrome
- We are also working to support One Click App installer for other Web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, as many people don't want to use Google Chrome for different reasons.
- Also can run like a native daemon or service on any platform. Tested platforms are Linux, Windows, Android, Mac OS X &amp; iOS.
- On mobile devices it would not be sending queries to external nodes, as mobile device would itself can be a FULL Bitcoin NODE!
- There are 100+ features and improvements done in iguana core over Bitcoin protocol ever since its been in development.
- It's GUI is in development by a team of half a dozen developers.
- But iguana core has got a lot covered in it's core API already if you want to make an app on top of it right NOW!
- I can not cover it's all features in this small space. You should considering spare your 5 minutes to read on that article. I bet it would be worth taking a look at it.
- As it's GUI gets ready for beta tests iguana/SuperNET team will update it's availability on all media places. Specially keep an eye on [iguana child-board on bitco.in forum](

Damn! That's too long, and seems much techie. Like over my head.
What it actually say in summery? Can you please translate a bit on their tech lingo?

So, which algo is better other than Proof of Work?
Did they offer any solution to improve or fix the Proof of Stake algo?
What's DMMS?
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:48:25
So, Bitcoin uses DMMS for Multi Signature functionality?
Can't DMMS Multi Signature functionality applied in Proof of Stake Blockchain?
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:59:05
Thanks for answering my queries mate. It's good to know the good and bad things about the stuff we get involved in.
I'm not favoring any Blockchain or algo. Just trying to understand as little or more I can.
Not sticking with just one tech too much and diversifying risk.
I still think it's good to give InstantDEX a try. I'll wait for it's public release.

The database server is up again.
I forgot to add SWAP on server, and with loads of processes running database server went down.
Seems like I wasn't expecting much traffic before posting the link on r/bitcoin.
It was a surprise finding out people saying 'RIP database'!
The website is accessible over Internet, and Meshnet as well.
On Internet the address is: 
On Meshnet (Hyperboria network) the address is:
