There has been a second post about the [same topic]( already. Top answer by sums it up nicely already: 
„Highly suspect. Does this include "change" outputs in the "transaction value"? If not, then how are they determining which output is the change? It's not at all obvious in many cases.
If my entire PayPal balance were included in the transaction value every time I send some money by PayPal, then PayPal's total transaction value would be sky high too.“

cum hoc non est propter hoc
Correlation != causation 
In no way (and if just very little) is the number of Google searches related to the price of Bitcoin. The google searches peaked during the bull run end of last year. Now that Bitcoin drops to a one year low, the google searches spike again. 
This is - in my opinion - more related to the fact, that people are checking prices during high volatility periods than actual attention/rise of interest.

It’s probably vice versa and the google data is slightly delayed. Bitcoin prices hike and google searches spike as people search to check the latest price. Same procedure if bitcoin price goes down. People simply want to check the price.
