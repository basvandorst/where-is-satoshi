everyone has the same handicap so it's fine
their end balances will show is the best trader

he's former JP Morgan Chase, also look at the bowlcut hairdo he was rocking for years, a true clown

I missed out on $5 btc cause my retarded coworker made it sound like a prize for a math nerd competition instead of secure digital currency, so I dismissed it
I will forever curse him and his stupid glasses

its fun and generally true, it is useful to summarise the attitudes of large groups of people, an exception to the rule/trend does not mean a general rule/trend does not exist

the fact that he was still bullish right up to the peak despite the crazy growth is a sign that he doesn't really know what he's doing, also I remember him popping a champagne bottle and celebrating after the price managed to stay above one of his meme lines after the initial fall because he thought it was going to recover within a few weeks, of all people at the time richard hart was among the first to say we may be in for a 2 year bear market, while tone and the wcn were all thinking the dip was temporary

I want him to compete with other youtube traders in some kind of virtual trading simulation, everyone starts with 1000 fake dollars, then see who comes out on top in a year
it would be funny when fans bet on which trader will be most successful

he didn't even know you needed to run a lightning node to use it and still hasn't set one up, a pure clown
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:13:33
tone's opinion on anything other than TA is useless, just watch him try to set up anything tech related like a miner or a new laptop, a pure clown show
yesterday he slammed a 3D BLOCK EXPLORER for looking like a shitcoin without even reading what it was or finding out, the guy is clueless and thinks that if he doesn't know about something it's irrelevant or a scam
this same big nosed idiot also thought btc was irrelevant in 2011, listening to this guy will make you lose all your money and all of your hair
this technical genius knows if project x is scalable or not, despite having no coding experience and didn't even realise that flying all over the planet to give lessons in person is a really dumb unscalable idea
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:54:30
yeah by making everyone miss their 3k chance of a lifetime by expecting 1-2k because of meme lines
this clown was bullish right up to and after the peak in 2017, listen to him and you'll lose your savings and your hair as well
just watch his video of him trying to set up a miner, how can anyone take him seriously?
@_date: 2019-07-19 10:37:51
and remember how he was sure eth would be $0 by now? and that it would definitely be classed as a security token, maybe he tore some hair out over the SEC's decision, maybe took it out on his chess set
and today his laptop overheats, the endless tech troubles never ends for the technically inept clown with poorly informed opinions on technical matters
"I don't even know what this 3d block explorer is because I'm too lazy to read, but I'm sure it's a scam coin"
I hope someone compiles a 'tone vays is a scam' infographic one day to better inform people of his ways, the guy DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU NEEDED A LIGHTNING NODE to use lightning
isn't it funny leah doesn't show up on his show anymore, she must be tired of him repeating the same rubbish daily as well
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:18:34
maybe it can be done with daily charts, so everyone gets to make 1-3 trades each day and not have to worry about being glued to a monitor
also tone said he's not doing travel anymore

USYD is full of commies, normies and retarded unemployable feminists (future cat ladies) still 'studying' into their 30s, pay no attention
on the plus side, it shows just how clueless the average 'educated' student is, and how early we are
check out what USYD is hosting next month

what if govs became very aggressive with taxing investment properties and 2ndary housing? that'll push the grubs to park their money in metals or crypto and that will pump those to insane heights
and with 3d printed houses on the horizon, I think the days of slow working price gouging below spec tradies and overly inflated piles of bricks are numbered.
a house built in under 24hrs for $14k or a pile of bricks that's over a million, I know which I'd choose...
and that should be enough to end this boomer market, I think we're on the verge of seeing massive changes
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:39:23
is that some kind of joke country?
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:53:01
crypto, 3d printed houses and retirement will force boomers to change their boomer investment habits, but it may take time since they can barely use email

sigmund freud was a degenerate pervert who tried to project his warped views into psychology, his garbage theories have done so much damage to society that he should be expunged
@_date: 2019-10-11 22:56:17
I dont think TD is BS, but tone doesn't factor in many things which causes him to expect things that do not match reality, he doesn't seem to realise that a drastic news event can reverse a trend overnight
this is why GLD never went to 800 like he expected
and he will be dumbstruck when alts moon exponentially in the next cycle, he doesn't seem to understand human psychology, which is why BCH, ETH have not gone to zero like he expected

pretty sure that's how they plan to restimulate the economy during the next crisis and deal with the global debt, QE for everyone and to turn everyone into full blown slaves
UBI can work if the amount paid to each person is tied directly to automation (more robots = more for all, with full transparency and a proper feedback loop to modify rules for society as necessary, like a DAO instead of being done in secret behind closed doors), with competing UBI pools so they don't turn into super communist states that cut your payments for using the wrong pronoun or supporting the "wrong" thing

his analysis is not bad, but relying on it would be fatal
@_date: 2019-10-13 03:17:09
not a contradiction
he does raise good points, but he misses other ones which means you should not rely on his conclusions
I listen for the good arguments he raises, not for his final say

thats not quite true, he had an argument with that gary the numbers guy fraud, which is quite funny because the TD indicator is almost exactly like numerology, and neither of them got to really dig into how their systems work
and at least eric von daniken's theories are amusing, there's NOTHING amusing about making everyone miss 3k firesale prices because his meme indicator said we were going to $1800, we may never ever see 3k again
tone vays was also a DJ and geologist
it's funny when he claims to be a coder when he has never programmed a real application, and thinks that his indicator is a masterpiece which he spent 3 years tweaking with some hired guy (who didn't know what an array was), even though any 1st year student can program it on their own in a week just by reading the rules of the TD system
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:40:04
it's amazing isn't it, and most of them are technically illiterate and they got into crypto in 2015 or later
tone doesn't even know how to port forward, which stopped his full node mining adventure, he thinks you need a computer science degree to read the manual of a router lmao
