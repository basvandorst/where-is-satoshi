I have them on repeat all day.   So much wisdom in BTC podcasts. I love hearing about it from other perspectives and people that are 10x smarter then me. Can learn alot.

There's a whole bunch of great ones!  LTB for sure, YoumeandBTC, Cryptocoinnews, Decentral.tv... Mad Bitcoins, Bitcoin embassy... content for days haha.  Have fun! Great place.

Sweet! Never seen a redditpoll.  This is going to be handy.

I think it aligns with the general theme and message they are trying to communicate, but I feel ya.

Thanks very much for the review.  Haven't heard much about these cards, good to know.

I think Bitcoin is in everyone's best interest even if they don't like it or want to be apart of it.  Mastercards responses, banks taking notice... all means one thing.  they understand the power of a P2P/decentralized value exchange system, and I really think it puts pressure on traditional services to offer competitive rates, increased transparency and innovation in the banking sector. Could be wrong.

There are a number of great options catering to BTC-EUR transactions.  Here's 51 alternatives -    
   
Each offers unique payment methods, you can use the sidebar search to narrow down by payment methods such as cash, debit, credit, many credit unions and more. (Be weary using Paypal at anytime for BTC purchaases as users can reverse transactions relatively easy)
   
   
Locally, MyCelium local trader, Paxful and Local Bitcoins tend to have a number of local sellers around. These are preferred for not only buying with cash, but understanding who your are buying from.  Local Bitcoins has escrow, and a number of options for transactions.
   
Always remember to do a few google searches about proper security measures.  Cold storage, password protection and 2FA are a few ways to secure your coins.    
Keep in mind when you own a Bitcoin wallet's private keys, it is you that is in charge of your currency.  Start by downloading a wallet on the device you like to use and try to keep your funds in your personal wallet.  Bitcoin exchanges have their own security measures and sometimes are situated in places that don't require much regulation.  
   
If you are nervous about volatility, there are also a number of wallets that allow you to hedge / peg currencies, meaning hold your funds in regards to other currencies, USD, CAD, GBP, and more.  Have fun.  Feel free to send a PM with any questions you might have!

Awesome!  Sometimes it takes a while for the first BTC transaction to roll in from personal experience, but don't get discouraged it will come!  I know the community is very receptive of Bitcoin payment discounts, perhaps a giveaway or contest of some sort.  Maybe even providing a podcast or YouTube channel with a solid following a free shirt for a shout out on air or some sort of partnership.  You've got this!  Wish you the best with your business in the future and I hope you get some Bitcoin sales.  I will try to give you my business if I ever find employment =)
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:43:09
I have come across 9 of them, although for the most part it seems to be pretty consistent with fees. I guess at the moment we pay for the luxury of the card, hopefully it will improve with time and alternatives.

Just google around.  I saw you are Canadian, anycoindirect is great, there's a bunch of others as well.  Quadriga, personally I use Circle (very good for quick purchasing, I usually get nailed with a 5$ charge from bank, but for acquiring Bitcoin in literally 10 seconds, well worth it).  Here's a few more..   ... Sometimes it's a matter of confirming identity depending on the exchange, certain areas require more verification than others. In the past I found a trustworthy miner on the forums and it was extremely handy as well, just an interac email transfer anytime needed.

I know Roger Ver does quite a bit with his memory dealers billboards and such, they usually donate most of their ads to Bitcoin accepted space or a flashy logo.   It would be tough to find a happy medium between the Bitcoin ad and communicating your brands message effectively, and to the contrary there is a whole bunch of individuals doing their part in their communities.  I try to hang posters here and there but it's expensive to mass produce and there is no direct return so I ran out of money quick lol.  I think changetip has been pretty important in social media promotions but over the last few years, I think social media is quite saturated with cryptocurrencies.  It would be cool to see more Bitcoinbowl size sponsorships... Dogecoin car still reflects positively or generates interest which leads people to Bitcoin, and I believe the Bitcoin Jet is quite active in air shows... Not too sure though.  
   
Seems like the best marketing has been mass media coverage on CNN, John Oliver, News papers and such.  My 74 year old dad got super interested with BitGold's activity in the Herald paper and Northern Miner.  But in my head the best marketing is when a large brand gets on board or a traditional media outlet broadcasts a story (basically mediums that are not 100% bitcoin, and bring bitcoin into people's lifestyle instead of throwing a message at the that they don't understand or care about hearing)  
   
Oh and I started to advertise to telemarketers when they call I pull a quick reversal. "Thanks, very cool, so a quick question, have you heard of Bitcoin". They get super confused but it's fun.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:08:57
Would a solution be to purchase Bitcoin with an exchange, and hold in a Bitcoin wallet allowing pegged /hedged against a stable currency for the time being?

Oddly enough I was cruising this website this morning -   Seems like it's exactly what you are looking for, quote from the site  


    
   
If you try it out let me know! Very curious.  
   
Below you said you have workers, so it would be a great practical use for a wallet with multi-sig transactions as well so other employees can access the coins and you can build trust.  Perhaps copay for that, not sure if mycelium has it yet. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:20:59
Glad you asked. Some good suggestions in here, can't wait to bring some Bitcoin's down to Vegas soon.  
@_date: 2015-06-29 01:18:50
Good ol' paper wallets lol.  Never had enough money for anything fancy, would rather purchase more BTC when it comes around.   But there is definitely a whole bunch of great alternatives. Here's a few if you are in the market for something - 
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:53:37
Cons: Consumer - Barriers to entry in New York.  Unpredictable future regulation in certain places.  Lack of accurate information / concentration of dated information.  Lots of misinformation in general.  Lots get involved without learning the associated risks.  Security is 10x worse if you don't bother to research it.  You can't spend it everywhere yet.  Negative connotations from previous events, some people look at it negatively, that reflects on the person who is talking about it to some degree.    
   
Cons. Merchants - can be confusing.  Can be insecure for people who are unaware.  Can risk volatility if you don't stay ontop of the rate, or don't have a service offering auto withdraw. Can add to an overloaded checkout process which adds up, up to 60% of sales are lost at checkout, extra buttons can provoke a flight response. Distract user from purchase by interesting them in Bitcoin haha.
  
Pros. Consumer - Discounts offered because merchants save on processing. Set your own Amazon discount, many suggest 25% at purse.io.  20% off ALL Starbucks with fold app.  There's a whole bunch more, Gyft 3% back on gift cards, Sierra hosts 20% off hosting I think it is.  Less sign up forms, simply send to the Bitcoin address, no need to sign up for additional services in most instances. Manage your own account completely, no need to rely on ANY service other then purchasing them.  Own your account from head to toe with a personal wallet.  Transparent, with the ability to anonymize through certain procedures.  Decentralized.  Encourages financial, technical, economical innovation.  Removes barriers to entry for people like you andme to create services that interact with Bitcoin and (or) the block chain. Puts pressure on traditional services to offer better rates, transparency, freedom.  Added security to personal financial accounts, for those who understand and utilize security practices.  Remit / send currency to areas lacking financial infastrucuture. Send / receive currency globally at a FRACTION of a FRACTION of a fraction of the current rates charged by traditional accounts.  It's convenient and works with personal software on all devices.  Send off chain over social media with accounts like changetip.  Monetize your blog for micro donations very easy... No waiting for business hours to access currency.  No 3 business day cheque holds. Travel with a consistent rate /currency.  Distributed and consensus driven.  Algorithm is predetermined, nobody can just cahnge inflationary rates or anything as a central bank has the power to do.  It's fun.
   
Pros. Merchants -  Save 2-5% on transactions from traditional processors like credit companies and such.  Save on nasty chargebacks which can cost up to 10% annually.  Accept Bitcoin right to your wallet if you are somewhat tech savvy and can work with a little code, no service needed.  Extend to international consumers.  Multi sig is a great way to manage accounts between multiple parties. ie. 10 people can each have equal say in an account, each have to verify anything moving.  Block chain, great way to involve consumers with promotions.    
   
Just a few!

I am suggesting about hedging / pegging to another fiat currency.  Bitreserve, Coinapult and Coinjar, 3 alternatives that let you deposit Bitcoin and hedge against other currencies, Bitcoin provides an easy avenue to do this.  Why would i suggest buying Bitcoin to peg with Bitcoin.

No tips for me! Came to say happy cake day! But there's been a lot of new people coming in here lately.  For someone who might be in r/bitcoin for their first time, what would your  piece of advice be =)
@_date: 2015-06-29 01:28:07
Personal wallets, typically the ones you download, the ones in which you are in control of your private keys, and there is no intermediary service means it's up to your standards what happens with you Bitcoin and the level of security.  I will never go against coinbase, they offer great services for the right people, but as noted already, it's still a service, and at the end of the day, if something bad happens it's up to their security, their terms of service, their privacy policies, and their organizational decisions.  A personal wallet such as mycelium leaves you in complete control.

This is insane.  Have never run an illegal website, nor plan to, and I have no rights because they want to curb... what exactly?.  You pretty much waive any personal privacy whatsoever to run a website.  The best part, is without due process, without warrant, without anything.  I have put a whole bunch of time and money into my website and I feel like this is a huge kick in the nuts.  Why should creating a website wave your personal rights as a human being completely.  Here, use our services, your just going to have to sign away any rights you may have, have had in the past or will in the future. 
      
   
  
The email from GoDaddy:  
   
I’m alerting you today about a potential new policy that could impact your personal privacy online.
GoDaddy knows that as someone who uses our Domains By Proxy privacy service, you value protecting your personal contact information online – and we value it, too. Unfortunately, there is work underway at ICANN, the governing body for domain names, which will set new restrictions on privacy services like Domains By Proxy.
The restrictions are intended to target spammers, criminals and other bad guys, but providers like Domains By Proxy already have proven systems in place for addressing unlawful activity while balancing the privacy needs of our customers.
The overwhelming majority of online activity is legal and legitimate. However, **the proposed restrictions would treat all domain and website owners as guilty until proven innocent, thereby requiring us to turn over your personal contact information (home address, home phone, etc.) to anyone who makes a claim against you – without a subpoena, search warrant or due process of any kind. The doors to your confidential information would be propped wide open**
The good news is that it’s not too late to change ICANN’s course. ICANN has opened a window for public comment on this program and is seeking input from the public. That’s where YOU come in. I encourage you to learn more about ICANN’s proposal and make your voice heard by signing the online petition to protect domain privacy at

The banks probably also told you upon sign up that they would never close branches and ATM tellers on a Monday, or for a week, or place emergency limits on withdrawl, or limit access to your funds. I guess it depends how much faith you have in the current system that from the outside in, isn't looking very trustworthy. But in all honesty, just providing a quick point that came to my mind... regurgitating what I am reading online.... Kind of interested in the faith your message has in a system that is currently failing.  Care to expand, maybe I have missed something.

I love this coinapult. Thanks for sharing, haven't seen it before.  I love the ability to peg currencies, although I don't use the feature, i think it is a huge step for people who are curious and scared of the volatility.  Is there any other alternatives you have seen that allow this?  Sofar I have coinapult and coinjar but I think there's a few others.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:37:42

You changed your comment 100% from what it originally said. Nicely done, you can edit comments. Step 1.  Step 2. Leave a trail of edits so people can respond accordingly.  It really makes you look like a jackass, almost like you don't even believe your own bullshit! What was that about a market research?  And your original comment referring to be as a stalker for clicking your username. Mind expanding? Maybe even reposing your original comment?
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:10:55
Bullshit?  Your fucking mentality is BULLSHIT. Quit fucking focusing on people who live in the spotlight.  You have devoted a whole bunch of attention to degrading someone who is quite active in this space  and has done really nothing wrong but own a good domain.   
Where is your website? where is your content? What have you done?  You would rather devote your day into spreading negativity about someone who lives in the limelight than actually contributing anything positive yourself. Enough said.  
Actions speak louder than words and I see what you are good at. A whole bunch of nothing.  
  
absolutely, the guys track record isn't perfect, but guess what.  GOX is done and has been done for a while, that can't be taken back.  The website is on a good domain, your going to really cry about someone elses domain and what they do with their website... Ok.  the nickname, that people use for him all the time, i guess fuck them too right?  Buddy, the world would go alot smoother if you took the stick out of your ass and did something positive instead of slandering peoples names because you are butthurt you don't decide what goes on the bitcoin.com website.
  
Plenty of domains out there. Don't feel like it's communicating the right message? Change it with your own website, but don't hate on people because their content isn't up to your standards. Nearly every popular Bitcoin communication medium has advertisements. Actually, please name a few that do not promote certain brands, ears are open.

Shit, if you don't like it, go buy a domain, and make your own.  I am not to sure what is so hard to comprehend, and why people need to attack the figures that have put a lot of time and work into this place.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:47:07
Which "seem" for "newbies".... Really? Seems quite subjective, opinionated... And if it wasn't on Bitcoin.com,  but another domain, I doubt this would be a discussion. You are angry he has a good domain.  Nice.  The best part about this place, is you can either buy the domain, or buy another one, and start you own website, with your own, more "accurate information". Up to the task?   
  
  Have you been around the internet?  Have you seen all the Bitcoin websites? And THIS is the one you have decided is shady? Really?    Did you happen to click see more wallets?  I would imagine not.   
    
Yea, I have seen his Gox video.  And people make mistakes in their life, which that was clearly one of them. Going to hold it over his head for the rest of his life?  Well done, that is definitely the mentality to promote in here (sarcastic as fuck / rolls eyes)

Hear ya loud and clear.  It's tough to judge.  I have been unemployed for a very long time, and this is the only reason I am up on current events, foreign exchange and the financial system as a whole.  Ask anyone else in my social circle and there is a 0% chance anyone a. Cares enough to discuss the circumstances b. Thinks I am not nuts.  People work long hours to pay their bills and although it's been tough finding employment, have learned a shit load more about how the world works recently then ever.  I completely understand the average joes view point on these issues, because there just isn't time for most of the world to devote towards these subjects.  Most would rather put their time in from 9-5 and relax afterwards, not consider global crises and a flawed financial system. It's kind of sad to think about, but it doesn't really seem like anyone cares until it hits the point you bank closes and the ATM's won't give you any more money.

Soo, is this the future of Bitcoin?  Convince people to use it and then realize if they aren't active redditors they are going to get fucked eventually?  I feel like we have to be able to use Bitcoin without people needing to come on to reddit on a daily basis just in case your wallet stops working or your transactions are going to be in limo all day.  So of 92 wallets I have found, 1 is sufficient... I love this place, but it isn't realistic or  feasible to think that joe shmoe is willing to stay up to date on reddit just so he/she can spend and hold their money.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:35:30
As far as I can see... This seems to be present in nearly all forex markets.  The best part about Bitcoin, it's not illegal.  But I have a lurking feeling that exchange rates are constantly manipulated based on trade agreements and external influences such as large corporations and trade agreements.  We're in a day of transparency and this stuff being publicized will keep growing.

Hindsight is nice, but I would imagine he was around this neck of the woods long before you. Whether or not I am correct, I challenge you to tell the fine people of this thread a few ways  or how you have brought more people into and grown the Bitcoin ecossytem in a better positive direction?

@_date: 2015-07-06 14:54:04
Welcome to Bitcoin, where reddit has advertisements, bitcointalk has advertisements (which are mostly gambling) and so does EVERY OTHER WEBSITE IN THIS SPACE.  If you are still here and haven't realized everyone who is contributing here has an interest to make money, you should now.  It's not THAT big of a surprise. It's actually no surprise at all, the surprise is the people who are still baffled by it.    
PSA: If you do not like the promotional content of a Bitcoin website, probably don't go on a rampage against the owner, perhaps suggest a few things or a minute of your time, or god forbid, get off your own fat ass and create your own informational outlet to teach others.    
Wait, take initiative, that goes against most redditors ideologies, they would rather bitch and moan in comments about what others should be doing.

You believe that everyone should somehow magically understand they need to run Bitcoin core. You know how many people use Bitcoin that aren't sitting here everyday?    
   
You and I have discussed a number of issues in here before and every SINGLE time, ***every single time***, all you do is look at the situation from your exact situation, the way you see it, your personal subjective circumstance, only your eyes, absent that anyone else exists in here at all. Fuck you need to take a look at life through someone else s eyes, just one time, there is a whole bunch of people who are not here, or the bitcoin-dev irc. Get real. You wreak of inability to understand anyone but personal self...  There is people. who do not sit on computers, forums and irc channels all day, that really exist and really use Bitcoin.  Cut them off everytime something like this happens. Cool.

Biggest scumbag of all of them.   The very last thing I did was promote that guys fundraiser for mental health after a fellow redditor called it quits.  Next day, gone with everything.  Sickening. There is a special dirty place for people who prey on communities. They will find it soon enough.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:28:46
I believe it is also a community funded site with a number of donations?  Has roger been receiving his donations to design what the community would like to see, opposed to being a domain owner that has the freewill to do whatever with the site? I still am feeling a number of individuals who wish they had the free reign to do what they would like with the domain. Unfortunately that is not how the world works and I would imagine roger would be more than willing to accommodate ideas if they weren't presented with pitchforks and demands. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:33:18
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone.  Best epi.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:39:50
The only comment that actually makes sense in this thread.  People, Bitcoin is about innovation and the ability to contribute. If you do not like it, buy the domain, and create your own website. You don't have the money for it? Probably because Roger was here a long time before you doing what he could to grow the ecosystem. Crazy eh? 
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:13:31
Frustrating.  I had the same go around with Circle closing my account for no reason.  No answer for a week until I emailed them an essay about PR best practices and how a financial service should have less than a 24 hour lead time for a response.  told them I ran a Bitcoin directory and would gladly share my story, email response within 5 hours.  I think it will get better with time.  Keep me updated. Hope everything works out for you.
@_date: 2015-07-05 03:10:03
It's definitely a foot in the door. This is why I get confused by people with such a hate for it. Bitcoin's success at very least puts pressure on financial services to improve their services, increase transparency and decrease fees, even for the people who don't use it. But for some reason, they find hate. Provides motivation to wake up everyday and share the noble word.

How is he shady?  What is wrong with doing what you would like with your own domain?  There is 100000 million shady things in this place, just because a persons. And running a personal Bitocin website to generate revenue doesn't seem to be one of them. Why because he has a good domain? Get fucking real.
