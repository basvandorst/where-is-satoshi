Where do I find the private key? And I did copy the whole folder into my d drive. Should I do the same with the shortcut and delete the new folder it created?

As long as it finds the coins after the new wallet finishes syncing. I had 3 years of block chains left when I set up the address and had it sent. This new version should find the coins?

I never backed it up and I don’t even have a wallet.dat. And the only thing similar has the some contents as the new one. I think I just have to take the L

Yeah I think it has. I’ll just take the loss because now I can’t even get core to run without a ton of errors. At least I’ll get 200 gbs back when I uninstall!

I have not but I don’t think that would have happened. I copied and pasted the address the original wallet created

Awesome thank you so much. Really appreciate it!

Nope. I tired using the dumpwallet command to dump the contents of the copied and pasted wallet but i just kept getting errors

Okay I see. So I just have to figure out what my private key is 
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:58:46
Alright I’ll try that. Because it did start a new wallet. However it synced the block chain to my d drive and just finished yesterday after two days. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 04:14:36
Well the wallet downloaded, but what took so long was the syncing. I sent it before it finished syncing and I didn’t have 200+ gbs on my c drive.

I guess my ultimate question is if I’ll have my coins once it’s finished syncing since it created a new folder. I set up an address in the original wallet and had coins sent there. I’ve read that it’s not possible to “continue where you left off” after changing directories. Using windows btw. I’m fine with waiting for it to sync from the beginning again, I just want to know if the coins will be in the wallet once it’s done

Okay thank you very much. Like I said I just started all of this and I didn’t know if I needed that exact original file that I created the address to get the coins. Coinbase said that my transaction went through to that address. Does this all work based off of my IP address?

I did take it from the roaming folder. The wallet in that folder is slightly larger than the new one. I pasted that wallet into my new folder. But now after some messing around I can’t even get the program to run. So I’m just taking the loss and considering it a lesson well learned
