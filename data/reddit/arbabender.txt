Thank you! :)

Thank you very much for the information! I only have a few scatterings of bitcoins, so I will take the advice given from you and a few others here and try some of the suggestions out.

If I had an iPhone, I'd definitely give it a go, but sadly that's not the case. I do have an iPad mini, but it tends to sit around increasingly gathering dust as iOS gets more and more hardware hungry with each new device.

True, it is a very broad question. I'm more so looking for information on the different types of wallet to better inform my decision. I guess at this point in time it's a bit of an experiment for me, though if it gets to the point where I can legitimately consider using them for purchases then I will definitely do just that!

Oh cool, thanks for the clarification. Maybe if you noted that somewhere during that step it might help in being transparent about it? It may be noted somewhere else on the site already, but I can't say I looked particularly hard.
Thanks for creating a nice, simple introductory resource for new users! :)

Why thank you!

I guess that's a valid option too! Do you have any personal recommendations, or are there any wallets that stand out to you?
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:49:58
Indeed, so definitely worth a look then. Thank you!

So compared to other similar wallets it offers better security? It seems to be a more 'all-encompassing' solution that operates on a lot more platforms than some other more dedicated solutions. I'll be definitely giving it a look.
Thanks :)

Thanks, I'll be sure to try this!

Thanks, I was looking for an alternative with a nicer interface!
