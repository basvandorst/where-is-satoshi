Ok not sure WTF is your problem.  I've made a few million dollars from a small business I started.  Never been sued, extorted, nor fined.

I just can not believe that.  Can it really be harder then say opening a payday lender store?  Every joe schmo is opening one of them, they are no where near 7 figures.

I've been interested in setting up something like this myself.  I have the money, servers, and web dev skills to get something like this going.  I am just having problems finding out about MSB rules and reporting rules and all that nonsense.

I'm also having issues.  Have two transactions that haven't done anything.  1.2 &amp; .011 both with fee paid, been 12+ hours.

And that is $7 million in bonds, not the amount you have to pay.

I've had ~2 bitcoin stuck in limbo for 48 hours now.  Just had most of it go through in the last few minutes.   
Now trying to get everything to bitcoin-qt and its been 2 hours since I sent with 6% Network Propagation.
Shit like this  destroys my faith in bitcoin

How are you exporting from blockchain?  If I go to export and then download I see all the  encrypted data, but it never downloads.  So I hit the send to email button and the the .aes.json file got emailed to me.
Now Im in multibit I choose the import file, enter the password for the import file. Is this the same as my blockchain password?  When I click unlock nothing happens or changes.  Then I click import private keys and the import button is now greyed out but nothing happens. 
Any Tips? Thanks
seems to me issues such as this will keep bitcoins from ever taking off.

While not helpful for you I will say that I just got paid $1500 in bitcoin for some after effects freelance work I did.   Kinda awesome to have 10+ bitcoin burning a hole in my wallet.   The work was for a company that deals with bitcoin so it was easy.
