The last lockety lock was to promise that they would perform this lockety lock. 
This lockety lock is to promise they'll do some segwity segwit in 2 weeks.

If you check [here]( you can see it's about a 500 USD difference at the time of this post.

Yeah! If you click on the exchanges on the right side you can see the graphs for each exchange. The Chinese ones that you named are there as well

That might be something worth debating. However, it should've been something you brought up in your r/btc post. Saying something like "both subreddits are toxic." All your r/btc post implies is r/Bitcoin, exclusively, is toxic.

I believe he said the bitcoin network is doing 3 txs per second and Visa is achieving 2000. Based on those general numbers it seems to be on the scale of 1000x, so 1GB blocks.

I think it was a mistake on his part he meant "bigger chain" vs "bigger block". His point is as follows:
1. Two blocks are created.
2. Another block is mined off of one of the blocks.
3. The nodes with the orphaned block still hasn't realized there's a longer chain elsewhere in the world (or it has, but it still needs to download the new blocks to validate this).
4. The hashing power to overtake the part of the network believing the orphaned block is legit is a much lower hash rate than attacking the entire network.
If you understand 3 (I don't believe your blockchain is longer than mine until I download it and validate it) you'll understand why a block size increase can cause step 4 to happen.

I wouldn't say that. They do typically acknowledge the issue, however, their counter argument is that it isn't a problem we need to worry about **yet**. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
