I know this man personally. What should I tell him? I'm panicking for the safety of his and my families.

I can get into contacting the Nakamoto family easily because I have contact with Dorian's nephew. Is there any way that we could get a lawsuit going? Will we need the original res photo? Thank you very much.

How strong of a case would he have? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:31:08
Yes, I am serious. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:29:12
The difference is that this man may not be the holder of a fortune. Those wealthy people you talk about, I'm sure, could have made preparations for potential attacks. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:09:19
Fuck, thanks, I'll see what I can do. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:23:26
This is a little different though. This involves a substantial amount of money.

Honestly, you need to spend 5 minutes with him. Both of his brothers are very forgiving and kind, but he will irritate you to no end. He is an  intellectual, yes, but intelligence never is an equivalence to amiability.

I am in line with his brothers. Satoshi is very secretive and is likely to not tell anybody anything. I just clicked on a link that had his name and was in utter shock when I saw his picture.

I am in contact with his nephew, if you guys are serious. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:25:50
Thank you very much. If he says anything, I'll let you guys know.

There is a reason why his wife prefers to go by "Mitchell" rather than Nakamoto. I don't know what else to say, although if you're curious, you could just ask.

I forgot they mentioned that because Newsweek referred to him as Satoshi numerous times. I didn't call him Dorian because I didn't want his common name out there. 
If you're questioning me knowing him, his mother references to him as Satoshi in their household. She does the same with the brothers and their respective Japanese names despite them having Americanized ones.

As of right now, I prefer to not divulge any information, per the family's requests. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:59:04
Should I call the local police? What do I say? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:53:51
Nice to see that I represented reddit nicely. Yikes. I am glad to see that Dorian has denounced Leah, though. The nephew and sons will be glad to see this day over. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:25:35
Shit, I'm worried about his mother too. She's a very dear person to me, and this is absolutely worrisome. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:18:35
I recall seeing his name before, but I chalked it down to coincidence. Then, I saw this article, AND HIS PICTURE. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:49:44
I have posted in the original bitcoin topic. I know the man and his family. I will update you guys if anything happens. I can tell you that he is already being harassed by the media, and they are overwhelming his mother (who is a very dear grandmother to her grandsons). 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:49:36
Hello, I am the contact for the nephew of Dorian. I have notified the family. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:05:23
I do not know about his thoughts on the government, but personality wise? Yeah, he is an asshole -his brother is spot on. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:47:09
If you knew this man, you wouldn't suspect anything. His home and means of living are BEYOND humble. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:35:50
Would he have grounds to sue that model train company? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:14:50
His nephew said to me, "I just want some tuition money, man".
