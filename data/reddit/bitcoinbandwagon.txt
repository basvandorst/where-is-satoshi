Absolutely… Yes!  Someone just posted RedCross as a target… and I wasn't even thinking about it.  Right now… I'm just letting the followers climb and I'll throw one at RedCross.

Call em what you want… but you might be the only guy on your island when all is said and done.

Notice you called them Bits and called it whatever… Sounds like your subconscious has already solved the problem… bits it is.  :-)

It's happening… if you notice… Bread Wallet and KNC Miner wallet on IOS have a default setting to "bits"  And…. Coinbase allows users to decide to denominate in bits… (not a default option)  I say… If a few more wallets and and if Coinbase gets their head out of their you know what… It just may happen soon.  Just need the price to jump to 10k…. then it will be automatic…. Because people won't like mBTC cause cheap things for sale will be too many .00???? past the decimal point.  IMHO  :-)

You are marked down!  :-)

If they do… I'll ask to come work for them.  hehe

How many minutes should I be looking into it?

I have Netflix on my list FO SHO!

I'll ask… and let the followers support me.  I'll keep it active and lively… It's kinda my character.  :-)  Would be awesome to have 1000 followers and have the power to go to someone like GNC and say… HEY!  1000 followers and I would like to know if you plan on accepting bitcoin!  :-)  and a few followers reply to tweet.  Might be enough to turn one corporate head.  Besides… I'm not hear to save the world of fiat… If I convince one company, I had fun!  :-)

These are good ones… I got them down.  I was just thinking of dunkin donuts too!  
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:16:45
I have a few in mind… Right now I'm just playing with it to see where it goes.  Strength in numbers!
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:04:50
I'm writing em all down.  
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:05:38
How else do you communicate to big wigs way up on the corporate ladder?  :-P
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:03:18
It came to me last night… I was like… if a large group of people used one channel to nail some of the middle sized businesses… it might be a good argument to accept sooner than later.

one different company per day.  Specifically call out to someone higher up.  Today was Men's Wearhouse CEO Douglas Ewert

Lets hope so!  Cause I'll be a bitcoinaire several times over.  I can't wait for the media to start identifying some of us as bitcoinaires.  :-)

How come BreadWallet, KNC Miner Wallet, and Coinbase call them bits?   Isn't bits a lot easier?  The average person can say bits sounds like pieces of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-08 21:19:29
LOL!!!!!  The whole industry has changed since this was made several months ago.  Why would I fork over 27,000 bits for something old like this video?  Would have been willing to pay the premium price when they completed it several months ago.
Why pay for it now when you can see some really neat youtube videos that say basically the same thing for free?
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:51:00
I know… I'll retweet it with an edit… they never responded yet. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:46:23
Actually… bitcoin is inflationary right now… USD inflates slower than USD at this time.  Long term if this was much later and USD was still inflating at the same rate… I would reply with 2+%  Because as USD inflates… BTC is deflating because people lose private keys and other shameful satoshi destructive  acts.
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:05:58
No one is calling them micro… People use bits… Bread Wallet, KNC Miner, and Coinbase are calling them bits.  Besides… it's easier for the new adopters to put 2 and 2 together and think of bits as pieces of a bitcoin.

Submit them here for now… or on my twitter… I'm just winging it and committed to doing this for a year.  Just need followers to comment and back me up when we get a response.  Just need someone to be out spoken for the silent numbers patiently waiting for bigger business to know we exist.  :-)
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:04:29
We need both… The more companies that accept… the more publicity.  More publicity = more users!    :-)
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:37:33
Do what I do… Lets say I have 10 whole bitcoins…  If I spend $100 worth of it… I immediately buy $110 worth of bitcoin, so that way i'm nut cutting into my investment, I'm investing a little more into myself, and I still get to help merchants accept.
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:41:11
There is no comment on bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:03:31
I agree… working on it… thanks for catching that.
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:01:10
I agree with you  :-)
