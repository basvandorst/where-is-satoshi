So, you're never going to buy a single computer component ever again?  Ingram Micro sells EVERYBODY'S products.  Seriously.  Name a product, and I can almost guarantee you that they sell that product or something from that vendor.  Autodesk, Apple, Dell, HP, Adobe, Lenovo, Hitachi, Seagate, Western Digital, Logitech, Microsoft, you name it.
Just about anyone you can think of is going to be purchasing stuff from Ingram, by the way.  NewEgg, Best Buy, CDW, Insight, PCM, TigerDirect, Frys, virtually every single company that sells anything to do with computers has an account with Ingram.  Why?  Because they are the big player that purchases massive quantities of product from manufacturers, driving their purchasing price down lower, which improves room for profit on a channel-seller's end, at the same time making the channel-seller able to provide competitive pricing to its customers.

From what I'm gathering, he used the username "altoid" to announce Silk Road, then further down the road, he used the same username on the same website to send out the request for help using an email address tied to his IRL identity.
Basically, one mistake 2 and a half years ago blew his cover.

Correct, they obtained access to his private key and transferred the coins out of wallets controlled by DPR.
