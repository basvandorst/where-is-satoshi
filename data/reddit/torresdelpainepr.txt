Newcomer questions here: Common attributes listed when describing the benefits of bitcoin are that you can do transactions which are: free, lighting fast, and of basically whatever size you want. These attributes seem incredible and I love the resulting implications if true.
However, based on my understanding, the way transaction fees work in the bitcoin system undermine all three of these attributes.
My understanding is that when you initiate a transaction you set the fee you are willing to pay for it. The miners will work it into their hash if it makes sense for them (in a video I watched the speaker said as high as 10 cents). Otherwise, the transaction will sit around for a while until it gains enough priority for being old that it gets worked in.
A transaction is not free, you have to pay a transaction fee.
 
A transaction cannot be as small as you want (bitcoin is touted as the perfect tool for microfunding--small microfunding won't work if there is a ten cent transaction fee).
A transaction is not instantaneously fast. It has to be picked up by a miner to be worked into the hash/blockchain. And it won't be picked up if it does not have an adequate transaction fee.
So, is my understanding correct in terms of transaction fees and transactions getting 'picked up' by miners? How will transaction fees change over time with increased traffic, halving of mining reward rate, the end of bitcoin production after 21 million cap is reached.
This is all very new to me, I have been on a reading watching rampage since yesterday to try to understand this fascinating technology but I feel my grasp of it is still very shaky.
