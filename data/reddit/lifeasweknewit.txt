I wonder how many BTC you guys have who freak out over a small drop. Looking at BTC in terms of minutes, months is not worth it. You should be looking at it yearly and question yourself "what has changed? is it going to disappear? do I believe in bitcoin?". Once you answer those questions you can determine if this is for you or not.

 Think my ledger defaulted to a small fee. Is there anyway to cancel it and resend it with a higher fee?
