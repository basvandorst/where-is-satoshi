No, they want everyone else to so they can make a profit. That's the failing of the entire btc community.

My God you are either on the extreme spectrum of autism or being willfully ignorant. You know exactly what I mean when I say stolen money, not in the technical legal sense of the word as in I can sue them, but in the general sense of the word as in they are taking my money. Stop being literal to the point of retardation.

Have a great day yourself, I'm glad you're ending the conversation as we were taking it too seriously. It is just an internet disagreement after all. :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:36:21
This is really good information, if it ever happens again I will definitely look into it.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:49:00
lol! I means you're nomadic (move around frequently, have no permenant place of residence) and work online.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:56:50
Because they allowed it to be sent, and then refused to let it be withdrawn. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:36:51
I leave it up to the person sending me money, I never had a problem with paypal before this.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:24:53
What false information? You're really getting up in arms about me complaining about a service...
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:41:52


Like a lot of people who make money solely online (and thus use paypal) I travel frequently and no, I don't have a permenent address. Is that a damn crime? I verified my bank account already, so this is *in addition* to the banks verification process, so you saying any bank in the world would do the same thing is irrelevant because this is obviously on top of that.
Also I already have circle and have never once had a problem... I didn't even have to verify my identity on circle let alone my address, all I had to do was verify my bank account.

No actually, but i'll check him out in the future if I need another one.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:32:36
I did, the "back and forth for weeks" part of my post should have made that clear.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:51:42
It's like you didn't even read my response to your last comment... In any case, if they're protecting themselves from fraud, why wouldn't they require that information up front instead of waiting until I *get a goddamn $1,200 payment before cutting off my ability to withdraw?*
It's one thing to require that upfront but to hold over a thousand dollars hostage with no warning and demand that I prove to them that I'm elligable to withdraw my own money is ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:53:42
Dude, if they think $1,200 is too large to be withdrawn, they *shouldn't let it be sent.* That's the long and short of it. If you disagree then we just have to agree to disagree.


Lol, sorry, I'll dumb down future posts for you.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:46:03
I think it's funny how I have to commit a crime to get past a process they put in place solely to "stop crime." The only way for me to get past their "fraud prevention" was to commit fraud, haha. It's be funny if it wasn't so annoying.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:12:12
I shouldn't have said literally, but you're being a bit autistic here, I think the meaning of what I said was pretty clear to everyone. What's the point of being so pendantic? Saying I can't complain about a company because somewhere buried in their TOS is something that gives them permission to hold my money hostage is a bit ridiculous, the TOS are 37,000 words of dense legal jargon, longer than Hamlet, and I doubt even 0.1% of people who sign up have actually read them. There is a reasonable expectation for companies that they won't try to rip you off blatantly.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:35:24
Didn't lose much, the time it would take for me to download photoshop let alone learn it would probably cost more in my time then it did to just buy one.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:08:36
lol dude why did you send me this via private message? 


@_date: 2015-01-02 17:51:20
Why? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:59:36
I'm sorry I didn't set aside several days to read and understand the 37,000 words of dense legal jargon that is the TOS, of course it's easy to find out the specific information *after* it happens to you, but they make no mention of verfication until it's actually in your account.
Here's an idea... if receiving over $500 a month requires verification, why not *stop me from receiving over $500 a month, instead of letting me receive it then blocking my account?*
In any case, of course they're not doing anything illegal, but does that mean I'm not allowed to complain about sub-par or immoral service? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:34:02


I have plenty of identification and have had CC payment set up for a long time, the issue is I'm currently traveling and they require *recent* proof of address.

Cool comment bro.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:17:31


You got the first sentence right, the second one wrong, I even stated I'm a digital nomad several times in this post. Congradulations on your detective skills of reading the first page of my comment history though.
Yes, they're going to extradite me, for faking an energy bill to prove that I am exactly who I say I am. Extradition is a big deal generally reserved for extreme crimes, it's not something they do on a whim. It probably wouldn't even meet the basic standards of dual criminality or jurisdiction just off the top of my head. I don't think they've ever extradited a person to America for a "crime" commited in Australia in the entire history of the countries relations, haha!


To operate in Australia, they follow Australian laws.
Take off the tinfoil hat dude.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:19:39


Prevent them from withdrawing my money to my verified bank account? Why not just stop the ability to send money to other paypal addresses instead of stopping me from sending cash to my verified bank account I've sent money to dozens of times?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:26:08
Oh I have several addresses where I can accept mail, in both Australia and the USA, the problem is the only documents they would accept were electricity bills, centrelink (australian welfare) letters, etc etc. Basically a bunch of shit I didn't have.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:54:32
You mean the 37,000 words of dense legal jargon absolutely no one reads? No, I didn't set aside a few days of work to read that. I know now at least...
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:57:19
What? My banks withdrawal limit on debit is 1k per day at ATM,  no charge. Unlimited amounts if I go to a branch.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:02:46


Alright, let me repeat myself because you seem to be pretty thick. If a large payment of $1,200 triggers a fraud alert, then *it shouldn't be allowed to be sent in the first place.* Allowing it to be sent and then automatically putting the funds on freeze is borderline fraud, although not explicitly illegal any reasonable person would consider that immoral.


Hell no, if they denied payment I could have asked to be paid in a dozen other ways, through a CC processor for example.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:38:53
If you know of a way to control your money yourself and still pay for things online besides bitcoin, let me know.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:00:48
I'm not very good with photoshop, it was only 0.1 btc for a professional job so with $1200 at risk why bother doing it myself?
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:57:53
Wut? If I have a malaysian bank account can I make $ this way or are you fucking with me?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:47:02


Everyone keeps mentioning the TOS. That's what makes what they did legal, not moral. 37,000 words is a full book's worth of dense legal jargon. To read it, let alone understand it, would take several full days of work. I would probably have to hire a lawyer to actually understand their TOS and it would be an expensive, time-consuming excercise. 
Of course I didn't read the TOS, neither have you, and neither has 99.999% of people who use paypal. I'm perfectly within my rights to complain about paypals service if I'm not happy with it.


It's obvious from your post you're not even aware what country I live in, let alone my name, let alone my identity. I'm also browsing with a VPN. Considering I actually am exactly who I said I am to paypal, I'm certain even if they would bother taking legal action against me (they 100% would not) they wouldn't get far and the punishment would be minimal.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:33:04
That can't be right, since it was logged when I logged in initially, before I pressed to try and withdraw the funds.
