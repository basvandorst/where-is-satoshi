This says nothing for the terrible security of Web forums and websites in general. The site could easily have been hacked and his password generating skills are useless.

Once again, the law isn't about practicality or actually stopping people from doing things, just vague deterrences and highly-selective enforcement. See the War on Drugs or the War on pirating movies/music. Or even insider trading regulation:

One additional point, in the bitcoin paper:


Also a Canada-ism.

Unless you're a merchant getting robbed for fees.

All three of them. Good job guys!
I gambled mine all away on those Satoshi bitcoin games. Don't regret a thing. I supported free market casinos!

This is how Bitcoin must progress. Slow and steady. A platform like this can't be the result of rocket like growth and instantly transform marketplaces. Much of finance is based on stable assured systems.
This is a good sign overall. Even if BTC isn't the right answer as a currency.

Hopefully the model train company gets investigated for giving her his email. Probably via social engineering.

This is what warrants are for. 
It's not asking a lot to require police to present evidence to a judge to prove they need to violate someone's privacy in order to conduct their investigation. It's a standard procedure in all western governments.
It prevents abuse and narrows the scope of searches to only what the police need. So it doesn't turn into a fishing expedition.

Cool. I was thinking of building something like this.
I might contribute some design help to the project.

We're still in the innovators phase.
If you're a "normal" person, I'd wait until the early majority to adopt the technology.

By taking risks like investing in new markets like Bitcoin, or new products like an Airline that doesn't suck, or starting a record label when you're in your 20s.

Done.

People think they know better than other people, so they interfere with other peoples lives in order to "protect them from themselves".
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:33:33
Which is odd because the media loves calling things that are not hackings hacking.

Agreed not just becoming "wealthy" but middle-class. "Rich get richer" is a fallacious statement in that context.
Power, political, and economic structures are to blame, not simply the rich. While the rich exploit those structures more than anyone, the average person is just as much complicit in engaging/creating these systems. The average person is just more forgivable because they think supporting/voting-in the systems are benefiting them whereas the wealthy are much more capable of knowing better.

Plus when things like 3D printing become accessible to everyone, things like gun control (when you can create your own) becomes nearly impossible.
Then you have drones which can transport nearly anything cross borders or in urban environments.
Unless the state starts to really suppress our privacy and other rights, the freedoms technology provides with trump any threat of Orwellian control of individuals.

Poor people can't do what? There's been plenty of stories of "bitcoin millionaires." They were poor before that.
Richard Branson was a lower-middle class kid in the 1960-70s.
Upward mobility is still possible, it's just way harder these days without a strong economic, financial, or regulatory environment. The achievements of neoliberalism at work (/s).
