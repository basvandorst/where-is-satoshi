If the early adopters are allowed to spend and invest Bitcoin the same way that people are able to spend and invest US dollars, then you will see the true potential of Bitcoin realized as a low time preference currency token of value that incentivizes people to work, save, and delay gratification vs. the consumption/instant gratification based economic model that we have now.  
Also, by spending Bitcoin on high quality goods, you will increase the overall Bitcoin network and get tokens into the hands of more people... In so doing you will also incentivize the creation of high quality goods and services that are made to deliver long-term value.

Historically speaking most renegades who tried to speak their own truth to power, like Jesus, Socrates, Gandhi, MLK, and John the Baptist, all ended up getting executed for rocking the boat too much.
More recently, weaker defenseless countries that have tried to undermine the USD ended up getting invaded by the United States. 
Stronger countries like China and Russia are now trying to undermine the USD, but those countries are also led by power-hungry politicians who won’t stand idly by and just let Bitcoin operate as a legitimate currency.

“You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole.”
The reason to buy Bitcoin isn’t because you think the price will go higher.

All of that is already happening under the current system.  At the end of the day, government just needs to allow companies compete without special privileges, stop printing money, stop running deficits, let prices adjusts downward or upward to meet demand until you hit a market clearing price, and most importantly let people choose what kind of money they want to use when exercising their economic freedom.

The Fed makes loans by creating new money out of thin air, which it is allowed to do by law aka American democratic consensus rules.

“Criminal” is a nebulous term. Yea, when drugs are outlawed, then it’s criminal to use them. When alternative currencies aren’t recognized by men with guns, then it’s criminal to use them. 
Obviously human trafficking and child pornography are a different story, and we should fight against those. But Bitcoin is probably the worst currency to use in that case, just ask Chainalysis. Instead, criminals are far more likely to use physical $100 bills to carry out nefarious activity.
At the same time, it’s not criminal for the Fed to print money backed by nothing more than their “authority” to do so.
What the banks did in 2008 somehow wasn’t criminal.
The endless wars waged by the USA around the world aren’t criminal. 
Meanwhile the US Treasury estimates $300 billion is laundered annually through the banking system, and all banks have to do to avoid criminal punishment is pay a fine when they get caught,which is rather easy for them to do. 
At the end of the day, Bitcoin is just screaming “give me a chance to prove myself”, but the IRS classifies it as property, so in order to use it for transactions you have to log capital gains every time you use it.... meaning if I buy a TV using Bitcoin, I become a criminal if I fail to report the capital gain. 
Using Bitcoin legally in this country is incredibly difficult, but nobody in power will even open their minds to a fair debate on the matter.
I appreciate your argument, but it unfortunately doesn’t fairly present the environment in which Bitcoin operates.

Pay rent? unfortunate fact of life necessity, we're all renters now... sucks prices are going up, but best to keep your overhead low, so be discerning about where you live
Buy insurance? very suspect use of money given that life insurance companies are built on government debt securities
Buy stocks? If you can find the right companies then it's worth tracking the stock market
Bonds? I mean it's gone completely upside down... negative interest rates in some parts...

I had 1 BTC at the beginning of the year, and I still have 1 BTC.  No reasonable person could possibly think there is a capital gains tax owed on this.  Your argument does rest on an appeal to the US dollar as a privileged unit of measure.  
I held my bitcoin, and then I used it as a means of payment with a willing merchant.  Why should the IRS get a USD denominated cut of that private transaction?
It amounts to a tax on free trade, and it flies in the face of free-market principles.
If you let people pay for goods and services with bitcoin without having to pay capital gains taxes, you would see more commercial transactions.

Lets say your company pays you a $5k bonus in dollars, and you decide to save it for a year.... and then let’s say the purchasing power of the US dollar increases over the course of the year.... at the end of one year, you decide to spend your bonus on something.
Do you have to pay a capital gains tax on the increased purchasing power of your bonus? The answer is no. 
Your argument rests on an appeal to authority and the primacy of the US dollar as a global reserve currency that is granted unequal treatment relative to any other currencies that people may want to use. 
The US Dollar gets special treatment relative to Bitcoin, gold, silver or any other non-dollar alternative currency . It’s as simple as that.

If you believe in supply and demand, then Bitcoin will only increase in purchasing power over time, because the supply is finite and fixed, meanwhile the total number of goods and services that can be potentially created from natural resources is in many ways still practically unlimited (for now).  
With more and more goods and services being added to the economy and only 21 million Bitcoins to account for it all, prices in Bitcoin would tend to decline over time.  This phenomenon will incentivize people to save their bitcoin and only purchase goods of the highest quality and value.  
If the purchasing power of your currency tends to increase over time, then in general you will be more willing to defer consumption on economic goodies, which is ultimately what needs to happen if we're going to avert an environmental crisis of epic proportions.
70% of the USA GDP is believed to come from Consumption.  This number has to come down or we risk great environmental harm to ourselves.

I’m just saying you shouldn’t have to pay capital gains if you’re using Bitcoin to pay for something. If you want to charge sales tax, fine. 
Make Bitcoin legal tender and accept it for taxes... the government should be open to accepting all kinds of payments, not just USD. 
We have to radically reimagine our tax code. Get rid of the income tax/capital gains taxes. Instead we should have a consumption tax where say the first $30-$50k of spending is tax exempt.

@_date: 2019-06-07 18:20:24
I think it's ok to consider second layer solutions, block size increases, increasing SegWit adoption, Schnorr, etc... they are all valid and natural avenues to explore and develop as Bitcoin evolves.  
But consensus should never be achieved based on appeals to authority (i.e. Satoshi's intent).  
Appeals to authority are fallacies.  Bitcoin's consensus should not be based on fallacies, just rigorous debates around the trade-offs between security and efficiency.  
Given that "cheap and fast centralization" has become an emergent property of the 21st century global economy, and also given that Bitcoin was unquestionably built as a radical protest of our current economic order, it just doesn't make sense that we should overly prioritize "cheap and fast" over "accuracy and security".  There has to be a balance, and right now we have strong consensus in favor of security over efficiency.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:14:29
Disagree that it is a centrally planned change to the system. I think the thousands of people who run full nodes would also disagree. You need overwhelming consensus to make a change to the protocol rules.

Good points.  Appreciate the commentary.   I guess to be more precise... rehypothecation happens with collateral assets posted by borrowers.  
Also agreed there is no clear claim on money by multiple parties... there is just new claims on new money created via the fractional reserve process... I feel like that's a better way to put it.  
To me, and you may disagree, the spirit of rehypothecation and fractional reserve banking is very similar.  The mechanics/nomenclature may be a bit different as you say, but in both cases you are increasing the amount of assets in an economy artificially either by lending out demand deposits on fraction (money creation) or by allowing multiple parties to claim full ownership/control over the same collateral assets, which multiples companies can claim on their balance sheet i suppose...
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:23:29
If that happens, then we will probably have moved on to a new kind of money.  Ultimately, people in power have nothing to fear from Bitcoiners or the rest of the 6 billion people on the planet who are unbanked.

If the price goes down and difficulty adjusts down, you’re still left with a practically unhackable decentralized computer protocol that developers are tinkering and experimenting with, Microsoft is building identity protocols on it. Lightning network continues to be built out. Twitter is funding full time development. 
Bitcoin’s value token transfer system doesn’t need a high price to exist, just sufficient decentralization and a critical mass of users/believers who won’t abandon the movement. 
The true believers in Bitcoin never entered this space for a quick buck... it’s always been about changing the world, not about getting rich.

It’s obviously not surprising the IRS would do this, but at the same time the Bitcoin community needs to get vocal about reforming legal tender laws if they ever want to see Bitcoin reach its true potential.
The IRS needs to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of tax payment. That’s what we need to be fighting for right now.

At the end of the day people have to think for themselves... if you believe a headline on face value then that's your problem, not the messenger... 
The point is that there is $1.5 trillion in cold hard cash abroad, but Bitcoin gets vilified... the potential crime that can be done with Bitcoin pales in comparison to what can be and is done with cash which is truly anonymous
Further, even if this headline is misleading, the fact is that the government and banking system is not a good steward or manager of money... look at the Pentagon and how trillions have not been accounted for
Look at social security and medicare which are bankrupt..
Look at repo where banks are given billions of dollars everyday
At the end of the day, I'm trying to spark critical thinking about money.  This article helps to do that...
You could argue that every article headline is misleading... that doesn't mean those articles shouldn't be shared

You’ll probably scoff, and this might be a crazy rant, but Christians have been waiting for Jesus for 2000 years and somehow that belief system still exists... The patience of Bitcoiners can’t be understated.... Bitcoin’s belief system holds even more potential for humanity than any of the current religions.... the difference with Bitcoin vs other man made social/religious constructs is that it is impervious to the whims and prejudices of any single or group of individuals... Bitcoiners have to follow the letter of the Bitcoin law... we actually have a platform/mechanism/tool/public utility that enables unprecedented empowerment to every human on earth... all they have to do is buy in... person by person, until existing authoritarian constructs are turned on their head...

It would be a complete waste of mining resources if miners colluded to do that. You’re right though, the attacking blocks would be valid until the rest of the network notices and forks from that chain, it would cost an attacker $1 billion dollars to achieve a few double spends at most and then have nothing to show for it beyond that. Conversely they could stay honest and earn bitcoin block rewards that would give them a benefit in the future... if they chose to attack then a POW algorithm change to an ASIC resistant algorithm would probably just decentralize the network even more and make the next attack even harder and make all those mining rigs obsolete
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:45:55

My point is that Bitcoin exists in part because our government officials have abused their power over money.... Bitcoin won’t change the government. Our government officials are not changing how they behave, and that is a fundamental reason why Bitcoin exists.

While I would welcome further growth and adoption, and I hope that happens, Bitcoin can survive as is. The community has reached a size that is sustainable on its own. 
The problem is legal tender laws. As long as governments can threaten the use of force or use force to collect taxes in USD, Yuan, Rupees etc.... then Bitcoin will never reach its true potential, because let’s be honest the Bitcoin community is largely full of pacifists who don’t have or want the military weaponry to challenge a government army.
If the US or China find out that you’ve created a lot of wealth without using the paper USD or Yuan they issue, then they will come for you, seize your property, maybe throw you in jail, etc.... 
The only other alternative I can think of would be if militaries/coercion service providers around the world stopped accepting government fiat for payment, but instead demanded payment for military/defense services in bitcoin or gold.

But there are steps you can take to mitigate your exposure to that risk (run a full node, paper wallets, hardware wallets, reputable custodians)
Government money transmission laws/regulations are partly to blame for what you’re talking about, so you can’t really blame Bitcoin...
We have to peacefully protest the government and change the hearts and minds of people in power in order to effect their change you’re looking for.
Bitcoin is merely a platform. It’s a door. We have to convince people to walk through it... sending bitcoin can be as easy as sending an email, but we don’t have email transmission laws that disallow people from sending emails 100 MB or greater
We have to change the culture, then change the law, then people will thrive in the new environment we are fighting for

You’re right... lending would be a much more sound practice where only necessary risks were taken. If the currency appreciates relative then all lenders will care about is preserving or slightly increasing the purchasing power on their loan principle...
If anything, Bitcoin moves us in the direction of an equity based growth model rather than a debt based growth model.... if Bitcoin grows into what I think it will, then the amount of lending will decrease over time and the amount of equity investment will increase. Equity based credit system will give everyone more skin in the game and do a better job aligning incentives.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:29:07
It's not fair for anyone to pay extra capital gains taxes/file IRS paperwork for using a currency (BTC) that they chose to buy with after-tax Fiat monopoly money...
Your entire argument rests on the simple fact that the US Dollar is a monopolistic currency that is given privileged status by the US government.  
If the same privileges were afforded to Bitcoin, we wouldn't be having this discussion, because I would be converting almost 100% of my paycheck to Bitcoin every month.  
If we wanted to be fair, then I should be able to declare a capital loss for every dollar that I spend, because the purchasing power of that dollar is declining over time, but that's not how this works.
I get penalized via capital gains tax for saving my Bitcoin and spending at a later date (because purchasing power went up).  
I also get penalized for saving my USD and spending at a later date because the purchasing power of the US dollar is constantly going down, especially relative to goods like housing, education, childcare, food, and healthcare, which are 3 of modern humans most essential needs.  
The government does everything it can to punish savers.  It's really as simple as that.

That’s why Bitcoin is so slow to iterate and so slow to increase its scale. Security is the number 1 priority in Bitcoin. 
Go read Inventing Bitcoin and Mastering Bitcoin. Based on my understanding someone would have to compromise every single node on the planet almost simultaneously... the amount of resources and planning it would take to pull off are crazy... the chance of someone introducing a bug into the Bitcoin software is damn near impossible. Honest nodes and developers would quickly update the software and probably just kick the bugged software off the network and start at the last honest block.
How would someone even be able to introduce a bug into open source software without it being quickly detected?
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:25:16
Yes a completely different model aka a more fair, balanced, and equitable model where the people who take the risk are actually protected. 
I’m not saying banks shouldn’t get a cut, but it should be a much smaller one and the model shouldn’t allow for the creation of credit out of thin air via fractional reserve banking. It all needs to be 1:1. 
Rather, credit loans should be structured as term deposits where depositors/savers can’t access their savings for defined periods of time, or until the loan gets paid back. Further, loans should be secured by collateral, to bring further support to the system and align incentives.

Our leaders and most upper-class Americans with power and influence are high on dopamine. Easy money, easy credit, reckless consumer culture, decision-making driven by instant gratification. 
The only thing keeping this runaway train going is how good we all feel from the daily dopamine rushes we get from an imperialist economy that allows us to consume things without truly working for them. 
Our dopamine receptors are being bombarded with sugar, low quality/addictive food, social media vanity, and shiny toys that only give us fleeting enjoyment until we have to find the next new trend to keep us “feeling” good all the time. 
There’s no balance anymore. We only care about how we feel in the present. Our emotions guide our short-term behavior, but our logic and ethics guide our long-term survival. 
We don’t think about the long-term anymore, which requires a commitment to ethical and intellectual planning.

Ultimately, the government would force that corner grocer to pay an income tax in US Dollars for accepting your bus token (it's income by definition).  Now if the government would accept the bus token as a form of tax payment, then that's something different... but as far as I know the US government will only accept USD as a form of tax payments, which gives the dollar an inherent advantage... USD is only the supreme currency because men with guns force you to pay taxes with it.... and also because everyone is forced to accept it as payment for payment on a debt, which could be classified as payment for any good or service because all "accounts payable" aka liabilities aka debts...
I'm simply saying that the government laws, both legal tender and IRS treatment, are not conducive to using Bitcoin as payment for everyday goods and services... but if you change the law that actively classifies Bitcoin as a currency instead of property and the Government starts accepting it as tax payment, then you would actually see people use it.

If there’s an income tax, then you just denominate prices and costs of goods sold in Bitcoin at the point of sale... and then pay the appropriate tax in Bitcoin
Or, if we got rid of the income tax, like all countries should, then we could simply pay a flat sales or valued add tax with Bitcoin which would be even easier to colllect

The spirit of a full-reserve argument revolves around accountability. Fractional reserve banking is by definition not accountable because how do you account for money that is claimed by multiple parties? 
Rehypothecation is not something fractional reserve bankers can argue their way around... the math is clear

It’s the concept of full reserves that needs to be reintroduced. 
Demand deposits have to be locked up in a vault and readily accessible for depositors, but that’s different from a time deposit/certificates of deposit
Time deposits would still exist, but those deposits would not be accessible to the depositor until the end of the the term of the deposit.... this is also just a loan.
I loan a bank money for 1 year. A certificate of deposit. The bank is free to do what they want with it for a year, but that money better be back in the vault in a year (ideally with a little bit of interest or ROI for the depositor/lender).
Right now, demand deposits are lent out on fraction which creates excessive risk and consumption in the economy.

“Funds” are subjective, and in today’s world often highly influenced by authoritative centralized hierarchies that brainwash us to think that money is only what the government defines as money....

You’re right, and if that’s how you interpret it, then you’re missing the point, which is also fine. It’s a loose analogy.

Stocks obviously have more variables and have a management operation/performance variable that impacts value proposition I think. Bitcoin’s protocol is truly built to be a digital cash/value transfer system, and the best use case is to use it to store cash/value tokens for long periods of time.

It's just maddening watching these "thought leaders" on Twitter argue with the Cubes about Bitcoin payments and not play the Ace card...
Bitcoin is taking off in the payments world because tax laws prevent it from happening.  Allow us to freely trade with whatever money we want and pay our taxes in whatever currency we choose, and this whole ridiculous debate turns to ashes... 
Comparing USD and Bitcoin just isn't an apples to apples comparison... they are defined by a completely different set of rules and authorities treat them completely differently, and that influences human behavior.

If Bitcoin became legal tender then the adoption and growth would happen more organically and with less focus on the price relative to the dollar. 
Bitcoiners aren’t looking to sell. They want to hold and trade their bitcoin for goods and services and they want to get paid in bitcoin for the goods and services they provide, but they can’t do that right now without complying with the IRS onerous tax requirements.

I gotta be honest, the more I learn about how computer systems create resiliency the more I realize that bitcoin is damn near close to unhackable.... the redundancy of nodes across the planet make it almost impossible to hack the system

Helpful feedback. Maybe I need to do more research on it, but still seems like an incredible waste of resources, and I still think nodes/developers would have more tools than you think to fight back/fork away... The attackers would have to coordinate with 51% of the hash power and then ensure that 100% of the 51% don’t shirk during the time it takes to rewrite the entire blockchain.... meanwhile it only takes a small % of the hash power in the attacking group to realize it makes more sense to stay honest because the incentive structure for Bitcoin mining actually works and they’ll get rewarded for their bitcoin...
Even if the attackers plan succeeds, and Bitcoin is 100% destroyed, then they are left with billions of dollars worth of mining hardware...
I just think it’s a lot harder than you make it seem. Sure China isn’t friendly to Bitcoin, but the miners are paying energy providers for marginal energy that goes unused... those energy providers are happy to get paid by those miners

How much would difficulty have to increase if energy costs are effectively negligible?  It's an interesting report and good food for thought, but I also wonder what the implications are for Bitcoin if energy costs are close to 0.

Well there are over 10,000 nodes worldwide which is about 3-5x higher than 2013.  Hash power is decreasing along with difficulty and the number of miners will adjust accordingly.  LN is showing signs of growth.  I'm not as worried about the underlying mechanics of bitcoin... those all seem to be operating just fine.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:32:01
This is true of any active or high frequency traders on any exchange, not just bitcoin exchanges.  It is unfair to focus solely on bitcoin exchanges when talking about market manipulation.  No exchange is impervious to market manipulation.  Any trader that is willing to make a market is a manipulator and will always act in his/her interest to push the price to make a profit.  
I am not trying to excuse Tether, if they truly created it out of thin air, and people bought or sold those Tether for Bitcoin or other Dollars, then that was their fault.  Could this have impacted the price of Bitcoin?  Sure, but there are thousands of other buyers and sellers all over the world that are trading in and out of bitcoin every day.  I don't see how even a few billion "dollars" worth of tether could drive the price of Bitcoin to over $300B.  
Ultimately, the fundamental technology of Bitcoin still works.  The protocol still stands ready to process transactions over the network, and it has a trans-national and distributed power structure with no single point of failure.  
In the long-run, I like Bitcoin's chances to survive.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:21:28

Not only is the movement growing, but it is becoming self re-inforcing as long-term holders also start selling a portion of their holdings and then buy back in at lower dips.  All the meanwhile, new users join the network with the same mindset to buy hold and then sell a portion of their holdings at high points to re-invest at lower prices and take control of more coins.  
Ultimately, the price on the exchanges isn't the true value of bitcoin.  The value lies in the growing network of users that relies on speculators to make Bitcoin useful as a payment rail.  
Speculation is fundamental to bitcoin because, at its very essence, money is a speculative instrument.  
It is quite natural for people to speculate on the price for any store of value.  Any commodity is subject to price speculation.

Stablecoins aren't acceptable legal tender for goods and services though... and the IRS won't accept them for tax payments.... plus Stablecoins are backed by USD in a fractional reserve banking system... meaning the dollars that back your Stablecoins aren't really there even if the bank tells you they are...
But I think you have a point... as long as people will accept stablecoins as a token of value, you could still participate in a kind of underground economy after the dollar goes bust

That's a good point and a valid concern.  If you have zero understanding about computer science, or even just a layman's understanding, then you do sort of have to trust the computer programmers, miners, wallet providers, etc... but at least the programming is open-source and in theory there is nothing to prevent any one from double checking their work, albeit it would require a lot of technical know-how.  You would have to teach yourself programming so that you can check the code.  
With that said, I don't think I'm too far off the mark. 
Further, if we're shifting trust from opaque fractional reserve central banking system to an open-source protocol that isn't subject to the opinions or influence of any special interest, then I think Bitcoin clearly proves its worth.

I think by keeping it in fiat with a bank, then you would still be subjected to the obscure/opaque fractional reserve system today, where you don't really know what projects banks are using your deposits for... in theory fractional reserve banking could be much more transparent, by tracking people's dollars through the entire banking system so we can see how banks use our money while in their custody

The contempt in his statement is palpable.  What's ironic is that I think his labels are correct, and yet he still doesn't get it.  Bitcoin is a gambling device/tool, which enables humans to make bets on Bitcoin's ability to store, transfer, and acquire value over time-- and, of course, value is purely subjective and based on every person's unique utility curve.  
Bitcoin serves as an unbiased exchange mechanism for human interaction.
Bitcoin is a call-option on time that doesn't expire.  
He's also correct that Bitcoin hasn't produced anything.  Bitcoin facilitates value storage, transfer, and creation.  Bitcoin does not create value on its own.  Just like fiat currencies, stocks, companies, bonds, or any other commercial artifact.  Without humans, bitcoin has no value. 
Bitcoin does not discriminate, it is not exclusive, it does not wage war, and it is almost impossible to corrupt or cheat the system.  
It is a protocol that requires humans to exchange with each other in a way that is synergistic and symbiotic, which will allow for a more peaceful and more sustainable life on earth.  
Its value proposition is based purely on people choosing to opt-in or opt-out.
