"Your honor, I didn't steal anything of value, the US government doesn't recognize BitCoin as currency"
Judge: "Did you take investor A's $1000?"
Judge: "What did you give him in return?"
"My software told him he had 2 bitcoins"
Judge: "And your software also allowed him to sell those 2 bitcoins back for roughly the original $1000 given a stable market?"
Judge: "So what happened to these Bitcoins?"
"I took them, but those weren't real, it wasn't real currency"
Judge: "But you essentially stole his $1000. You just 'traded' the real US currency for this non-existant virtual currency under the misleading guise of giving him something he could resell?"
"Oh... um... "

I worked at a pet food store where someone came in and bought $400 worth of dog food with fake cheques. The RCMP doesn't investigate crimes less the $500. They're not going to ask TH for the camera, nor should you want the RCMP to do so.
People rip off coffee joints for free shit all the time, ever heard of shoplifting?

Interesting note, Venmo and Bitcoin were created in the same year. For the, 'send someone some $', it seems like Venmo has taken that use case. That's because, if I put $20 in my Venmo wallet, I don't ever expect it to be worth $200, or $2. imho, if bitcoin was going to take off as a currency, it should have completely flatlined in value.
