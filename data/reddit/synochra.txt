Just thinking aloud here....if someone were to combine Turkey's good internet infrastracture and Iran's cheap energy... :S

I mean, the value going up or down doesn't depend on the amount you buy. 
From what I can tell, people in this sub will generally advise you to buy and hold your BTC longterm.

Thanks man; is there no one that's able to compete with these guys? Why don't other countries that have low energy costs set up their own miners? There's plenty of third world countries with low energy costs, they'd surely benefit from this?

I see, thanks. This is very alarming

I'm the furthest thing from an expert or even what most would deem a Bitcoin user, but I think part of bitcoin's deal/issue is that there is no one 'unbiased info source' as everything seems up to debate; which is why any voice, that goes beyond simply asking or explaining technical questions, has to pick sides one way or another. 
This is all very much a work in progress, both technologically and politically.

Holy coin, can't believe how much I laughed at this. I'm going to hell

I was gonna say just that. Whoever started investing that much money would drive the price up exponentially the longer they kept buying, as you can'T buy that many bitcoins at once

Well, something something John McAffee, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:44:11
Ah, this makes sense

Damn right, I've been waiting for the next significant dip ever since I sold at 900 in the first crash early this year.
[Any day now...](

Unless he bought right at the top of the bubble, he could probably buy all of his favorite coworkers a house right now

I regret my brilliant idea to start 'trading' earlier this year. The prize had seemingly stabilized around 1000$ and my intention was to ride the volatility waves, like most noobs. I sold what little I had at just below 1100$, anticipating a drop within the next hours. Nope.
I quit out of frustration. Now, 9 months later, I have no energy left to care. 
Damn I used to belittle Hodlers. Good for them.

What I don't get about this story is who was offering services for bitcoins back then? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:45:28
No one is talking about the guy who haggled this other guy out of his virtually free 10000 bitcoins
guy at least got two pizzas out of it. Arguably the most expensive pizzas in history.

I agree, what's presented is their profiles as agents of bitcoin.
