Which Bitcoin is even more vulnerable to, since you can do all your brute forcing offline...

In the iCloud scenario, you would be able to attempt significantly more private keys for a Bitcoin wallet than you could iCloud passwords. In a realistic scenario, I could do millions of attempts per hour against iCloud. I can do more than that against a Bitcoin wallet per minute, on pretty simple hardware.

The point is to remove any such arbitration. It is purely in the buyer/seller's interest to negotiate between themselves, since both lose if they don't agree to release funds.

Sure, but that doesn't fit with the ApplePay use scenario. There use case is a hot wallet that gets used frequently, which BIP 38 doesn't work well with. If you're using a wallet regularly, you're only as secure as your passphrase, and if the leading theory on iCloud compromises is poor passphrases...

It isn't surprising that he would learn British English, if he learned it prior to moving to the US. 
That's not to say I'm not skeptical, but who they present is almost exactly what I would have expected. The only exception is that I didn't expect him to actually have Japanese heritage, instead that he had worked for a Japanese company and was using a pseudonym.

Definitely. It would be far more useful to have some sort of a limit, so that, say, I could quantify how many hashes/second my users should be hashing. That way I could put, essentially, a price per minute/hour spent on the site.

Considering how badly many startups fail at authentication, I'm not sure I would consider it a net loss if more of them just outsourced it to Facebook. At least they won't be handing out unhashed passwords to everyone who knows how to use a single quote.

Question: what does this convert to in terms of bitcoins per cpu/hour?
Part of the way down the post I got the following numbers:








What kind of output is that?
@_date: 2011-12-20 16:01:49
According to that, in the two month period between August 15th and October 15th the price stayed entirely between 1.46 and 1.32. The biggest 1 week swing (which is the outside limit I'd consider a "question of days") was 0.06.

Couple of points with your comment:
* Betting BTC will rise in relation to the $ isn't interest, its currency Arbitrage. Its actually very similar to buying Gold under the same premise, but without the physical use for your investment.
* On a related note (having not read the article), point 13 probably refers to gold rather than paper currency, and BTC mining probably has less of a carbon footprint than Gold mining. They're both reasonable stores of value which are not tied to USD, although the chance of gold dramatically devaluing is a little less likely due to the fact it has uses beyond store of value.

Now you're just playing with words. Your rounding took a difference from 0.14 to 0.2. Saying you're exaggerating a price swing by 50% isn't "right".

Sure, but if the options are:
* Developer rolls their own authentication
* Developer outsources authentication to Facebook/twitter/Google/whatever
The second choice is going to be a better decision the vast majority of the time. One of the sources like that typically aren't going to have their entire user database compromised, and if they do they have the sense to keep it reasonably encrypted in the database too. 
There is a subset of users, which you may very well belong to, that uses a different password for everything. In that case, having it compromised on one site doesn't matter. The vast majority of users don't do that though, so in general it would be better for sites to outsource authentication to someone who actually knows what they're doing. 
This is especially true for something like a startup which does user Polling. Its targeting a decidedly non-technical audience, which is almost certainly going to use the same password for everything. 
@_date: 2011-05-20 18:29:53
I wouldn't say that. Its actually a pretty straightforward system, and doesn't seem to have a lot of a downside (minus the fact that at this point it has a piss-poor return). Compared to a lot of things people put on their websites, it seems like a significantly safer alternative for most consumers. 
I would guess the majority of people doing this would be running shadier types of sites: Porn, pirated goods, the RapidShare spin-offs, etc. Compared to hosting, say, an advertisement from a shady publisher, which could get switched to malware at any time, it seems like a net gain.

And the *best* part about bitcoins, is once you say you "lost" them, the IRS has a perfect trail. Its like if every single serial number for every bill was constantly tracked.
Bitcoin is the best thing that could happen, for the IRS.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:50:02
What, you mean the bitcoin equivalent to money laundering? I'm not sure you understand bitcoins. You can *always* trace any transactions from a wallet. If they can identify a wallet as yours, you can never spend the bitcoins in that wallet without leaving a trace. That makes the "I don't know the private key" no longer a valid excuse.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:55:53
You know what, they're totally right:


Right now most of the fluctuations are due to bitcoin being a ponzi scheme. Until people are actively acquiring bitcoins for the purpose of spending them, not getting rich off of holding them, they are going to be exactly right.
Of course, I don't agree with the conclusion that bitcoin can never get out of this phase, but at least right now it is.

Yes, but its a special case. As far as I'm concerned, there are two classes of cheating that a casino operator can do:
* Manipulate the odds in such a way that it is to their advantage, while still publishing the odds. The way random numbers are chosen in this example fall into this case.
* Not doing what they're claiming to do.
That second one is a **much** bigger issue. The first one might be a little shady, but at least in my opinion is perfectly acceptable. The second one is a huge issue. If you can't trust them to do what they have claimed (in this example to be Provably Fair), then you can't trust anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:29:02
My point was that it depends on the claim they're making, and I don't see an issue with picking one over the other. You are seeing the exact "guts" behind picking the random number, not simply being told "a number 0-2". 
The point you made in this comment is actually a much more important than the one you made in your post. It doesn't matter if they choose 4294967295 or 4294967296, the odds still aren't 1/10000 of winning 0.3. Due to rounding, you're looking at 1/20000. 
While its slightly misleading, its not any different from saying "roll a 1 on the die, get $100", and have in the fine print that its a 20 sided die. The math is fully available to work out, its just not what you would immediately assume looking at it. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:59:42
The first part of your analysis is correct, although I don't have a way to verify their claims. If you change the number you are dividing by, you end up with a different EV. Whether or not that is better depends on your perspective. Some quick, back of the envelope math says it is on the order of 1 in a couple million rolls end up on the lower side of the payout.
Your second part, however, is dead wrong. *IF* they are doing Provably Fair properly, they are providing you with "Server Seed Hash" prior to you sending your client seed to them. With that in place, there is no tampering they can do without breaking sha512, and there are better ways to make money than a crooked casino if you can do that. It doesn't matter if its randomly generated or if its the owners' Social Security number, once you do the HMAC of that and your client seed, the output of the HMAC will be random.
Also, using a third party randomness source is equally flawed.


I got that number from random.org. Verify that it is truly random. You need some sort of a key exchange such that either party can trivially prove that both pieces were used as a source of randomness, without either party knowing what the other's secret is prior to creating their own. 
Some math:
The difference between 4294967295 and 4294967296 is very small. The difference is that the hex values 0xfd119ce0, 0xffa0f909, 0xffd566cf, 0xffef9db2, and 0xfffcb923 will be paid out at the next lower payout. The difference in EV is 0.0000000000698484946204928 per roll. 
And to clarify my earlier points:
I couldn't find the game you were talking about in the 10 seconds I spent looking. Going purely from your description, however, leads to several flaws in your analysis.
If they send you the hash of their secret prior to you picking your secret (that is, you can see Server Seed Hash before you pick client seed), then without breaking sha512 the output will be random. You should also be able to verify after your rolls that Server Seed matches Server Seed Hash. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:32:24
Uh, you're right, that's a huge issue. I was going by the standard "provably fair" method of doing things, since I couldn't find their implementation quick enough. In that case, you're right, they can simply pick arbitrary outcomes. That isn't them being rigged though, its them claiming to be Provably Fair when they actually aren't.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:55:43
The best thing about cash is that it can go missing. A bitcoin can *never* transfer hands with the IRS (or anyone, for that matter) knowing about it. If you have a wallet that has been positively identified as yours, there's no way to use any of that BTC without getting a very serious audit.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:44:05
I actually feel fairly similarly. I think it will be *hilarious* when we start seeing people who made a fortune on Bitcoins get screwed by the IRS. Tracability of money is, generally, a good thing, especially if the culture surrounding the currency is built with that in mind. There's way too much confusion about how bitcoin transactions work though, which means a lot of people think bitcoins are magic money that no one can trace back to you.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:51:02
Its cash. Think of it the same way.
Having 5,000 BTC is no different from having a suitcase full of money that "fell off a truck". You can shove it in a closet all you want, but if you start spending it the IRS may come after you.
