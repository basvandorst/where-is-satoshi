Are there new movements to exchanges? How much has been sold? 
I noticed large deposits and sells on Gemini, not sure if they are from 1933 though... stumbled upon those txs when I followed some addresses which lead all the way back to **1DKY** 600k btc wallet

Here is a link to the article based on your research

I admire WizSec's work, but not sure if he is right on 1933. Silk Road connection def seems as the strongest.  It would be good if he explained his stance.
(Although Karpeles seems like a possible candidate as well)

Yes, your bitcoins are safe. Testnet is not connected to Livenet

Unfortunately, I didn't save the link to that address (but around $20m of btc went to Gemini). I stumbled upon it when I traced one transaction from old 1DKY wallet (which contained 600k bitcoins).. all the way to the present time. So it's old money.
Btw, I also managed to find a link between 1LDN (Ross) wallet and 1DKY, but it has around 50 intermediate addresses, and funds go through Instawallet before entering 1DKY. Many of those intermediate addresses used just for mixing. Maybe someone can find shorter links between the two.

Have a look at this article. Daily volume on Yobit exchange rose 181% prior to Pump, the Pump is actually going to be a Dump [ Their announcement of Pump and Dump is the most bizarre thing I've heard recently

The analyst did not do a good job really. The price of Bitcoin is whatever someone will pay for it, regardless of work and money that went into producing it

It's more a Store of Value rn and alternative payment method in the times of distress or need, and there's nothing wrong with it. There are many more cryptocurrencies on offer as well

Facebook is dying. Crypto is being born. The price is irrelevant for the development.

That's because fundamentals are getting stronger. The price will catch up, dont worry
