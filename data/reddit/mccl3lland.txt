It was a single effort, that found no actual traction until it was basically tricked in to place by the NY Agreement.  And the main purpose of SegWit was to push transactions off chain.  So as i said, no effort was made to scale on chain.

The value of bitcoin might drop in the short term, but change is necessary to ensure bitcoin is usable as a digital currency rather than simpky a store of wealth or investment.  So while bitcoin grows and changes to become what it was meant to become, people need to stop worrying about getting rich, and worry about how we actually get where we should be.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:28:51

Your point being? Just because you have experience doesn't mean you can't be wrong, replaced, or challenged. In the scientific community, you often times have two groups of incredibly talented and brilliant scientists, that take opposing sides of a debate/hypothesis. If one side is ultimately discovered to be true, or at least MORE true, then the side that was not true/less true joins with the other and starts again with a new baseline. 
If the core devs are so much better or more experienced, they should bring their experience to the side of classic with the purpose of making Bitcoin better, stronger, and more "true".

It's not trolling to say that SegWit didn't have majority support.  It's not trolling to say that with out the agreement of SegWit AND a 2mb block increase, SegWit never would have happened.
2x wasn't an attack on Bitcoin.  2x was moderate people agreeing to a compromise to move forward.  Treating it as something other than reasonable people working together to move forward rather than stagnate is just dishonest.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:25:55
Why would you simply go by nodes?  Thousands of people use Bitcoin with out running nodes.  Hundreds of businesses use and/or accept Bitcoin with out running nodes.  They aren't part of the community?  This isn't an US vs. Them kind of thing.  
Everyone involved adds value to bitcoin, whether they are miners, node hosts, users, or any mix thereof.  That's the community.
If you simply look at nodes, you're ignoring a large portion of the community.  If you simply look at developers, you ignore a large portion of the community.  If you look at miners, you ignore a large portion of the community.
THE thing Bitcoin had going for it, was the vastness of the community.  It was spread so large and wide, taking control of it was near impossible.  You know what fractured it?  An unwillingness to compromise.  You know what is about to fracture it again?  An unwillingness to compromise.  Scorched earth never works out in anyone's best interest.
I don't want to come back in November to slap anyone.  I want people to accept a god damn moderate approach to a diverse community.  No one will ever be 100% "right".  No one will ever be 100% "satisfied".  But if no one is willing to accept they aren't going to get every single thing they want, then the Bitcoin protocol is going to keep cracking until we're 10 Bitcoin currencies deep, and all are left by the wayside because the security of the vast community is completely fucking gone.
Do I support larger blocks? Yes, because I believe on chain scaling is important.  On chain security and blockchain transparency is what I signed up for with Bitcoin several years ago.  I'm still here.  I haven't just abandoned ship to hope on the BCH wagon.  I support BCH in its own right though.  That doesn't mean I'm against progress.  That doesn't mean I support fracturing the community.  It doesn't mean I'm right or wrong.  You know what it does mean though? I can accept compromise.  Compromise is how we move forward.  This project doesn't belong to any one person or group.  It's "ours".  The entirety of the community.

Come on guys.  You all know BU was set up as another option to core.  There's nothing sinister about it, stop trying to find boogeymen where none are.  
The fact is, Bitcoin has stalled for the past 2+ fucking years, and BU was simply meant to push a blocksize change that has been argued for over the past few years, as well as add a competing group of developers to the mix because a lot of people have felt like the core devs have been ignoring the desires of the community.
Yes, I understand the argument "SegWit DOES increase the blocksize!"  But even before SegWit was a thing, there has been a push to increase blocksize as simply as possible.
Let's all remember that neither the Core Devs, BU, or anyone in particular owns Bitcoin, and it was always meant to be a collaborative effort.  It was always meant to be various groups offering ideas to the collective.

I just wanted to to say, that the article clearly has a lean towards implying the bitcoin core are the ones being maligned somehow, particularly with regard to the bit about accusations of censorship or news of blockstream raising capital being spun negatively. 
Oddly enough, a person giving their personal 'experience/expertise' that somehow relates to strengthen the following claims is a psychological ploy to give themselves credibility before you hear what they say. 
People on the many sides of the argument (herein simplified to bitcoin core vs. Classic/XT, etc.) could make claims of each other being shills, being devious, having malevolent intent.  The fact is of there are PsyOps at play regarding the bitcoin community (which there absolutely are), both sides are almost absolutely guilty of it, and we're I betting man, I'd say those reasons are as follows:
Personal gain. Desire to cripple, destroy, or control a powerful technology. Because they feel they are doing "what's best". Or any combination of these. 
Surprising? Not really. People want to be in the know.  People want to create the next best thing. People want to ride the next big thing. People want to profit from the next big thing, some by support, others by hindrance. 
My stance on the bitcoin saga is currently, I disagree with the route the Bitcoin Core/Blockstream has and is choosing. BUT I don't take myself out of the line of information on their side of things either, because we limit our own potential for knowledge when we pretend to know everyone machinations and decide to refuse to hear out an argument. 
Personally, I think the biggest detriment to the Bitcoin community, and the technology itself was when we allowed ourselves to split our sounding board of ideas into the shit load of hate-filled he said/she said forums where opposing ideas where no longer welcome. Can't say who exactly started or propagated the rift, but we're all to blame for what we have now.

2x isn't an attack.  2x was the price of SegWit.  It was agreed upon, and now those that got what they wanted wish to shit on their half of the bargain.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:49:07
While you're at it, make sure you thank all those that agreed to the NYA in good faith of actual progress, because with out the compromise that everyone here apparently is chomping at the bit to renege on, SegWit never would have happened.  In the end, I guess all it cost was a bit of integrity and honesty to achieve!
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:16:34
It really wasn't.  It had like 30% support, and wasn't gaining ground.  With out the compromise, nothing was going to happen....which is what made the compromise a good idea.  Neither side got exactly what they wanted, but both got something they needed.  Unless the 2x doesn't happen, then it just splits the community again because them that would compromise will have been alienated by them that would not.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:27:46
Panick selling assumes some things. 1) you have no faith in the underlying technology and 2) you spent/invested more than you could afford to lose.
You only "lose" when you sell for below what you bought in at or have your assets stolen or lost.

@_date: 2017-10-08 16:23:57
Maybe you didn't.  But enough of the community did in order to enact SegWit, since it was only at 30% by itself.  So if you didn't agree with it great, but the majority did.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:17:44
Enough to push SegWit through, when alone it only had 30% support.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:05:58
It was always going to be competing implementations of code and the longest chain IS bitcoin..so of course an exchange would side with whatever implementation won out. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:23:04
Perhaps not, but should the community that supported the agreement (which had to be the majority, since they pushed SegWit through when it was only at 30% by itself) not be obligated to then support the second half of the agreement?
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:46:37
Don't they though?  Don't Miner's control Bitcoin?  SegWit couldn't pass on it's own.  Only with miners agreeing to allow it, did it happen.  So as ideally as we'd all like to believe Bitcoin is "in our control as the users" it's clearly not.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:13:57
Who is trying to save face?  SegWit was stuck, i.e. not going to happen before the compromise was reached.  So after being enacted under the guise of compromise, it was touted as "We did it! Look at all this support, we're not gonna 2x ahahahaha fuck those minority!" When the reality is Segwit was never the majority.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:10:49
I just think it disingenuous when SegWit stalled at somewhere around 30% agreement, then when a compromise to get what is wanted is wanted by that 30% of the community, they rejoyce and immediately let everyone know they won't support any kind of compromise after the fact.  SegWit still doesn't have the support of the market if you will, with out the factions wanting the 2x as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:08:09
I mean, there was enough agreement by people who had the ability to do anything, to push SegWit through, when before it only had 30% support.  If people didn't like those terms, they could have stopped it by pulling support for SegWit under those terms.
The November 2x portion was part of that, so again, they could have pulled support and stopped the compromise, which they didn't because they were getting what they wanted and knew they'd have time to renege on the 2x portion that gave them what they wanted.

If you'll remember, there was the SegWit + 2mb block compromise that basically all of the miners agreed to, that the core devs and fanboys (once SegWit was enacted of course) flat out refused to do, or even entertain.  That's the only reason SegWit even happened to begin with, because it was going to be a compromise.  And core reneged. But yeah, they just wanted to avoid Segwit and LN...

It's not like, it costs a lot to buy in to bitcoin.
For example, the current price of bitcoin is $330.91.  If I go on to Coinbase and buy 1 bitcoin it will cost me $331.59.  That means it cost me an additional $0.68 to "buy into bitcoin".
If I were to buy a large coffee at starbucks, a venti, it would cost me $2.50 using cash/credit.  If I took a 20% discount, it would cost me $2.00.  I saved $0.50 on a single cup of coffe, almost completely covering the "cost" of changing my dollars in to bitcoin.
And the great thing, you don't have to buy a full bitcoin, so if you have say, a coffee budget of 20 dollars a month or whatever, you can buy 20 dollars worth of bitcoin, and get more coffee than you could before....or any other product that offered a discount.

Transactions off the bitcoin blockchain (aka, on lighting network) are inherently less safe than on chain, as there will be less nodes, less decentralized control.  SegWit isn't making things safer, its paving the way for unsecured chains that are far less secure than the on chain transactions.

Exactly. Which is why side chains on bitcoin are a risk...they will be inherantly less secure.

Does that mean that you won't accept a reneg of the 2mb hard fork in 3 months as well?

Miners aren't the ones that have been trying to keep transactions per block artificially low.  And they aren't the ones that are pushing for OFF chain transactions, where they make no money from the transactions taking place.

Just wait for the crash then convert lol.  When prices start skyrocketing with out actual activity to warrant an increase in value, shit is going down somewhere, and people are trying to profit in totally speculative ways.  Once shit normalizes, since, nothing has actually happened to warrant a valuation increase, some will have got paid, some will have lost.

I was using the PIA client.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:40:40
I just want people to be safe man, read the link I posted or don't. Either way there has been some suspicious shit with PIA for the past month and I thought people should be aware.
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:45:38
I posted this in another thread, but want to make sure everyone sees it, so here it is again:
Just for everyone's information, a few weeks ago, I noticed PIA was showing I was connected to one IP address, but my browser was showing I was connected to another when I looked. I did some searching, and came across [this thread]( on the PIA forums.
Someone in that thread claims to have done some testing as they were doing work for an ISP and had access to some tools/data that most people wouldn't be, and they feel there was definitely data leaking. Whether or not it was personal, identifiable information is anyone's guess.
A lot of people were geo-locked to the US, even if they lived outside of the US and couldn't access websites in their own country.
I switched VPNs due to lack of any addressing of the information related to data leaking from PIA. So, proceed at your own risk I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:59:36
Yeah that's probably the case then.  For me, the fact that PIA started fucking with things with out notifying people first, then their failure to address concerns over potentially leaked data (Not to mention the multitude of unanswered support tickets) was reason enough for me to find someone else.
Thanks for your input on that matter!

You realize you can read the fucking forum to see if what I'm saying is true, right?  I'm a BITCOIN supporter.  Do I think change is needed? Yes. Am I upset that I've had comments hidden by mods here for bullshit reasons? Yes.  That doesn't make me a troll.  All I was trying to do was warn people that PIA may not be safe, so fuck off.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:42:10
Read the fucking link man. Other people were having the same issue, and someone in there tested and found data to be leaking.  PIA commented in the thread, but didn't respond to the data leak claim so I was making people aware.

I hope more people saw and took the advice, because it looks like price correction is in full swing lol.  I'm sitting here like Hooray, I was about to make a purchase so I'll wait till it tries to rebound and get a little bit more out of my money!

Lol.  Thanks man, it warms my heart that while we may disagree about the direction of bitcoin, and though we still both support bitcoin in our own ways, we could work this out as gentlemen!
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:50:21
I changed over to AirVPN because a friend of mine had nothing but good things to say about it.  A lot of people were having issues and the lack of support from PIA for a lot of people running in to issues dissuaded me from continuing to use it since they didn't address the claim that it was in fact leaking data.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:37:02
Posted the same information above in the other thread about this in and I'm accused of lying, or that its motivated because I'm a BU supporter.  This is the fucking community now a days, can't even try to help people be god damn secure with out it devolving in to politics. 
Bleep bloop.

Foresight would be hold on to the ETH you bought at less that 15 dollars, sell the ETH you bought when the frenzy started, and buy quantities of ETH and BTC that you can afford, often over time, where it doesn't negatively impact your day to day life and hold on to it because more likely both are going to increase in value.

I switched over to AirVPN because a buddy of mine has been using it for a while and had nothing but good things to say about it.
