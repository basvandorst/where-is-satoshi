There are at least two famous italians looking like this portrait: Lucio Dalla (a singer) and Piercamillo Davigo (a judge).

On the right of the picture, there is a fiscal receipt. Your comment is not supported by the facts.

You'd be surprised to know this, but the American way of doing things is not the only possible way. In almost all EU countries, taxes are not split in fiscal receipts for not professional services.

Which is the name of this service? We should create a list of all of these services.
In the old days of Internet, someone create Yahoo as a directory service. It helped many people in finding things they already don't know they existed. Then, it came Google, which is a better way to find things. But today we need something that find not a service or a product or a merchant, but a bitcoin service, product or merchant.

How much could be their PUE? 2? 3? They may gain a 20% performance with ASICboost, but if this is a cryptocurrency mining facility, it seems very, very easy to build a better one that by only being built in a rational way could outperform them. 
Really, after seeing these pictures I am now 100% sure that big corporates and governments will enter the crypto mining business, they could do things ten times better. 
(Google'a PUE is 1.12, as comparison)

First create the market, the technology will follow. If there isn't enough room in the blocks today, the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin is a 100x increase in the number of transactions that force to find new ways to allow for all of these exchanges. And we'll be all instantly rich :)
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:31:32
I've got a Ph.D. in computer science and I want to tell you a secret: technology is not relevant. If there will be so many transactions in the blockchain that cannot be processed, someone will find a clever way to do so in a way compatible with Bitcoin's principles and core ideas.
Do not tell me how the world is today. Suggest how to change it :)
For the wealth transfer: I know that many many people have many more bitcoins than me. But I could survive with this if its price goes stellar.

Why we don't create a list of all these services and put this in front of this reddit?

The age of cryptocurrency. Not perfect in explaining how the block chain works, excellent in anything else. I am hoping for a translation in Italian, so I could give to some friends who don't speak English. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:15:12
You've got the whole point. The good part about that article is that is about OneCoin, and it never cites Bitcoin. Also, it uses the more general concept of cryptocurrency, and I see this as an indication that the attitude of media on Bitcoin is changing.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:07:53
As far as I know, Italy'antitrust authority cannot put people in jail, this is for the judicial system. But the Antitrust could be extremely fast in fining someone. And you have very limited capacity to ask for a revision of their decision.

I don't think that Repubblica is a shitty newspaper, generally speaking. It's one of the two most read newspapers in Italy and it's usually good, except for science and technology that has never been their best.
In the article, there are no factual errors, no confusion between Bitcoin and Onecoin, and this is the real news.

My bf has to read this :) Thanks!

Charity is always a good idea, but you could consider finalize it a bit more. Maybe, you could say that when there is a donation made via bitcoin, you donate the same (or a fraction) of amount in food. To do so, you could consider food that is still eatable but difficult to sell or about to expire.
As such, not only you promote a charity, but you avoid food waste.

Yes, the analogy is terribly poor.

Yes, but I am accostumed to and I am not the only one doing it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:58:19
The article is a preview of the first page of the Monday business supplement of Repubblica, the first or second Italian newspaper, traditionally progressive.
It says, in the title, that markets start being frightened by the cryptocurrency and some professionals investors are launching financial products related to it. It adds that as payment system is still limited in use, but as investment asset works quite good.
It is extremely significant, as only 4 or 5 months ago the sentiment towards bitcoin was quite negative, for the same newspaper. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:14:33
That's true. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:14:06
From the people that have sold it.

So, you think that Ukraine could say that they are implementing some technology as a defensive step against Russia. Ok, I guess that this discussion could stop here for lack of substance. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:29:31
Yes, it does. The OP suggests that these countries were interested in cryptocurrencies, whilst they are interested in distributed ledgers for geopolitical reasons that you still fail to understand. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 20:39:29
This has nothing to do with the Russian expansionism and how a distributed ledger could help in contrasting a cyber attack. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 18:33:15
It is interesting to see that both Ukraine and Estonia have launched some eGov blockchain based initiatives and both have an awkward neighborhood like Russia. 
I see this a strong indication of a very good use case for the blockchain (here, would it be better to call it a distributed ledger) : as an easy way to have identical, geographical dispersed copies of the same data, it removes the single point of failure otherwise typical, that could be the target of physical / cyber attacks. 
If not for the possibility of foster innovation, distributed ledgers should be a common building blocks for resilient infrastructures.

I am wondering how many people talking about 'black swan' had actually read the book.
Considering that, if have read the book, you cannot realistically think to predict a 'black swan', I'd say we have very few readers here.

Good, it's called Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:59:32

You got the whole point.

I guess that you write a lot of emails. You are a hero :)

No, it was only 2,100 more or less. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:48:04
The analysis is very approximate. 
If you have a billion of customers doing SPV, you have already precomputed, for each of them, the relevant transactions. Sure, you won't reread the chain every time one of them wants to know his balance. 
This, believe it or not, is exactly what happens with your bank, that when sees a movement on your account does not process your history since the beginning of time, but in a very quick way sees if you have enough money or not to authorize the withdrawal of funds. It's a synthetic index. 
Things are more complex than this, but the analysis is a bit ridiculous.

I've moved every bitcoin to Trezor. It started a couple of months ago, I've transferred the last fractional part in the previousdays. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:48:50
If I have understood the analisys, it's possible that bitcoin goes higher or that it goes lower. But it's not sure, as it could also remain at this levels. 
Informative, for sure. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:09:04
Not everyone in the Bitcoin community plays well. So  Bitcoin, as an idea, it's still in its infancy and could dye in its young age. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:10:24
If Coinbase gets hacked, the value of bitcoin will be severely impacted. And this is one of the reason why I root hard for them. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:33:48
I guess I could give my Trezor to my mum everytime I enter the US. Mum will keep it for me and, I am pretty sure, she is an hodler, also, at least because she can't figure out how to use that strange thing.

If you buy 200$ when the price is 2200, you have bought 200/2200=0.090909 bitcoin (or whatever crypto you like)
If this crypto is valued now 2800, you have 0.090909*2800=254,54$, so you've gained 54,54 $.

It's 5.5 million, the author of the article is quite ignorant of the EU funding mechanisms and you didn't read the link on the cordis service.

It's 5.5 millions.

Because Coinbase has some problems, but it's a resource for the mass adoption of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:31:18
Everything is possible, but I don't think that, if there are some orders to buy/sell originated from Coinbase itself, they could clog the system. It would be only an handful of orders, so it seems not plausible to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:31:53
I'll check into Bitstamp. But I hope that they manage this properly.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:18:34
The project is funded with 5 million, not 5 billion. 
It is always funny to see how ignorant many North Americans are when it comes to European things. An Horizon 2020 project like this one could get millions, not billions of funding. It should be clear to everyone who talks and speaks about technology, writing an article for a tech website. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:34:55
Yes, you did it. It's called the Horizon 2020 project and it has been approved by the Parliament. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:14:24
It has more than 7 million customers, hard to say it's dead. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:20:23
The project has nothing to do with any possible regulation. The regulation are drafted by the EC and voted by the Parliament, if you have anything to say talk to your EU representative.
