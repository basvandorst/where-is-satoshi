I also sold 100 BTC to buy me a 1000€ bike in the days. It later got stolen. Still have the wallet to remember the days. ;\-\)

Best explanation video I've seen about it, many already may know it. Awesome guy.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:26:16
I feel you, but how could anybody know really? I kept 1 of them coins by the way and sold it for 92€ or so. Good price wasn't it? :D
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:18:48
Let's see when it breaches 1000$ again. :P
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:58:02
Also curious. Last time I've been there there was no such thing, let's see. :)
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:38:14
Oh well, you seem pretty self absorbed about what your value as a human is just because you have money. Most of humanity is people that want to not suffer. But the rich and psychopathic ones are the ones who are stuck in a cycle of addiction to power or collecting.
Btw. it could be a personal goal to become more aware of others and what are really your needs as a human being.
I don't know you but I don't like your perspective, are you an American?
P.S. Other beeings with crypto money doing it better: [
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:41:45
I'm confused. Why do you make this about language now? No, it's not my mother tongue. Also I'm not American. Back to the topic.
After I asked you about if you're using your money for charity too, you passively denied by making a statement about humanity. You want to make clear that you see others as "hungry mouths \[for your money\]" and "not worthy for being given a chance". Oh dear, who is the one that is hungry, ask yourself. ;\-) Don't know where you live, but I bet you think that people in need deserve it or the reason they are in need just lie within themselves and not in external reasons. Well, that's what I thought may be american about you, even if you're not (like their whole system is based on: the rich are rich because they worked hard and the poor just didn't; it's fucked up).
Ask yourself again: If you are able to afford an island, why not build one for others? What's this money collecting all about?
I should have just stopped writing after you made a statement about how people are worthy or not worthy. Are you deciding?
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:04:59
Finally we will be able to pay in CREDITS.
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:49:35
Crap. If you bought in very high then you just lying to yourself and others with such statements. "Well known investment strategy" - Sources? ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:33:29
Hope you're using your money to help others in need (third world, homeless etc.) too. :\-)
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:10:38
I think it's pushed and pulled in both directions, as long as you don't get anything out of it. ;-)
I also want to say that it's certainly not only one group that tries to manipulate.
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:29:53
Thanks for your reply. First of all I want to say that I am not anti Bitcoin or other kinds of similar payment systems at all (I'm a friend of Monero tbh). But my problem is this hype mentality about it and what misinformation and manipulation you can read from every corner of the room. Some people claim that Bitcoin is a store of value. I think that's very risky since Bitcoin itself doesn't really have a value like goods or land or whatever you can invest in usually may have. So it's at least as fragile as any other "currency" you want to compare it to (since paper money is also nothing but an agreement between the people who use it).
If you talk about "a safer bet" I'm really worried, because one thing that can happen very fast with Bitcoin: it gets attacked or a serious bug comes alive. Also if you lose your wallet / keys you're pretty much done. Not really safe in my eyes.
I didn't say owning BTC is a gamble by the way, just this HODLING meme really annoys me. ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:44:37
"Well, I lost enough, so it probably won't go any further... I just HODL."
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:34:25
Sorry but you're wrong. If you're in for gains you certainly could do it with short term trading and that's what big investors do too. I think you're either lying or justifying your own behavior even if you're not getting anything out of it. I say: Invest whenever you get something out of it - short or long term or both.
And don't just hold just because other people tell you to. OP is totally right. Also BTC won't just "moon" overnight, you can easily get in when the downtrend has passed. Remember: 50&amp; loss means you have to see a 100&amp; rise later, it's way easier to lose money which is also due to peoples mentality to sell in panic.
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:42:54
"Potential of this tech hasn't been realized." - This makes me want to puke and laugh at the same time. I don't think you know what you're talking about but just repeating some statement. So explain to me: Which feature is it exactly that wasn't realized after so many years?
Maybe related to it: [
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:29:54
I like how in his last sentence he mentioned that you may also use your gains to help people in real need. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:46:33
You're talking randomness. No it won't just go to 100k and also not 100 by one day. You're just making it up for yourself.
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:24:20
I don't know if BTC transactions on the blockchain can be "fraud", but maybe you mean the trading volume regarding exchanges?
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:42:44
Why not roll the dice? It should have the same outcome at predicting anything in that matter. Really, some people here maybe can give you good advice on strategies in such a market, but nobody usually knows when it's the "right time". You certainly missed out on buying in when it was 50% cheaper some weeks ago. About the future? Who knows. Maybe the ones manipulating here and there. But every news, good or bad, could turn the market in either direction. It's a gamble in the short term. And long term it's also a gamble, whenever people "believe" or "know" they actually just assume or hope.

In psychology it's called anchor heuristic, if somebody throws in a number and then you should evaluate something you have no information about; you will always choose a number closer to the thrown in "anchor" then if you would just guess out of the blue. Of course you will not be near the truth at all.
So this is just fraud to infuse the masses with emotions, AGAIN.
Bitcoin will rise to 9000, that's my guess. Now think about how this makes you feel.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:12:24
I agree with you that "everybody knows" is an overstatement. What I wanted to say is that most of the big players in financial systems "know" and they are NOT stupid. They are already manipulating and pushing and pulling and the average person is the target for them. Everybody hopes that this coin will just inflate while nobody is going to sell, that's just nonsense. It doesn't add up.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:28:04
He only has 0.1 BTC, what do you expect? It's more likely he puts all the money in lottery tickets and win than getting rich with 800$ in BTC. You must be trolling...
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:43:52
As if you can compare XRPs rise and BTC, you really must be joking.
So give me an example, what price has BTC to be that 0.1BTC is consired "pretty valuable" for you?
Let's say 10.000$ is pretty valuable for an average person when it comes to an investment of 500$ once, yeah?
Now what about all the people that already invested 100.000$ in the beginning, since they have lots of money already? What's valuable for them? It will be most likely that they will begin to sell their fortune early and make the price fall, so your 0.1BTC will never be pretty valuable. Also all the diversification to other coins will not make that likely.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:14:38
Only if there are people following it while believing all this (crap). There seems to be a lot of them. What I want to say is that this is most likely more about the "news" and what people make of it, truth or not, not just a pump out of nowhere. But sure, the downward spiral in the late months regarding BCHSV helped with pulling it up again.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:32:48
That's not an analogy, Bitcoin was unknown back then, don't be foolish, everybody knows today. I sold 100 BTC for 20$ each and forgot about the thing, till I sold another one for 400$. This is not history repeating, because the present is so much different, look at how much coins there are for example. Back then there were: NONE.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:14:06
Would it be possible for the real Satoshi (one person or a group) to verify that they still exist, but are not Wright? I have no info about the whole situation, so it's my serious question.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:53:11
Yeah well an opinion without arguments is as much worth as Peepcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:35:25
So you think it will be easy to gain 10x of what you have, while others have 10BTC already, they will have 100BTC then, that's a bit unlikely isn't it. Don't you think they would sell a huge amount of their 7,2million? Please, please, do not think from your perspective but from the ones that already are in on this. 0,1BTC is a joke for them.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:04:01
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:26:34
Yeah well, and people will just wait and never live their lives with the profit they already made right? Also humans are pretty bad in predicting the future, they only have the past and present, which doesn't really help.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:02:35
Not really to be honest.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:07:16
You could work one month and then invest 800$ and have 0.1 BTC, so why the fuzz? I am just curious. What do you do with 0.1 BTC? Wait for you dreams while this amount of money is pretty much nothing? Why not just buy another 0.1 BTC if you believe it will be so valuable?
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:22:58
So what's the deal, "they" are all the big players, the global "financial elite", you think they don't add up to a million BTC when there are 21M max? ;-)
But yes, exaggeration is not helpful, I agree.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:15:33
No, it was just Craig.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:44:23
One wealthy dude on all the major exchanges? You sure? ;-)
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:56:32
Shouldn't you just take some profit OUT since it doubled after you put something IN in winter? You bought in low and you should consider selling something of it high (which is always a relative term). Because what do you expect will be the time you feel it's "time to sell"? When it's crashing and everybody is in a panic mode?
You have a lot of cash in your pockets? Maybe think about giving something to trustworthy charity organizations. Doesn't look like your money is used for anything in particular.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:08:26
I agree, that of course is a main factor - maybe the biggest one that many people are actually in for in crypto, although claiming it's because they believe in something.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:01:25
I would advice (again) to cash out and only have the initial investment left. Because then you have your 4x profit secure and don't give a damn about the initial investment. I would be emotionally invested if my "profit" would still be in the market though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:56:39
The difference between BTC going way up in the past was that nobody saw it coming and nobody had an idea where it would or could stop rising, now expectations are high and everybody seems to wait for it and also we have a virtual ceiling of the ATH, so of course you will be disappointed.
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:36:16
Don't forget that this advice is as worthless as any other advice on predicting the future. Because Chaka42 is certainly not a clairvoyant. By the way, just ask yourself what you want to do with "investing" (more like speculating) in Bitcoin with 100$ worth of money. What's your goal?
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:14:53
No it's not possible and I won't discuss this matter with a person that has no arguments. Give me the math please and try to show me what you got there in your mind.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:22:01
Of course they should, what advice is that? Sell down to what 0.1 BTC is worth now for example. So you have made a profit and don't miss out. And if it goes back down you really won't care.
You will never be rich with 0.1BTC, don't be a fool. You think BTC will secretely rise again to unbelievable numbers? This time is over, all over the world people with lots of money are in on this, they have large teams of advisors, built enourmous mining farms. Think they will wait till your 0.1 BTC will reach 100k, so they can sell their Quadrillions in USD? Nope.
Also in some countries people are super poor and hope to get some money in with this. Do you think they wait till they are country millionaires, even though they are starving and 100$ means a months' work for them? ...
