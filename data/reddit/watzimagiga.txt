It's not irrelevant. If you read the statement from valve when they removed bitcoin, it specifically mentions price volatility. I haven't read the microsoft's one, but I don't see why it would be any different.

I think a big part of the problem is the price volatility. But yes the scaling/fees problem is valid too.

Did I say steam didn't? No, because they did. They also said about price volatility, which you said wasn't an issue. It is.

Why? I love talking with my friends/family who have similar investment interests. It's fun, and you get ideas from eachother. Lots of my most successful investments have been tips from friends.

It's only a myth if you have the money to invest now and you hold it back. If you invest as you earn and dollar cost average, it works. That's my understanding.

Lol. We found the guy everyone. The 1 guy that actually knows what's going to happen! Thank God!

No one yet you knob lol. Also like you said it's probable, not certain. So it still has the chance to go up or down, regardless of what actually happens. But saying someone is a moron for thinking a hugely fluctuating coin might go down again is a bit harsh.

It's a shame many learned these fundamentals AFTER losing loads gambling on crypto.
