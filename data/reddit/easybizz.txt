In Paris using Fahrenheit? You’re from the US/ Liberia/Burma on Holliday/Business trip? But your language setting is French, so maybe ExPat. I’m narrowing you down. Almost at your private key.

Exactly, I think that is the end of the dip. Could be wrong though idk.

Are you expecting an answer from me?

No, thanks [deleted]! ♥️��

Well here’s the thing. The insiders got so much free powered coins they now all started a lambo racetrack on the moon. So it couldn’t be them in the picture.

My apologies, you’re right. There is no reason to think that, based on just the picture. Just as there is no reason to think it IS in Iran. And assuming the dudes are Chinese. It doesn’t look like a mosque either, nothing suggest anything Islamic. So ‘Here’s a random warehouse, somewhere in the world, with 2 Asian dudes in it’. That should’ve been the img’s caption.
