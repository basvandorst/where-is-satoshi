@_date: 2018-08-02 11:02:24
Will we get a android and ios version.....
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:09:43
Yea..unsafe code can make many people poor....but large exchange (basically main exchange of one country) with enough money can fund such thing to their devs if it overall improves the security of the system why r they not doing so...is it ideogical defference(like they hate it) or they realy don't know(thinking their might be some bug in segwit native addresd format from which they can lose their coin)....plz tell
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:20:06
Hahahaha....don't worry i still have lots of testnet3 coins to play with and get all the knowledge i need...so when the government in my place have a brain i can still buy some real one....but i see that future far away.....lol....:-p
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:09:24
Oh Thanks...:-)
@_date: 2018-08-26 11:40:12
Is it very hard to implement segwit native address format with its added security of 128 bits compared to hash160 80 bits security....can they not take help from bitcoin core client and samourai wallet code and maybe ask their devs...
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:47:49
Oh...Thanks...lots of new info...it always makes me want to study more new stuff....:-)
@_date: 2018-08-07 09:08:30
So bassically can i even hide some of my coins(small amount brought from a centralised exchange with all logs info kyc and aml stuff with full spying) by using stonewall and other cool stuff like ricochet and payment code...(even with more fee) and still get some of my coin back to me with no link at all from the exchange...
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:29:34
Oh wow...0.71 or 0.071 both r so much btc to hold on a mobile wallet with no idea about the wallet full functions(source code stuff) but wow even 0.071 is too much for me since i don't even have a tiny fraction of btc but lots of testnet3 coins for playing....lol...:-p
@_date: 2018-08-07 09:11:06
I thought that only chainalysis devs and government control the secret method to do their bitcoin blockchain spying....still Thanks....
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:00:58

How can any one start one if they have not even a single fraction of btc.....for a sell order....and buy order for buying btc from others and paying them in cash is on western and european 1st world countries....i also can't buy any btc not even a tiny fraction in my place...and buy order for btc in cash on both bisq and localbitcoin is neglible....

@_date: 2018-08-05 13:39:22

@_date: 2018-08-06 14:03:42
Plz talk about segwit native address format of bitcoin(btc) and why its taking time for all wallets and exchanges to impliment a base 32 fromat with its upgraded security(correct me if i m wrong) and how is it different form the bitcoin cash(bch) cashaddress format...specify their pros and cons in every attack vector....

@_date: 2018-08-05 23:33:08
Is it 2 cents or $2 dollar....so it means we just have to check mempool everytime we want to do tiny transaction....
