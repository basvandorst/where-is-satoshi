I remember when it first spiked to +$1100 then dropped to as low as $189 (which is my lowest buy price). These price swings have always been a part of Bitcoin. If you worry about short term price swings then you are not in Bitcoin for the long term I think.

Are you talking about something like running Ubuntu from a thumb drive? The way you do that is download the Ubuntu ISO (either 18.04 or 19.04) and burn to a USB drive with Rufus or Etcher. Restart PC, set the USB drive to boot first in BIOS, and Ubuntu give option to test out the OS live without install or installing to another drive. You can do and install whatever you want in the live OS but nothing will be saved upon reboot because it's running from RAM.

I remember back in the day the discussions about what to call the smallest unit, and when it was decided to be called Satoshi. I always preferred bits to Satoshi though. It fits with the 'bit' part of 'bit'coin more, rather than an arbitrary honoring of Satoshi that regular people won't know or care about.
@_date: 2019-03-06 17:32:25
Unpopular opinion: I still wish bitcoin used SI units. Something like:
*  .000000001 = 1 femtobitcoin
*  .000001 = 1 microbitcoin
*  .001 = 1 millibitcoin
*  .01 = 1 centibitcoin
*  .1 = 1 decibitcoin
*  1 = **Bitcoin**
*  10 = 1 decabitcoin
*  100 = 1 hectobitcoin
*  1000 = 1 kilobitcoin
*  1000000 = 1 Megabitcoin
So there's 21 Megabitcoins, and a satoshi could just be called 1 femtobitcoin or just 1 bit, even though its actually 10 femtobitcoins. 
I have a feeling Americans had a say in how to divide and name bitcoin units.

@_date: 2019-03-06 23:31:20
So drop the less common SI prefixes. We don't weight things in hectograms, do we? 
More compact:
* .000000001 = 1 bit
* .000001 = 1 microbit. There's 1,000 bits in a microbit.
* .001 = 1 millibit. There's 1,000 microbits in a millibit. 
* 1 = 1 Bitcoin. Theres 1,000 millibits in a Bitcoin
* 1000 = kilobitcoin (or kilobit). Theres 1,000 Bitcoin in a kilobitcoin; or just say 1 thousand bitcoins
* 1000000 = 1 megabitcoin (or megabit). There's 1,000 kilobitcoins in a megabitcoin; or just say 1 - 
 21 million bitcoins.
Perhaps just use SI prefix for fractional bitcoin values and amounts ≥ 1 bitcoin has no SI prefix.

You have -$15 to your name and you want $20 to buy flowers and a stuffed animal. The flowers will only live a few days and a week from now you will still have -$15 + dead flowers &amp; stuffed animal.
If you aquire $20, would it not be wiser to use it to turn that -$15 to +$5? Or use it to buy non perishable foods like a big bag of dried rice and beans?
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:47:21

Use this site to download block chain data by torrent instead of syncing on the pi or another PC.   You'll get the full block chain in a few hours (depending on internet speed) rather than a few weeks.
Connecting a HDD to the pi to store block chain is better way to go. But it's not as easy as just connecting it to USB and off you go like with Windows or Mac. The Pi uses Linux. **EVERYTHING IS HARDER WITH LINUX**. You have to connect the drive, find it's id, use fdisk to make a mount folder, set permissions (fucking permissions), maybe set automount on boot, all sorts of stuff.

I keep a spreadsheet with info from each transaction. Looking at it, here's what I got:

**Median price BTC**: $993.99
**Max price BTC**: $19,450.78 (December 2017)
**Min price BTC**: $227.70 (June 2015)
I've been into Bitcoin since late 2013 so my average is actually around $2,500 and median price is $620.
edit: corrected numbers, added median price. I'm not going to give numbers of how much USD value went in initially, current value or current amount of BTC I have, but my spreadsheet has Total Percent Gain/Loss @ +303.5662%

I like it. I used to use Coinbase or Circle to auto buy a set dollar amount each week and watch charts to panic buy if the price dropped a bit. I did 2 test runs with Bitwage of like $10 per paycheck and liked getting a percentage amount instead of set amount per paycheck. The more/less $ I earn per paycheck, the more/less BTC I earn per paycheck. Noticed in my second year of using Bitwage I hadn't used my exchange accounts in long time and logged in to them just to see if I still had account. I love automation set and forget so Bitwage works for me.
@_date: 2019-01-01 17:11:51
Can you direct deposit to Coinbase Pro? I've read a few posts about bank accounts (I'm with a credit union) being closed for frequent bitcoin related transactions. I really like percentages more than a set amount because my income varies by week. I've thought about averaging my past annual incomes, seeing what 5% of that is, then dividing by 52 weeks per year, and buying that per week.

My goal isn't to make huge dollar gains by timing the market or other stock market strategies though. My goal is to aquire Bitcoin in as safe a manner as I can. It's neat when the value go up (esp Dec 2017) but that's not the goal. 5% of each paycheck is all I feel comfortable with. I think Bitcoin and crypto is extremely interesting and will be important in the future but I still have bills to pay and family to support. It would be irresponsible to pretend to be a trader or go 100% all in like some people here do when other people rely on me.

Blockchain.info exchange rate for same transaction: $4121.74 USD/BTC
Difference between exchanges: $106.91 USD/BTC, ≈2.5%

If Bitcoin experiences another Nov 2013 87% level crash, that'd put us around $2.5k per BTC.

@_date: 2019-05-17 18:53:09
Oh was it? I thought I read a long time ago it was around $30. Doesn't change the value too much. I guess it gives a price range of around $0.003-0.006 / btc.
