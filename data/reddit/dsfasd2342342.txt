The .1 BTC signup fee is only for selling BTC.. you can buy BTC right away.
also, the site is called  not transferwire :p

The problem is that if you advertise that you're doing that, it will attract scammers with stolen paypal accounts. Most people are honest and it works out fine, but if you make it commonly known that you sell for paypal then it won't be long before a scammer finds you.
bitbargain really couldn't be any easier to use.. I think you'll have a good experience with it. the transferwise thing is pretty easy too although it takes a bit longer.. they even support sending money from your bank account's linked debit card -- although they still need your bank account info to set up -- but basically you can initiate a transfer from the transferwise site without logging into your online banking, which makes it one step easier to send money to the exchange.

There are basically two main ways to get BTC in the UK;
 -- p2p exchange using local UK bank transfers.. fast (avg completion time is ~8min using faster payments) but has a bit of a price premium - usually not that bad though.
 -- send very cheap SEPA bank transfers to one of the exchanges that has an EUR bank account.. favourites for this are bitstamp.net and bitcoin-24.com. This is probably the cheapest way to get BTC.. it takes usually around 24hrs to get money into an exchange.
