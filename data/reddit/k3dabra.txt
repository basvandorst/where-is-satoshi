I'd like to understand more about what different blockchains are and what they might be used for.  Alot of people on the forum seem to be concerned only with how much fiat money or goods they can eventually exchange their bitcoin for. I admit its a draw, but I'm trying to understand its true value as a future technology with inevitable downsides.
So yeah..if you can point me to good info on the ideas around this technology and what it can be, beyond money, great

Thanks I'll take a look at those.
It would be amazing if the miners found coins by solving non abstract problems like discovering new drugs or curing diseases or searching for alien communications

Interesting. i can see his argument if renewables are being used. Not sure about coal/gas though, which is used alot in China still. That shit needs to stay in the ground...

It does depend what you mean by "good", i mean you could argue we've already emitted too much and should literally be scrubbing c02 out of the air -we're already in the middle of a mass extinction, but i guess its not quite clear how cryptos will influence that process long term. In the short term it looks like a horrible amount of emissions produced for something that has not yet proven itself..

Cryptos can't be destroyed in the same way as a centralised company like Myspace since they (especially bitcoin) are based on a distributed network. Companies have staff to pay, overheads, and when they fold they are gone. Bitcoin could become very unpopular, but  can't be destroyed. I'm a noob though so please correct me.

Why LOL at carbon footprint? According to this from Dec 9th 
"each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the US for one day. "

Its hard to find objective information about the efficiency, security and sustainabilty of coins. I heard some newer coins are less secure too, eg bitcoin cash seems rushed thru, and obvs there is a rush to exploit cryptos popularity, so i'm skeptical of claims about new coins...
