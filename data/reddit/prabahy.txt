I love it, but having both the size and color represent the BTC transacted seems redundant. Could you keep the size the same, but change the color to something like fee/tx size?

They won't revoke segwit. At this point nobody could "revoke segwit" without causing millions of dollars of BTC to be lost and the price to crash. Both full nodes and miners would reject any attempt to revoke segwit.

Its probably your change. Think of it like when you give somebody a $20 bill. Unless you owe exactly $20, they need to give you some back. The same thing happens in bitcoin. You send some to them, and some back to yourself (at a new address). Each wallet has an unlimited number of addresses in it that can all be spent by using the same Ledger nano s.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:38:55
Please quote the whole tweet. Luke believes that blocks should be smaller than they already are. Many/most people want blocks to be bigger and using segwit for all transactions allows that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:38:00
Yes, all the wallets that I have heard about that support segwit addresses also support sending to legacy addresses and p2sh addresses.

Github's sorting is a bit broken, but it appears to me that merging full Segwit support into core is currently the most commented on MR in Bitcoin Core's history. ( It is not that "they won't implement it themselves". It is that they are being very careful how they do it and are making sure that it is fully tested so that they minimize the chance of introducing bugs.

These limitations have been mostly resolved in the upcoming release. It is my understanding that it should be pushed out in the next month or 2. Unfortunately, a month or 2 doesn't help if they fill up in the next couple of days, but at least there is a path forward.

The DB corruption should be fixed in the latest version of Bitcoin Core, so that should at least help a bit.
For you I would recommend using a Trezor. It has very strong security properties and is not hard to use.

I would want see the math on this before going too far. Most heaters are essentially a big resistor. Resistors are generally very cheap while ASICs are relatively expensive. If it ends up that the ASIC powered heater only makes $.01 per day and costs $20 extra it would over 5 years to see an ROI.
An antminer S7 ( takes ~1200 watts of power to run and costs $1823. On the other hand the first 1200 watt space heater that popped up on google ( costs ~$100. That comparison might be a bit unfair, but it shows that producing heat with an ASIC costs at least 1 order of magnitude more capital expense to start.

In the GUI there is a way to adjust the DB cache that will help improve sync time. Go to Settings -&gt; Options -&gt; Adjust "Size of database cache". The bigger it is, the faster the sync should go. Even with a huge cache it will still take a while because it needs a lot of CPU to crunch the signatures.

IMO, bitcoin transfers should be similar to bank transfers because there is fundamentally no way to make them secure in less than 10 minutes (on average). 10 minutes is too slow to preform face to face transactions, so lets not waste our time trying to make it work. Instead, lets build a layer like lightning, sidechains, or opentransactions on top of bitcoin to allow for secure instant transactions and then settle them on the bitcoin network a little later.
@_date: 2016-03-31 01:09:38
That method doesn't help you get the full utxo any faster than starting at block 1 and going forward. With your method, if I am half way done with the sync and I see a transaction that spends a transaction that is not in the UTXO, does the transaction have an invalid input or have I just not finished syncing to where its input was created?
The whole idea behind reverse block sync is that the UTXO is immediately available and progressively validated (in reverse). What you propose won't have the UTXO until all blocks have been processed.

I really hope this catches on. I believe that multiple independent implementations (bcoin, btcd, bitcoind) is better for consensus than one single version that everyone must run. If/when the network accidentally forks (unknown rule, AKA  again, it will be more clear which is the "correct" fork based on which fork more implementations follow.

A USB drive isn't going to get you much/any more security than you already have. If you want to get something more secure look at a Trezor ( or a Ledger ( I believe that both of these integrate directly into Mycelium so should be easy for you to learn while still improving your security.
If you want want to go full hardcore cold wallet, I still recommend Armory ( There was recently some trouble with the corporate backing of Armory, but one of the developers appears to be carrying the torch independently now. Armory is a bit more tricky to use, but provides a nice interface for a truly cold wallet.

I doubt it had a memory leak, but the old design let the mempool get arbitrarily large. If somebody sent out a bunch of spam transactions the only way to purge them from your node was to restart it. From the outside this might have looked like a memory leak, but it was actually working as designed.
@_date: 2016-01-25 05:20:08
The wallet needs a chance to look at the data before it is pruned to see if it is relevant to the wallet or not. If it is relevant, it is recorded in wallet.dat, if not it is ignored.
If the node was pruned before the wallet was in place then it wouldn't have the historical data to scan and it wouldn't be able to show you old transactions.
Yes, there were changes to the wallet code in 0.12 to make it work better.
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:00:59

Is there a reason that you aren't using 0.11.2? It had some improvements that should make the way that it writes to disk safer even if your computer crashes.
A bad internet connection shouldn't be able to hurt bitcoin. Everything is signed/hashed/verified, so if something managed to get corrupted on the wire (unlikely) it would still get caught before breaking anything. I would be more worried about bad memory or a bad hard disk.
Just make sure not to delete wallet.dat. Everything else can be deleted, but I wouldn't recommend it without looking at your log files. In general bitcoin core is robust enough that given enough time it will sync without manually deleting any files. I would tend to use -reindex before trying to manually delete any files.

It won't happen until something like lightning is popular. Bitcoin isn't designed for microtransactions like those that happen at an arcade.
Fundamentally, I think its a pretty cool idea. The machines would just have a QR code somewhere on the screen. You just scan it with your phone, send the bitcoin, and it lets you start playing.
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:23:27
Not really. If the merchant puts 400USD in the QR code, what is to stop the customer from sending .25BTC and saying that they just got a super awesome exchange rate? For a safe, fair transaction the QR code must include the amount in BTC and the users wallet should display the amount to the user in his/her preferred currency.

@_date: 2016-01-23 17:22:45
I'm not a dev, but I think I can answer most of these questions.
1) The wallet is responsible for tracking addresses that it cares about. The is only a minimal amount of coordination to allow the wallet to do its job before data gets pruned.
2) Correct, you must have your wallet in place before you begin pruning. Once pruning is enabled, you will no longer be able to scan for old transactions.
3) The wallet keeps all transactions related to the addresses that it cares about.
4) Yep.  says that you just need to pass -prune=N. This hasn't changed in 0.12.0
5) There is a special status that RPC requests will return during startup. After that, they should return but they make take a little longer if the node is busy.
6) It is quick. Seconds/minutes.
People have mentioned getting specific pruned data as needed, but nothing has been coded yet. I believe that patches would be accepted, but nobody has gotten around to implementing this yet.

Dollar cost averaging just means buying the same value of something on a fixed period. Basically it would be like buying $50 of Apple stock every two weeks. Doing that is less risky than trying to time the market because it is very hard to predict exactly when the price will go up or down.
What I wanted was to compare dollar cost averaging to a strategy that is related to this website. If using the website to preform an enhanced dollar cost averaging strategy would cause more profit in the past then it might be a good idea to use that strategy in the future.

One of the best things you can do to sync quickly is turn the up the memory that Bitcoin Core is allowed to use. To adjust this click Setting -&gt; Options -&gt; Change "Size of database cache" to a larger number (2000 if your system can handle it). Once the initial sync is done you can turn it back down.

1. I recommend some sort of offline hardware wallet for long term HODLing. The trezor is very well respected in the community. If your only buying $25 per month, it may be worth it to hold off for ~1 year before deciding to purchase a trezor (or similar).
2. Correct, old address will still work, but it is generally better to use a new address each time. In the future, there might be a better way to handle this, but for now I would just let Coinbase do the recurring transaction.

Google "utxo commitment". Basically everyone thinks it's a good idea and that every block should contain a hash of the utxo, but there is a lot of different ways to do that hash. If the hash is done correctly, there are many things that it can be used for than just faster sync times.
IMO, we should start with a simple hash of the previous block's utxo and get more complicated as use cases arise. The downside is that every time this hash is changed, Bitcoin will need to have a soft fork.

Mainly it improves your own security. If you run a full node, there are no tricks that a malicious 3rd party could do to attack you.
The other benefit is that it makes the network more robust. It is much harder to knock 1000 computers off the internet than it is to knock 100 off. Some of the latest DDOS attacks that have been have had enough bandwidth behind them that they could send a gigabit of traffic at every known bitcoin node. If that ever happened, bitcoin \(or any altcoin\) would struggle to have the nodes stay connected.
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:09:29
It depends on how your non-full node trusts the actual full node. For example it might ask "What are all the UTXOs for address 1hsjhe...?" The trusted node might skip UTXOs that it knows about or include UTXOs that don't actually exist in it's reply.
Basically the only way to overcome a huge DDOS attack is to have more bandwidth than your attacker. Each node adds a bit of bandwidth, so the entire network can survive larger attacks with more nodes.

In my opinion:
Android - Mycelium
iOS - Breadwallet
Simple - Electrum or Multibit HD

Dedicated Hardware - Trezor
@_date: 2015-08-31 02:46:43
IMO, the best way to do this is to use a dedicated solution like Trezor or Armory offline instead of a general solution (PGP). Most bitcoin wallets also have strong built-in encryption so PGP is not necessary. This encryption is bitcoin aware so it allows you to check your balance without your password, but requires a password to send any bitcoin.
To do what you were talking about you will need to make a second wallet. To "take X amount out of my wallet", just make a transaction from your existing wallet to your new wallet. Verify that you have received the bitcoin in the second wallet (not technically necessary, but it should make you feel good). Close the 2nd wallet. Encrypt the 2nd wallet with PGP. Delete the unencrypted copy of the 2nd wallet.
As always, be careful deleting files to ensure that you delete the file that you intend.

To clarify, by some estimations there are ~350k of "legitimate" transactions per block. The remaining are spam and other similar nonsense (stress tests, etc.). The miners can choose to either include the spam or ignore it (and not include it in a block). If they include the spam, they pass the burden of storing that history on to everybody running a full node. If they ignore it, they risk censoring legitimate transactions that get classified as spam, but make it easier to run a full node. There is some development that still needs to be finished to reduce any negative effects of "stuck" transactions (
IMO, I believe that mining pools could do a better job of ignoring spam, but I also don't want to see any legitimate transactions get "stuck" because no pools will confirm them because they look too much like spam. This is a fundamentally difficult problem that has plagued and been fought by email providers for years. The inclusion/size of the fee associated with a transaction is just 1 small tool that can be used for spam prevention.
@_date: 2015-08-31 02:33:40
The security concern is that right now even if all the miners colluded (51% attack) they couldn't make coins appear out of nowhere. If you trust a UTXO commitment as your starting point, miners could collude to create invalid coins (before that commitment) and your node would have no way of knowing that it happened.

0.15 added a way to load multiple wallets at the same time. If you do that, it will rescan them all simultaneously. I don't think multiple wallets show up in the gui yet. You would need to use the CLI.

It might not be the easiest, but Armory is a local wallet that offers a GUI that supports multisig. You will need one powerful online node (to keep a copy of the blockchain) and as many extra clients as you want. Armory uses the term "Lockbox" to describe this functionality.

The data in OP_RETURN will stay in the blockchain forever, however it will not stay in the pruned dataset. There will always be at least 1 node that maintains the full unpruned blockchain or no new nodes would be able to sync with the network.

Not exactly an answer, but 
@_date: 2015-08-27 03:20:26
Sort of, but it probably wouldn't do exactly what you want. The main reason for using a cluster is because 1 machine can't do all the work. Lets assume a network where something has happened where a node does not have enough resources to be a full node, but wants to be as useful/safe as possible.
The resources that could most obviously run out are network bandwidth, CPU power, and hard drive space.
Hard drive space has already been address about as well as possible. Pruning can be enabled for a full node quite easily and reduces the needed disk space to a quite trivial amount (~1GB right now). If somebody wrote a custom serializer they could probably squeeze a few more percent of space out of this. If a node doesn't have enough space it can map a remote disk using a technology like NFS. If we want it to look more like a cluster it can use something like Tahoe-lafs or gluster to distribute the storage requirements of several other computers.
CPU power is a bit more tricky. Right now once bitcoin coin has caught up to the tip of the blockchain it doesn't really use much CPU power. There are plans to replace OpenSSL with libsecp256k1 which should reduce the CPU usage by at least 5x even while catching up. To get any better than that we need to start getting creative. For example, if we assume that all the nodes in the cluster are trusted we could delegate signature verification to seperate nodes and have a master node check transaction validity against the UTXO and other consensus rules. If the other nodes are untrusted, I'm not sure exactly how this could be sharded into multiple pieces.
The final resource that could run out is network bandwidth. Right now the bitcoin protocol has several inefficiencies that cause data to get transmitted several times. There have been several ideas to improve the protocol including  In the end you will need at least MaxBlockSize download bandwidth every 10 minutes to guarantee that you can download all the blocks. While you are catching up you will need to download the entire blockchain (currently ~45GB). If UTXO commitments get implemented, then you can pick any UTXO commitment and start catching up from there significantly reducing the total bandwidth you need (at a tradeoff of some security). In a trusted cluster, the cluster would need to have at least external bandwidth to stay caught up with the blockchain. Even then it doesn't make much sense because a SPV node can stay caught up by only downloading the headers and probably requires less trust than a cluster.
Hopefully this didn't devolve into to many generalities about bitcoin scalability. In the end, I don't see too much of a need/use for bitcoin specific clusters. IMO, if UTXO commitments are implemented it could lead to some interesting cluster-like behavior, but it would be more like a bunch of partial nodes than a traditional cluster.

I wouldn't really call it a problem. Imagine if a person walked into a store and dumped a bucket of pennies on the counter to pay for something. It would be a mess, but the store could either choose to ignore the mess and just leave it there or spend some money to clean it up.
With bitcoin that behavior leads to the same possible 2 outcomes. There needs to be a bit more development to have a wallet gracefully handle this, but bitcoin (at the protocol level) already handles this pretty much as well as possible.
I'll be interested to see how payment processors (bitpay) will handle this. The could say that the payment was incomplete, but I see the "attackers" point that they paid the amount requested.

Defined cracked. Most widely reviewed hash functions don't just instantly go from secure to insecure overnight. A hardworking researcher usually finds a weakness in one of the specific aspects of the hash's properties (preimage resistance, collision resistance, length extension resistance, etc.). This attack usually reduces the probability of each bit having a 50-50 chance of being a 1 or 0 to something more like 49-51 chance.
The most likely result (depending on the "crack") would be a non-crisis. Miners would build new version of ASICs that incorporate the crack to make them faster, but that would be about it. If the community decides that sha-256 is looking too weak there will likely be a hard fork to migrate to some other hash function like SHA-3.

There would still be problems with CPU and bandwidth usage. Even though your node doesn't have to store the entire blockchain, it still would need to download it. Most phone's data plans cap at ~5GB, but you currently need 40+ GB to validate the entire blockchain. I guess you could force it to only sync over wifi, but even then you would have trouble with CPU usage. Fully optimized, it would take a mobile phone several hours at 100% CPU usage to fully validate the blockchain. This would eat the entire battery so it would probably be limited to working while the phone plugged in.
In the end, the only way that it makes sense to run a full node on a cell phone is to have it running wifi and be plugged in, but at that point is it really a cell phone anymore?

I disagree with some of eligius's policies, but this might actually make sense. If eligius is not mining the spammers transactions it makes it harder for the spammer to reuse their funds. If all miners were more picky about not mining spam, the mempool would stay large, but it wouldn't actually effect "real" transactions.

I agree that it is a theoretical and impractical attack, but was pointing out the weakness that is added by trusting a UTXO commitment. Also, the attacker(s) would have to generate all five years. They could just start 1 block before the commitment that you are going to trust.

That bandwidth is what makes your full node more secure than a SPV client. Pretty much by definition it isn't a full node if it doesn't at least download all the blocks. Why running a full node is more secure was addressed in the OP.
"Using a full node as your wallet is the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin's rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed (e.g. difficulty.) All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server."
@_date: 2016-02-28 05:03:08
Your first point is true. Bitcoin is run as a network of computers. If you want you can download an run a full node and be part of that network. If something breaks, nobody is obligated to fix it for you.
Bitcoin is not from a private company. The code is open source and anybody can run a full node. As long as there is at least 1 full node and 1 miner somewhere in the world, Bitcoin will continue to exist.
There are many bitcoin exchanges. Some of more popular ones are Coinbase, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp. Most of these are privately owned, but have been publicly scrutinized. It is true that your money is at risk while the exchange holds it, but that is more of a problem with fiat banking being slow than anything directly Bitcoin related. With Bitcoin transactions take ~10 minutes. With fiat transactions take 3-5 business days.
Hopefully that helps.

You would need a very good reputation in the bitcoin community to make them worth anything.

Nobody gets turned off by cash because they can spend it pretty much everywhere with little to no effort. If the person isn't familiar with bitcoin, they need to figure out what Bitcoin is, download a Bitcoin wallet, figure out how to transfer the Bitcoin into their wallet, find a store that accepts bitcoin, then actually use it. I am a huge bitcoin supporter, but I still accept that it isn't as popular as cash or credit card.

Basically every piece of hardware has a list of features that it can do. A flash drive can store and retrieve files. A hardware wallet can store your private key and use it to sign bitcoin transactions, but it was intentionally designed without having a way to export the private key to the computer.

Propagation latency only really matters to miners. For everyone else, as long as they get the block within a minute or 2 it's fine. Even in huge networks the latency only goes up a function of log(n). Compact blocks was just introduced recently and also helps decrease the amount of bandwidth needed when a block is found.
I guess my main point is that we should focus more on getting more full nodes than worrying about possible side effects.

The new blocks will be accepted by old clients and are therefore considered a softfork. No old client would accept new blocks after increasing the block size limit.

Fundamentally the number of bitcoin transactions per second is limited by 3 variables:
1. Maximum Block Size
2. Transaction Size
3. Block Speed
Right now the Maximum Block Size is being debated at great length, but for now it is limited at 1MB. The transaction size is quite variable. Multiple transactions can get grouped together into a smaller number of bitcoin transactions using sidechains. In addition, wallets can be smarter about combining multiple transactions to make each transaction larger, but at a higher transaction density (more useful stuff per byte). Finally, the block speed is at 1 block every 1o minutes and nobody has really seriously talked about adjusting that.
Until one of these 3 variables changes significantly, we will not reach 1 million bitcoin transactions per second. IMO, the is not a need to do that many TPS, but the current number is still too small.

The "math problem" is checking to see the output of a SHA256 after picking a random nonce.


It is not based on a percentage. Every transaction includes a fee. The pool (miner) decides using its own rules which transactions to include or not. Many end up following a fee per byte system because there are a limited number of bytes in the block, so that is a scarce resource.


Pretty much. Miners can put anywhere from 0tx to 1mb of transactions in each block. To increase the 1mb, there would need to be consensus (hard/soft fork) from a majority of market/miners.
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:12:49
Basically, just do all the normal stuff. Install OS and application updates quickly, turn off unnecessary services, close unnecessary ports, take nightly backups, use strong passwords, etc.
If you want to get fancy, I would run the node on an internet facing machine and the wallet on a LAN only machine. Point the wallet to the node using -connect=. This reduces your attack surface even more.
Edit: If you run in a VM, the host could easily steal your wallet. If there is a bug in the VM application, any other VM on the same host could potentially steal your wallet.
Edit 2: If you have thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin, you might want to look into air gaping the wallet, but that is more complex.
