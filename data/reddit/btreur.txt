I hope but first I want to buy some more at 9k
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:55:45
The time will pay your will my fellow hodler
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:59:03
You think can reach that amount? I don’t know it is to high... no other asset has that price but itself...
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:56:23
Well I’m not in US or Europe so is quite hard to sell to fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:53:06
If I put 200 with 40% gains from BTC after cashing I have enough for a new phone.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:47:29
Thanks for the clarification but I am outside US. Maybe a European option for Amazon or Apple gif cards?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:12:33
I regret not buying 2011 and now not buying enough 2019 first quarter...
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:05:57
I guess what I can afford to lose I may keep it in a exchange and the other in a cold wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:10:25
Yeah but the idea is to have a constant bulky price not a bull and drops each time. At least for hold strategy.
Trading is other history.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:27:31
I guess that’s the plant. If by any means goes down I mortgage my dog to buy more lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:26:40
Wow dude thats thought. Let’s not miss this opportunity. Probably we lose the lambos but fuck at least let’s get a nice retirement.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:46:15
Yes that what I am planning to do and part of my learning process is to know an exit strategy. You never know what could happen.
Image those who exit at 19k and rebought at 3k in 2018.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:14:33
Explain more please
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:56:17
Yeah me too if BTC goes below 5K I will happy as hell
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:42:36
Yeah but I am ya about loosing the money I can afford to lose. So if a put 10k I am ok risking 5k and let the other 5k in hold.
I want to know how to cash or avoid crash on those 5k I can’t afford to loose.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:50:44
I know people who bought at 14k and by January 2018 were crying.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:41:48
Exactly. For small amounts is ok to use hot wallets but if the amount of bigger a cold wallet is the path to follow.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:40:48
Just imagine 100k BTC at the end of the year...
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:54:05
Yes and is a long run. We all know that here but will be nice to know a exit strategy just in case something happens.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:09:05
Is to late?
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:57:18
Yeah but If a lose what I can afford it is ok for me but loosing all well it is not.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:21:39
Yeah me too. But just imaging that...
