Is now a good time to invest?
What if I invest in the wrong one before the fork? I know just enough to be dangerous but that's it.

This feels super 90s futuristic.

So the wall creator is betting there will be more volume below the wall than they needed to create the wall. Thus they have a larger holding than they started with and were able to buy in at a lower amount than what they sold for. Am I correctly stating the benefit to this strategy?

Would the exchange retain the key for that bitcoin? Didnt they have it before?

Ok that makes sense. Do transactions ever fail to be recorded and or confirmed in a freshly mined block? Are there examples of this happening? What recourse would the participants have? How would the situation be rectified?

Six months from now will i be kicking myself for not going in at $5800?

Fascinating. The wall owner would drive the price lower by creating more sell orders. I'm sure there isn't a good answer for this question but: "how many sell orders would need to be created to produce a wall i.e. what percentage of existing sell orders would need to be created?" I imagine it would need to be a significantly high percentage well above 50-100%. Maybe I'm looking down the wrong rabbit hole though.

Thanks for your help! And that transaction from the exchange to my wallet goes in the ledger with a uniques transaction id?

When you transfer to your wallet how do you know that you amd only you have the private key?

Ooh ok I didnt realize they could just cancel the sell orders. So does the meer act of placing the sell orders drive down the price? If you dont feel like taking time to explain it feel free to just tell me what the method is called and ill google it. =)
