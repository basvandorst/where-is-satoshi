It all depends on the level of risk you are willing to take, a smart portfolio has multiple levels of risk. How much risk? well thats up to you. Thats half the fun :p

10 panels at 300watts each (hopefully) so 3Kw with probably an 85% efficiency at full output depending where you live with full sunlight.
Asic miner is roughly 1350watts
So you can probably run 1 miner all the time with a good enough battery bank at night as well.
Anyways great work man, id love to see the numbers on all of this

Man, In 2013 I set up my mega gaming rig to mine bitcoin. It was something like average .2btc/month once i started. But after the first 20 minutes of running it, it sounded like my computer was going to die lol. So I stopped it, cause at the time it was my precious gaming PC and it wasnt worth only 60dollars a month if that.  
I wish I torched that mother fucker lol

Didn't most credit cards start treating crypto as a cash advance? Like pulling money out of an atm with a credit card, they will instantly charge you the 19% or whatever your rate is
