On miners, bought for fiat, running on electricity, also bought with fiat, exchanged on devices more accessible for those with money, utilising a network also paid for in fiat and more accessible to those with fiat. The majority hodlers are educated and likely not poor or struggling to get hold of money. Dealing in btc, even making simple transactions costs 4,5 times what the poorest have in a day to survive.  Lets not bullshit ourselves here.

The start of the year is historically a fairly stagnant time for crypto. Same thing happened last year. Another thing to note is festive times: both western and chinese new year is around this time and people tend to spend a lot of money so dont have much liquidity until around march

The last couple of forks are just people who are trying to create their own currencies and cash in on forks. These generally dont really have anything special to offer, and their value is so low that youll spend more in transaction fees to recover them than theyre worth, unless of course you own a lot of btc. The only fork that has gained any real traction thus far is the bitcoin cash fork. Doing the split can also open you up to certain risks, like lost/stolen private keys. Regarding coins on the exchange: certain exchanges dont generally do airdrops of btc forks, so youll be unable to recover it from coins that are on exchanges. Your coins are generally as safe as they usually are when there arent forks. That said, the safest way to keep your coins is in cold storage, but then looking after it is your responsibility, so cold storage is as safe as you make it.

Digiwallets.co.za sell hardware wallets in south africa. Hardware wallets are devices which you can store your currency offline, theyre also quite easy to use. Luno could be hacked, any online wallets/exchanges can be hacked. Otherwise you can look into paper wallets, but make sure you know how to generate them securely. Only keep currency you want to trade online.

This. Taxation takes many forms: income tax can be directly paid by employers, fuel levies, value added tax etc all exist. There are many other forms of income for states. The concept of a crypto world does not mean no taxes, but it does mean a financial system that isnt lorded over by a select few.

Eth does a better job at being a currency than btc does, at least until LN is implemented, and who knows when thatll be, then theres the fact that its offchain, which has other pros and cons not worth discussing here. Eth is also a bit more mature as far as smart contracts go, and is built for it from the ground up, their dev team is also quite a bit bigger, and provides a platform and language. Something btc doesnt. Its also deflationary, but the lack of hardcap keeps coin loss at bay. 
And IoT a mirage? What country do you live in that you arent already surrounded by connected devices? Either you live in a third world shithole, or you're blind. Considering we're chatting here, ima bet on the latter. Iota solves some serious issues in the IoT space: security, monetisation and standardisation. Its not a store of value, and its not really even a btc competitor, but it is very promising technology.
XRP is the devils plaything, but fact is it has a lot of opportunity to be implemented and have a lot of money flowing through it. If you're in this for money, its a promising investment.
Its fine to be a btc maximalist. I am, but being blind to other opportunities is just stupid. And attacking others for investigating those opportunities makes you an asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:33:56
Ltc's only saving grace is that its faster/cheaper than bitcoin. Bitcoin itself should scale and be as fast/cheap to use. 
 Im not sure wtf you're on about re Iota. The system you mentioned is the point of iota, to bring that standardisation. Itll take a while to implement, but not as long as you think. Its like not being in the 90s and reckoning fuck google, cause itpl take forever to implement a single gateway to most of the internet.
If banks adopt xrp, itll explode. Its more auditable and cheaper/quicker than btc will likely ever be, and comes without any stigma. Banks like making money. Transactions are expensive. Give them an option to save money there and theyll jump on it like a hungry hyena. Guaranteed.
Point is Value should be based upon functionality and adoption, and there are options that deliver on these. Bitcoin is booming because people heard its making a lot of money. Its kinda sad, cause get rich quick schemes have a history of not delivering.
Even if you think everything i say is bullshit. Diversification is a wise decision, and getting on your soapbox being an asshole preaching against it wont do anyone any favours.

Personally I think he was most likely Hal Finney: he disappeared a little while before Finney passed, likely cause he wanted to get his affairs in order. If not, he may have been hunted down and offed, or he disappeared and lives a peaceful life as a john doe on an island or some godforsaken place and may as well be considered dead to the world. The likelihood of him disappearing without a trace is super unlikely though. Some three letter agency has likely figured out who he was, and if they did, then chances are he's a goner, if he wasnt already. All just theories though, we may never know. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:23:34
Id like to know as well. I can only guess they may he more expensive(so not viable nodes, ie for shilling), and it might also be a centralisation issue: nodes propped up to feign support. Note this is not my opinion, just a guess as to why people may not be pro aws nodes. Thats not to say all nodes on aws are bad, just if its used in that context.

Theres been fud spread almost every day this week of some country clamping down, exchanges in bad situations or some other negative reasoning. Crypto is currently in a natural annual dip. Retail investors dont currently have the money to buy, and some are withdrawing to cover festive season costs. On the other hand seasoned traders know this, and fud is spread to reinforce this dip so coins can be gotten for very cheap before it starts climbing again around march. Thats the one side.
On the other side there are tons of positive fundamental news on various coins, but these stories dont reach as far because 1. Its kinda boring to the masses, 2. Its not very sensational.
Now is a very good time to buy, probably up until end of february.
