On a traditional exchange, do equities truly "change hands?" If I open an account today and buy a share of Apple, on a practical level I just have a promise from the exchange that I own a share of Apple, right? And I've agreed to something that allows them to loan it out to people short-selling, etc.?
It just seems arbitrary. At that point, how much different is that than an exchange holding Bitcoin for users off-chain, with the promise that they'll be able to withdraw it later?

That makes sense, but then could Bitcoin exchanges get around this by selling you a "certificate for Bitcoin" rather than Bitcoin itself? That certificate could even mean registering it with some third party.
Obviously a "certificate for Bitcoin" isn't the same (or worth quite as much) as on-chain Bitcoin, but it's really what you're being sold anyway most of the time, right? With the option of withdrawing it for real Bitcoin at some point?

Apparently OS X 10.11 El Capitan (beta just released for devs yesterday) doesn't run Java 6. I noticed the recommended way to get Bitcoin from Multibit Classic to Multibit HD is to spend them, but I won't be able to do that since I can't open Multibit Classic.
I'll be able to figure it out (probably just by copying the files over to an earlier Mac), but it's worth noting that others might have this issue going forward.

I don't know about you guys, but I owe a few more grand than I expected for my taxes this year, so I may need to sell some of my bitcoin to cover for that. Since that's a one-way circumstance (nobody is buying bitcoin to pay taxes), maybe others are doing the same thing.
If that's contributing, you can expect it to stop around April 15.

That valuation includes the significant recent price drop caused by the loss. It's probably more accurate to say they lost **nearly $600 million** in Bitcoin (~$800/BTC), which reduced the entire currency's value so much that it's now only worth $367 million (~$500/BTC).

I understand any entity having a high percentage of the computing power is bad, but I keep seeing restated that this will allow them to double-spend at will. My understanding was that a higher percentage of control just gives you a higher chance of being able to double-spend--but far from guaranteed.
At 51%, you'd just be slightly more likely than all other legitimate miners to confirm any given transaction, right? To undo any number of confirmations, you'd still need a significant amount of luck. Or am I wrong about that?

There's a full description [here]( but basically it's another one of those features that only really works right if everyone you're e-mailing is on the same domain, using Exchange, and probably using Outlook.

I may be in the minority, but my tax guy was interested, had already read up about what Bitcoin is and how it works, and suggested reporting them as capital gains. I think I was his first client with anything to report (and even my gains were less than $1000).

In the situation you described, though, Sally didn't really *lose* her bitcoins, she just never received them. She assumed she was getting them based on a transaction with zero confirmations, which we've always known to be a bad idea with large transactions. 
If she waited for even just one confirmation, then the attacker is now at a serious disadvantage. He needs to both confirm a block containing the false transaction, and another one to make his chain longer than the honest one. And he needs to do it before the honest miners confirm their next block, which is almost as likely to happen. The more confirmations honest miners make, the more difficult it is to undo the transaction to Sally.
To me, this sounds like what we've always known. For very small transactions, zero or one confirmations are probably safe. For really big ones, wait for six or more.
Well, now that I check the [Bitcoin wiki]( it looks like someone with 40% of hashpower can overcome a 6-deep confirmed transaction with a 50% success rate. I guess there's something I'm not understanding completely. Mind setting me straight?

Something to help avoid that recent ghash.io fiasco would be great.
I haven't mined much personally, but presumably there's something ghash.io is doing well if they were able to get so many users. If anyone could stand up a similar-quality mining pool in minutes, it'd be much easier to avoid stuff like this in the future.
Or make p2pool easier to configure, so there's no reason for big mining pools to exist.

I'm kind of new to this, but isn't whether something is inflationary or deflationary relative to the size of the economy using it (not itself)?
That is, as long as the Bitcoin economy is growing faster than 25BTC/10 min, it's still deflationary, right?

Personally, I'd imagine that wiring $11k internationally to an unregulated Bitcoin exchange probably raises many more flags than doing the same to Coinbase (which is in the US, and presumably cooperating with authorities). If you have a different card to use, though, it probably wouldn't hurt.

This has always kind of been my objection to the race car sponsorship and this. Every other sponsor is a company, so it gives the appearance that Bitcoin is a company.

I just meant "barely likely" for confirming the first block. "Barely more likely" might have been more accurate--I just meant that it's hardly a safe bet. It wouldn't be worth doing for a small amount, but on a larger amount you wouldn't take a 51% chance of succeeding. It just didn't seem practical.
I must be assuming something wrong because [the Bitcoin wiki says](


I think you're right--one factor I wasn't considering is that it isn't really a race, and there's no "catching up" with the attacker. Once the attacker gets more confirmations of his transaction, he wins, because honest miners will follow his longer chain. That likely affects his chances of succeeding more than I was thinking.

I'm still convinced this is a much simpler situation than everyone seems to think. Submitted iPhone apps' source code can't be reviewed by Apple, so there's no way they could prevent anyone from releasing a wallet app for the purpose of stealing users' Bitcoins. And Apple would shoulder some liability for that, since they approved the app and it was downloaded from their store.
Sure, they let bank apps in, but those transactions can be reversed... or work through some third party's API that could take some of that liability. Bitcoin's completely decentralized, so Apple would be the only company to blame.
I guess you could argue they should allow the compiling/installing of open source apps, but that's hardly the hatred of Bitcoin spouted over and over on this subreddit. And it's completely unrelated to Apple's alleged secret new payment system.

It actually says what the average annual income is in the image. Or am I misunderstanding you?

Even with 51% of hashpower, you'd be only slightly more likely than honest miners to confirm the false transaction, though, and you'd still be pretty unlikely to undo a transaction with a single confirmation by honest miners. To do that, you'd need to mine the alternate block containing the false transaction (which you're *barely* likely to do) and then another to make it the longer blockchain, and you need to mine both of those before the honest miners confirm another block, at which point you're now an additional block behind undoing the honest confirmations.
Is that right? Or am I way off?

I can't tell from this whether Bob is good or bad. It's unclear!
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:30:33
That's typical, since a new block is supposed to get confirmed every ten minutes. 6 x 10 = 60 minutes. For something that costs so little, it would probably be reasonable to process your domain purchase on zero or one confirmation.

It also puts the infrastructure in place so that if/when the USD has significant issues, many vendors will be able to react immediately and switch to holding a higher percentage of BTC.

I think everyone's jumping the gun a little bit here. Despite working over NFC and credit card networks, Apple Pay is not strictly limited to them. I'm sure Apple would be happy to implement an alternative protocol for a different set of big vendors--especially since those vendors seem to be a little more forward-looking.

Indeed. So I'm not sure why OP is lumping Windows and OS X together security-wise (historically inaccurate) to recommend Linux (which will offer little security advantage over OS X) for normal users.

Limit the power of government. Power correlates pretty strongly with special interests and corruption.
EDIT: And to address your comment specifically: Corporations "own" government because it's cost-effective. They know that by spending some amount of money, the return is much higher.

It'd be useful to know what browsers you had trouble with, if you still remember. We've seriously had no complaints at all, and if he rest of the world is using browsers I don't know exist, it'd be good to know about them.

That's just one factor, even. Now throw in the costs of:
* having multiple geographically distinct datacenters, 
* [various compliance certifications](
* multi-factor authentication on all of your administration architecture (e.g. not just instances, but firewalls, backup snapshots), 
* redundant power,
* redundant cooling,
* redundant humidity control, 
* redundant, multi-homed Internet connections (including bandwidth),
* *everything* being API-driveable, 
* being Internet scalable with no infrastructure bottleneck,
* Windows server licenses
And that's just what I can think of off the top of my head. I swear I have to have this conversation every few months with our server guys. We got a quote for a backup generator for a single building that was more than the costs of five years running at AWS. It's really only cheaper if you assign no value to all of those things.

It wouldn't be super clean, but they could probably implement it through a voucher system. The sender would send bitcoin to Voucher Company, which would then generate a special image / token / link to be sent to the recipient. Recipient taps it to open, which would open the Voucher Company app (or prompt to download if not installed).
I think that's doable (with a link) now--it'd just have a few extra steps and app necessary. You could probably make it smoother with the new framework.

I'm normally very laissez-faire about these things, but truly I think the card processing agreements that merchants have to sign to accept Visa / Mastercard credit cards are anticompetitive. 
They can't add a surcharge to cover card processing fees, which means the fees have to be built into the price that applies even to other payment methods. That's deceptive to consumers, as they're incentivized to use their cards through bonuses and privileges. If customers had to pay 2-5% more just to get their 1% cash back, they'd see through the scheme immediately and other options would be more competitive. It's hidden from them, though.
Could businesses drop Visa and Mastercard? Absolutely--just like PC manufacturers could have dropped Microsoft Windows in the '90s or other businesses not used telephones back before AT&amp;T was split up. If these laws exist to stop companies from colluding to push out competition to the detriment of consumers, though, then this is an area that should be examined.
...and ending the CC processing scheme would be of clear benefit to Bitcoin and any other payment method.

That's the rake, and of course they win, but a skilled player can have an advantage over other players significant enough to beat the rake.
That's as compared to games like roulette or craps where the odds are never in your favor, as mentioned by OP.

Not necessarily in games that you play against other players. For example, in poker, given less skilled opponents, a player can certainly have better odds than the rake.
