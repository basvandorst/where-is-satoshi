Both.  But if given the choice I would choose gold.
Bitcoin will be worthless in a post apocalyptic future Gold would still be useful.  Bottle caps would be even better
If no apocalypse...and Bitcoin reaches the Fabled MOON...Gold in any form hurts more and more effective as a weapon or torture implement to persuade some one to give you their Bitcoin Wallet.

It was easy to explain to my parents.
When they got married in 1980 the same year I was born and bought $1000 in stock.  It would be worth with the splits(no Dividends) about $20 Million.
I got Married in 2009.  From my research the earliest price I could find was $1US - 1300ish BTC, for their approximate value at the time.  
Then told them the price now.
Now they are waiting a few months to see how it goes for me(which is very well).  Before they decide to put they want to see how it goes for myself for a few months.
I could be getting my inheritance in Cryprto Currencies in 20+ years.
