So just think (it's simpler) of the basic idea that gold mines get closed and supply from mining is reduced when the gold price goes down, and then think that the idea is to put this into the Bitcoin protocol in a fully decentralized manner.

The more hopeless, poor, declining, corrupt a country is, the more incentive they have to ban bitcoin. USA is very open towards bitcoin, China less so but so far they haven't taken any serious action against it. Russia on the other hand means business: they truly are bent on banning it - and this says a lot about this so called "country".
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:19:07
Well, I don't know. If we're stabilizing Bitcoin to the downside, we're making all Bitcoin stake holders (including them) happier and richer. They may get less BTC per day but it should be worth more.
I know no change to the core protocol is simple but that doesn't mean we should stop improving the core protocol (which appears to kind of be the status quo right now).
And anyway, I'm not proposing anything that gold doesn't have, and I'm not proposing anything that might alter Bitcoin's core principles on which it was founded.

Oh, well. This is conspiracy theory bullshit. Have you considered that a much simpler theory could be behind this (which would also make Occam happy)?
It so happens that rogue countries that attract the ire of the US (and of most civilized countries in the international community) also feel the need to retaliate with bellicose statements, among many being the threat to stop using the currency that they (like all countries on the globe) use as a reserve currency, currency which happens to belong to the US.

I don't agree. Most people are not monuments of reason and mathematical logic. It is my personal opinion that without the massive supply, Dogecoin would not have taken off. People just like having many units in their wallets especially when they do not have a lot of fiat funds to invest. And if they hear they get 0.1 BTC for 60 USD they say "nah!". But they would be much more inclined to buy if they get 170000 units for 60 USD. So choose: do you want to increase the chances that BTC will succeed, or you prefer not to because there would be "pain".

Why do people even entertain the idea Apple Pay is a competitor? It's something else entirely. Apple Pay is just a payment technology: the simple basic idea of having an app on your smartphone to authorize a payment from your fiat bank account to a merchant bank account. Duh!

Besides "if you look at the master branch you'll see lots of nondescript commits" could you please be more specific? What are the major new features the core Bitcoin team is working on? I'm genuinely curious and satisfying this curiosity is the purpose of this comment. Basically I recently started to read lots of cryptocurrency-blogs and read about other coins all the time and the rising number of ATMs and such but I've never (since I started reading them about 2-3 weeks ago) seen anything about what the Bitcoin team is doing NOW (which was why I actually started to follow those blogs).

It's not explicity their job, but if I were there I would (and most humans of course) be morally pressed to fill that job's description.


Yes I guess that would be a way to do it. Perhaps even better to modularize if possible the proof-of-X module so that useful types of work could be introduced on the network without changes to the code.
Although I was not (previously) proposing anything explicitly - I would say I'm not very qualified for that (the Foundation has to do that). Based on what I knew I just felt I can be validly concerned for the future of Bitcoin.
Oh, and something else I forgot to mention, something that stings me in my daily use: I find transactions too expensive and slow (which I haven't felt for example when I used Dogecoin).
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:06:30
No, I really don't see how trust in the network is affected: what I'm proposing (starting from the article, but changing it in fundamental ways) is just a simple adjustment to the protocol which would adjust (slightly) the reward per block based on an algorithm looking at rates of change in the difficulty level.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:07:57
I would disagree. Community is very important for an alt-coin (promotion, public outreach, public campaigns etc.). LTC (?), PPC/related (technical improvements not currently functional and would not even work) or other prominent alt-coins are basically just clones with a veneer of technical improvements. At least Dogecoin has what matters most (at least when technical improvements are lacking really, as is the case with all CURRENT prominent alt-coins).
@_date: 2014-11-08 10:48:10
Yes, he wanted that as well, and he thought the best idea for the digital age is to bring gold in the 21st century. And I agree with what you're saying that's why I made sure to add "Fully decentralized" in the title. About simplicity: I agree, but this is not so complex and may be a very good idea considering this stabilizing mechanism exists for gold as well.

In 2050 you'll be able to buy a house with 137,000 satoshis. So do go to that dodgy looking adful bitcoin faucet site because with the tips you'll get in a month from such a site, you'll be able to buy a house in 2050.
@_date: 2014-09-08 06:21:47
Yeah, actually I do. I've spent many, many years pondering these questions (unlike most libertarian teenagers), have seen many many things in this world and can tell you that the US is among the least evil things in the world.
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:02:19
I can't do a better job myself, but others can and did (various altcoins in which I'm invested). But I'm mostly heavily invested in Bitcoin, and the argument does stand, it is actually very common for an investor to be rightly concerned for the fate of their investment and a serious reply to my argument would be a point by point explanation on why bitcoin is still on the right path and also why it has the right priorities and vision for the long term.

Not from my sources (I could look it up but you could do the same with a simple google search yourself). I know it was 70% before Crimea and it went to 80% after Crimea. I don't have recent figures, but I'd estimate it's in the same range.

Except that Russia only wants to get rid of the dollar from the global scene so that they can push their own super-state-controlled currency, hoping this will be another way they can use to bring the whole world under their authoritarian, despotic control.

Some arbitrary half-joking theory: it's because of all the traders who jumped on board. Trader these days means momentum trader which means that if they see the price going down, they will all sell (with &gt;50X leverage) until the price stops going down. And if the price goes up they will all buy until the price stops going up.
They bring great value to our community by helping the bubbles grow 100 times larger than they need to be and then by crashing them to a price 100 times lower than it should have been based on supply and demand. This means we can buy low and sell for 10000 times the initial price!
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:18:16
Yes, I do. I read quite a lot about Russia, and rereading my statement above I can only say that yeah, that's the plain simple obvious truth. If you are not Russian (and hence your attitude would be understandable) but a plain ignorant watching Russia Today then I suggest reading up on Aleksandr Dugin:

Ethereum (being able to easily use a blockchain for much more than just money) and other related, Reddcoin/Blackcoin/Peercoin/etc. (proof of stake, maybe used in combination with PoW, can potentially eliminate most of mining), MaidSafeCoin/Storj/Namecoin extending the blockchain to other practical internet uses (which might also bring more price stability as Bitcoin will be intimately tied with useful services that people would pay money for) and many others.
Why they are not already adopted? Well, in this early speculative stage a simple method for deciding the long term full worth of a new feature does not exist - or for easily deciding how to implement it in bitcoin (that's why we have the visionaries at the Bitcoin foundation to do it for us). But make no mistake: a bitcoin fork with a simple useful feature added on top is still better than bitcoin. And if bitcoin remains in stasis forever it is basically guaranteed that it will be superseded. I don't know if the folks at the Bitcoin Foundation after a long process of deliberation have decided to say pass for now or they simply think things are too complicated and have decided to retreat to conservatism but I tend to believe the latter.
And if you thought my mentioning of Nick Szabo was a joke, it was not. When it comes to bitcoin, the thing I'm mostly interested in right now is what does the man who had the vision to come up with bitcoin in the first place think of the cryptocurrency universe right now and about the various alt-coins in existence right now.

80% of Russian people admire and support Putin (especially younger people). So no, actually Russian people are a little bit weird.
@_date: 2014-11-08 10:43:42


I don't agree, no layman will ever understand what Bitcoin has under the hood and he doesn't have to.


I was pretty explicit this was not pegging to fiat in any way.


No, low price of bitcoins make the hashrate go down ANYWAY, that's what happens now, when marginally unproductive miners shut down. I was just saying that we could add a smart algo which would slightly reduce the BTC reward per block when that happens. And as I said in the comment you replied to, this shouldn't make miners unhappy because it would make them actually richer over a timeframe longer than very short term.
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:50:00
Umm, why? Satoshi wanted to create a digital equivalent to gold. Gold supply from mines goes down when the price of gold goes down. Any constructive arguments you may have?
@_date: 2014-08-24 18:45:26
 's general point stands... Maybe we should ask Satoshi Nakamoto (a.k.a. Nick Szabo) what we should do next with Bitcoin, where Bitcoin should be heading next, because apparently the Bitcoin Foundation is taking a wait and sleep approach. And surely, Nick wouldn't want to see his baby get buried.
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:05:51
No, I explained that unlike the method proposed in the article, my proposed method does not peg bitcoin to anything: it's just that the global worth Bitcoin has to humans (which is also correlated with its worth in USD) is ALSO correlated to rates of change in the difficulty. So we can implement the same stabilizing mechanism gold has, in a fully decentralized trustless manner.
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:04:11
Bitcoin mines are powered down too, but the reward per block is kept constant. Which means that miners will probably sell even a larger amount of bitcoin to keep their fiat income at a predefined level. So you're wrong about this point. I'm not sure about the trust in the network thing though (haven't heard the discussion).
@_date: 2014-09-08 06:33:43
Yeah, I find it funny that although the US has been the target of the libertarian conspiracy kids for many years now (among them many people who for some reason, at some point admired Putin and watched Russia Today), the US has been among the most open to Bitcoin in the whole world.
Oh wait! Wasn't the purpose of Bitcoin to fight against the oppression of the evil US? 
Going forward, it may be that the impetus behind the US support for Bitcoin (as opposed to just banning it because it obviously complicates things at many levels for the govt) may be JUST the fact that it may help democratize the countries under authoritarian regimes (i.e. most on the planet). And shocking as that may be to some, the greatest interest of the US is not to conquer and oppress peoples (like Russia does for example), but to have as many countries as possible on the planet under democratic, stable, free regimes (so that they won't have to spend trillions policing the globe).
@_date: 2014-11-08 10:51:41
I don't really care about everything those authors have to say, I merely took the idea of adding the stabilizing mechanism gold has to Bitcoin, and changed it considerably to avoid pegging it to fiat etc.
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:50:43
Not sure what you mean, but the mechanism stabilizes it to the downside, it doesn't affect upside potential.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:49:23
Ha ha ha!
You accuse a reasonable person coming up with intelligent arguments of pulling things out of his ass, and yet YOU do the same thing with your pro-gold arguments, and your arguments are even less serious and substantiated. "No." (having a hard time seeing gold surpass $2500) does not even qualify as trying! Marry your wife not your (gold) trade bro!
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:22:08
Nominal interest rate is irrelevant. What matters is the real interest rate (what you get over and above inflation). Currently the real interest rate is close to zero, so in 20 years at current rates you'll still have a million dollar's worth of today's money.
