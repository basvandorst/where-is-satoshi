New version of Ledger live desktop has native segwit enable as a default, you just need to add account again and move your fund to the new address.
For Ledger live mobile version, Ledger said they will update soon.

and do you know what is the use of the 24 seeds word?
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:56:56
I see, so it's not a widely available tool to generate address like the normal seeds phrase.
For channel backup, I see Zap wallet have it store locally on my iPhone.
@_date: 2019-07-26 06:12:46
Have you tried any of these wallets?
From the fourth links you gave, I have tried:
* LightningPeach: it require node on google cloud service
* Zap: testnet only
* Zeus: I can not run node directly on my device
* Bluewallet: custodial or connect to your own LN
* Wallet of satoshi: the best custodial IMO
* Breez: seem to be a non-custodial, but I don't understand their backup
* Lightning's lab wallet:  just try because yesterday it was said the beta is full. I think this is the non-custodial I'm looking for. Will transfer some fund and make some testing. However, I can request payment without putting the amount.
Please share your experience, if you have use any of these before.

You can reset the ledger nano s and generate new seed and add account address for this new seed into ledger live. Then you can restore your old seed and send to the new seed’s address. However, the inconvenience is during your verification of new seed and the restore of old seed since you need to type the seed words into ledger.
Don’t forget to verify your new seed before sending bitcoin.
About the new wallet for Ledger and Trezor, I don’t think they will release new model anytime soon. They just release new model this year.

it still need to connect to the internet to broadcast txs, just the way they connect is difference from other.

From this website it said:
 *“It’s not as secure as running your own node. But it’s pretty close and a trade-off we felt was necessary for broader adoption on mobile,” Hase told Bitcoin Magazine. The trade-off here is that Neutrino requires the user to trust in a third party node, either one chosen at will or at random, to send accurate blockchain data.* 
I'm not quite sure, but I think it just similar to mobile wallet like Bread which we use their node. But the seed is store locally. Is this correct?
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:36:45
Do you have experience with recovery process for lightning wallet?
I just realized the 24 seeds is not the same as the seed for on-chain bitcoin. So it's mean that with only 24 seeds word it'll be not enough to recover my lightning wallet.
For Zap wallet they provide channel.backup, which can be found in File app in iOS
For Lightning lab wallet, they provide only the 24 seeds which invalid on iancoleman website
So do you know how to recover these kind of wallets?
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:59:54
yes, i'm testing it now. Just don't understand about the backup process.

for experiment with lightning wallet, I recommend Wallet of Satoshi. I found it quite easy to use and refill. But please beware that, it's a custodial wallet, which mean you have to trust the wallet (developer) with your fund. Don't send too much fund to it.
Your receiver need to have lightning wallet too to receive. If you need to send this amount only one time, just send normally, but if you need to do it multiple of time you should use lightning wallet. As always, do some research to understand about it

 This is the current address format
1. Legacy address begin with the number 1
2. Segwit starting with the number 3
3. Native segwit ([Bech32]( starting with bc1
Most wallet support type 1 and 2. If your merchant provide only type 3 address, you need to find a wallet which support sending to native segwit. If you're in a hurry to send to the merchant you can try Bread wallet, they support sending to native segwit iirc. Create new Bread wallet, then send your fund to bread wallet address (start with 3) and send from Bread wallet to your merchant.

Before using a new hardware wallet I would generate a new mnemonic. Then, use website or tool like [ to test out that mnemonic. I want to make sure that the device and the open source tool generate the same address from the same mnemonic. Finally, reset the device again to generate new mnemonic. With this I can be sure that the mnemonic can generate address independently.

Yeah, sound cool. Maybe Bitcoin protocol will be change to adapt to quantum computer, thus make the active address more difficult to crack, but the ancient address become like a treasure trove.

It similar to USD and cent, bank account show unit in USD, but if you want to send a few cent, you just use USD=cent/100

If the sender use a very very small fee and the mempool is full, it will never confirm. For a period of time, not exactly sure how long, it will remove from the mempool. So, the sender can spend their coin again.
If the sender use replace-by-fee (RBF), he can increase the fee and got it send back to himself.
Thus, you should wait for at least 2 confirmations.

Yes, Ledger live just to view your fund, with public address.

1 btc = 100,000,000 satoshi

AFAIK, when someone send some amount of bitcoin, they set the transaction fee in hope of miner include his transaction in new block. This fee will be collected by miner, who will make a new block of transactions. Then the miner broadcast the new block to the network, which the node verify (for free). 
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I hope so too. But what I imagine is like this:
Two siblings on facebook with relationship set send the same amount to someone address outside of facebook.

If Facebook officially adopt bitcoin, they probably build an integrate wallet into their platform. A lot of  Facebook's users will probably use this wallet. When the transaction was made from this wallet, it'll be associated with their Facebook's profile. Since there are billions of Facebook user, the non-Facebook users will also be receive/send to address associated with a Facebook profile.
