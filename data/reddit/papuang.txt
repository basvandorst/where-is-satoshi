Sorry, would you mind explaining that. I'm semi-familiar with SEPA transfers because I looked into them on Coinbase, but are they only for euros, not pounds? Is there any way I can have liquidity into pounds without having to go through euros so I can avoid conversion fees with my bank if that's the case.

Fair enough rereading it it does look like an ad but it's genuinely not.

Yeah, that would definitely have been my preference, but the school wanted a question title...

At this point, the idea isn't even stupid any more...

When the world stops using the USD as their reserve currency. The reason everyone used it was because the US was stable and prosperous. The US is now neither of those things, and has lost favour with every centre of power in international politics - Latin America, Europe, China, Australia, Central Asia. More importantly, these are the global centres of commerce, so now that they don't trust the US, it's far more likely that they will choose am alternative reserve currency. China has recently expressed an interest in cryptocurrency and perhaps this is the beginning of the end?
