That's exactly it. It's an idea that seems so wildly idealistic that it's hard to get people to take it seriously, but at this point I can't see how we *won't* get there. These are exciting times!
What I meant by "public but anonymous" is the fact that even though all of an account's activity is logged, a user can easily make sure that the account is never associated with their real-world identity, or with any other accounts they might have. Alternatively they could just decide to leave the "memo" field blank. So even though minisat_maker's actions can all be catalogued, sorted, analyzed, and possibly distributed and publicized, I can be assured that the information will never affect the flesh-and-bone source of that personality. I'm also aware that it's *my* job to keep private stuff off the internet, and not anyone else's. This kind of public anonymity is essential to a healthy, honest dialogue. If this minisat idea lives up to the dream I have for it, its usefulness will basically force people to begin to learn about this new set of rules and the street-smarts associated with it.

I'm leaning toward logging all queries too. However, I would argue that if that is bitcoinbillionaire's real identity, it's more his fault than anyone else's that he was able to be tracked down. It takes a fair amount of internet-street-smarts, but it's entirely possible to cover all of your tracks on the internet and maintain complete anonymity. I think that tools that embrace and encourage this behavior will be far more successful than any competition that does not.

Definitely. In fact, the tips database could serve as the structure for such a system. All you'd need is an algorithm to search through it in the right way. If you look at the [original post]( I talked a little bit about that. You'll find it under "Example applications of data analysis".

There are a few reasons. Sorry I didn't make them clearer:
- First, the transaction fee associated with the bitcoin network is a cost that can't really be lowered on a p2p network without sacrificing security. The cost of simply one server keeping track of a transaction is much, much lower, allowing us to work with denominations smaller than satoshis.
- Second (and I'm realizing I totally forgot to put this anywhere up there; will edit after I respond), transactions will be instantaneously irreversible, as opposed to the bitcoin protocol which takes up to 10 minutes for even one confirmation.
- Third, because messages can't be directly embedded into bitcoin transactions, the only way to associate a message with a transaction is to have some other system keep track of it. This could be another p2p system, but again, p2p systems are more expensive to maintain. If the goal is to have searchable memos embedded in transactions, I believe a centralized server is the best way to do it.
- Fourth, while the data analysis could be used on the blockchain itself, the blockchain will not have the associated memo field for each transaction, which takes away a huge part of what's exciting about this tool to me.
I don't intend this as something to replace Bitcoin in the least; a project like this is only possible with Bitcoin. I want to see this thing built on top of Bitcoin, and simply used when it is more convenient to its users.

If anyone would like to start a subreddit for this called "minisats" and invite me to moderate, I'd be grateful. I can't start a subreddit, as this account is still young.

To be honest, I don't think it sounds much like a bank either. I talk a lot more about it in the original post, and I think this one tool could serve a pretty wide variety of purposes--so I'm really not sure what to call it. "Bank" is just the closest class I could think of to describe what it can do right now.

What I'm trying to say is that if you want to protect yourself from someone else finding out that you're associated with some action on the internet, the *only* way you can guarantee that is by going through a process that is, at the current moment, pretty complex when compared to "normal" browsing. I'm not really saying it's easy, but I also wouldn't say it's hard. It just takes a good understanding of the tools at your disposal, and a willingness to do a lot of research before making any moves. For example, I believe that this account is totally untraceable to any meatsack that's writing this, or any other accounts that meatsack may or may not be controlling. Anyone is welcome to challenge this claim and prove me wrong!
Imagine a person grew up without knowing anything about cars, traffic, or roads. Would you then expect them to be able to walk a few blocks safely in a huge city during rush hour? I wouldn't. It's not because the guy is stupid, but because he just doesn't know about the dangers inherent in the environment or how to deal with them. For this guy, you might say it's almost impossible for him to get from A to B in a reasonable amount of time without being in danger. However, given the right knowledge and experience, you can guarantee the same guy an efficient and almost danger-free trip. That's how I see cryptology/anonymity/etc on the Internet. It's not that the landscape is inherently dangerous--just that there are new rules and new common sense to learn. I believe in breeding smarter people, rather than designing better leashes and fences. I'm more interested in developing a useful tool than an idiot-proof one.


Anonymity and a public record are not mutually exclusive. The bitcoin network is an excellent example of this, and it's what I plan to model minisats after. While it's true that given any transaction or address you can track its history, I can guarantee that if I take the right precautions, you'll never be able to trace the my public address back to any specific meatsack or any of my other accounts. The most important tool for this is the idea of a mixer: any person or organization who will take your money and send it to someone else, and refuse to reveal the connection to any other entity who wants to know.
It would be the same as if my friend gave me cash and asked to give the same amount of cash to another one of my friends. Even if each of those transactions was public, the only way for someone to know that friend 1 meant to send money to friend 2 would be if they convinced me or friend 1 to reveal that information. So, using a mixture of friends and organizations serving as mixing services, one can pretty much guarantee anonymity **without trusting only one third party**.


But do you know that for sure? If I found the right person to bribe, and I had enough money, I can find out the details. If I have even more power, I can begin to employ blackmailing or other dirty tactics to get the details. If I succeeded, it would all be happening without your knowledge, as that would naturally be part of the dirty deal. Note that I can do this by finding only one weak link in the chain of transactions.
The difference between a credit card company and the bitcoin protocol, in this regard, is that information that's known to one is known to all. So while you might trust (foolishly, I would add) that your credit card company won't sell your private information, if you simply don't put private information out on the bitcoin protocol in the first place and use mixers (more than one!) appropriately, **you don't have to trust anyone**. The best kept secrets are the ones that no one knows, and credit card companies simply do not allow you to keep secrets--even for something as basic and private as your physical address! The fact is that a credit card company forces you to keep information somewhere where you can't control it, and bitcoin (and the culture and tools surrounding it) does not.


I challenge you, or anyone, to trace my public address posted in the OP or this reddit account to any other piece of meaningful information at all. There are steps one can take that guarantee anonymous action, and I believe (although I'm new to this kind of stuff, so I'm not sure) that I've taken them all so far.


Well, there's a bit more subtlety here. If the information is logged and publicly viewable at all, then someone will take it and reproduce it. No matter what kind of logging the system imposes on **its on servers**, the data will have been released to the internet, where anyone can do anything they want with it, publicly or privately. Data is free, and to resist that is to fight a losing battle (just ask the music industry). The question isn't quite "do we force all queries to be logged?", because the answer to that question is that **we can't**. The question is "do we log all the queries that users run **within the system**?".

Thanks for the tip dude. It put a huge smile on my face!
