Yea no Matter how much I want to send the fee is 3.77 mBTC minimum for sending it within 10 blocks. So that's about 50 EUR by my calculations. This is regardless if I send my entire amount (158 mbtc) or even just 5 mbtc. I don't have more so can't check to see if the fees go up. But this also surprises me. I thought the whole idea of Bitcoin was to use it for small transactions as well, to replace currency. But if everytime I make a transaction, it costs me this much, then I'm not sure how this will ever happen.
EDIT: Okay odd. I just went to go test it. And now the fees are showing differently. Much lower than they were about an hour ago. Or when I checked two days ago. Now it's 1.22258 mBTC to send my max in 10 blocks..... And now again I closed and reopened (2 minutes time difference) electrum and the fees are back up to 3.52615 mBTC within first 10 blocks for the same transaction..... I think I'm missing something here........

What would you recommend I use in that case? I have noticed some performance issues with the website (I'm not super actively trading though), but I thought in regards to account freezes and locks it was far from some exchanges such as coinbase (which seems like the epitamy of bad exchanges)

Why shouldnt I? Seemed like the best one with EUR to BTC at the time I signed up. Is there something else you recommend over kraken and why?

I would send a smaller test run. But I was checking the electrum fees for sending and regardless of how much I wish to send, even the slower methods will cost the equivalent of 50 EUR in BTC (send within the next 10 blocks). The faster methods upwards of 100 EUR equivalent in BTC.
