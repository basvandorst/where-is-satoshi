Most people have both bitcoins and fiat. There's absolutely no benefit in paying for your flight in bitcoins in this case. You're paying a fee for the privilege of paying in mbtc and it doesn't even make it easier. You'll still have to fill out all of your information so it won't be anonymous. 
Just pay it in Euros via bank transfer or credit card. **Edit**: I somehow overlooked the fact that you're from the US. Ignore what I said. It might still be cheaper to exchange to Euros, but I'm not sure about that.

No he didn't...
Precursors like ARPANET, NPL, and Usenet helped in its creation.
As far as I know, DARPA and CERN invented it. Al Gore merely aided them immensely from the political side.

First off thanks for the great post. Also thanks for caring and sharing.
Is your hedge fund really planning on trading bitcoin or is it just speculation from you? Have you been actively promoting it? What's keeping them from jumping in right now?

Likewise. I moved most of mine out, but had around .25 btc still lying around in my online MtGox wallet. I then also moved that two weeks ago and I received the money almost instantaneously. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:44:23
Well damn. I lost 0.03835 Euros because of Mt Gox.

Even if half of all computer literate people in the US start using it and the government decides to ban it from one day to the next, nobody will do anything. The biggest privacy breach in history was just uncovered and aside from a few Restore the Fourth movements, nothing happened and everyone is just letting it slide with a few angry words on Facebook and Twitter.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:21:06
They're asking for a lot of money though. Their conversion rates are shitty. 
0.58EUR/mbtc opposed to the current rate of almost .7EUR/mbtc
You're better off paying Euros. (USD rate is shitty too)

Uh, Maggie, no you don't.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:13:47
The 10btc should merely be a secondary incentive for doing this. If P2P mining were more widespread, it would help the whole of bitcoin immensely.
There's proof of that and even without the 10btc, it'd be worth doing this.

Well the title is kind of ironic, seeing as how all bitcoin transactions are public...
Still, the fact that a bank is earning money off selling "private information" makes me agree with you.

Do you have to wait there for 15-20 minutes or can you leave after the 5.5 or 15 seconds?

Poor Winklevoss twins. Planning on selling their fund at $125 each. Good luck with that...
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:47:48
It'll take 3 days to send the euros to your account, but only a few clicks to buy BTC unless you're buying out of pocket. Just use an exchange that stores your Euros and doesn't force you to pay for them directly out of bank account (like mtgox). Then you send it to your meth dealer, which will take around 20 minutes max. Not bad.
@_date: 2013-06-27 12:14:10
Yea but if you get a few ounces of weed sent to your house, wouldn't you be relying on the seller's amount of giving a shit about you not being discovered?

Bought in between $100 and $125. I was up due to having bought ASICminer stocks at Havelock Investments. Some assholes decided to DDOS the website and it was offline the entire evening. Finally I had to go to asleep and when I woke up, the price of bitcoin had dropped to $75 and the price of ASICminer shares had dropped from 5btc to under 4btc per share...
Fuck I'm mad right now.

How often are dividends paid and for how much? In context, what I mean is even if the share price stayed flat, would the dividends be &gt;1.5%/year?

Right, I guess it's in their best interest to package correctly and tightly.
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:52:02
Hah shit didn't even think about the possibility of using it offline...
You're right and the only thing I can come up with within a minute is to use a sort of online wallet that both you and the store use, but that gets rid of the "de-centralized" again...

I'm at work and not in the least bit drunk, but I didn't realize this was a joke until after reading the comments while thinking "what the fuck is this?"

I doubt it. They've had a couple of downtimes.
@_date: 2013-07-03 19:15:39
You definitely need to read up on a lot of stuff before dabbling into mining. 
Iirc, butterfly labs has only just send the first few shipments that were backed up from last year. Especially as a noob, I suggest you don't step anywhere near them. You should try mining some LTC with your current computer first to get the hang of it. Read up on how it works and then after a while you could move on to ASICs.
EDIT: You can start reading here:

Do you have an ETA?
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:17:11
On what grounds?
@_date: 2013-06-25 07:53:32
How? What?
If I wanted to send money to a friend in America from Germany, it would takes ages to transfer it from bank account to bank account. Sure, you can use something like paypal, but adding money to a paypal account takes time too.
I have nothing against the time it takes to transfer btc. For me it's never been &gt;20 minutes. I've waited a week for some bank transfers to arrive.
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:40:32

Thanks. That did help.
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:24:06
From Havelock Investments I'm guessing? 100 shares would bring down the price on btct by a lot.
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:43:09
"Fiat to bitcoin in 15 seconds" but it says it takes 15-20 min to go through with the transaction?
@_date: 2013-07-01 18:12:27
So do you think that the price of ASICMINER shares will go down once other companies start shipping? Or would they also have to offer stock for that to happen?
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:06:53


The first problem is already in the first paragraph. Wait until they ship before you even think about doing this.
You're also tying up your money for an entire year. I would stay away from it. There are much better ways to invest.
@_date: 2013-07-01 17:49:20
I'm glad that it's flat right now. A highly fluctuating currency doesn't look good and the ordinary Tom and Jane would avert money that could go down in worth by 25% in a single day. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 17:45:14
I really don't like this blog post.
First of all, he talks about the rather common problem that is shitty seller protection. It's a rant, rather than an informative post. Then he comes to the claim he has made about eBay "hating" bitcoin. His auction was probably ended early because of an automatic crawler that found "bitcoin". eBay doesn't want to sell virtual goods and that's their choice. This incidence proves nothing.
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:16:50
How many bitcoins do you own?
Props to you for saying this and keeping a cool head. I'll probably keep my 12 bitcoins too. Turning these 750€ into 50€
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:40:59
Why do prices jump from 85 mBTC to 1.2 BTC? The size difference between 750x750 and 1000x1000 doesn't accurately reflect the price difference. Did you mean 0.85 BTC instead of 85 mBTC (which would be .085)
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:56:55
I thought they said it would sell at the June 27th price or something like that. I guess not then. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-05-21 10:33:48
Aren't full shares cheaper? Passthrus are going for .0277 right now while full shares from btct are 2.68
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:43:48
This will just make people sell, lowering the price more, and eventually proving you right. Instead, you guys could just let the market run its own course instead of trying to repeat history.
@_date: 2013-06-20 09:43:49
Is this really in development? I'm doubtful, but it sounds awesome.
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:45:00
Since so many more people are using bitcoin nowadays, I doubt the price will fall anywhere close to $14. Nobody can say what the price will be or when it will stop falling. 
The question is, what do you want to use your bitcoins for? If you're here for easy money or a quick investment, don't do it. If you want to actually start to use this awesome currency, go right ahead and buy in now.
If you just want to buy some weed on silkroad, then you can buy now too.
