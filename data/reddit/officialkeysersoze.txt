Thanks for the ELI18 videos mate

Try trending subreddit from the front page. You sure spend most of your time here so you should know that "buddy"
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:02:55
Very well said,thanks to that information
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:47:20
Im a long time Paypal user and i saw this on the frontpage,what is this bitcoin that they say will replace Paypal? I also see a coffee shop around my town that has a sign that they accept bitcoin. Someone please give me further infos 
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:16:02
No idea where you're trying to get at "buddy". But thanks for the warm welcome,great way to attract more users to your so called "future of currency". Anyway I'm switching to bitcoin from Paypal for my own good so if you dont want to teach me more about bitcoin that's fine with me. I'm sure there's more nice people like you here who will
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:35:18
Im not but thanks for reminding me anyway 
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:54:05
How about my physical store? It's a small store i also run myself,what do i need to do to set up a bitcoin payment?
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:26:56
One question is how can i use bitcoin for my online and physical store as a mode of payment?
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:27:26
Thank you so much usrn. I appreciate the link
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:23:32
Very new to bitcoin,someone ELI5 51% attack? Gracias
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:28:26
Even if i bought at $450 if wouldnt matter once it hit $1000 at least right?
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:50:38
Just out of curiousity though,what did bitcoin did to you? Spent your life investment and fucked up? I'll gladly spare you some cash through paypal if you like. It's a genuine offer buddy
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:09:39
Ah,yeah frontpage of reddit sorry
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:45:05
Seems like google is pretty accurate about the circlejerk thing judging from you. I guess non geeks are not welcome to use your precious currency
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:44:24
Can you brief me on the reddit rules too cause im a new reddit user as well. I pretty much read the rules and i dont see the section where it says you have to believe me or i should please everyone of you. Do i need to provide set of government ID's as well? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:28:02
Huh? Subscribed to what? Im new
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:17:41
I pretty much have that all covered,i already downloaded a pc and android wallet. Multibit for PC and Bitcoin wallet. What bugs me is how would i know a transaction is ok and that items can be released? Btw i have a wide range of products from customized shirts and stickers and sports apparel
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:23:46
Yup,say goodbye to transaction fees,currency conversion rate and unreasonable account freezing. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 09:02:41
Gracias! Will read through the FAQ and Begginer section when i get home.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:41:53
Welcome,its no looking back for us now
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:12:36
Dumb is the perfect word because wtf will i gain from fakeposting aside from wasting my time arguing with a bitcoin troll so yeah let's call it quits buddy boy
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:49:07
Thanks a lot. Im going to watch it
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:05:08
I really didnt explained myself well on how i came across a bitcoin post before,its because i really cant remember how. Ive been browsing reddit after i created an account. But yea its cool if no one help me,afterall i can just learn it myself,just thought the community will make it easier for me. Afterall what will i gain for "fakeposting". 
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:42:57
Googled bitcoin upon reading from here from i dont know how and circlejerk   comes up with a google search. I dont remember how i got so far to land to that paypal post,i can remember if i care enough. I guess this isnt the right place to learn more about bitcoin from actual people
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:25:56
I dont know about that Sherlock. You really live up to the stereotype that bitcoin is for the circlejerks i think
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:59:29
Hmm sounds interesting and complicated lol I've seen some store around my area with the sign accepting that bitcoin thing but i didnt really bother asking until i joined here.
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:19:31
You mean if i create a reddit account the frontpage should be blank because im not subscribed to anything yet? Because thats where i see it browsing from the post there. My main reason joining is mostly for the movies forum and reddit in general.
