19 and 20 march they going to do a 1st status on crypto.   Wake up

2017 was the speculation year, you dont realise how fast it grew... Too fast and after this grow, what we get? Nothing, cause there is 0 application for now and if they are delivered it has to be accepted. So no more money to make right now. Why invest ?
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:40:13
Prices wont pump until this meeting

Dont you see it ... We slowly and surely dying. 
Internet bubble sheme ... Too much invesment for few applications.  Money just leaving the market

Omg stop, you just like a crazy Hobo who thinks gouvernement is spying on him. Rich people are smarter in finance they dont invest cause its too risky. What a rich man wants more that become richer ? Stays rich ...
If they buy the dip and pump BTC to 20k then what ??! 
Applications will follow just after ?? I dont think so. 
I will be more scary if they pump instead of it grows slowly. Simply because too much btc in one hand is dangerous (Mr.gox). 
The only way for an hard pump is clear ... find applications...  
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:29:09
The next step for an hard pump is devellop applications for bitcoin. 
People now doesnt give a shit about low fees, anonymous or velocity. Those enhancement could be the next step for futur society applications but dont expect price pumping cause nodes creation or low fees...

The point of a meme is that its know by a lot of people and reused on the good situation to be funny. 
If everybody just creat jokes everytime meme would not exist. Stop mad
