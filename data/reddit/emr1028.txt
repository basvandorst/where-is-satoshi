Pretty well, I recently sold all the doge that I invested with a little over a month ago to buy a small yacht. Unfortunately it can't take me to the moon in a literal way, but god damn if my wife doesn't love tanning naked on the deck while we float through the endless expanse of the ocean.

$300mil USD out of a total money supply of about $11trillion = 0.0000002727272%

This hack alone was 18.78x more damaging to the bitcoin economy then the totality of all hacks are to the USD. Add in Mt. Gox and baby, you've got a stew going.
(Not to mention that the American banking systems has extensive protections built in to minimize the damage from incidents like this)

USD purchasing power stability is so far beyond that of bitcoin that it's kind of embarrassing when you compare the two.
