Because the price is a strong indication of how likely people feel it is that Bitcoin will be successful.

Why would you remind him of that? And that's not how it would have gone anyways, he would have sold before it hit $100.

They order you not to use that particular key, start monitoring it, and arrest you as soon as you move any Bitcoin.

If I had $310 million, I would definitely be fine with a much higher fee in order to ensure the transaction could be fixed if I made a mistake.

Because it usually doesn't make sense to cut your customer base by 99% by limiting the ways they can spend money on your platform. Companies want to make spending money as frictionless as possible, so it makes no sense for them to exclusively accept Bitcoin unless they are doing it as a marketing tool.

Pretty sure that isn't true, because 1) the markets for gold and oil are much larger, so it would be prohibitively expensive, and 2) gold and oil have intrinsic value, so there is a higher price floor

I mean that's a reasonable question though. Having a currency backed by an institution can reduce volatility since they control the amount of that currency in circulation. It also allows them to devalue the currency, so it depends on how much you trust that institution to keep the currency stable.

Why would you ever recommend a Bitcoin ATM, they have insane fees
@_date: 2019-11-03 16:26:09
They look almost nothing alike...
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:06:52
Bitcoin can be confiscated too. Not hard to put someone in prison until they agree to give up their keys.
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:04:08
Any economy grows when people save through investments - an economy does not grow when people hoard a particular asset. That's the whole reason we have inflation - so people make investments in growing companies rather than keeping their money in cash and having it just sit around.

The easier thing would probably be to rent out enough hash power to run a 50% attack and destroy peoples faith in it.
@_date: 2019-11-07 06:33:03
I mean you can also open up a high interest savings account for like 3% or invest in index funds if you are going for a long term investment.
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:12:42
You honestly thing you could crash the gold market by having a few hedge funds short it?
@_date: 2019-11-26 08:40:06
Probably because they have been getting a significant number of reports of fraud from people buying Bitcoin.

Why can't they take your Bitcoin as collateral?
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:50:34
If Bitcoin can be manipulated that easily, it isn't a very good store of value or currency.

If you honestly think that Bitcoin will make war obsolete, you are insane.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:17:04
If you are sending BTC from a single wallet, to a single wallet, can't people compare the balance if the two wallets, and see that it is the same, allowing them to link the two wallets together? If you are sending X BTC to the mixer, an attacker could look for all wallets which had X BTC deposited into them within a couple hours of sending it to the mixer, which should be a fairly small number of wallets.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:13:30
Then you would get starvation with lower-valued transactions, since miners will always prefer to process higher-valued ones, so if you are trying to move a couple dollars it can take an extremely long time.
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:46:10
You completely misunderstood my comment. Currency isn't supposed to be an investment, so comparing the performance of the USD over time to the performance of Bitcoin over time makes no sense - no one should be storing significant amounts of USD over a long period of time, if you have significant amount of savings just sitting in cash not getting interest, you are doing it wrong. I'm not saying that you are supposed to obey some rule of not investing in currency, you are free to do so all you want, but if investing in a currency is a good decision, it isn't a good currency.
Bitcoin also goes down in value much, much faster than stocks. How are you doing now if you bought near the last big hype cycle, where the all time high reached almost 20k? Not great. By all means if you have money lying around you want to gamble with buy Bitcoin, but don't treat it like some kind of reliable investment. It is a speculative asset, not a value producing company.
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:44:24
But it matters a lot if you are a daily user
@_date: 2019-10-23 05:12:03
Pretty sure it is more common for Bitcoin exchanges to lose your money than banks. And if a bank loses your money it is insured (at least in the US/Canada), unlike with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:12:00
But if mining cost-efficiency increases, it is also more cost-efficient for a 51% attack, so you haven't gained any security.
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:27:14
Illegal drugs have a premium because their illegality limits supply. Making Bitcoin illegal doesn't limit supply, so it won't have the same effect on the price. Making it illegal does limit the demand however, so it would most likely decrease the price.
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:37:54
If all you want to do is not get poor slowly, you should just open a 2.5% savings account. Or buy index funds if you are OK with more volatility.
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:40:13
Sounds like you need to build up an emergency fund and some safer investments before you start looking into Bitcoin. If you are buying Bitcoin, you should be buying it with money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:30:19
You want to invest your money in an index fund, since then you are investing in companies which create value rather than in a single volatile asset. Currency isn't supposed to be an investment, it is supposed to be something which you can store value in over a short period of time without having it's value change, having it an investment is actually a significant downside since it increases volatility. If you have a significant amount of retirement savings, and put them in Bitcoin, you are an idiot.
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:47:46
Regardless of the legality of Bitcoin, there is still the same amount of Bitcoin being entered into the market every block. I suppose if it was illegal there would be less people selling it, if they are not comfortable dumping their supply while it is illegal, but if there is some warning before it is made illegal you would expect the price to crash as everyone sells off before it becomes illegal.
I don't see how Bitcoin being made illegal on it's own would ever increase demand, since the only effect it has is making it more difficult to hold on to Bitcoin. Now if it is made illegal at the same time as the government is adding restrictions on other currencies demand could increase, but I think making it illegal would decrease demand just like pretty much anything else.
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:27:57
Sure, but if you have most of your investments in Fiat you are an idiot, because it's not supposed to be something which gains value. It's supposed to maintain value over a short period of time, which it is great at.
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:18:44
How often are you spending thousands of dollars in cash? Do you pay your rent in cash or something?
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:38:41
It kind of is your problem, because if adoption doesn't increase Bitcoin will never be useful.
@_date: 2019-10-14 02:59:43
Pretty much any well-represented collection of stocks? What makes you think a crash is inevitable?
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:11:20
I don't think those examples are particularly good ones. The internet has had widespread adoption since before 2000, and TCP/IP was adopted as a standard in 1983 - so 17 years from when it was first used for something to widespread use.
GPS was only available to civilians in the 80's, and wasn't fully operational until the 90's. In the early 2000's, it achieved widespread use and was a feature available on cars, so 20 years to widespread adoption.
And in both of those examples, the popularity was limited by lack of technology - TCP/IP wasn't popular for a while because most people didn't have computers with an internet connection, and GPS wasn't popular because for the first 20 years people didn't have a device in their pocket capable of using it. Bitcoin isn't limited by something like that - for the majority of the population, they could start using it today, using the technology they already have. They just choose not to.

If you have $1 billion, there is probably an employee or two at that bank dedicated to ensuring you can move that $1 billion whenever you want to. Companies move billions around all the time.
@_date: 2019-12-07 03:45:30
Your first example is irrelevant in this case. People benefit from phones by just having them, so they want to buy them sooner rather than later. People don't benefit from owning stocks unless they increase in value, so if Bitcoin increases in value faster than stocks, people won't buy them.
@_date: 2019-12-17 07:54:16
I wasn't talking about the actual number of items available to purchase with Bitcoin, I was talking about how much of those items someone is willing to give you for Bitcoin. Like how many Bitcoin it costs to buy a car or something.
@_date: 2019-12-16 06:05:31
Ideally we would measure against how much stuff you can actually buy with Bitcoin. That is an extremely difficult thing to do, so instead we measure against the USD, which is a very good approximation of value when looking over the period of a few years, or when correctly adjusting for inflation.
@_date: 2019-12-14 03:03:21
I would never trust a QR code for transferring thousands of dollars in an irreversible way. Then you are just shifting the trust from yourself typing in the right numbers, to whoever generated the QR code typing the right numbers (and being non-malicious). Unless you generated the QR code (in which case you have the exact same problem with miss-typing things), it seems crazy to me to actually use it to move much money around.
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:50:20
And BTC has lost value over the last 6 months so I guess that makes sense.
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:12:51
You are assuming that the only reason someone would do at 51% attack is to profit financially - there could be state actors who want to destroy it for other reasons.

Because there is only ATH, while there are infinite historical prices you could compare with.

What kind of cherry picked stat is this? Did they just make all possible combinations of charts and choose the one that looked the worst? Without controlling for the size of each generation it makes absolutely no sense, since you are looking at percentage of overall household wealth, rather than comparing median wealth (which would make far more sense).
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:00:11
I don't get why people are always using such large transactions to talk about low fees. With a $400 million transaction, you don't care if there are 1k in fees because that is insignificant relative to the amount being moved around. When you do care about fees is when you are buying a coffee, or sending someone you know money, or moving 10k between countries.
If I was moving a million dollars i would be perfectly happy paying significantly more fees to ensure that if I mis-typed a number, my money is not lost forever.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:00:38
Do you know how much it costs to move $1 billion between banks?
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:05:49
No, Bitcoin's true value is what you are able to buy with it. The value of the USD is extremely stable, so it is a good thing to compare against when determining if something is gaining or loosing value. You would have a very similar graph of the value of Bitcoin if you tracked value by how many loaves of bread you could buy with it.
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:55:27
Sell it. If you didn't have it in the first place, would you buy it? Sounds like no, so you should sell it, the only reason you have it now is inertia.

I feel like stealing people's property isn't a great solution
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:32:38
Except for they said "from launch," not "from the first recorded price." And guess what - Bitcoin was worth essentially $0 at launch. It gets even more dumb though - 15 million percent from $0.07 cents gets you the current price, so for some reason the author of this tweet thinks Bitcoin was worth $0.07 at launch. Given that the first purchase was a pizza for 10k Bitcoin, I really doubt that is correct, unless that person was buying a $700 pizza.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:34:19
Some assets initially have negative value (ex. you might initially pay someone to take manure, but then learn it is good for fertalizer). So assets can certainly have exactly 0 value. When I say 0 here though, I just mean "essentially 0".
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:04:55
Just when I thought Reddit couldn't get any more fucking retarded. Any asset that started out at 0 value is up infinite percent, that doesn't tell you anything about how good of an asset it is.
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:45:58
I mean yea there is tonnes of land around, but there is a limited amount of land in places people actually want to live. You can build a massive house in the middle of nowhere for very cheap, and it will have a relatively low value, since most people don't want to live in the middle of nowhere. Even if there were no regulations surrounding construction, there is still a limited amount of land available for people to live in cities.
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:14:52
If you are serious about saving money, make a budget that lays out how much you want to save for things like your education, and how much you want to use for things like eating out, having fun, etc. Then use money from your "having fun" budget to invest in Bitcoin, and put your savings in some kind of more stable investment. At least where I am there are tax free savings accounts for saving for your education, I would just put my money in one of those, in some kind of medium risk mutual fund. If you need the money in a few years, you don't want to be investing in risky assets (ex. index funds), and you definitely don't want to be investing in a single, extremely risky asset (ex. Bitcoin).
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:06:52
Except there are lots of savings accounts that get way more than 0.05%. I'm getting 2.3%, and that's in Canada, which generally has lower returns anyways. Increasing interest rates would make it harder for the working class, since it would be more expensive to get loans and mortgages. I mean I personally hope that they raise interest rates so houses get cheaper, but the reason savings account rates are so low is because lending interest rates are so low.
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:11:03
I actually regret not spending more when I was young. I make way more in a month now than I spent through all of grade school and high school, it would have been worth it to spend more and have some fun. Having an extra 5k right now wouldn't really matter to me much, but it would let me do a lot of fun things when I was younger.
