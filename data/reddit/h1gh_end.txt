Wow. Because of the low interest rates, banks in Germany are looking for alternative revenue streams. Which is why some charge 0,05 € for EVERY transaction that is registered in my bank account. Every time money comes in or goes out, 0,05 €. I'd be perfectly fine paying 0,06 $ (= about 0,053 €) for a regular transfer that only takes 1 hour. That is actually much faster than banks can do it.

If you use Coinbase and not Coinbase Pro, they will just trade the Bitcoin for you at something close to the current market price plus fees.
If you use Coinbase Pro, you could place a limit sell order to sell your bitcoin to someone else. That would cost you 0 fees. You'd just have to choose at what price you want to sell your bitcoin. If you choose a price that is close to the market price it usually does not take long until your order is filled(=your bitcoins are now dollars).

Props to you good sir! 
You explained it really well! Although some people on there might need an ELI5 version to understand it.

I like your idea. And I too think that many small investors combined could challenge one or the other whale in terms of capital. BUT the problem is that it seems too hard to organize enough people to contest the whales. 
The best we can do - and I actually think we are doing quite well here - is the "HODL" meme that has a huge influence on the market. 
It's just a consensus that many bitcoin investors share. And the people that just hodl are actually the safest and are - most importantly - not among those people that fall into the traps of the whales and give them their money. Remember: Whenever someone makes money in the market somebody else is losing it. Hodler's don't contribute to that, it's the noob traders that are now complaining on twitter that they followed the advice of xyz trader and now lost a lot of money. They are feeding the whales. And as long as there are people like them, moves like the one we just saw will remain profitable for the whales. So they won't stop repeating them.
By taking just a glance at the chart of BTC for example you can see just how it looks like you drop a ball and with each bounce it loses some of its force and the next bounce will be lower than the previous one. To me this looks like the whales did their moves whenever the price reached a high point. They push the price down, make money, slowly build the price back up and repeat.
Now why is the next high lower than the previous high? Because with each cycle it washes out people that are frustrated because they just lost money by trying to be a trader. It's also why I guess the profits for the whales will go down because the number of people they can take their money from is decreasing. So at the end we'll be left with the hodlers and the people who are in it for the tech/idialism.
This turned out to be longer than I thought. It's just a theory that I came up with after trying to wrap my head around this last crash. Might be completely bs.
Only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-09-12 06:58:06
Uhm .. I don't know if it was intentional or not. 
But this actually came very close to how one of my nightmares looked!
It was the first time since I started accumulating btc that I actually sold some btc because I was sure that the price would drop (right before the BIG drop on September 5th). So I sold about 30% of my btc. That night I was really restless. I always dreamt of the btc chart of coinbase pro and how that chart was just shooting up and the next bull run was starting like crazy. Yeah .. next morning I bought back in, just slightly lower than I had sold and 3 hours later the price dropped by a huge amount. Definitely taught me a good lesson.

Or is this destructive criticism all you have for me?
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:39:30
You could look into VCA (=value cost average). That automatically makes you buy more when price is low and less when price is high. But you still accumulate every month/week.
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:50:49
Why? Do you have trouble reading?
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:04:34
I doubt that they're German. But in Germany you don't have to pay any taxes when you hold on to it for 1 year.
That would be nuts if you think about a sum like that.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:57:43
Right, that's why I think it's best to just go with bitcoin when you start out.
@_date: 2018-08-06 09:31:53
So they will eventually buy a big chunk of btc and then trade it within their own Network similar to the Lightning Network so the blockchain will not slow everything down?
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:03:47
I'm already doing both. Posting this article and engaging in a discussion with you guys on reddit kind of shows that.
But I haven't seen that site yet. So thanks for that. I'll check it out.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:33:23
Yeah I doubt it as well. Would be funny though. To have some secret whales swimming around this subreddit.
But the article is much more important for non-whales. As everybody needs to have a really strong hand in order to not feed the whales while they are going through their cycles.

@_date: 2018-08-07 12:35:18
Maybe I should clarify here:
I posted this article to educate all the smaller investors on the tactics that might be used by whales in the crypto market right now.
To me it is an explanation as to why the price is behaving the way it is right now. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:49:26
That's what I'll try to do. I just hope I can stop watching the price every 10 minutes or I'll go insane before those first 24 months are over.

You beat me to it!
I am currently at 0.087 Bitcoin.
But I plan on getting to the 0.1 as well :-)
Edit: Of course 1 Bitcoin would be the ultimate goal! BUT that would be so much more than 1% of my entire money. I've heard some investors saying you shouldn't invest more than 1% of your assets into crypto. Kinda like the "don't invest something you can't lose" -rule.

I was not responding to the OP of this thread but to u/Abraxas19 who definitely does not want to store 250k.

I've been asking myself the same question. I would think that they are accumulating right now while the prices are still low. But I have no idea.
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:12:02
I haven't been in the crypto space for long. But I believe that what you say is true for the current market situation. 
Whenever the big crypto accounts on twitter say they are VERY BULLISH, and price goes up .. it won't go up for long until it "crashes" again.
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:25:15
Could it not work this way:
I put a big portion of my money into bitcoin before the fiat money is printed and loses value. In relation to fiat, bitcoins dollar price should increase. Especially so if the dollar is being inflated.
Whenever I need fiat to pay for something. I can liquidate parts of my bitcoin and just pay for it. 
If bitcoin's price wont suffer from inflation, my bitcoin should be worth more and more dollars as the dollar inflation goes on. So every month that passes, I'll just get more and more dollars for my bitcoin.
Edit: I mean just look at countries like Venezuela and Turkey where the inflation is ramping up. We hear reports of people actually using bitcoin and buying more bitcoin because the value of their fiat money just melts away. Isn't this right?
@_date: 2018-10-24 06:26:41
Yeah, it was something like:
Elon should think about whether he should tweet at all because whenever he tweets Tesla stocks go down and people lose money.
Then He replied to my answer that I should tell this to the people who lost 30k$ and more because of his "uncontainable spirit".
After that something along the lines of "He should take at least some responsibility towards his investors, because people go bankrupt only because "a wealthy business owner behaves like a 12 year old" or something.
Hope that helps. Does this happen often, that people delete their comments when they realize their point of view is not popular?

Hello history class, now I want to show you this tip that reddit user u/ride_the_LN sent another reddit user just because he agreed with his comment.. a tip that would be worth about 13.044,00 $ today. 
But .. like all the previous examples I showed you, bitcoins dominance wouldn't have developed like it did without people using it the way they did. So it is all part of the process. And this particular "lntipbot" was one of the very first steps in the long road of success for the Lightning Network. Which was only the second layer on top of Bitcoins Blockchain network.
Does anyone remember the layers that would follow in the coming years, which we learned about in our previous lesson?

I think I failed to get my point across due to a lack of words. Maybe I was talking about luxury items. Items that I don't need for survival.
For example I bought a new mattress a couple months ago. The old one was still fine but the new one was better. I feel like if I was saving for something like a house and knew all my savings would be worth 5% more in a year, I might be more hesitant about making such purchases.

The creation of bitcoin is an enormous historical event! 
The impact bitcoin will have not only on the financial world but the distribution of power and therefore the course of governments, politics and the earth in general is so huge that it might change everything starting with its creation.

Wait ... Is it true, that banks actually increase inflation, because they lend money that they don't even have and therefore there is the illusion of more money in circulation that there actually is?
That wouldn't work though, right? A bank couldn't give out money that they don't have. I understand that it's different with cash. That they only need to have a certain percentage of cash stored in relation to the money they are actually working with.

I guess that depends on where you live. I get 0 interest in Germany right now. They actually charge me for every transaction that happens on my account (in- or outgoing). 
It's never ONLY the bank, since the state will always be able to see your financial affairs as well if needed. You can have good privacy with Bitcoin if you take some precautions like not reusing addresses etc.. Point is, you don't have to trust the bank to keep everything private. You have ALL the power over your financial privacy and all the decisions are yours to make.
At the current stage, it takes a lot of effort to do everything yourself though. Which is why I think, until we have good enough decentralized solutions, banks are needed in a transitioning period.

I like that the German government passed the required laws to make this possible, and I like that there's a bank that wants to make use of these possibilities right away.
While I would not personally store my btc in a bank, we all agree, that it is very challenging for the broad masses to set up a secure way to hold their crypto assets all by themselves. So if banks help to make the entry into crypto easier for the average person, go ahead. Bring them on board. Meanwhile, the crypto scene will keep coding and make decentralized solutions that are more and more user-friendly and will be cheaper to use than banks. 
So when the time comes, people can leave their banks and start using non-custodial solutions. So it pretty much feels like a transition-period that might be necessary to get more people on board.
@_date: 2019-02-01 08:05:37
I'm really not good at maths but I don't think you should evaluate the differences of bear- and bull-market in percentages.
Obviously the -80% are subtracted from a big number. Where the bullish movement starts from a small number. Plus you can not lose more than 100% during a bear market but you can gain multiples of 100% in a bull market. 
If looking at the Dollars that we gained and lost, we're pretty close to being even considering the last cycle. Was it not like 3.000$ to 20.000$ now back to 3.000$?

It sounds sooo cliché, but sticking to the "don't invest what you're not ready to lose" dogma it the only way to go.
99% of all people who don't stick to it will be weak hands at some point.

I wouldn't disregard OP's fears. I think his point is legit.
If mass adoption should ever come, the main task for banks might shift towards storehouses/safekeeping. It already exists today with "bank lockers" where you can put in valuable stuff. And I imagine that you just put your hardware wallets into a bank without giving them access to your btc.
So your money is safe and protected. Plus the bank can not use your money.

I'm glad I read all the way through. Thank you so much for your contribution!
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:20:33
I thought the same.

Looks like Narutos seal to me. She might be the 4th Hokage. Or something.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:55:12
Thanks, now I at least understand where the comment is coming from.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:38:38
People like you are the reason why I don't fucking understand myself. 
Why the mother fuck did I laugh so hard about this comment?
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:08:47


For me, that is one of the big arguments FOR a crazy price explosion at some point in the future. 5.8 million is such few people. If btc becomes more mainstream, that number could multiply really fast and thus the price would shoot up as well.
It first has to become more mainstream though.
@_date: 2019-01-09 10:58:53
Is that number legit? 
I was thinking about making a node as a cool project but then I thought that right now I don't really make payments with btc so I don't really need a node for myself.
If the energy costs are that low, I might still consider it.
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:39:00
It's just amazing because so many people listen to Joes podcast. So if btc is mentioned there in a positive way, it's always great.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:12:53
It doesen't necessarily need it. It just inspires it in some people when they learn more about it.

I just always buy with limit orders. Set the limit price slightly lower than the current price and you pay zero fees. Although it might only be easy to use during a bear market. But that's the only kind of market I know.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:04:39
This is amazing!
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:12:49
I tend to agree as well. All you see from them are empty phrases. Time will show. 
I am at a stage where I don't really care about the price of btc anymore as long as it stays above a certain level where mining will be lucrative enough to have a decent hash rate so the network stays safe.
So I don't really care about bakkt either. It is lightning that I care mostly about right now. If we get that one up and running flawlessly, btc has the tools to become an even better form of payment.
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:37:18
Those are some heavy downvote numbers.
He is not completely wrong though. The higher the price of btc, the more mining rigs you can install/energy you can consume and still be profitable.
I still don't know how btc will solve this problem. It might not have to be solved and we can just take it as an inevitable downside. It doesen't change the fact that it's a downside though.

It's just an awesome motivational scene from a cool movie.
No need to play internet police.

Relax guys, step by step :-)
I'm quite happy with these news. Haven't heard of that before.
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:17:17
That comment right there just made me paranoid. Thinking of google's web crawlers like some kind of beast looming in the dark, scanning for things we type and post just to adjust the ALGORITHM!
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:32:43
Really well written! Loved it.
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:02:56
Thank you for the article! It's kinda hard to believe, but .. your analysis gives greater substance to the hopes of all us hodlers out here :)
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:32:18
lol I doubt girls want more period though. So crypto is even better than bleeding out of your private parts once a month!
That's quite something.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:55:58
I wish I would have known about btc from early on.. I always admire you guys who were brave enough to invest in btc when it was still so new and nobody knew if it would stand the test of time.
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:11:25
Looks poisonous AF.

Just letting you know that you're behaving like a piece of shit here.
If that's your opinion, it's fine. But asking for help/advice in a sub that is full of dedicated bitcoin enthusiasts and then replying in a disrespectful manner like this is just messed up. 
It just shows that you don't have the least bit of courtesy.
@_date: 2019-05-06 07:15:54


I am aware of that. 
And you are obviously aware of the fact that for people in this community, bitcoin is more than an investment. And you still chose to write in the disrespectful manner that you did.
That .. according to more than 17k reddit users - actually makes you a bad person.
@_date: 2019-05-06 08:02:16
You're also constantly trying to divert from the actual issue I was calling you out on. Reading my first comment again will hopefully clear things up.
Your "food for thought" is correct. I'm just afraid you don't understand what it means.
What good does it do for you that the "universe does not give a fuck" about morality? How does that impact your life? It does not impact it in any way.
You know what does have an impact on your life though? The society you live in and the social constructs that you are a part of. And they are - just like morality - "man" made.
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:51:37
I think "Fair enough" just doesen't cut it here. His answer was pretty disrespectful and we should stop giving this guy advice.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:39:40
I see what you did there..
You tricked him into wishing you luck so that bitcoin would go up because of your new luck and 
.. that's amazing! Because your luck is my luck :-)
@_date: 2019-05-06 07:38:47
Damn dude, you're starting to check all the boxes. Pretty good timing on this "Askreddit" thread.
While some of these might be a little far-fetched, they kinda still apply.
You're pretty bad. Do you intend to change that?
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:43:29
Come on .. You think that some unbanked people could just download your banking app and open a bank account? Is that the solution you offer them? You know that there is a big system behind all of this. 
For instance you had to verify your identity etc. Without the right infrastructure it can't be done. 
Bitcoin does not need verification of identity or anything. All it needs is Access to the internet. And it is becoming easier to make offline transactions as well.
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:45:44
You mf .. you almost made me cry!
Beautifully written my friend. I was feeling the chills all over my body while reading the last 6 lines. 
I'm on board as well, sitting like 3 lines further in the back to your right.. when you turn around.
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:42:16
Where does the money come from that the merchant uses to pay for those fees?
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:30:49
If you don't pay the transaction fee .. then who does?
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:41:18
Right. They use the money that they get from their customer who pays for their product. 
Of course most don't pass on the savings. But that doesn't mean that they won't price in the transaction costs in the first place. 
In a future where transaction costs are very small, businesses would eventually have to pass the savings because the market would find a new price.
I am not arguing for bitcoin here. I just don't want people to think that they don't pay the transaction costs at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:30:41
Wow. This is the first time I read about this.
And I totally love it. It really does make Bitcoin that much more robust!
How could bitcoin ever die with so many amazing projects being realized all over the world?
