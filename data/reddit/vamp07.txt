If Bitcoin is all the things that us believers believe, none of the current movement up or down  is going to matter.

I know breadwallet generates new address for every transaction, is it possible to reuse an address if you give it out to several people or is that trouble?

I don't see it as a currency for now. Maybe never. I do see it as as a very good potential storer of value in the long run. Much better than gold.

I have not burned money. Even after this drop I am way ahead. Then again I did not buy in that rise. Nobody should have.  Would I buy now? absolutely! Of course that assumes you have a longer term timeframe. I have no idea what it will do in the next year or two. Looking farther out I think you will end up far ahead.

Stability will come with much wider ownership and usage. At this point it’s a speculative investment.

It’s amazing to me how the press just doesn’t get it. You can say that bitcoin is on a bull run or a bear downturn depending on the time frame you look at.   At this point I think you have to look at bitcoin in terms of several years maybe four given that that’s a timeframe for having. If you look at it that way how can you possibly not reach the conclusion that bitcoin is on an incredible bull run that outperforms every other asset I can think of. 
Of course if you invest like most investors and buy on the upturn and sell  on the downturn especially with a volatile asset like bitcoin you can’t help but talk about the bear market.

I think what bitcoin has done over the last year is absolutely awesome. I never thought it would drop to this extent in that timeframe. It gives many of us an opportunity to load up again and enjoy the inevitable next bull run

It all comes down to timeframes. It you look short term you are right. If you look longterm I have been very right .

You have a keen sense of the obvious.

What about the attempts to hire assassins?

Bitcoin is not really up million fold. That comparison is to ipos in which the founders get x amounts of shares. Bitcoin is just more democratic. The founders are all those that believes in the idea on day one. Not just the developers and or angel investors.

That was not my point. It started at zero because in an open system there is no way to set initial pricing. If this was an ipo it would have launched much higher. The initial price gave many a chance at wealth but comparing it to something like Facebook in terms of the wild climb in price is not real. Facebooks initial price was set. Bitcoins was discovered by the market.
