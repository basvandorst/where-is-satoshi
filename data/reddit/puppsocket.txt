Enough to give 2011 a real run for its (hypothetical) money ...

What doesn't these days

1% “cash back“ gets tons of people to needlessly borrow trivial sums at exorbitant interest.  If the evil pool can roll its exploitation into top-of-the-chart payouts I wonder how altruistic hashers would remain...

I too am concerned, the warning said "24 hours" more than 48 hours ago.  With difficulty rocketing like it is, I sure hope we don't end up losing days' worth of mining to this.  It has been very difficult to find any information about the outage as well.

Conversion to USD is apparently not what BTC are for, everyone is happy to take your $ for bitcoins but god help you if you want to do anything with bitcoins except give it to fraudulent merchants or gamble it away on the damn internet.
Your best bet is a face-to-face with a local buyer, yes it can be a pain. Lack of a reliable USA/BTC exchange is really impacting bitcoin acceptance in the US, and presumably around the world.

PayPal is a 'protocol' too.  Several, even.  It's protocols all the way down.

You promised me a hilarious read [here]( and I was not disappointed!  I gave you an upvote (here, because it was funny; but not there, because you were a whiny bitch) but it wasn't worth a bitcoin, sorry!
“Everyone should get a free bitcoin“ is exactly (*exactly*) like saying “Everyone should get a hundred bucks“, well sure, everyone could use a hundred bucks, the world would be a better place if everyone had an extra hundred bucks right now ... but whose hundred bucks is it going to be?
What do you expect from an experiment in capitalism? Money sucks. Scarcity sucks. Human nature frequently sucks.  You may get your wish re: bitcoin tanking - I mean it IS imaginary money after all, and plenty of 'real' currencies have gone the way of the dodo - but it does not sound like you will profit from it and since the global economy is ultimately a zero-sum game for any given individual, all the money that your supposed foes lose will just end up in the pocket of some douchebag exploiting a more 'legitimate' store of value.

We start buying things with dollars?

I'm not sure about that. If the “big guy“ - who controls the societal means of production, creates *and* enforces the law of the land, and holds a coercive monopoly on the legal use of violence - can force you to pay taxes (they can), take your land without your consent (they can), take away your kids (they can), put you in prison for any of a vast array of statutory offenses (they can), draft you into the fucking Army (maybe they can) and compel you to decrypt your hard drive (you might not think they can, but they can!) ... what makes you think your bitcoins are safe? If that's the argument you'd be better off burying gold or cash and keeping your mouth shut ...
