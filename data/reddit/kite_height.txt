It makes it super easy to install a bunch of Linux distros including tails on flash drives.

I'll be so happy if this is still happening

Bitcoin doesn't inherently rely on any sort of fiat currency. Yes it has an exchange rate with most if not all fiat currencies, but is that not true about those currencies themselves? Also, this is not something that will happen overnight. Bitcoin is like the Internet was in the early 90s in the sense that it's a technological baby. I suggest watching some YouTube videos of newscasts from that time and see how confused and dismissive people were of the Internet. It's not ready for mainstream adoption just like the Internet wasn't ready then. However, I do know 2 people that currently get paid and pay their rent in bitcoin. Thats a tiny number but it shows its possible. 
I'd like to hear the other catch-22s you have in mind and have a chance to discuss them.

I agree with most of what you're saying. For now, it's completely unrealistic for even a tiny percentage of people to be paid in bitcoin, let alone actually agree to it. We are in the baby stage of bitcoin and everybody involved is still an early adopter. Bitcoin is far from perfect but so is our current financial system. Over time, bitcoin will cement it's place in our worldwide economy just like every other fiat currency has and continues to do. It will be years, possibly more, before that happens. But the best way I've found to speed that along is through discussion, education, and awareness raising. I'm constantly amazed by how few people have ever heard of bitcoin, and how quickly most adopt it into their daily lives once they better understand it. I don't think it will ever "take over" but it'll probably become a new way to get paid just as most people get paychecks but some people still get paid in cash. Also, we haven't even discussed bitcoins ability to pay workers in developing nations with much shittier banking situations.

If you haven't, check out Ting. They also rent time on other networks but seem to have all the new phones.

Coinbase now gives you the option of having control over your keys 
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:56:26
You have to set up the vault which entails generating, encrypting, and printing your private keys. After that you can have coins purchased directly into the vault.

What are you saying?

You don't sound very educated on the subject so idk why you're giving such certain advice

Less convenient? Using the same address is definitely more convenient the same way you use the same email everytime. It would be way less convenient if I had to ask you for your new email everytime, no? For certain purchases I don't care about their privacy. For example, I usually buy lunch with bitcoin a few times a week. I don't care who knows about my pizza eating habits. For somebody who is new to bitcoin, there is no need to complicate it any further in a situation like that.
Like I said, if they're storing or sending more money than they carry around in their real wallet everyday, then yea reusing addresses is not a good idea. But just as my real life wallet is used for convenience not security, so is my bitcoin lunch wallet.

If you're not concerned over the extra privacy you're losing, reusing the same address is more convenient for most new users.

I like to make the analogy to a real life wallet. The money you carry around in your wallet everyday is not secure by any means. You use it for convenience and you rarely carry around more money than you can deal with losing. The same thing can be said for bitcoin wallets. If you're using a few bucks a day to buy lunch, who cares if somebody knows your bitcoin spending habits. That being said, if you can use an HD wallet it makes using new addresses very simple. And if you're using more bitcoin than you would carry around in your wallet everyday, you should treat it as so and be as secure as possible.

About 10

Hold on, how is reusing addresses the same as not having a password. No password shows very very low security. Reusing addresses simply links your purchases together. No body can gain access to your coins just because you reuse addresses, can they? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:54:06
I'm not saying it's good practice. It's not. But if you're using it so friends/family can send you money, it's a lot easier for them to just save one address instead of asking you everytime. Also, if you use that address for simple, small, and legal transactions, the convenience might out way the privacy depending on the person.
