I see it this way:
First, a world in which a few hundred/thousand people have 50% of wealth is very bad.
Second, a world in which everybody has equal wealth is very bad.
Somewhere on this continuum is the optimal allocation of wealth. Universal basic income is basically a control mechanism to ensure we do not go to one extreme or the other.
Unlike the 'mainstream' idea of UBI, I do not believe it has to replace other benefits or even be based on people's actual economic needs. It could exist alongside means-tested benefits.

I'm glad somebody is looking at BitTorrent and Bitcoin in this light. I actually had a similar idea -- inspired by Bitcoin and TOR -- but it's not quite as extreme as what you guys are trying to do. As BitTorrent stands, you can download a file part and not share it with others -- essentially 'stealing' a file. My idea was that you could instead share an encrypted file part, with the instruction to share it with N other peers. Only when you have done work to distribute to N other peers, was the decryption key released. (Either the originator releases the key, or you have 'onion' encryption and pass they keys back and forth throughout the chain.) So, essentially, you are not earning money or bitcoins -- your reward is the file part you requested.

This is common for budget airlines in Europe. They don't actually want you to use their card, and they'll change the cards year after year so you have to keep applying. And if you don't use it in 6 months, it expires. All they want is the €5.99 fee, which is really part of the price. It makes the flights seem cheaper than they are. They'll also charge you if your bag is not of a certain dimension -- and those dimensions are non-standard.
You might also have to pay a service charge of £0.50 per person, a wheelchair fee even if you don't have a wheelchair, and all manner of add-ons and extras that you didn't ask for and didn't want. All to reduce the headline figure.

I don't understand why people obsess over the 'price of Bitcoin'. If you are going to treat Bitcoin as a currency (rather than an investment), it doesn't matter how many USD you can buy with it. I don't sit here worrying about how many USD my GBP will buy, so why do people do it with Bitcoin? Exchanging currency is not an investment.

The UK doesn't have a constitution as such. I think it is rather an extreme way of thinking to think the government is continually out to get people. I think the government is too big, and intervenes too often, but I am also wise enough to recognise that hospitals, roads, rail infrastructure and schools don't magically appear out of nowhere. And people need to pay their taxes to enjoy these things.


Tax is not an abuse of power, it's an essential part of society. Do you really think a society without tax could function in any meaningful way. The next time you drive your car on the public road, use public transport or go to hospital, think about what made that happen. It wasn't Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is great, but so is paying tax.

That is a problem I thought about, and I don't have any real solution to. If there is only one person downloading, you can simply have N=0 -- the originating peer will know only one person wants the file. It was this problem that led me to think about 'file swaps', since it doesn't matter who the file is shared with -- as long as everybody is getting the same as they put in, it's a zero sum game.

No, the only real participation in the network is if you were mining. And then you are generating value. So a mining company is an asset. But being a mere user of the payment network doesn't generate any value. (I want to make the distinction between *passively realising* value and *actively generating* it. I think that's important.)
The point I am making is that the Bitcoin infrastructure is of value, but Bitcoins of themselves are not -- they are only a proxy of value of real assets.
Don't get me wrong, I want to see Bitcoin succeed. But I want people to realise how important it is *not* to treat it as a "speculative value asset" as you mentioned.

Well, you shouldn't think of there being physical units of currency, but rather as a book where you write down all the transactions -- a ledger. In the same way that governments create money by writing down an entry in the ledger (i.e. "Add $x trillion to treasury balance") so too is Bitcoin created by writing in the ledger. The Bitcoin ledger is known as the blockchain. The only difference between real money and Bitcoin is that real money only takes writing with a pen to update the ledger, whereas updating the Bitcoin ledger is incredibly more (computationally) difficult. If a Bitcoin miner has put in effort to update the ledger for everybody else, he is rewarded by being allowed to add his own entry into the ledger -- for 25 Bitcoins.

Statistically speaking, somebody always has 51% control at any particular unit of time. It wouldn't matter if the 51% attack happened for a small, temporary amount of time. Suppose for example that the United States suffered a huge power cut, knocking off most miners for 12 hours. Somebody could use a 51% attack, but it wouldn't matter as they will be "outmined" when everybody comes back online.

Well, the downloader doesn't have the freedom to choose who to share with. The origin peer instructs the downloading peer to share with others. Similar to how TOR operates -- you feel back a layer, and there's an instruction to forward the message to somebody else. Except, in this model, once the file has been distributed, the keys get released so everybody can reveal the true file.
An alternative idea I had was for a 'file swap' network, so you only share a file part when you receive a part. But, because everybody has different files, you can chain swaps together. I haven't thought about this idea much, and you'll run into problems with cold start, etc.

Holding Bitcoin has no potential to generate economic value, except relative to other currencies. If we treat it as an asset, we are ascribing intrinsic value to Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin isn't "worth" anything, it simply measures the worth of real assets, as does any currency. If people are buying Bitcoin not because they want to trade in it, but in the hope it attains value relative to USD, then I'm sorry but the project is doomed to failure.

That's exactly what I mean.


That's not a bad thing. The Bitcoin blockchain is entirely based on printing money.


Of course, but that's not value in and of itself. The value of Bitcoin is what you can buy with it -- i.e. tangible products, assets, services. And that value is ultimately based on debt. For every new Bitcoin that is mined, the value of every other Bitcoin reduces. It might not be called debt, but the effect is the same.

Well, they already have power to seize assets. I see this as a measure to cut red tape. Even if you had to get a court order, all of the evidence will be provided by HMRC, and it is very unlikely that the court -- on the basis of that evidence -- will refuse to grant an order. Of course, if mistakes are made, you can bring your own case against HMRC and recover not only the money that was taken, but also any legal fees and financial loss you have experienced.
