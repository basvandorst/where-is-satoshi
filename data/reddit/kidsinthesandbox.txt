Jesus christ how boring. I thought I was on r/personalfinance for a second. Scrape every penny, Drive a 1993 Honda until you reach 900k miles, collect coupons, every penny goes to a retirement plan. 
Not everyone wants to live the safe life.

I can tell you're new to investing because you think investing in something without doing due diligence is something new. That shit has been going on for centuries. 
Get off your high horse acting like you know the technology behind bitcoin because you're throwing out buzzwords.

Don't give a fook. Transfered my 401k to btc when it was at 1200. I've gained so much more it's not even funny. 75 percent drop is still profit.

You would have sold at some point. I had about 500 coins around 2012 ($10 each coin) and sold a large chunk of em when they it hit around $200.

Another redditor parroting tulip bulbs analogy.
Edit: looks like you realize now it's a poor analogy. Carry on sir. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:02:17

@_date: 2017-11-29 09:38:35


Tulip bulbs gets mentioned in a post somewhere and now several people are parroting it. 
You made this? I made this.

It boggles my mind that people actually speak this way. A real life copy pasta. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:11:28
This is why it doesn't bother me knowing I had 800 btc in my wallet back in 2011.

It's not like we have drug mills and "pain clinics" all over the country providing deadly drugs.

So you're just gonna ignore the credit card and interest comparison you made.

Banks aren't in jeopardy here. Get real. Banks can easily transition to crypto if needed. The amount of revenue they generate you would be foolish to think the banks are in trouble.
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:23:30
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha. No. It's edgy and all but let's be real here. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:39:09
Wait what? You own the crypto though. So it's like a debit card. Are you paying 20% interest for your debit card? I'm not. I don't even get how this is even remotely similar.
