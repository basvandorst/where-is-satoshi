Are u in the US? If it's more than a year since you made the investment then wouldn't it be 15%?

He's saying that's the case with paypal, which is correct. Cryptos allow for actual trustless transactions.

Okay so you're saying I'd pay taxes on the BTC-&gt;ETH and ETH-&gt;USD transactions right? Well if thats the case at what point are the taxes actually supposed to be paid? In other words, taking your example, say one hasn't converted ETH-&gt;USD but has only done the USD&gt;BTC&gt;ETH part. Do you still have to pay taxes on the BTC-&gt;ETH in the current fiscal year even though you haven't actually made any profit in fiat because you haven't exchanged it back to fiat?
I see what you mean in regards to cryptos having a currency designation, certainly would make these crypto-crypto trades more painless in regards to taxes :/

So what if you want to withdraw more than 10k from an exchange ?

But when do you pay taxes on the btc-eth trade? Dont you pay that once you convert back to fiat? Or you pay it that same year regardless of whether you kept things in crypto or not?

The problem is there isn't really an obvious way of punishing said ICOs without also punishing US citizens that have invested in them (either by doling out an actual punishment to them or simply causing major financial loss for participants due to fallout). If that's the case there will be a shitstorm raised by those who had losses due to some retroactive SEC intervention. I'm not saying what you said is impossible just that it is most definitely not a certainty when you consider the damage it would do. The SEC's purpose, ultimately, is to protect people.
