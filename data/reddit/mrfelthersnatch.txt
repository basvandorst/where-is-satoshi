I just made a account on coin base, and I was wondering if I were to buy one Bitcoin now @ 352 usd, then say next week their selling price is 400 and I sell my coin I bought last week for the profit, is this a good strategy?

Yea I looked at the code, lol looks like a bunch of hold returns. Haha jk, I like what you have going. And I'm excited for 2015. I think we will see price rise further than expected with these big companies getting on board as well as overall publicity it will bring.

Awesome advice, I think I will take both of yours- I will buy about 3-4 coins and never touch them. I then will have another 1 just to gamble with. But I'm also going to look into those other sites... I also looked at the stock market on these and they are pennies right now, can anyone elaborate on the reason that is?

Back in early 2011, I followed Bitcoin and sadly was not financially stable to start to invest, from what I gathered from reading this subreddit, I am now just buying when I can, I am not trying to day sell, but invest what I can lose, hoping for a profit 10- years down the road. Is this a smart game plan or should I do a combo, say I have 3 full coins, and 1, that I use to cash in when the next bubble happens,  and cash in with that one coin and save the others for down the road when hopefully the next bubble happens.

No not other coins, kraken... Although I'm having trouble selling coins. It is saying I'm not authorized. Even though I thought I registered everything. My plan is still the same but kraken provides a nice exchange site... If I could figure out how to sell &amp; buy.

Wow awesome, is his formula up for people to see?

Thank you all so much! I am no computer noob, in any way but with that said I find coinbase to be simple to use especially with Authy... If you all think leaving it on there will be good enough, then I think my best option would be to do this... 
Also one of the reasons I want to keep them on there is so I can sell off my phone anytime, would u recommend selling through coinbase or exchange? I find exchange to be a little complicated.

Why give out free money, but I'll have some!

I will say the lucky part of it! I do my due diligence when betting though and any time I pick the underdog of a nhl bet I am only doing that if I feel strongly that they have a little bit an advantage out side of stats. Such as will this game kick them out of the playoffs, how many injured and general stuff like that... It seems to be working well.

Depends on state, basically follows all casino rules. I'm on my phone but you should be good as long as you follow your states laws! I recommend cloudbet.com.

Am I allowed to ask what site? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 04:03:51
Why thank you, has anyone numbered crunches on how much money u need to have to even start a profit on mining? Or is the difficulty so high now that you basically need your own warehouse? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:14:07
Anyone try this? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:33:59
Thank you, good advice.
