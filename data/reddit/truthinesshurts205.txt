Nah, that was cuz the oil market crashed.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:34:31
He can't
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:50:34
My point is that if you prop up any regime on oil revenues or one specific industry, it's not going to end well,  communist or not

You mean he's gonna cut taxes on the super wealthy and large corporations,  too? Damn, that's what we're doing already!
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:33:23
Yeah,  that's what it looked like. Last post of theirs basically told yang supporters to off themselves,  so I'm guessing that got the ban hammer

His plan is to run his 'Freedom Dividend' in parallel with current welfare programs,  so it's not in addition to,  it's either or. If you do the math and see you're getting more than $1k/mo in welfare,  you can choose not to opt in to ubi and keep your welfare benefits. So it's more of a replacement than a supplement because If you take ubi you forgo welfare

Keep all your money in btc, it won't be taxed and you'll still get your $1000/month, which you can then use to buy more bitcoin.  I thought this was r/bitcoin, are you not a true believer,  heretic???

Put it on the bottom of any horizontal surface to make it a great hiding place! Bottom of a chair, under a shelf in the cupboards,  etc...

Then the demand for the dollar will decrease... Literally you can only buy oil from Saudi Arabia with American dollars. You can't use euros, or yen,  or yuan, or even *gasp* bitcoin. Sometimes called the petrodollar, because USD isn't backed by anything like gold anymore, it's most closely backed by oil (or just our imaginations). So if there's no more need for oil, or it all gets used up, there will be less of a need for other countries to buy dollars to pay for their oil. 


Sounds awesome to me, tbh. Bitcoin is divisible down to a hundred millionth (I could be a decimal or two off), so like a penny of a penny. And printing money isn't a good thing in the first place, in America it's effectively a very sneaky tax. As the Fed prints more money, the value of each dollar decreases slightly as the money supply grows, which is inflation. Effectively the government is taking a tiny slice of everyone's wealth and pocketing it, without ever actually taking any of your money. So why would we want to print more bitcoin? Bitcoin acts with a deflationary pressure because there is a limited supply of it. With any good, if there's a limited supply and an increasing demand, the price goes up. Sounds good to me. As far as different cryptocurrencies, Uhh, yeah, but those wouldn't be bitcoin :/ 


The real way to do it is to buy things with bitcoin then immediately buy back that same amount of bitcoin.

Well, one could certainly make an argument that had their currency not experienced rapid inflation (which can happen under any mismanaged government) that the btc market value would be lower than it is today.  So really... thanks,  Venezuela.

Well of course,  dude sounds like he's batshit crazy on repeat.

The only actual information about policy in this thread.  Thank you.

Nice character assassination with literally no supporting evidence,  bruh

I think it was a great ad at the time, but we need someone to make another MS paint ad with the bitcoin logo + wizard + matrix-ey shit. Best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:22:50
Definitely HODLED

Whenever I'm discussing btc and the topic turns to price,  I'll try and specifically say "one FULL bitcoin is worth $X" instead of just "one bitcoin..." in order to give it the subtle inference that you can have a fraction of a bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:12:08
Totally accurate analysis,  but the price has been forming a sort of cone since it peaked in late June till today,  and it seems to be selling around 10-11k. In the past when I've noticed this,  it means once it's settled and not moving a lot there will be a very quick spike or crash. I'm bullish, so I'm predicting a spike. 15k btc by November.

What's a good resource to find these exchange rates online?
