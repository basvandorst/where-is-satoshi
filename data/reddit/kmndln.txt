Word. I feel lucky because I bought a mining rig with TeamViewer installed and I'm glad I didn't use it to transact BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:29:07
How's your interest rate compared to the rise in value of BTC?

@_date: 2014-06-16 23:35:55
Actually, retail deposit accounts are not profitable. That's why we did credit checks. If you can't so much as qualify for a credit card (much less car loan or mortgage) we didn't want the $200 in your checking account.
Maybe it's not surprising that you don't know how badly corporate America fucks the little guy.
@_date: 2014-09-09 13:36:48
You can still hate someone and do business with them if it's in your self-interest.
If the Ku Klux Klan was offering bitcoins for $200 each I'd be first in line.

Not as awesome as it sounds. The Swiss have been rolling over to the U.S. authorities for a couple years now. They'll probably go more hardcore on KYC with BTC accounts.

I am a former Bank of America Vice President for the retail division and I can tell you that Bitcoin has a role to play here. Since the late 1990's you've needed a minimum credit score to open an account.

Last time I checked, they weren't operating as a charity. You pay 1% and a flat $.15 and get enterprise security and cold storage, 2FA, mobile app and web access, modern UI, vendor integration and API tools.
Seems fair to me.

Actually, knowing someone's email address and BTC address is a good start for thieves if they keep a web wallet and/or email without 2FA. Knowing someone would reply to this message also indicates they probably have a weak password.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:35:48
This is actually not good news.
We have to quit pretending that Bitcoin is superior to credit cards because of fraud concerns. Your credit card gets compromised, you're out $50 and a lot of hassle. Your private key gets jacked and you are shit out of luck.
Unless, like me, you know Liam Neeson. He can get back anything that's taken.

Whoah... Shit just got real.
Cucumber is a nonstarter. Looks tasty, but too hard to keep good cukes at the local deli. That's why pickles were created.  
As for chicken, redundant meats. We only have 3 ingredients here. Use the "c" more wisely.  
Cheese is an interesting discussion point; could work, but I'd want to see a single cheese approved by the Bitcoin Foundation.
