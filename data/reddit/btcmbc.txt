You really think it has nothing to do with the hack ?  Users entrusted BFX with BTCs AS MUCH as they did their USDs.  I know full well when I hold BTC on Poloniex that should they lose all of their dogecoins I'll get an haircut to my BTC and vice-versa.

Why would an autonomous corporation operate at zero profit?  When something operate at zero profit an unexpected pothole on the street can collapse the company.  Between operating margin, growth and risk management lies something called investment opportunity who's main metric is ROI,  aka. profit.

Maybe Blockstream has no "power" over core but they have influence over core.  Which may or may not be a bad thing for core. It's most likely a good thing for core but even more likely a good thing for blockstream.

Well there are many court and individuals, who will judge this guy differently depending on what he does next.  A determined angry mob has many level of determination.  This person will also have to live with the knowledge that he might have affected the lives of some people beyond what he can imagin.  If the amount to cover is too big for bitfinex investors and it goes bust it affect negatively the ecosystem as a whole while stealing directly from individuals vs bitfinex investors. With bitcoin the hacker can very easily send transaction without putting his physical person at risk of being caught and the truth is that the value of those coins is much higher in the hands of the people to who it belongs with an operating exchange. Bitfinex can trade a more fungible asset in exchange for a partial refund.

Important to remember that Bitcoin will not split like stocks, for example Apple stocks have a split a few times and the price on one stock (from 1986) should be 56x more than what it is now 119$ or 6664$
Apple, a company that makes gadget and phones, has a market cap more than 100 times larger than Bitcoin, a global monetary system.

For me, and I think most people, the hardware is not the problem, actually I don't think buying underpowered dedicated hardware for running a node is very sane, The problem is resource management !
If Bitcoin core need to be reviewed and tested so much to add any feature, then there need to be a fork of bitcoind that is not meant for storing any coins but that focus on resource management, connection monitoring, bandwidth controls, and maybe even show some nice visualizations of incoming transactions, list of connected peers ect. Think BOINC or F 
The current version can saturate upload from time to time hence affecting download and there is no way to limit it's sending to say 95% of available bandwidth, to tell it to calm the F down during set working hours, to run only when computer is idle or allow to run while respecting monthly transfer caps.

Transcript thanks to **Senator Black**: I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking and congratulating each of you for these outstanding presentations. I have only been at the Senate a year and a half, but this is clearly one of the best panels I have had the privilege of working with.
Speaking for myself, I view my role on this file as to assist, in a meaningful way, innovation, as you have discussed today. That's how I'm trying to look at this. How do we assist this innovative technology, this disruptive technology, as you referred to? You have to help me. We had a lot of conversation today started by our chairman around regulation or not.
I would need specifics. What would you like this committee to do to assist the development of this, right to the point? What would you like us to do? Maybe the answer is nothing, and if that's the answer, tell us. But if there is something that you need to do to enhance Canada's position as a destination for innovation,
I want to know that. Let's cut right to the chase: Tell us what you need from us.
**Mr. Perklin**: I'll start. I'm sure each one of my colleagues will have comments. One of the things that would be beneficial to the innovation that my company is trying to provide to Canadians is the ability to open a bank account. When I am accepting funds from my customers in exchange for my services, I want to accept a cheque, but I cannot accept a cheque because my company has no bank account. I'm unable to do that. At the end of my tax year, when it comes time to remit payment to the government, I have no ability to write a cheque to give the Canadian government the money they deserve for the business I've conducted here in Canada. Instead, I have to have one of my employees write a cheque to the government on behalf of my company, and then I can reimburse them with bitcoin, because we cannot accept funds in any other way than cash. To answer your question specifically, Senator Black, one I thing I would love to see is the ability for bitcoin businesses in Canada to open bank accounts at our major banks.
**Mr. Hoegner**: I think we would very much appreciate the focus and ability of the crypto-currency ecosystem to focus on arriving at its own solutions and to see how this plays out in at least the short to medium term. Bearing in mind the changes that have been made in Bill C-31 and in the regulations that are forthcoming, I would love to see this committee understand what crypto-currency is, really get its arms around what crypto-currency is, and not necessarily make any policy changes at this point.
**Mr. Babin-Tremblay**: One outstanding issue is the taxation classification of bitcoin. The CRA classified it, I think, as a non-appreciating capital asset. Obviously, with Bill C-31, it's being included in the proceeds of money laundering and whatever the name of that thing is. You guys know.
One of the key dangers here that we have to avoid is to come up with some sort of double taxation scheme for bitcoin. If you treat it as a commodity, as for capital gains purposes, you cannot also charge sales tax and treat it also like a currency. That is one of the main outstanding issues that needs to be resolved: In which category does it fall for taxation purposes? I am sure Jillian has suggestions here, but from an entrepreneur, that's one of the important outstanding issues that needs to be cleared.
**Ms. Friedman**: I think Mr. Hoegner spelled out very well what I would have said as an answer. I would add approach this questioning in the spirit of competition between different technologies and institutions that provide financial services and in a way that is as technologically neutral as possible. If you look at different services being provided, it wouldn't be fair to say that an exchange that has the same risk of money laundering, for example, changing from euros to Canadian dollars, has to follow this set of rules, but an exchange using digital currency to Canadian dollars doesn't have to follow this set of rules. If the risk is the same and they are providing a similar function, then by virtue of the idea of technological neutrality, it should be legislated similarly.
**Mr. Babin-Tremblay: It would be the opposite road to take than what they have been doing in New York**. In New York, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, came up with a proposal for bit licences, which was negatively received by the bitcoin industry for a number of reasons, most of them being that they are not technology-neutral. They are imposing additional requirements to bitcoin companies to comply with. That will most likely result in the isolation of New York and businesses moving out of the state of New York into friendlier jurisdiction, because it is impossible to comply from a technical perspective.
**Mr. Pouliot**: The important key point is not to discriminate against bitcoin just because it is a different technology, to look at it from the functions and uses of what people are doing with the bitcoins. The community doesn't ask for much; I think I speak on behalf of most of the community when we say that we're not particularly inclined to go to government for extra help. But, for instance, some ministers in the U.K. have made positive statements regarding bitcoin. I'm speaking particularly of the U.K. where the minister of finance announced that he believed the U.K. could become a bitcoin hub. The community is receptive to government statements about bitcoin, so I think positive statements from our governments saying they think it's a great innovation -- and Canada does actually have a great potential in bitcoin -- just stating that fact, the symbolism of it, is enough.

TLDR: "We propose a new technology, pegged sidechains, which enables bitcoins and other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple blockchains.
It appears that we desire a world in which interoperable altchains can be easily created and used, but without unnecessarily fragmenting markets and development. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to simultaneously achieve these seemingly contradictory goals. The core observation is that “Bitcoin” the blockchain is conceptually independent from “bitcoin” the asset: if we had technology to support the movement of assets between blockchains, new systems could be developed which users could adopt by simply reusing the existing bitcoin currency"

You know a coma is not much different than a period?    "  Because of the confusion that can result in international documents, the withdrawn SI/ISO 31-0 standard advocates the use of spaces[12] and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry advocate the use of a "thin space" in "groups of three".[13][14] Within the United States, the American Medical Association's widely-followed AMA Manual of Style also calls for a thin space.[11] In some online encoding environments (for example, ASCII-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.

Maybe some additional insights here: 
The way blockchain.info fixes this is to FORCE the API user not to derive addresses beyond the 20 addresses of the look-ahead window. You can set a parameter to bypass this, but it still won't extend the look-ahead window.

When did I ever said paying airbnb? People can pay airbnb however they want and airbnb add the option to pay hosts in bitcoin.  The other way around is also possible but usually you'd want to get your profit in bitcoin and keep your expenses in fiat. Sice the credit card payment method is also used for easier identity validation that might cause a problem as hosts have much more to lose than guests.

(Personal opinion here, only tried the nano s.) 
I believe you'd get better security from using non application specific but dedicated device brought off the shelves,  combined with software more thoroughly reviewed like bitcoin core or maybe electrum.  You could also burn a live OS with persistence on a dvd after having installed a lightweight HD wallet. 
Personally i find the UX of the Ledger nanoS to be so awful compared to the more mature Trezor that it make me doubt the underlying code is secure or reviewed enough for storing large amount of Bitcoins. I have no doubt about their ability to deliver very strong security but for now I will let the test of time do it's work before using.

You just need a wallet that make it easy to set a custom fee. Also a wallet that allow coin selection can make the ordeal cheaper,  extra bonus if it can make your transaction RBF.  Electrum does all of that.  Bumping the fee for a transaction depend on the size of all affect  transaction combined.

Good question,
This is mainly a problem when dealing with business that guarantee you a quote for 15 min and a simple solution is to update the quote at the time of the confirmation. 
Right now almost every wallet allow you to create transaction with the unconfirmed funds. Re-Spending the change (when you are the sender) or the received funds (when receiving) with a higher transaction fee will have the effect of increasing the fee (averaging) with all dependent transactions. This is called Child-pay-for-Parent and is enforced by miners.
More and more wallet have implemented Replace-By-Fee. RBF allow to rebroadcast the same transaction but with a higher fee. (much more straight forward).

I think you're being broadly rude, There are many ways someone can get involved in a project like Bitcoin. Obviously you can't be arguing technical decision if you don't have sufficient technical knowledge.  A person owning coins can at least speak by selling his coins.

The clerk doesn't for 10$ but sometime does for as little as 2000$, it's also why the governments tries to get rid of cash.


So what ? There is zero or very little extra cost to do that with bitcoin.
If ever you mix your coin with the proceeding of an atrocious crime and you come selling those coins to me, there is a chance (depending on the crime) that your're not leaving the premise without going through some very thorough interrogation.  I can also decide not to buy your coins or do some further check on your whereabouts afterward without your knowledge.
Don't get be wrong, Coinjoin does increase privacy and does make investigation a lot harder if not completely cost ineffective, but remember; Bitcoins are NOT fungible and if your mixing your grayish coins with dark coins, your risk ending up with dark gray coins and be affected by that.
Even if something is 99.99% fungible and you collectively make up for the remaining 0.01% in your head it is still NOT fungible.

If you want to prove you own something in private, you make sure there is no recordings of the event. By letting Gavin use his laptop he would have had to trust that the key had been deleted from the laptop. Laptop are cheap too.

Here why not to use it over mycelium. 
Very stubborn at not wanting to let people use the btc unit to promote bit as the only unit. 
No way of having multiple accounts
Can't import or export anything else than the recovery seed
Can't set priority fee. 
Can't choose or even know which exchange is being used to fetch the rate for $ equivalent. 
I find the UI to be overly minimalistic and not intuitive.

Coinbase need to do heuristic KYC calculation on the receiving address before letting the bitcoin go. It might take 5 to 15 min or if the address has some similarity with an address used by a gambling site your bitcoin can be seized until you are proven innocent by a  court of law.

Every exchange has it's pro and con than you can try factoring in the price.
For example btc-e charge 5% to get any money in and so on.....
To begin with, it is NOT true that you can't withdraw from MtGox. You can at anytime remove 6-8% from MtGox to get an actual expectation of the price.
