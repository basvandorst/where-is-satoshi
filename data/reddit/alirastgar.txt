That's exactly what I'm saying. Blockchain community should seize the opportunity and highlights their version of the story too as world leaders and economic leaders will gather to discuss that. They shouldn't be passive that's what I'm saying.

I'm concerned that's what world leaders will be trying to do. But the Bitcoin community's worst response will be to stay idle. But instead, they should be vocal. They will have no say in Davos but they should be very active in other places during the meetings. That is a great opportunity and they should try to be heard as much as possible.

Thanks for sharing your ideas. I totally agree with you.
What I'm trying to say is that this is not something we hear every day: "let's talk about institutional reform so it fits today's technologies."
Bitcoin and blockchain community should also debate this topic to present their views as well. Ideas of bankers and politicians shouldn't be the only game in the town.

Bitcoin can't be the future if governments keep trying to regulate that. And that is the topic of the WEF this year.

This is the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019  overview:

The WEF overview clearly says " ... jointly shape our monetary and financial systems  by not only leveraging new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies ..."

At least the World Economic Forum doesn't agree. It has been a central topic for the last two years in the most important economic gathering in the world.
