I’m not sure why you’re commenting in a dead post about a scam wallet where the OP is now deleted. If you are curious about hardware wallet options I recommend posting to r/bitcoin or just look into Trezor or Ledger, the two main trusted wallets. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:54:59
If this company is serious about joining the hardware wallet market then they need to stop lying. Current wallets like Trezor and Ledger are not at risk because of their usb connection, and using bluetooth instead offers no real advantage in security (if they disagree then provide technical details).  Beware of any company that lies to smear their competitors, offers lots of glossy marketing without substance, and doesn’t back up any claims with technical details.

If you’re not looking at the exchange rate, then you’d want to look at the buying power of bitcoin. For example I could buy car A with X amount of BTC. Value cannot be determined by saying you can trade 1BTC for 1BTC.

There will still be services that provide loans based on risk metrics (proof of income, credit history, etc.) and have you sign documents that allow them to take the underlying asset back in the case of nonpayment. I suppose smart contracts could be used in lieu of paper documents. For unsecured loans there would be no underlying asset to recover so interest rates would be higher.  Basically the same model we have now except the loan would be in bitcoin instead of fiat.

Bandwidth isn’t the issue either. The limitation is that blocks of confirmed transactions are limited to 1MB every ~10min. Recently, the network has been receiving more transactions (see mempool) than can fit into the 1MB/10min pace of mining. That’s why we are seeing longer wait times and higher fees. Lightening Network is being implemented now as a second layer in order to alleviate this issue.

Pruning is already an option - I’ve run a node in pruning mode before. The scaling issue is NOT about blockchain size, it’s about the size limit  of each block and how that restricts the number of transactions that can be confirmed/mined per ~10min. For the record, I don’t think a block increase is the solution.

When there’s a crash in the stock market, people do often pull their money out and look for other stores of value, for example gold. Bitcoin hasn’t been around during a significant stock crash, but one of its major current use cases is store of value. Let me ask you this, what happened to the price of gold from 2007 to 2012? I wouldn’t be surprised if the same thing happened with bitcoin during the next crash, but only time will tell.

The government did not move silk road coin without private keys - that would be impossible. They either cracked his opsec or used coercion. The government doesn’t need to do this with traditional asset systems like banks - they just seize it. Again, you cannot move or seize bitcoin without the private key. If a person has bad opsec or cracks under threat of incarceration that is their decision and has nothing to do with the security bitcoin provides. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:51:00
What the actual fuck are you going on about? You can't break  secp256k1 cryptography. Period. The government did not 'figure out how to move it'. If he gave them the private keys under threat of incarceration or had bad opsec, for example kept it plaintext on his laptop, then they could have moved it. That has nothing to do with bitcoin security and everything to do with stupidity (something you seem familiar with).
If you think it's bullshit then prove it by moving bitcoin from the following address:
to this address:
I'll wait...
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:11:06
You’re just proving my point - the point of failure is not in bitcoin’s security or protocol, it is in the opsec of the person or their willingness to give in to threat of incarceration or worse. I said this above and he called it a “bullshit excuse”. But thanks for repeating my point. 
Any asset must have the ability for the owner to access it, therefore the owner will always have the ability to give that access to another. This is not a problem bitcoin attempts to solve - it solves the problem of a government seizing an asset without interacting with the owner at all. This happens daily in countries around the world where bank accounts are frozen and funds seized. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:51:25
What was said is funds are moved by the government, not exchange rate affected. Funds cannot be moved/seized by anyone except the person(s) with the private key. The statement holds true. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:30:41
It has nothing to do with the complexity of cryptography. Mining uses a hash function - not cryptography. The reason that CPUs can’t mine successfully is because ASICs can run the hash algorithm so much faster (over and over again) and they end up finding the target hash (a certain number of leading zeroes) before a CPU/GPU does. Then the race starts again to find a new block, and the ASICs win again. 
For more info about the hash function in btc mining:

Your frustrations have nothing to do with using bitcoin, and everything to do with converting between currencies using a third party/business and your bank.
 If all you want to do is send bitcoin from your wallet on your phone to a poker site, or vice versa, the process is quick and easy. 
I think a more accurate statement would have been how frustrating it is to deal with centralized money services like banks and coinbase.

You wouldn’t even have to use multiple wallets - most wallets are deterministic, using multiple addresses all derived from a seed. Usually a new address is used for each amount received for privacy.  The chart doesn’t (can’t) account for this, so there may be more people that own higher amounts of btc than shown, even if they only use one wallet.

I’m not sure why you think bitcoin requires more bandwidth as time goes on. The blockchain does get bigger with every new block, but what does bandwidth have to do with it? If you want to run a full node (rather than a light client like a mobile wallet), then you can initially download and sync the entire blockchain at whatever speed you want. Once it’s downloaded then it only needs to be updated with a new ~1MB block every 10min. Hardly a resource intensive task. 
If you meant disk space to store the full blockchain, space is cheap. The current blockchain is around 180GB and 1TB disks are common.

Bullshit. You’re presenting a false dichotomy - hold or spend. They are not mutually exclusive, I’ve done both. The money that would have been in savings was hodled, When I could make purchases and spend with bitcoin I did so. This is what people do with currencies, both save and spend. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:28:40
Stop posting this bullshit all over the sub. At this point you should be asking more questions and spouting off less misinformation. A PERSON CAN BOTH SAVE AND SPEND A CURRENCY SIMULTANEOUSLY. Or did you not realize people have things like a checking account AND a savings account?
Hodling refers to not exchanging bitcoin for fiat, usually during a price drop. It doesn’t mean don’t use bitcoin as a medium of exchange when possible.  Now, does deflationary, sound money discourage frivolous spending (when you could save instead)? Probably, and I think that’s a good thing. I know it’s had positive effect on my financial habits. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:29:19
Your ‘both sides’ equivocation is bs. The feud, as you put it, is a natural reaction to an attack on bitcoin through Roger’s fraud and deception. But bitcoin being attacked through an attempted branding takeover is, in the end, a good thing. If bitcoin can’t withstand an attack from a douchebag scammer, then how will it withstand an attack from nation states? When it’s clear the flippening isn’t going to happen and bcash is seen for the shitcoin it is, it will highlight the resilience of bitcoin and the importance of true decentralization.

If a hardware wallet arrives with seed words, NEVER use them. In fact, contact Trezor or Ledger immediately since having seed words already written down means your device/package has been tampered with.  Seed words are generated by the device AFTER you receive it, while initializing a new wallet. 
You suggesting that people use seed words that come with a device means either you’re ignorant or a scammer - either way, stop giving people advice.

While I agree with your first two points, your last point is bs. Whether it’s easy or not does not invalidate the complaint. By that logic, no one would ever have the right to complain if a company has put time and money into development of their product (which describes most companies). If we want decentralized mining then we need companies to make miners available to individuals. That being said, this is a company not a charity and I imagine their primary concern is profit. That doesn’t stop me from being disappointed that yet another mining rig manufacturer is making hardware available to big players before individuals, contributing to the problem of increasing  centralization in mining.

What’s to explain? Someone saw how economies around the world were becoming more and more intertwined and predicted a world currency would arise. They proposed it would have a central authority (perhaps descended from the IMF) and use monetary policy not unlike what we see with USD or EUR. 
Bitcoin has no central authority, is deflationary, and was created by someone(s) with a computer science/math background. 
What does this have to do with bitcoin. Not much.
