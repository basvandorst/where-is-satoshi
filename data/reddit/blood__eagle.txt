Not without anything that resembles an established market. But I get your point, it's just a useless calculation since there wasn't any market to speak of when Bitcoin was far under $1

You don't explain things once. Cause you don't understand the point of nodes, open source, or how bitcoin works. Jezus, is this the quality of all noob muppets that find out about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:48:59
And that's why nodes validating and signaling something else are 'fake' right? 
You should probably stick to penny stocks.

What, like a few weeks from now when Bitfinex ownership lands  in jail and $500 million in pretend dollar goes 'poof'.

"Exposed" by a public tweet-like.. yeah, real hard hitting investigative reporting there bud.

If you don't understand that ASIC/GPU install base is directly related to value in crypto then you need to just leave.

Oh dear, how dumb can a single person be. If you think who 'owns' a node has any impact on the node's ability to signal you might need to stop eating led paint.

5% fee is not really a ripoff for physical BTC transactions. These machines aren't really 'designed' to buy and sell massive amounts. Most people buy $10-$500 for more of the novelty. Using ATM's to accumulate large amounts of coin is and will always be a bad idea.

Only idiots equate reddit account age with anything what so ever. Pretty sure I have been active in crypto far longer than you for example. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:29:46
If you think that ASIC isn't responsible for a considerable amount of the value that bitcoin holds you simply don't understand enough to have an opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:26:14
You might be mentally slow with that comparison.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:25:45
POW change is the nail in the coffin for 'Bitcoin Core' or whatever that coin would be called. Absolutely terrible idea and if you don't understand why you should just leave crypto and not look back.

And by that logic I can sell 0.000000001 BTC to a friend for $500 and claim that 'bitcoin market cap hit 100 Trillion!' cause that's how or works right?
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:27:13
Should be called 'Coins stolen from customers, he he. See you later suckers. Best Bitfinex'
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:34:36
So when someone sets up 2x nodes they are fake, but when you set up core nodes they aren't? 
You don't understand how open source, bitcoin or nodes work. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:31:40
No it hasn't. It's an idiot calculation based on prices that never existed in any volume what so ever. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:42:44
"But since market is rational" hah..

There were several versions of Bitminter in circulation before mid 2011 before official release. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:33:26
People that doesn't understand opensource should't write PSA's

Amazon can also buy back their own shares before releasing information that affects the share price.
