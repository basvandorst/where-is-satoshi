no of course not.
 im just weary of those t&amp;c's.  i cant imagine theyre anything but water tight for this exact eventuality. its a pretty predictable occurrence, and i would be extremely surprised if the OP didnt have to pay the full amount. we'll see what happens i guess, but I wouldn't be overly optimistic. 
there's an inherent risk in this kind of trade. its not an official currency, its more like buying a product whose value fluctuates violently. does coinbase fulfill the contract by simply delivering the goods? 
now they havent done that (yet), but the OP is also sending them letters saying he is refusing to pay, which may be the reason for that. they might be calculating their next move before responding. we'll see how it plays out.

yes, but theres no stipulation that the contract will be void if they dont adhere to the time. they arent under any performance bond, merely giving the goods may suffice legally.
there are so many warning about the risks and the associated risks with bitcoins on the website and in the conditions of the contract.
he's going to have to pay the full amount either way, and if he refuses, i cant imagine coinbase will be too happy at all.

gotta read the terms and conditions of any contract.
sure its sly, but coinbase would be insane to do it any other way. buying bitcoins is risky, the risk bit the ass off this particular buyer. coinbase are providing a service, and if they ultimately deliver the goods, then thats that. there's no agreement that it has to be instant, it even says delays are possible on the site.
