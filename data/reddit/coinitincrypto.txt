It prevents your pin or seed from ever being compromised via malicious code or similar on your computer.
With the trezor my seed was shown to me once only, one word at a time, on the trezor device only.  It also interacts with trezor.io wallet and protects you in certain ways.  (ex.  my pin is shown on the trezor, and it's then entered on trezor.io wallet site using randomized blank buttons where the numbers would be on the computer screen).
It also shows your addresses or QR code via the trezor screen as opposed to your computer screen.
Supposed to be more secure against phishing scams and similar.
You still retain your seed on a piece of paper.  If you ever lose the trezor you can purchase another and restore your seed as you would a phone wallet.  The trezor is just an interaction tool.  Your funds can be restored elsewhere I believe should you no longer have the trezor, nor desire to buy another one.

I agree.  I think there has to be middle ground found before things get ugly.  I'm a bit of a pessimist though and do believe the USD and fiat currencies are on their way out.  How that transition takes place is the question...
I think Obama in the US expressed these concerns.  How do you even enforce basic tax law when everyone has a swiss bank account in their pocket?  Ultimately it's up to the people to obey.
They would have to torture someone for their private key.. or lock you in jail (which they will probably do if you remained in the US and didnt pay your share).
People could tell them to kick rocks and just leave, but you'd have to be 100% OUT of your countries dollar dominated assets, otherwise they would just penalize you in other areas...aka take your house, bank account, business, etc... If they haven't already enforced tax law through the use of a rifle or simply making BTC extremely prohibitive.  
Crypto Currency is a mere piece of the puzzle to become free.  Ultimately people have to stand up against their government as I think BitcoinBeanie is suggesting.  With crypto currencies the power has shifted slightly into the hands of the people.  Cash or gold under the mattress can be confiscated... private key in one's head is a little more difficult to "take".
Gonna be interesting for sure.  Cheers!

If you held the private keys yourself.  Yes.  You have equal amounts of both held before the fork.

Sound advice all around.  
There is always a chance it could be compromised in the hands of a 3rd party reseller.  Hell, there is honestly a chance it could be compromised directly from Trezor employee as well.  
That said, I'm pretty certain SQ deals is an authorized reseller.  They are said to be legit and safe.  I received my Trezor from them and it was in original box with seal.  So far so good.

That still doesn't have anything to do with OP's question.  The private keys still need stored somewhere and in some way.  
Mobile and hardware wallets are still only as secure as your safe storage of your private keys, or aka, your backups.
It's honestly a big hurtle in the way of mass adoption.  The majority of people don't care about their financial sovereignty and are not responsible enough to manage their own wealth (private keys).
This will lead to 3rd party services, aka Banks, which just circles us back around for the potential of customers' coins being "available" residing in a bank's safe keeping, which may or may not actually be there, leading to huge problems if there happen to be a run or mass withdrawal of said coins.  This may even be happening to a degree now to those who hold their coins on exchanges.
As with gold, if you don't hold it, you don't own it.
Will enough people required for mass adoption ever truly care about their financial sovereignty, and in doing so hold their own keys?  My guess, is no.. most will not ever care until they've already lost everything as a result of not caring.

How much tax are you willing to pay?  Are you cool with the gov taxing you 50% gains tax, 75% gains tax as their fiat ponzi scheme implodes as opposed to the 28% gains tax now?
If it takes ~25k dollars to buy a single bitcoin have you really "earned" anything, or is crypto just accounting for the expansion of currency?  What do those dollars actually buy when bitcoin is on the moon?
I hope to hold my crypto to protect from government debasement of fiat currency and until the IRS is abolished.  If bitcoin is worth 100k or 500k or whatever.. than it is likely that the dollar is dead or hyper inflating and the paper you'd be exchanging it for has limited purchasing power.  Do you even want those dollars at that point?
Cryptocurrencies are a way to escape the financial enslavement we all live in.
I guess it all depends on why BTC grows to huge levels and the current purchasing power of the USD against the BTC price, as well as the current state of the world.

Isnt there 100mil Satoshi in a BTC?

Seems as though many people don't realize this.  Despite the correction we're seeing now Bitcoin is still 450+% higher than the price it was last year.  That's pretty crazy considering the recent rally to nearly 5k.
I'd say this correction is expected and really overdo.  ... that certainly didn't stop me from trying to "buy the dip" at 4600, 4400, 4300, and 3850.  Doh!

Well, there is this thing called Purchasing Power, and a fuck load of it is being lost right now during this bull market correction by those who bought too high.
