Is this sub as censored as people say it is? Why?

Oh. Damn I didn’t know. I’ve just seen so many threads and so many people in the last 6 months talk about how ridiculous the mods are on this sub, I always thought, just over exaggerating but after reading that last post and seeing yet again so much support from so many people saying similar things I was like WTF. Even vitalik and CEO of coinbase previously Brian Armstrong apparently called out r/Bitcoin mods for their retarded banning or something. I was like if this is who we elected as our mods for the biggest crypto by far on the biggest community, damn we fucked up horrible showcasing. Hope what you’re saying is true and these mods aren’t that crazy lo

I mean ignoring the fact that 90% of people say otherwise just looking at your name how am I supposed to believe you?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:22:52
There’s a post on r/cc about how bat shit crazy fanboys the mods are that they ban anyone who mentions literally anything remotely negative about BTC. Please tell me this isn’t true..the sub with the greatest followers can’t be ruled by such delusional man child’s..

So is it as simple as I buy $500 of bitcoin today and they worth like 20k or whatever tomorrow then I sell them and make a shit ton of money? I’m confused and don’t know shit and this seems way to easy to make lots of money so I must be missing something

@_date: 2018-03-24 06:52:24
Finally some separation from Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:23:52
Is it true if I mention even names of alts this sub will ban me? Lol

Why do you want rwd?
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:44:46
Ya but where I’m from most of the year is shit ton of snow and ice so when people talk about getting cars it’s always “get awd or fwd”
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:51:22
Idk much bout cars that’s why I asked. The only thing I know is it’s easier to drive fwd in winters than rwd or something

Sooo when does it stop being irrational? When it finally gets to that magic low number you think it should be? In other words it’s irrational as long it isn’t the number you think it should be, even if it stays at such number for long periods of time, but when it finally is your number, only then is it “rational”?
Fuck me so many morons....
