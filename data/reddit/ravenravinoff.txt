I'm new to BTC and keep seeing comments like yours. Can you explain to n00bs like me your reasoning?
Thanks in advance!

I started syncing with the Bitcoin-QT network a few weeks ago. It was taking forever and someone suggested downloading bootstrap.dat torrent which I did. It worked great but now it always says it's syncing the last 3 hours but never catches up. 
What do  I do now? Am I done? Does Bitcoin-QT have to be running for me to use Armory?
Armory says this is my address to receive BTC: 14S8zUZwvRsuadmcXrv8hnCU261dnKkAs5
How can I verify that it's working?

Right on, thanks.

Right on, thanks.

A widget would be awesome. I've got [bitcoin checker]( on my tablet but I'd prefer yours instead.

Nope, but if it stabilizes and hangs out within a few bucks of a certain price (like it's done for the past week or so) that's fine.

Thanks. I've got them both running and Armory is 'Building Databases'. Looks like once that's done I'm good to go.

This just came out today due to a [FOIA request from Runa Sandvik]( privacy and security researcher, Forbes contributor, technical advisor to Freedom Of The Press and the TrueCrypt Audit project, involved with the Tor project.

Now you are legally obligated, by the Code of the Narwhal,  to use this [illustration of a BearWhale]( by Redditor in your report.

Not necessarily. For instance: I bought $140 of BTC the other day from CoinBase. But with their fees &amp; such I didn't actually 'get' $140. So I'm waiting until my coin is worth that (or more) before I spend it. That way any &amp; all fees are moot. I'd always do that if possible, of course.

Question: I'm downloading the blockchain for the 1st time. It says I have 12 connections. I've been downloading for like a week now and this is as far as I've gotten:  
This is what Bitcoin QT says about my progress: 
Am I doing something wrong? A setting I need to tweak? Or does it just take that long? 
I'm getting [43 down &amp; 4 up](

EDIT: For other n00bs like myself, the torrent is [HERE](
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:26:38
Yep, no change. Sounds like at this point I just need to wait it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-25 22:56:16
Thank you! Yep, it's working. Right now Armory is 'Building Databases'. looking forward to getting my 1st BTC!

I'm a big fan, and current user of Cryptostorm. On phone or would link. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:12:59
Interesting. Like you mentioned, when I pay w/ BTC I'll be planning on replenishing my supply.

Been a bit since I bought BTC but I think I'll be purchasing from y'all next time. Sick &amp; tired of coin cafe taking days and charging more than the value when I actually pulled the trigger.
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:42:29
Awesome, thanks!
