More like government regulation will shut down non-bank hubs through physically finding the servers or attacking them through ISPs. And KYC laws will be sure to make banks want to know who is transacting through the hub. Profit incentive for privacy goes out the window when you have your banking license at risk.
Bitcoin will still be pseudo-anonymous but when that Amazon purchase shows up at your address then its pretty easy to back track those Bitcoin back to you. You can still hoard your bitcoin anonymously, but good luck trying to spend them through a LN privately. Why don't you answer your own questions instead of shitting on my post? Or do you have nothing to add to the conversation?

It can be branded outside of Bitcoin. People are saying Bitcoin will be digital gold and LN will be a digital bank account. Bitcoin leadership seems to be going that way. The vast majority of gold is used to guarantee currency and debts between nations. I think current holders will be owning a piece of this. 
In the future, the vast majority of the world would use branded LN as bank accounts. Either issued by banks or governments directly, since they are the only ones who can fund large networks. So you will be using "Fed credits" or "Chase credits" for day to day activity.
I don't know enough about LN to guess if there will be real competition or if it will centralize like mining has.
Such a system will not be anonymous. It will be publicly anonymous but agents can easily track sales to you. It won't be government resistant because it is easier to shut down unlicensed nodes. Will the cost of running or the risk of running a node be worth the fees you can make?
I'm not arguing against this because unless efficiency increases, I think this will be a certainty. Capacity for trillions of transactions on chain a day seems impossible. But digital replacement of cash is inevitable.
