Funny that you bring up the Great Depression, which was largely caused by the Fed. The real problem was that the Fed inflated the money supply in the 20's, which led to bad investment decisions made under the influence of easy money and credit. The economic recession was necessary to correct the all of the previous malinvestment.
And its funny that the supposed purpose of the Fed was to stop these smaller panics that were occurring. And then less than 20 years later, we have the Great Depression. Of course it turns out that these panics were artificially created to provide some justification for the creation of the Fed. And now here we are.

It looks like you've bought the bullshit, hook, line, and sinker.
We don't need a central bank. We don't need a for-profit private entity to create currency and then charge interest on it. We don't need QE and the massive inflation it brings. And your analysis doesn't make any sense.


For example, this statement is completely non-sensical. Yes, if banks loan money to the private sector, then the private sector has that money. What's your point? The point is that it shouldn't be loaned at interest from a for-profit institution.
And I am not in a predicament, I'm very well compensated, with more work available to me than I can possibly do. Its funny that you tried to insult like that, though. So are you here to shill or are you just really misinformed? That's my only real question.

You can have banks without having a central bank. The power to issue currency should be vested in the people. This is possible and has been done before, but the central banking cartel will crush anyone who tries it.

The interest on bonds acquired with its newly-issued Federal Reserve Notes pays the Fed’s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6% return to its banker shareholders. A mere 6% a year may not be considered a profit in the world of Wall Street high finance, but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6% return are considered “for profit” corporations.
In addition to this guaranteed 6%, the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their “reserves.” The basic reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve is 10%. The website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system, this 10% held in “reserve” can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans; that is, $10,000 in reserves becomes $100,000 in loans. Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.8 puts the total “loans and leases in bank credit” as of September 24, 2008 at $7,049 billion. Ten percent of that is $700 billion. That means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least $700 billion annually – this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans.
The banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks’ interests protected by an all-powerful independent private central bank, even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers’ — for example, when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the U.S. economy. Among other special benefits, banks and other financial institutions (but not other corporations) can borrow at the low Fed funds rate of about 2%. They can then turn around and put this money into 30-year Treasury bonds at 4.5%, earning an immediate 2.5% from the taxpayers, just by virtue of their position as favored banks. A long list of banks (but not other corporations) is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks.
