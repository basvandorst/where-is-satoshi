Thank you!
How do you think liquidity will be affected by the change in policy re: virtual accounts?
Is it now harder or slower to get won to an exchange to buy crypto?
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:18:40
Yes, absolutely. The three quotes you picked are perfect. 
This guy is a self-leaking, self-seeking nut.

Can someone with more economic knowledge than I have provide some insight?
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:25:33
Right, the volume is pretty low overall, but what confuses me is why the surge in volume several days ago (which, relative to the whole, was tremendous) did not move the price. My admittedly basic understanding is that sudden changes in supply or demand will affect the price until equilibrium is reached.  Whether the surge came from thousands more people who wanted to buy that day or thousands more who wanted to sell that day, it strikes me as strange that there was an immediate supply available to soak up the demand and keep the price stable.

You almost reached for a federal document when you wanted insight into monetary theory?

The Wright brothers' innovation was not the wooden bi-plane, it was three-axis control, a conceptual breakthrough that, like Satoshi's work, elegantly solved a stubborn problem... and a concept which the Airbus 380 still relies upon.
Satoshi's conceptual breakthrough does not work without an incentive token.
Tim Swanson is proposing an airplane with two-axis* control.

Yes, I am asking why the tremendous surge in volume of shares traded the other day did nothing to move the price (in either direction), unlike the other two high-trading days.

Wright does not seem like a guy who ever says "Sorry".

The caption in one frame says "If you want to kill bitcoin"
Who is the "you" he is referring to?
Doesn't this imply that there is a debate within PBoC, and one side does want to kill bitcoin?

But miners will need CNY to pay their operating costs, won't they?

Is this evidence in favor of your theory?

There was a massive sell-off (down to 555 on Bitfinex) after the last couple of pre-referendum polls came out showing Remain in the lead.
There was a completely random gigantic green candle in the middle of the day on Thursday, right around when privately-commissioned exit polls were becoming available (and no doubt showing that Brexit was going to win).
I think that if Brexit had gone the other way, we'd be in the 400s by now.

There was a $650 between 9:25 and 9:30pm EST.

If the script language is not stateless, if it has access to any outside information that changes or varies between nodes, attackers can use it to fork the chain.  The only exception is if it is always false before a certain time and permanently true after, which is implemented with nLockTime.

Is this why Bitfinex has shut down for minutes at a time during recent breakouts?
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:20:36
Bitfinex then distributes to Bittrex and Poloniex and the others.

But isn't this just people buying BTC on a USD exchange (for the equivalent of 1882 CNY) to then sell on a CNY exchange for 1915 CNY?

Where do you see the supply decreasing? If you are referring to the blue line and tiny decreases in market cap, those fluctuations appear to coincide simply with the fluctuating spot price of Tether.  
Real redemption of Tether should involve the burning of a Tether tokens on the OMNI layer, which has never happened.

Is the conference being streamed or live-reported anywhere?

Hal Finney likely answered Nick Szabo's request for help "coding up" his bitgold idea.
My take is that they mutually decided on the pseudonym.

You should read the actual valuation. Of course 17m coins will *exist* in 2025, but it is unknown what percentage of them will still be hodled or not.

Can someone help me understand Figure 1?
$400 is mentioned elsewhere as the 12-month target, but is it also the 10-year target according to Figure 1? If not, then what is?

To the beautiful brown-haired girl in the yellow shirt, smirking at the climate change guy's comment around the 59' mark:

Can you show me where Tether tokens have been revoked on the OMNI blockchain?

"These incidents, among many more, have caused the value of the bitcoin to fall dramatically both in value and in public standing.
'I don’t like losing money,' said Boussi. 'It’s kept me from buying with Bitcoin a few times mainly because I didn’t want to spend my bitcoins on an item that’d be worth less than I actually spent later on.'"
Poor Moussa Boussi. The reporter clearly did not understand his quote about not liking to lose money.. He obviously was referring to spending a deflationary currency.

I'm confused by Figure 1.. Is $400 the 10 year target price as well as the 12 month target?

Can you share the source on Dec to Feb from the trustee?

Movement on the blockchain is not synonymous with market sell on an exchange. 
I have yet to see a reliable statement on how coins were sold.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:32:57
Right, but I think the Party has made it clear they don't want CNY exchanged for crypto.
I made the comment as a speculative warning, not a suggestion of what ought to happen. People who spent weeks buying cheap BTC during the 'lame-duck' period of the Chinese exchanges will sell to get USDT (probably dumping the price in the process so they can max their buys)
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:01:55
Quite easy to get Tether... sell your BTC at Bitfinex/Polo/Bittrex/HitBTC...

For a peer-to-peer Ponzi scheme. They guarantee 30% interest on deposited money, as long as you send it to people who request money.
See this guy's video, for example:

I agree that the demand generated by the MMM scheme must be a large factor, but are you sure that the surge is therefore fragile? It is not as if the scheme involves buying and holding BTC to get rich... it is actually getting thousands of people to use BTC for money transfer. They don't care what a BTC is worth because they just want to complete the transfer.
MMM has been growing for years, so, absent a governmental shutdown of some kind, it would seem that new users will be continually requesting bitcoins to use and the demand will continue.
Isn't this the rebittance use case being proven for us?

I wonder if the recent run-up has anything to do with U.S.-based buyers wanting to get the long-term capital gains tax rate (only available if asset is held for at least 1 year) ?
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:16:55
But the weird thing about Bitcoin is that it's utility as a digital value transfer vehicle is not affected by an increase in "price." If someone wants to transfer $500 (effectively in and out of fiat), it doesn't matter to that person whether it takes 1 BTC or .01 BTC to do that.
