A $80 shirt and $200 shoes seem cheap, specially compared to the other prices they are mentioning.
@_date: 2016-04-06 20:00:45


No, for trying to force an opinion on the rest. It should be the general actions of miners and users that decide the block size, not a few developers imposing a arbitrary limit. It is not that hard to understand, so please stop making strawmans of every comment I make.
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:23:37


They are not? In their own words they have claimed keeping the block size limit to 1Mb will help increase the fees (aka creating a fee market).
@_date: 2016-04-20 23:02:42
Actually I do. If you are in a remote area you can get creative on how you lay it down and do it on the "cheap".
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:40:58
That is a coup out, not an answer to my point.
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:28:37
Sure, but they mentioned it as a good thing, which implies that keeping an artificial limit and control prices that way is a good thing. That is exactly the thinking that Jeff is denouncing and you said did not happen.
@_date: 2016-04-06 20:32:32
Bitcoin, mainly promoted by the Core client developers, is changing from a free market model of fees to a more centralized decision model. Sure, people are still participating voluntarily, but the internal model is changing.
@_date: 2016-04-20 23:49:09
That depends on the country you live.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:39:28


This is absolutely ridiculous. Even building your own fiber optic through the country side to a well connected location would not be as much as the miners or the electricity over a long period. And you can very cheaply create very good wireless connections (see guifi.net).
As I said, comparing the cost of connectivity with the costs of mining is utterly ridiculous.

The citizens associations guifi.net has done it. You have pictures here of one of their installations: 
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:51:32
That is not the argument. The point is that giving a judgement value on a parameter influence on prices is bad, because no one should have that power. So saying prices should be higher we need to keep the limit low is bad and saying prices should be lower we need to increase the limit is also bad. Because the real answer is no human should be able to make that judgement.
That is the point about high priest comment.
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:51:29
The cost of mining is mainly the miners, not running a full node. You can even mine without running a full node by using a mining pool. What you say makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:14:57
Can you explain what exactly is wrong with what I said?
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:34:39
This is not true. A coffee should be or should not be settled on chain based on how economically viable it is to do so, not because you or I think one way or the other.
There is a technological limit as how much the blocksize can grow, and a cost associated to bigger sizes. That will be taken into account by miners as to whether they want to include a certain transaction or not. Assuming that you or I or anyone have the knowledge to predict if it makes sense to include a certain transaction or not is plain ignorant.

@_date: 2015-12-29 20:35:15


Yes they are.
@_date: 2015-12-24 09:44:17
There is nothing wrong with a fee market. Bitcoin design implies a fee market. Nobody opposes a fee market.
But there is a difference between having a fee market develop organically from technological restrictions and forcing an artificial cap. That's the point of the article, Bitcoin has always had a fee market, even if the fees were minimum because there was excess capacity. What some people are arguing for is to __increase the prices of said fee market__, not creating one. It is dishonest to say that you are trying to create a fee market when what you are trying to do is increase the prices of said market creating an articial limitation.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:09:24


Which is a big cost and even people who support small blocks make this point when they talk about the Great Firewall of China. So its not a little consideration without importance.


You do not need to eternally store all the blocks. Plus, even if you want to for whatever reason, the cost of storing blocks is not such a big deal, even with present technology. Solid state memory is dirt cheap, and it will only be cheaper in the future. Even people who argue for not raising the limit, do so because of the increase network delay that a big block produces, not because of storage memory.

@_date: 2015-12-24 12:11:51
They have been claiming that setting the limit at 1Mb is good because it will bring the development of a fee market. I am not going to spend time looking for the exact quote, but you will find it easily.
The article argues (and I agree) that the wording is dishonest. What they are really saying is that they support increasing the prices of the fees with an artificial 1Mb limit, because Bitcoin by design already has a fee market.

You are confusing, a private bank lending a private citizen savings to another citizen which is natural growth, the bank only acts as intermediary (earning a comission obviously), with the present central bank system that allows bank to lend as much money as they want (its more tricky but at the end thats what it comes down) regardless of the savings of the private citizens.

No. They can refuse to sell to you. They are forced to accept usd to settle a debt.
For example, if I go to a restaurant, eat and then refuse to pay in the currency they want, now I have a debt with them and they are forced to accept usd to settle that debt. But if I have a shop I can refuse to sell anything to someone that wants to pay with usd. In the second case there is not debt, so no obligation to accept usd.

Thats not correct though. The interest rates directly stimulate the amount of money in circulation and therefore will affect prices.

Not true. A lot of currencies did not collapsed but were just politically removed.
I dont see how you find so relevant the fact that we have now fiat currencies that are extremely young in terms of a human history timeline. Its exactly like the example you brough up. Every human in human history has died, but there are some humans that are not dead because they are still in the expected range of human life. When a human lives 300 years then that would be something to discuss, but until then saying that a particular human will not die as oposed to the rest that did, is either being delusional or requires some extreme and impressive explanation. Exactly the same with fiat currencies. The expected outcome is for the ones we have now to die like all the previous ones. If you are going to argue the contrary you are going to be called delusional unless you can bring some really extreme and well though explanation.

Thats why Im saying that if you want to steal this way, you want to do it as fast as you can, before they check.

Thats not what I said. But the overall result of the regulatory system is to favour big and politically connected companies hurting the consumer.

Ok so lets stop this stupid myth once and for all.
First, Bitcoin is going to get regulated no matter what, thats not a debate. But regulations are not needed to stop fraud, thats what natural law is for. Regulations are there to favour some players over others.
Also politicians and burocrats always appear friendly even when fucking you over because thats the most politically profitable attitude. People who dont understand an issue (the majority) offen sides with whomever __seems__ more reasonable. Thats also why progressive change in laws year after year is how politics operates. Politicians are just coming with a smile and they will just keep moving in the directions whoever pays them wants to move slowly and progressively.
This is what they are going to do no matter how much we complain, but we can not be so naive to think that the politicians that are voting one corporate law after the other are going to be sympathetic to Bitcoin just because they smile and say nice things. Politicians are just slowly stablishing their power and will keep progressively pushing like they always do. How Bitcoin and its community reacts is going to be the real key to determine whether Bitcoin will suceed or not.

If semantics is what helps avoid misunderstandings, you could take a hint of your own advice:


You can not be a murderer by not killing someone just depending on the context, because no matter the context, if you are being literal, murdering implies killing another person. The same way intrinsic value, as opposed to subjective value, is defined as having value independently of the opinion of a person. So no, something can NOT have intrinsic value, even in the context of particular needs or wants, because thats exactly what intrinsic value means.

How do you reconcile your view that banks hate regulation with the fact that from bank publications to bank directives have been asking constantly for Bitcoin regulation?
Also, how do you reconcile it with the fact that without regulation banks would not be able to issue as much credit as they can issue right now, when you admit its their main source of income? Could it be that banks love the main regulatory system that allows them to issue more credit than they could in a free market, but they dont like the regulations they have to obey so the abuse does not get out of hand?

If you are going to correct someone get your facts straight first. Banks ARE getting money from the central bank. They are not getting the money directly to make each and every loan from the central bank. But banks do get money from the central bank. If you understood when I said that banks get money from the central banks, that it meant that they go get the money from the central bank to make each and every loan then you understood what I was saying incorrectly.
Regardless, thats not the point, you are derailing. The point is that what you said is not inherent of fractional reserve backing, but its what happens when you add a central bank to a fractional reserve banking system.

We live in a central bank system and one central banker says banks are not limited by deposits. How does that contradict what I said? Why would you think pointing that comment would add anything to the discussion? This is why people who know economics avoid chartalists, its not some grand conspiracy, its that its difgicult to debate with you and infuriating to have the other person not even bothering to read the arguments you are presenting and just jump at giving you the same links and talkpoints again.

There is no money transmitter asset requirements. Assets requirements only make sense in the context of fractional reserve banking, because they dont hold all the assets people deposit but lend out a part.
In Mtgox case anything else than 100% reserves is fraud, with or without regulations., because thats the contract Mtgox had with its clients. It makes no sense to claim Mtgox problem was lack of regulations in regards of a minim level of assets.
Thats a common problem with people supporting regulations, that most of them dont really understand what they are asking for. They just heard buzz words and politicians promising stuff and go for it, with total disregard about the real consequences of what they are supporting.

That's not true though. If USA "progressives" realized that inflation is a shadowy and discoordinating way of taxing and that direct taxation only gives people more conscience on how much the service provided by the government cost and exert some control over it. That would be a reason to support Bitcoin for them.
But Usa "progressivism" is now forever tied to Keynesianisme so such an idea will be heavily fighted against. Because at the end Usa "progressivism" has always been about finding excuses to increase the power of government. If being racist increased the power of gov they were racist, if being anti racist increases the power of gov they are anti racist. Despite what their more naive followers think, USA progressivism has always been about increasing the power of the political and corporate classes,  that is the government. It's the reigning ideology but it's intellectually dead and has already reached its expansion peak. You can see the cracks everywhere.

That depends on what you define for a gold standard. The truth is the link to gold had already been losened with different laws. So it was not what the proponents of gold standard defend. Also, if you go and check the data youll see how the Fed injected as much liquidity as it could. You can argue not as much as you think it should have, but it definitively did not adopt a "do nothing" attitude as you seem to suggest.


I agree. I was mentioning it because its the example you brought up.


In general, currencies are investment vehicles, including fiat currencies like the euro, dollar, etc... There is nothing incompatible between being a currency AND a investment vehicle. Really, anything can be an investment vehicle, so being one does not imply anything for or against being a currency. I dont see how you think its one or the other.
And yes, Bitcoin was bootstraped from nothing a short time ago, so its still developing and not widely used. But I dont see how that makes it 'not a currency', when its used as a currency and at an incresing rate.


But the run on the banks during the Great Depression was due to the inflationary bubble the Fed created during the roaring twenties that ended up producing bad investment and the crack of the 29. Then misguided government policies prolongued the depression. Its just like the present depression where we have seen record number of banks go down, and the big ones have only survived because taxpayers and monetary inflation (which will have a cost) have saved them.
So I dont see how you associate deflation with bank failures. In fact, history records show that free banking systems, which tend to be price deflationary, are way more stable than regulated banking systems, which are majoritarely price inflationary.

Because you are human? You are also hard to talk with because you dont understand the concepts.

When people say that the free market will take care of itself, they dont mean that everybody can sit down and do nothing, what they are saying is that you dont need the authoritarian power of government but that non-violent trade and association between people can solve the issue. Do you understand now?

But that is a dangerous position as well even if your objective is only to become rich with Bitcoin and dont care about what Bitcoin was made to be.
Because at the end, Bitcoin is the most succesful private currency in the last centuries of human history because of its characteristics that show the unerlying political ideology of the people that created Bitcoin (even when people try to say there is not one to try to not to alienate other groups that might adopt Bitcoin). But if Bitcoin is watered down enough then there will be no point of using Bitcoin over a fiat currency. So if Bitcoin gets regulated to the point where anonimity is not possible, where there is not real decentralization, etc... then its price will decrease because a lot less people will have a reason to use it. So even if you dont believe in it ideologically, you have to be aware that Bitcoin success and therefore its price is tied to its capacity of fighting the fiat regime.

You are missing the biggest problem with a central bank, that it distorts the structure of production.
Even if the wages raised at the same level as the price inflation the central bank would be distorting the capital structure creating recurring crisis, like we see regularly. The interest rate is the price of money over time, and like any other price in the market is a signal that coordinates the economy. In the particular case of money the distortion of its price fools investors in the type of bussines consumers want, thus producing a distorted capital structure that will eventually produce a crisis, unemployment, etc... on top of the wasted resources and missed oportunities.
When you say "moderate inflation can be incredible useful" you are outright ignoring the grave effects of the distortion of the price of money or assuming its possible to centrally plan the price of money, when theory and history has showed price setting is an idea that leads to evonomic ruin.

Being passive-aggressive doesn't help your cause. It just make you look infantile. 
You keep ignoring the point. 
First, it's worth noting that if you are going to do some analysis of the blockchain it's better if you download the data from the blockchain directly and not from some third party (like blockchain.info), because the third party can contain errors. The only reason to not do that is if you are lazy and want the data as cvs directly. But any serious study would not do that.
More importantly, the point you keep refusing to acknowledge is that the study is flawed because assuming any address belongs to only one person is wrong. In fact we know some of the addresses with more bitcoins in them belong to exchanges, so those bitcoins belong to lots of people, not just one like the study makes it to be. The study is so flawed and stupid in it's assumptions that it's possible that Bitcoin wealth is either less concentrated than they claim or even more concentrated, because multiple addresses can belong to the same person. This issue was discussed in the early Bitcoin days and the analysis was discarted because the assumption was clearly seen as flawed. It leaves you in a very bad place that you are trying to defend it just because you like the conclusion.
I won't go into your game of adding new arguments until you properly address the initial ones. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:59:17
Maybe as a test. But they wont keep that policy forever if they gain any traction. And since setting your own Bitcoin wallet is easy and does not require any extra hardware that you dont need to use Bitpay and Coinbase, there is really no need to depend on a third party.
The only reason to use Bitpay or Coinbase is if you want part or all of your bitcoins converted to fiat instantly.

Thats what its happening now, yes (it's not what happens always though). But you were strongly arguing that the Fed does not give money to banks. It does. What the banks do with the money does not negate that the Fed gives money to banks.
And the above argument comes from your derailing. The original point, that you keep regusing to address, is that the fractional reserve banks do not inherently create money out of nothing, but it is when they are paired with a central bank that their limitations are much less restricted.

For starters is a very bad deal for you. You are giving something that can be highly profitable for almost nothing. Google is an adverstisement company that creates technology to get your private info and be able to show you targeted ads. That private information is highly profitable and you are giving it for almost nothing. If Google payed you a percentage of what it gets for that private info, then it might made sense to use their services, but just giving it for some easily replicable services is moronic.

You can not want it all you want, but that is irrelevant to whether it will or will not collapse.
Fiat currencies in human history have all collapsed. All of them. The average time of life for fiat currencies is 14 years. Obviously some die quickly, some take longer. Given the history of fiat currencies, assuming the dollar wont collapse like the rest is delusional. And the cracks are showing more and more. Whether the dollar will survive this crisis or not is anyone's guess. But despite not wanting it, you should be aware that the dollar collapsing at some point is the expected outcome given the history of fiat currencies. Believing the contrary requires either being delusional or extreme well-though and innovative justification.
And yes, the dollar collapsing wont be pretty short term (although its positive mid and long term), but again that does not mean it wont happen. The sensible and reasonable position is to he ready for it.

Holding your money is just a way for banks to get funds to invest. Bitcoin investment funds, aka Bitcoin banks, could have a future in the Bitcoin economy (they will imo).

Price is only a representation of value, not value itself. Details apart, the point I was making is that the labor theory of value needs value to be objective, but value is subjective, therefore the labor theory of value does not hold. Ive read some attemps of reconciling the labor theory of value with subjective value, but with all honesty they seem like a trying to fit a circle in a square box (edit: this includes Karson attemp). The issue is that the labor theory of value was created in an era when value was considered objective and it made some sense under that perspective, but its nonsensical once you assume value is subjective.
My point is not about profit, who works what, etc... its about the basics on what the theory is based on.

You are confusing the banking system with the central bank. There is nothing stopping a banking system around Bitcoin. One of the functions that a banking system provides is increase or reduce credit depending on the demand thus providing the flexibility you are claiming that can not be providing without a central bank.
And a central bank can not provide the service you say it provides because it is a centrallized institution and therefore suffers from lack of local information impossibiliting its mission and leading to wrong decissions.

Some mutualists have supported the labor theory of value. I dont see the theory of value as a moral issue, the same way gravity is not a moral issue. No matter how good you think a person is, if that person falls from a very tall building, gravity will apply and that person will die. In the same way, value is subjective, no matter what your moral intutition wants it to be. I see the labor theory of value as false, not as good or bad.


Consensus and participatory democracy are different, but I dont agree with any of those as a form of government. If some people want to associate under certain governance system, including voting, that's fine, but they still have strong limitations as soon as the size and scope of the association grows. A voting system can work for like minded people association with a particular and defined scope, but as soon as you expand those too much you start to ask people to vote on things they have very little knowledge and experience on. Human time and energy is very limited too so forming people in every issue is not realistic. Once you start asking people to vote on things they dont understand and dont have experience on, politics start. People vote out of sympathy, out of good rethoric, out of small parties private agreements, etc... basically politics.
Also, I like that different parties can decide to not agree and try their way. The world is uncertain, even the biggest experts get things wrong, and trial and error is still one of the biggest tools of progress. Letting people follow their intuition and try stuff is when they pour their souls and real efforts into discovering something. I feel from experience that discussing options endlessly and trying to convince a majority of people of your ideas stiffles this human tendency. Since people will always have different experiences from you, there will always be communications impossibilities and people will tend to agree with the most reasonable option, or the option that make them look good, etc...

I still dont understand how you define labor value if value is subjective. If you accept value is subjective, the amount of work someone dedicates towards creating a commodity does not matter towards its value, unless maybe for the person working or for someone with a special emotional connection for that person, and even then not that much. In general, its meaningless.


Because it depends on how you see an non capitalist economy developing. Bitcoin, as any money, does not make sense if you see a comunistic future, but it does for example in a market anarchist system.

Again, if value is subjective, how is the cost of producing an item, an objective measurement, value?
I think you are trying to insert through the rear door a similar concept of objective value, but using the rethoric of subjective value theory. That two people have agreed to a certain price is just a representation of a "collision" of the subjective valuation of two individuals, the buyer and the seller. When people use the term market value, they are just abusing the language. Strictly speaking there is not such thing as market value since there are as much valuations as individuals. What you are doing is saying that yes, there is all this individual valuations, but Im going to use this new "market value" as a real value and not just a way of speaking and define it as the price that two individuals agreed upon. Then Im going to get the cost at which one or some individuals produced a commodity and define it as a value too. But that is not what subjective value says, and in fact its in direct contradiction. It seems to me (and I could be wrong) you are trying to stablish again some form of objective valuations to shoe horn labor value theory.

Nothing has intrinsic value. Gold has no intrinsic value, food has no intrinsic value, clothes have no intrinsic value. Value is subjective. So stop using that concept.
Now, answering the important part, you can be repaid in bitcoins and if not possible judges usually use fair value, which is whatever they consider it was the market value at the time.

In economics, the price is not the value, price is a representation of value in a particular point in time and location for a particular person. Value is a though, value only exist in the mind of a person. Price is just a particular representation of that value. For example, not selling and thus not stablishing a price is also a representation of that value.


To stablish exploitation through the labor theory you are assuming value is objective and that is false. To convince me otherwise youd have to demonstrate value is not subjective (and saying is a capitalist conspiracy is not going to make it) or achieve a good explanation of the labor theory under subjective value.

In a free market, banks do lend the money in deposits, keeping just enough to repay people who want to withdraw. In a central bank system banks can avoid the limitation of deposits by getting money from the central bank, yes. That does not mean creating money without the limitation of deposits is an inherent characteristic of fractional reserve banking. Its that the central bank is a regulatory system that allows fractional reserve banks to do that.

Its a technicallity but a central bank creates money to mantain the interest rates at the desired target. But it does not matter since my point was that in the context I was using them interchangeably. And you trying to chew on that was going on a tangent that added nothing.




The interest rate is a basic indicator for anyone looking to make a new investment. I dont see how it can be argued its not.


And my point was not about the decrimental effects of the different distribution of the new money, that are real, but about the effects on the capital structure. Ive made this very clear. If you dont understand it just ask for clarification in the parts you dont understand, but stop going around the bushes.


It does solve the problems that the central planning of money by the central bank produces. Thats no extraordinary claim.


No, we are talking economics, not finance. In finance the capital structure refers indeed to the ratio of debt/equity, but in economics it refers to type of capital goods that exists in the whole economy and its intertemporal relations. The concept is 200 years old. I dont see how when talking about capital structure of the economy you could have interpreted it was the capital structure of a firm instead. I feel this is why you did not understand my points. Now that you are aware you might want to re-read them.

Yes it has. Bitcoin has been the most sucesful private currency in the last centuries of human history. No other currency that wasnt forced by a government has achieved something similar lately. I dont see how anyone would dismiss that.
At the end you have to understand that a voluntary currency like Bitcoin has to offer something a government is not willing to give you on his currency, because otherwise the currency imposed by force will prevail. So the best way to kill Bitcoin is to "tame" it and remove the (according to some) controversial culture that made Bitcoin how it is. If that happens Bitcoin is over, as there will be no real reason to use it and over time it will die.

You have left some of the more concerning issues out:
Brock said he did not know he was accused in the USA, but curiously enough left for a 2 year "vacation" to Spain just before the trials. Thats such a coincidence.
He had to pay one of the boys to settle, so there was evidence indicating he participated in one of the rapes.
But lets asume all of this was just his youth influenced by Collins-Rector, even when he was an adult when it happened. Lets say we want to believe he is really sorry about it, it was because of bad influences and its now in his past.
But then when he created IGE company he tried to scam his partner by not paying what he promised him, and when the judge ordered him to pay he tried to deny the payment so much that his partner got a restraining order against him.
There is also the fact that Brock always includes clausules to hide the alegations from all his setlements.
And then you get to him trying to get Mtgox with a proposal that was prone to leave creditors in a position where they could be scammed by the new management, that the japanese judge rejected.
The sexual part might well be a mistake of his past (or not, anyones guess), but the shady way of doing business seems to be a constant in his life.

I know you want to believe this but it's not true. Satoshi made political statements when realising Bitcoin.

This is not correct 100%.
First, for someone who does not know anything about Bitcoin, it should be noted that an easy way to accept Bitcoin in your fornt desk is indeed having a tablet with a Bitcoin wallet app. The tablet will need to be an Android one, since Apple bans any Bitcoin app.
Also, its not true that you will be able to use only one address, since you can generate as many as you want. F.e. one per day, one per hour, one per transaction, whatever you want. The Bitcoin wallet will create a 3D barcode with the address for you to turn the tablet screen towards your costumer and they only need to scan the code with their phone, click ok and the payment is done.
This way you save the fees that both Bitpay and Coinbase charge.

Bitcoin is intentionally decentralized, aiming at having no government, corporation or other central entity control it. That's an ideological design choice.
Bitcoin pays a price to accomplish decentralization: mining, as opossed to a more energetically efficient centralized database. But the cost is worth the benefits for the people choosing Bitcoin. I'm mentioning this to point out that decentralization is not some random simple accomplishment of Bitcoin, but a costly and very intentional design choice. And decentralization aligns with certain political ideologies and is opposed by others.
Same with (pseudo) anonymity. Same with the idea of a non monopoly currency.
Whether you want to keep saying you don't see it or not, Bitcoin design choices align with certain political ideologies and are in contradiction with others. It's not random that initially one of the criticism Bitcoin received from people in the opposition of libertarian ideologies was that while technically sound, it was socially inviable. Given how they though society functions, Bitcoin should have been a bust.
I understand that some people think that if we keep repeating that Bitcoin is neutral it will fool politicians, but its just preposterous given how very obvious is that Bitcoin design choices align with certain political ideas and in contradiction with others.

Two things:
1. Karpeles was not running in any case a fractional reserve, since it implies the consent of the costumers of having the funds reinvested and earning interest for the risk assumed. If what you say turns out to be true, Karpeles was commuting fraud, never fractional reserve.
2. To give more credibility to your theory you should show that at least 100k bitcoins moved between the start of the hack and the time Karpeles regained power, with bonus if they are old bitcoins. Because it is expected that once Karpeles regained control, the hacker could not remove any more bitcoins.
You should also note that your theory of having important bitcoin players helping Karpeles would explain why MtGox received the public support of very notorious old guard bitcoin members, the sudden and coordinated reaction to distance themselves of the disaster and why their attitude has always been: " its an unfortunate incident, there is nothing to do, let's move on" instead of reaching for the pitchforks, with public posts when no public information was available. Very circumstantial but it fits with the rest.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:47:47
Having consent from the costumers is a big difference. That some costumers might sign a contract with the bank without reading it does not change the issue. If you are going to argue that consent is a detail and both situations are similar, then you could argue that sex and rape are similar too, both is a penis in a vagina. Yet we put people in jail in one case and not in the other.
MtGox could not do fractional reserve. If the costumer funds were used it is fraud. You will have to admit that trying to dismiss it saying its similar to what banks do because the "only" difference is consent is disingenuous.

Yes I'm saying that Bitcoin design choices reflect a certain political ideology, but never that it was made solely for political reasons.
This is not the way I like to discuss things. I have given you at least a couple of clear reasons as to why, with no answer other than denying basic parts of the USAProgressive ideology. I'm going to leave it here. I hope you believe me when I tell you that I was not trying to attack or offend you, just have a rational discussion. It's legitimate that you don't want to believe some random internet person so please check for yourself whether a government monopoly currency is the standard USAProgressive position.
Edit: And one last thing. Initially almost everybody in Bitcoin was libertarian, with a bigger than normal percentage of anarchists. So if there is someone co-opting Bitcoin, it's the people who oppose libertarianism. In reality nobody is co-opting Bitcoin because Bitcoin is open.

Are you serious? It's one thing to argue that given what you know personally of Karpeles you think someone else within the company is at fault. You are entitle to your opinion.
But what you are saying about fractional reserve is false. MtGox could not do fractional reserve under any circumstance. Fractional Reserve implies that the costumers are aware the funds are being reinvested and accept the risk. In exchange for the risk they recieve interests on their deposits.
MtGox did not inform their costumers it was reinvesting part of the funds, nor did it pay interests. In fact, Karpeles himself assured the funds were there several times.
If Karpeles used clients funds it is fraud, __never__ fractional reserve. Even if Karpeles was not appropiating the money but trying to legitimately invest it, which doesnt seem to be case, it would be fraud and not fractional reserve because he was doing it without costumer consent. This is a sensitive issue for a lot of people and someone of the old guard should not be spreading false information, trying to justify a possible fraud as just an unfortunate but legal business decision.

Well, decentralization is not an objective of certain political ideas, but let's try with a less abstract idea. USAProgressive ideology says that currency has to be controlled by the government. Even conservatives adopted the same idea because of their influence. Libertarians (and not all) were the ones defending the viability of non government currencies.
Bitcoin is a non government currency explicitely designed to avoid government control. Explain to me how this design choice is not politically aligned with certain ideologies and opposed to others.
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:23:37


No. Government control of the currency was a well established and non controversial part of USAProgressive ideology. There was no inside movement questioning it. Please stop making things up because you don't like reality. Bitcoin design choices have a clear ideological alignment.
But as I said at the start, that does not mean people with other ideologies can not use it. Anyone can find reasons to use it. Bitcoin is open, not some private club. But using that to deny the obvious political motivations behind Bitcoin design choices makes no sense.

First, drop the attitude because clearly your comment has lots of errors. Ill try to point them out:


Having an dispute resolution and law enforcement system (judges and policemen) is not something that Bitcoin disputes. People using Bitcoin will need a dispute resolution system and Bitcoin has never pretended to substitute it. Legal enforcement and judges are still needed if you use Bitcoin.


There is a difference. When you sell or buy a corporate bond, you do so voluntarily. Nobody is forcing you to do it. Both parts enter an agreement because they want to, and once that has happened then it is when law enforcement comes in if the agreement is not uphold by some part.
With fiat currency there is no agreement. The government mandates a set of rules that you have to follow whether you want or not.
You can be in favor or against this, but comparing the situation to the enforcement of a voluntary agreement is ridiculous. Understand that you could also emit bonds denominated in bitcoins and you still would want to have a judicial and law enforcement system to uphold each part accountable. And btw this is your mistake, not Krugman's because he is just bringing corporate bonds as saying that they pay interest when Bitcoin doesn't.
Now that we have that out of the way, I was pointing that the fact that Bitcoin does not need men with guns for people to use it while fiat currency does means that the properties of Bitcoin are more liked that the properties of fiat currency, because otherwise it would not need mens with guns to impose it.
The issue then becomes whether you think people can decide on their own (as long as they are not violating someone else basic rights) or need to be told what to do with violent means if necessary.


The dollar is used as an investment more than Bitcoin in absolute terms (not relative to their market cap). If you think its stupid, go tell all the brokers in Wall Street that are making a very good living by using the us dollar as investment vehicle that "is stupid". Come go, lets see what they say.

Fractional reserve in the present system is even codified in the law and the law is public. You can go to the federal reserve system website and freely download the rules under which all the banks of de F.R. system operate. If you do you'll see they explain that the whole thing.
You can argue that fractional reserve is ethical or not, but that is a different discussion, because you can not compare what banks due to what Karpeles allegedly did.

Im not trying to antagonize you when I tell you that you havent understood what I wrote you. Your answer doesnt really address anything I said.


You come in pulling the old conspiracy switcharoo. It's not inflation that's the problem, it's now the structure of production!
My post is specifically talking about the effects of inflation. The problem is inflation and Im justifying it because of the problems it creates (distortion of the capital structure).
On the conspiracy acusations I dont even know where to start since I have not spoken of any conspiracy.
Ill try to adress some of your arguments so you can see how they dont adress what I wrote:       
- That the Fed has a political mandate to do something does not mean that they are not distorting the economy. It just mean they are legally capacitated to do what they do. I had to read your comment twice because I though I might have misunderstood your point. At no point have I claimed central banks are ilegal and I dont know how you have imagined that.
- That capital markets are looking for higher returns is what they do and I dont see how that is relevant.
I honestly dont really know how to answer because you have not adressed what I wrote.
To finish, Im not from the USA. You seem politically motivated in your last rant but you are misding the target completely.

You seem like a level headed person and not a troll, so you should know that it is standard procedure to accuse someone of some charges without any chance of proving it just to leverage those accusations iin another trial. Which is exactly what they did, they used the murder accusations to get the judge to deny the defense from having access to certain information before the trial.
Then after some time has passed the case will just be dropped. Ask any lawyer with experience in these cases, its a common practice. And since the government knows people don't know about these technicalities, they are using it to slander him in the public opinion court. Just wait some time and you'll see how they never move forward with those charges until finally they are just silently dropped.

Mark selling costumer bitcoins in his own MtGox exchange did not produce more fiat inside MtGox. There is the same fiat and same bitcoins inside MtGox, just in different accounts. To obtain more fiat for MtGox Mark would need to buy and sell predicting the market right, not just selling, which btw is what the commenter is correctly correcting in his comment about the other theory.

Because it would be terribly inefficient. Mining (and its associated expenses) is the cost of having a decentralized system. If you are going to have a centralized one, why do you need to mine? Just use a normal database.
Without decentralization the Bitcoin structure (blockchain, mining, etc...) makes no sense, because technologically there are much better options. What Bitcoin has over all these options is that these other systems can not be decentralized.

So the gag order has expired? Or are you hoping you are anonymous?
@_date: 2015-08-08 13:28:07
The price system, which money is a central part of, is an aggregator of information. It helps organize the economy. Let me give you an example:
Let's say you produce some machine and a part uses a certain mineral. This mineral is used in a lot of other sectors. Suddenly this mineral becomes more scarce (a mine closes, there is a war somewhere, whatever). How do you decide which sectors and how much get of the mineral now?
One way would be to get all the people from all the sectors that use that mineral, discuss their necessities and try to reach some sort of agreement or even consensus. But you can see the problem with this. The information of each sector is not readily available to everybody, people can try to lie and even without lying studying and understanding all the information is very time and energy expensive. Even without the natural politics that would develop, it would be a big mess. Now multiply this for every change that happens in the economy. So how does the price system improve this situation?
When a resource becomes more scarce the price rises. Now the industries that can substitute it for another cheaper mineral, will do so as to keep their competitive advantage. And the companies that dont, will have to either pass the price increase, possibly reducing sales.
Thanks to price signals, we have substituted what would be a costly process of politics and knowledge gathering, to a internal decision of each industry. They did not need to know what was happening with the mineral industry, they did not need to know what was happening in the other sectors using that mineral, they just needed to know their own business, because the price was aggregating the information of all the events happening and conveying that information in a simple number. It's worth noting that for certain circumstances knowing why the price is changing, acquiring more information than just the number, can add some benefits. But still the price system aggregates the essential information and allows to make quick decision with great efficiency. That's why money is not only a signal, but a very useful one.

Its not a specially bad time, because nothing very big is happening in Bitcoin space. This is normal development.
Also, historically the bitcoin price has behaved more as an asset than as a currency. When fiat currencies are in price deflation bitcoin price has gone down, like the rest of assets, not gone up as if it was another currency. So the drop in price is nothing surprising if you have an historical overview of the price movements.

You are so naive. In a regulated stock market layering happens constantly and nobody does anything about it. The reason is the only difference between calling it removing an order you dont want any more or layering is a subjective opinion, therefore regulators can ignore as legal activity any operation of the traders they think should be allowed anything and punish other competition.
Then you get some cases in the press and you believe the regulators are keeping the market safe.

You can receive bitcoins without being in sync, even without your client being connected at all, but you can not sent them. To send bitcoins you have to wait until your client has received the block that validates that you own those bitcoins, which in the case of recent transaction means that you have to wait until (almost) full sync. It makes sense that until the client knows that you own those bitcoins it does not allow you to send them.
If you dont want to deal with synchronization issues, use a client that dont download the full blockchain (but that depends somehow in a third party).

I am giving you that book as source because is considered by the majority of economists (not that what a majority of economists matters a lot) as the more accepted source for economic data during that period.

I dont see a lot of what you mention here.
But in general, get used to it. There will always be people trying to create hype, not only in currencies but in everything (a sport newspaper hyping a player because the editor is friends with the agent, a girl hyping her friend to the boy she likes, etc...). It happens in everything and it will happen in markets and specifically in bitcoin markets. We are humans, we behave like that.
Also, this dynamic happens a lot in markets because the reasons why something goes up and down are unknowable most of the time and the only thing you can do is speculate. It lends itself to people hyping stuff and getting away with it for a good while.
We are humans. Get used to it and learn how to ignore it.

Ah, ok. Thats not the attack that its usually understood as a double spend attack. As for what you are proposing you will have to ask someone with a deeper understanding of the Bitcoin protocol as to whether that is posible or not.
@_date: 2012-06-27 16:41:49
But that is not the issue here.
First of all, if people dont consume a specific good because they dont want it, the business should close. Otherwise you are creating waste by producing something nobody wants. I think we both agree on this.
Second, consumption is not what makes an economy run. Consumption is the objective of having an economy. You want to produce "stuff" and distribute it in an efficient way so people can enjoy "stuff" ("stuff" being goods and services). Consuming is the objective not the engine of an economy. The engine is the production and distribution system.
And to the point, that is not the issue here. What Freicoin wants to do is incite consumption for the sake of consumption, because coins will lose value heavily if they are not spend, not because people needs or wants what they are purchasing necessarely. There is no lack of money in any case.


As I said, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin or Freicoin, but anyways:
It is not true that there is lack of consumption because nobody has any fucking money. The iPad appeared on the middle of the crisis and Apple could not keep up with the demand. People wants to buy iPads but they dont want to buy more houses. When you have an economy that is overproducing houses and not producing other stuff that people wants (mismatch between what is being produced and what wants to be consumed) you obviously will have a decrease on consumption. People dont want to buy more houses (and that is a good thing). Until you dont produce the type stuff people needs or want consumption wont go up.
Now it is true that the credit freeze (and therefore a lack on the supply of money in respect to the demand) has not helped and that is increasing the effects of the crisis, but again a credit freeze due to the centralized banking system that we have would not happen in Bitcoin (and Im guessing neither on Freicon) so I fail to see how that is relevant here.
As an aside note, consumption is just an indication of the health of an economy, not a parameter you can manipulate to alter the state of the economy. Let me explain it to you with an analogy: If someone has an illness that is killing him and one of the effects is having lack of blood, just because you add more blood onto him (maybe aliviating a bit the symptoms) you are not healing the patience. He will still die, although the blood circulation readings are now fine. Same with consumption. An increase of consumption is an indication that the consumers are finding "stuff" they need and want and therefore an indication that the underlying problems are bieng solved. But just because you artificially increase consumption by monetary means or increasing government spending it does not mean the economy is getting better. For example, thats why Japan went through the lost decade and still has been suffering problems even after despite of all the mesures they took to increase spending.

There is not much difference between present dollars and greenbacks.

First of all, the legal definition is only relevant in a legal context. In an academic context for example the legal definition is irrelevant. In economics and in general the definition of money has been always " a means of exchange". Bitcoin fits that definition.

Yes you can. But first, I want to make clear that you are mixing theories. The regression theorem is a theorem based on the subjective value theory. If you consider value objective, then there is no need for the regression theorem. The regression theorem only makes sense under a subjective value theory.
Now, back to the regression issue, you just have to look at reality. What happened when Bitcoin was not money yet? What happened when nobody was using bitcoins as means of exchange? At that time, people were still mining and keeping them, therefore they valued bitcoins. So bitcoins had value before being used as money.
The question you might have now is why were bitcoins valued before being money? From my own experience and guessing on the reasoosns of the rest of the people mining and keeping bitcoins back then, it was because of the entrepreneurial vision of how what Bitcoin could accomplish.

Remember that the price is not a function of the mining hash rate. This means that the price has no direct reason to follow the hash rate.
The price could go up and made the mining rates viable or the other option is that the miners would become unprofitable and some of them would have to retire until the reamining miners are profitable again because there is less miners among who distribute the rewards. Bitcoin incentives are very well created so it auto-balances.
Mining is not free money. Mining can be unprofitable, like any business it has risks.

Nevertheless during the majority of the time there was price deflation and an increase of investment and consumption.

But that would only make sense if there was an artificial conversion rate between bitcoins and us dollars. If the rate is allowed to freely float, it will reflect the present market value of each currency and therefore the effect you mention will not happen.
For example: Day A where 1btc = 5usd, an apple costs 1.5btc or 7.5usd. Day B where 1btc = 6usd, an apple costs 1.33btc or 8usd. People dont have any incentive to use one or the other because of their market value. They might prefer one or the other because one is more convinient or other reasons, but not because of the change of their market value as you are arguing.
The effect you are describing, that economists call Gresham Law, does not happen unless there are some artificial restrictions between the exchange of the currencies. There are a lot of examples in history of this phenomenon. Does it make sense now?


Fractional reserve banking takes the monetary base and increases it creating what we call the money supply or M1 (not M2 as you wrote, I think you misspelled that one).
What I said is that a fractional reserve banking system without central bank does not increase the supply of money (meaning M1) in respect to the demand for money __over time__, that is it does not inflate the money supply. It keeps it stable in respect for the demand for money.


I was suggesting "Monetary equilibrium theory" not "equilibrium theory". Google it.

First, I would recommend a more humble attitude because clearly you have no much idea about banking and finance. Its important to remain humble and not be aggresive to show that you are eager to learn and want to have a civil discussion when you are asking for information from another person.
Second, wikipedia is not a good source (in this case wikipedia is correct but thats not the point).
Third, I have not downvoted you, so I would appreciate if you dont downvote me either.
What Wikipedia is saying is that fractional reserve banking multiplies what its called the monetary base (also named M0 usually), increasing the money supply because it multiplies the monetary base by what it is called the fractional money multiplier. In a free market fractional reserve system, the multiplier is not constant but oscilates around certain values in respond to the demand for credit. So as long as the monetary base does not inflate, because the multiplier remains constant around a range, the money supply remains constant relative to the demand of money. Or in other words the money supply oscilates around a closed range and does not inflate indefinitely.
The only way to inflate is for the monetary base to inflate, which is not controlled by fractional reserve banking.
So yes fractional reserve banking increases the monetary base, multiplying it by a certain percentage, but that does not mean that it increases the money supply over time (inflating the money supply) because the multiplier moves around a closed range (in a free market system, when the government introduces regulations like in the present system it depends on the regulations).

You can always return the bitcoins to the address where they came from, because that is public information. The issue is that you dont really know if the address will still be under control of the person that donated to you.
A person could have used the address once and then got rid of it. Another could have transfered the bitcoins from a wallet or similar service and therefore the address never belonged to him/her, in this case you would be returning bitcoins to that wallet or service, not to the person that sent them to you.
Basically, if you know or make sure somehow that the donations came from an address that the person who donated controls, then you can. Otherwise not.

What happens is that the IRS does not care about small value barter. In their webpage they actually say that you should not report barter of under $2500 value. But Im sure that if you start moving a lot of money in Bitcoin and alledging barter they are going to care.

Hahahahaha, Im not sure if this is serious or satire.


This is false. Most gold standard systems had fractional reserve, so the same process happened, and also a lot of "so called" gold standard systems where government imposed standards with special regulations to allow expansions of credit independent of the gold reserves (F.e. in the XIX century after the civil war, banks could create notes with government bonds as backing in addition to their gold and silver reserves).
It feels like this writer has taken a 30 hours finance course and decided thats all she needed to know about finance and economics.




This is false again.
Money is indeed created the way she says, but its not the only way. The central banks monetize government debt, which is a direct injection of money to the government and equivalent to the government printing money. So his first statement is wrong.
I could go on correcting mistakes but its really not worth it. The writer needs to humble herself and learn some finance and economics.

Actually his points about deflation are the most ridiculous of all the article. What he says directly contradicts what we have seen in history.

1) Yes. Bitcoin can be seen as a distributed p2p database. Your keys (whats inside wallet.dat) give you access to modify certain parts of that database, which translates to you sending bitcoins to some other address. Whether you have a client online or offline it does not matter.
You could have a client online if its not too much trouble for you, since it helps the network. I have a server at home and have the bitcoin client always on with a day to day wallet with a few bitcoins, while I have my savings wallet offline.
2) Yes, thats enough. But I would not recommend it, because at the moment the bitcoin-qt client (the "official" one) and as far as I know the rest of the clients, do not allow you to select the address from which you are sending bitcoins. So when you send bitcoins the client decides by itself which bitcoins it will send. They could be from one address, from the other or a combination of both. So while theoretically if the client allowed you to select the address you could do it as you explained, right now its not possible. Your best bet is have the anonymous address(es) in one usb, and then have the non-anonymous address(es) in your computer (as day to day wallet) or in another usb.
One note more: Having them separated has the advantage that its easier for you to have multiple anonymous addresses with your anonymous bitcoins spread over them. This way even if you make a mistake and someone reveals one address belongs to you, all or most of the rest of the addresses will still be anonymous. If you only use one anonymous address and that address is compromised for some reason all your anonymous bitcoins are compromised and not anonymous anymore.

The demand to hold the currency is one of the biggest indicators of the health of a currency. If no one wants to hold the currency, the currency dies.
In the case of Bitcoin the demand comes from its characteristics and the possibilities those characteristics offer. In the case of dollars, or other fiat currencies, it comes from government laws. But in any case, if the demand disappears for whatever reason, the currency dies. So it is a big deal.


First, this is not the case here.
But just for the argument lets analize this scenario. What you just wrote is a myth, promoted by certain ideologies. I can show you several examples in history where a country with a non-inflationary currency (that is price deflationary) had its consumption and investment increase a lot. In fact, when the price of bitcoins where rising a lot merchants were reporting an increase of sales that stopped and reversed when the price of bitcoins was falling. Perceived lower prices (that is nominal lower prices) make people spend.

From the point of view of the state, any trade that does not include its monopolly currency is barter. For example, when you pay something with bitcoins, for the state, a barter trade happened.
If barter did not pay taxes, nobody would use the government currency.

You have not, you've just said that I did not have point. I would appreciate an answer. I layed out a brief criticism of the analogy, you can keep trying to shuffle around or answer and say whats wrong with what I wrote.


If you adopt a neoclassical approach of only looking at equilibrium, then
obviously demand is being met at the equilibrium points. But if you adopt a more "modern" (and by modern I mean what keynesians and austrians tried to solve in neoclassical economics during the 30's) you will take into account the disequilibrium process, what happens between the two equilibrium points. During that period demand is not being met and that is why price is rising.
Obviously once the new equilibrium has been met demand is met, but if you dont look at disequilibrium then keynesianism (which is basically the ideas your are using) does not apply either. There can be no deflationary spiral if you dont look at disequilibrium.
Seriously, do you even realize what you just said?

This is false. State money has always have figures and portraits of people that the state wanted to promote along with other nationalists symbols. But private money has had much more diverse art, including pictures of day to day activities like having a portrait of a house or a farmer working the land. Idealizing specific figures is always the first step of nationalism and thats why state money has always promoted that kind of art. Bitcoin should not. The art of Bitcoin, if any, should reflect its p2p and distributed nature.

I dont know about the program you mention, but Im guessing it does not allow for several currencies (and even if it allows it), the best way to handle bitcoins is probably counting them as an asset.
Imagine your bussiness changes 5 computers for a motorcicle. You would have to pay sale tax if there is one where you live, but you dont count what you get as profit, not until/if you sell what you got. Same with Bitcoin. You would have to pay sale tax for the transaction (if there is one), and only count as profit what you get when/if you sell your bitcoins, not before. Basically treating bitcoins like another asset. For the government,  any kind of money that its not its fiat currency is an asset, so when it comes to taxes its the best option.

There are other basic mistakes in your writting. For example, you mention that fractional reserve in Bitcoin will partly relieve its price deflationary nature (apparently you think price deflation is bad for some reason). Fractional reserve for itself does not create inflation. I can show you several historical examples on how fractional reserve banking kept the monetary base in check with the demand for money. It is only when you combine fractional reserve with central banking that inflation happens. A central bank is obviously not an option in the Bitcoin economy therefore your comment about fractional reserve is erroneous.
Also, its a basic concept that value is subjective.

Yes, private banks are in charge of their notes and creates them as private beverage companies are in charge of their drinks and create them.

The Federal Reserve system, whoever it benefits (and I think we are in agreement here), its a mixed system but mainly governments.
Just because you say that the Federal Reserve benefits this or that, does not make it private. With the same logic you could argue that all part of the government are private...

I believe its how the client was designed but I am not 100% sure. The idea behind it is to make it more difficult to trace your bitcoins. Imagine you have an address with 100btc and you sen 20btc to someone else:
1. If you send the 80btc left to a new address someone trying to trace the bitcoins will have to check both addresses and their ramifications in the future because only looking at the block chain there is no way to know if you sent 20btc and kept 80 or sent 80 and kept 20 or even if you sent 20btc to someone and 80 to someone else. Since its all done in the same transaction there is no extra cost associated (the fee, if any, is the same).
2. If you send the 80btc back to the same address now the person tracing them can be sure you sent 20btc somewhere and kept 80 under your control (at least).
Note that it does not make it impossible to trace your bitcoins but it makes it extremely more complicated.

The fact that someones tries to fool someone else its not the fault of the creators of the currency. You have to show intention to counterfit. If I go to some very dumb person and try to sell him a pepsi cola as a coca cola and I convince him because the bottles are very similar and they both end up in cola, is that pepsi's fault? No, you would have to show that pepsi cola created the design with the intention of fooling people.
In this case, the government just found an excuse to shut down liberty dollars, and if that would not have been a viable option they would have found another one.

As I said earlier, Bitcoin is both a commodity and money. Since we agree its a commodity (a weird one by historical examples though, but as it is everything digital), Im going to focus on money.
The definition of money is being a means of exchange. From the definition we can see money is a function, not really a intrinsic characteristic. Something is functioning as money or it does not. In history we have seen tribes using tobacco as money, and therefore during that time and in that community tobacco was money. Right now tobacco is not money. Nothing has changed in the intrinsic characteristics of a tobacco leaf, but it is money or it is not money depending on the use it receives. If it is being used as means of exchange at some point in time in a community it is money, by definition. Otherwise its not.
*In fact saying something is money is a bit confusing. If we wanted to be more specific we should talk of something functioning as money or not.
Therefore, right now Bitcoin is money (or its functioning as money) because people are using it as means of exchange. The curiosity with Bitcoin is that its only meant to be money. So if it stops being money it will probably disappear (unless some other use if found in the future).

Bernanke did say gold is not money and my previous comment agreed. My remarks comes from the fact that Bernanke did not say gold is not money because no government had a gold backed currency. Do you see now what I am pointing out?


If you want to discuss what is money it is a matter of semantics, so you need to discuss semantics in this case. The definition of money has been agreed for centuries, its not something controversial.
The fact that some governments set up legal barriers to avoid gold being used as money and compete with their fiat currencies, does not change that if people start using gold as means of exchange, even despite those laws, gold is money. If people dont, then gold is not.

Consensus. Everything in the Bitcoin protocol operates by consensus.
Specifically to your question, the client determines the difficulty of the blocks it accepts as valid depending on the speed at which the blocks are being aproved (and that is determined by the hashing power). The client aims to have on average one block every ten minutes.
What happens if some clients adopt different rules? Then Bitcoin would split in two networks with each a set of rules. Whether one would impose and the other disappear or the two would co-exists is something that would depend on particular circumstances.

Bitcoin exchanges are private companies that allow to change bitcoin for dollars and dollars for bitcoins, just like any other exchange in the world, for example like the FOREX where you can change dollars for euros and euros for dollars.
The issue is how to get your dollars to MtGox to then change them for bitcoins. Here is where different companies come into play, like Liberty Reserve or bitinstant. This companies will allow you to get your dollars from your bank to MtGox, so then you can change them for bitcoins.

Not all types of transactions generate a new address, so you dont need to back up every 50 transactions. Receiving to an already existing address does not generate a new address, so you dont need to count it.
The only two operations that generate a new address are:
1. generate a new address (obvsiously)
2. Sending bitcoins (because the change is sent to a new address in your wallet).
So every 50 (or what you think appropiate) of these two is when you want to back up again.

You dont want to see it. I have pointed out how with only one product and one currency the relations between them dont behave the same way as when there are more, and therefore any conclussion achieved through the analogy does not hold any resemblance of what happens in reality.


Its true the price will rise, but the demand is not being met, hence the increase of price. If the demand was being met with an increase of supply (therefore mantaining monetary stability) the price would not change. The fact that the price is rising (as you yourself have pointed out) means the new demand is not being met.
As you yourself have pointed out elsewhere also, this produces a lack of currency for people to trade. The point is that under a system where Bitcoin is not a monopolly, substitutes will be used, allowing for trade to continue and at the same time reducing the demand for Bitcoin cash and stopping the deflationary process.
Note that you are contradicting yourself:


You are contradicting yourself by saying that people will be able to access Bitcoin in the supposed case of a deflationary spiral, because you have said elsewhere that during a deflationary spiral people can not access to cash to trade.

In computer engineering getting too ahead is usually a bad thing. When someone tries too hard to prevent problems that have not already appeared, it usually ends up badly because it complicates the protocol and it makes it more difficult to solve the real unseen problems that the future brings. Its usually better to keep the protocol as simple as posible and to solve the problems when you see them coming, not problems you imagine. You would not believe how many projects become unmanagable and even obsolote because of over-engineering.
Bitcoin is fine now and if there are problems of scalability in the future its better to attack them when they come with the technology available in the moment.

Not necessarily. In a Bitcoin economy, because there can not be a central bank, banks would have to compete in a free market (at least more free than right now), so they would have to work harder for lower benefits.

It was implemented in the original bitcoin software as a way to prevent the problem op is describing.

Basically the paper is arguing that since a bunch of bitcoin transactions come from the same address and then meet again in another address they come from the same person. This assumtion is what produces the assertion that 70+% of the bitcoin are owned by 5 or 6 people (or something close to that).
The author of this post is arguing that this assumption is wrong and therefore the conclussion is wrong too. The assumption is wrong because there are other cases that would produce the same behaviour, for example web wallets that store the bitcoins all together. Basically there is no way to know if the bitcoins belong to only one person that moves the bitcoin around to try to hide them (for whatever reason because there are better way to hide them) as the paper assumes, or they are part of web wallet (or services using a similar infrastructure, like a exchange) and therefore belong to a lot of people who just move them around to pay for stuff.
tl;dr: The paper makes a wrong assumption, therefore the conclussion is wrong.

Once you send or recieve fiat to or from the exchange account the government knows you are dealing there. I dont see how Tor changes that.
Also, the Tor exchanger will have to colaborate with the government because otherwise it will get its banks accounts closed and their business ruined.

Yes, they have at times. What does this have to do with my comment?


It is not true that gold and silver only served manking best interest when barter was still part of everyday life. There are numerous examples of gold and silver "working" 200 years ago.
The issue is that governments imposed certain gold standards (or silver standards) but usually they were degraded standards where the government (or a few government licensed entitites) could by law overextend. For example, in the USA durign the second half of the XIX century (just after the civil war) there was this law called the National Banks Act which allowed the banks opertaing under the National Banks system to emit notes identical to their gold and silver backed notes but that were backed by government bonds instead. Obviously this was done to provide cheap funding to politicians so they could spend more. There were other laws that affected the banking system greatly, but people still call that a gold standard. There were several panics and crisis due to this legislation.
During the same period in Canada there were not similar laws and in general the banking and monetary system was much more unregulated. They operated basically with gold and silver. The system was much more stable, and its also called a gold standard.
But again, I dont really get your point.

This is not correct. Since a central bank returns its benefits to its government, when the central bank buys government debt it is equivalent to the government printing money.

This is a myth. It does not hold, theoretical nor empirically. I can show you several examples of history of economies under non-inflationary currencies producing price deflation with a continuous increase of investment and spending.


Another myth. The objective of an economy is to produce what people want/need. There is no point of producing and consuming what people dont want/need. Innovation, entrepreneurship, producing new stuff that people want/need,... (call it however you want) is how an economy develops.
Encouraging production for the sake of production is just wasteful (and pointless).
In the extreme of the myth you have communist Russia. They had increases of GDP because the government ordered production of stuff (not consumers through demand) and then consumed (or directly wasted) what was being produced. Yet people lived in miserable conditions because the economy was not producing the type of goods and services that people really wanted/needed. Wasteful consumption is just wasteful.

Yes, but the problem is that in a free market where there is a competitive currency and banking system the deflationary correction stops. But in a regulated banking system like the one we have know, where the government has created a money monopolly and a banking oligopolly (there are no banks outside the Federal Reserve system) the banks dont react to the demand for money because they are bankrupt, thus creating more deflation than needed. Hayek called this the secondary deflation. So the primary deflation is benefitial and corrects mistakes, but the secondary deflation, produced by the situation of the regulated banking system damages the economy.

You have not addressed my points. It would be nice if you did and point where you think Im wrong. In any case, I will answer to what you are saying:


Yes, unfortunately Im familiar with it. People have read Krugman's blog or books and they think they know economics after reading that analogy.
The main problem in that analogy is that there is only one type of product and one type of currency. Therefore any variation on the currency market will affect the unique product market. This is not how a realistic description of a real economy. An economy has an almost infinite number of types of products. Also, unless the government imposses a currency monopolly, there are different types of currencies.
There are other problems on the analogy but that is the obvious one.


I do think you should be a bit more modest and dont tell people that have given you a reasoned answer that they need to think more.
Why would anyone use any other currency than Bitcoin if it is appreciating? Because in a deflationary spiral there is a cash demand that is not being met. That means people can not access Bitcoin cash to pay stuff they want. Therefore they will use whatever else is available.
Note that the use of alternative cash will reduce the demand for Bitcoin cash, stopping the deflationary process.
Again, this happens because Bitcoin is not a monopolly. Im guessing you are used to the reasoning of currency under a government monopolly only. In that case, you are correct that people will not be able to use an alternative and the deflationary process will continue. That is one of the several problems a goverment currency monopolly produces.

Because deflationary spirals are the result of the impossibility of a monetary monopolly within a region to respond appropiately to the increase in the demand for cash resulting from the collsapse of a bubble (which in turn is produced in the first place by the inflation that comes from the monetary monopolly).
Since Bitcoin is not a money monopolly its near impossible to get to that situation, and even assuming for the sake of the argument it got there people would easily be able to use substitutes (since Bitcoin is not a monopolly) avoiding the deflationary spiral.

Ok, first thing you need to do is know if the first transaction made it to the block chain but to a different address, in which case it means you mistyped and your 1btc ended up in another address (so you just donated 1btc to someone or the void) or the transaction never went through because the network did not received it.
To check you need to go and check your original addresses and see if a 1btc transaction happened. If it did, its lost as I said. If did not happened then it just happens that your Bitcoin client needs to learn the transaction did not happen. It would be weird because when this has ahppened to me the Bitcoin client tries to resend the transaction every 30 minutes or so if it did not work the first time, so if you have not tried, try leaving the Bitcoin client on for a few hours and see if the transaction gets sent again. If this is not the case, there is a command to reset the transactions locally and get the data from the blockchain again. This command will allow you to recover the 1btc. I dont remember this command through, you will have to use google.

Remember the money in one address means nothing. The address could belong to a company holding bitcoins for other people and therefore those bitcoins would not belong to a single person. Or several of the addresses could belong to the same person and therefore one person alone would have more money than the largest amount in one address.
Basically address concentration of bitcoins does not tell you anything at all about the concentration or distribution of weatlh.

In central bank systems there is a central system that tracks the accounts of the debts between banks. But even this is not necessary since a decentralized network of banks would be enough since the rest of the banks would stop making business with a bank that tries to cheat them.

Not only modern definition. Being backed by government law is the old and historical definition. The word "fiat" comes from Latin and means "by decree, by law" (check it on an online dictionary).
What happens is that historically gold (and silver and coper) was chosed as the free market currency and governments that tried to impose their currency by law tried to use paper money as currency (sometimes transitioning before onto a government gold standard so people would not refuse the ultimate move to paper money) so they could print as much as they wanted (or allowed). Thus some people started associating fiat with paper or non-backed money and non fiat with gold or with backed certificates. Here is where the confussion comes from.
But the only definition that makes sense is government imposed currency. Because if you go by the definition of being backed, then gold is a fiat currency, since gold itself is not backed by anything. Only certificates are backed by something else (tipically gold or silver).
Bitcoin is the opposite of a fiat currency.

You can give him the address, you dont need to be connected or sincchronized to receive money. The only thing, back up your wallet.dat file because that is where your private keys that allow you to access your bitcoins are.

This is false and a myth that Ive seen around a lot. Its inflationist propaganda. Let me explain you why it is false and it is actually the other way around.
All your reasoning is based on the idea that banks and rich people have their wealth in money. If this were true what you say would be true. By devaluating the money you would devaluate their wealth.
The problem is rich people dont have their wealth in money, but invested in different assets. In fact, rich people have more debt per capita than poor people because of the level of leverage they use in their investments. So by inflating the currency you are not devaluating rich people wealth, but actually offering the opportunity of becoming even richer because they have access to the best experts on investment and speculation and therefore benefit from the increase on asset prices that comes with inflation. So by inflating the currency you are acutally making the rich richer and the poor poorer.
The banks issue is a bit different. I can comment on it if you are interested.

Then you dont support democracy. Democracy is a type of government. If you support organizations that vote thats not a democratic system.
Again, you stated that one of your objectives was anonimity. I was just pointing out that your system is not anonymous. If you dont want your system to be anonymous, fine, but then you should not state it as one of your goals:


If your objective is not to keep the person anonymous, but to keep the vote secret, I dont think your system acomplishes it neither. Since the issuer of the addresses knows who got each address (because it needs to verify identities to stop double voting), it can check who voted who by following the transaction from each address.
I dont think Bitcoin is specially well suited to implement a voting system. People always proppose stuff but fall short. Maybe another type of cryptographic system is better suited, or maybe someone will come with a valid solution using Bitcoin. Anyways, I think it needs more work.

 Bitcoin is not by any stretch a ponzi scheme. People who say so have no idea what they are talking about.
If you wanted to accuse Bitcoin of being some kind of fraud, the closest thing would be "pump and dumb". That is buy an asset (usually a low traded stock, therefore volatile), talk it up and once its gone up because of the hype youve created, sell it making a profit and leaving the suckers with he loses. But with the main developer of Bitcoin telling to people that Bitcoin is experimental, a risky investment and that nobody should invest what they are not ready to lose, I find it hard to make the case.

Not really. Except in the USA, in the rest of the world liberal means what the USA knows as "classical liberal" or libertarian.
The issue comes from the 1920's. In the USA liberal was used to mean the same as in the rest of the world, social freedom and free markets. FDR run against Hoover promoting social freedoms and free markets. FDR criticized Hoover for increasing government spending and said that if he won he would return to a free market policy to solve the crisis. But when he got to the government he did not go through with what he promised during the campaign. He continued and extended Hoover's policies of government intervention.
Thats the point in history where the "liberal" policies changed from free market to government intervention. They should have ditched the word liberal, since his policies were not liberal. But the word stuck and thats why you have this kind of strange situation where liberal means one thing in the USA and a different one in the rest of the world. The USA coined the words classical liberal and later libertarian to reffers to those policies.

Bitcoin has indeed some hurdles to overcomes (lots of them to be honest), but the ones given by the article are bogus.


The link is about the history of TradeHill and Dwolla. But I dont see why you would automatically blame the lack of chargebacks on "Bitcoin" and not the existance of "chargebacks" on the US dollar associated banking system. Specially since in reality the issue was a breach of contract by Dwolla.


Yes, and US dollar associated banks get robed, digitally too, and nobody claims the dollar has to overcomes hurdles because of this. Shit happens, and shit will happen in dollars and in bitcoins.

Basically that. One of the two ways the new money comes into the economy is as loans and the banks have the oligopolly on credit granted by the government.
Also, while some claim that inflating helps the people in debt (and this is true) the big benefiritaries are banks because they get their money back even if its a devaluated value. Otherwise people would not be able to pay back and would default completely bankrupting the banks. People get confused by this point because they argue that getting devaluated money  from their loans is worse than getting full value money. And while that is true, those are not the options. The options right now the banks have is get back devaluated money or people defaulting, so obviously inflating is the most benefitial option for the banks.

They can not mean floating value because gold, silver and anything else also has floating value. As you said, they usually means not pegged to another commodity, but that presents a problem: under that definition gold and silver themselves are fiat. The only ones not fiat are backed notes (obviously). So the definition does not make much sense.

Generalizing a bit, people with savings in the government currency but mainly people with a wage.
The issue here is that if you have government currency and spect inflation you can always get rid of the government currency and hold some asset that you think will appreciate thanks to the government intervention. But if you have a wage you are fucked, because you can not scape.
The answer is usually: but wages actualize with price inflation. And this is true, but they dont actualize as prices are going up, they actualize with a big delay (in most countries they actualize yearly). So, while prices are going up and your wage remains untoched your purchasing capacity is decreasing in favor of the people who is using the newly printed money (or the ones who are ridding the bubble it creates).
Its also worth noting that the mechanism to calculate price inflation, the number used to actualize the wages, has changed since the 70's in the western countries several times. The changes have always gone in the direction of understimating price inflation producing a inferior increase of the wages. Whether this changes are correct or not would be a long debate, but I think its interesting to note that none of the changes have produced higher increases of wages, all of them have produced lower increases of wages. Even more curious, is that this changes started happening after the 70's, when the governments of the western countries, cut the last relation of their currencies to gold and started heavy inflationists policies.

What happened is Dwolla, their dollar transfer provider, cheated them of $200.000 (or a similar amount). What happened exactly is Dwolla assured them when they received a confirmed status on a dollar transfer they could assume it was confirmed. But Dwolla confirmed the funds very quick, way quicker than any other service. It was a bit strange but everybody assumed they had a special method since they were assuming the risks (or so Dwolla said, including in their webpage). But later on TradeHill discovered that Dwolla was changing the status of old and confirmed transactions without saying anything to their clients. TradeHill discovered it when they started missing funds in their account and revised and compared the Dwolla statements. MtGox later on confirmed they had the same issue. Dwolla refuses to take responsability (since those funds were from people who were cheating Dwolla by doing a chargeback on them) and unilateraly decided it was going to pass the cost to the clients. As far as I know the issue is not resolved yet and TradeHill is still threatning to sue Dwolla.
Soon after this incident Dwolla changed to a more strict policy when accepting dollar transfers and changed the conditions in their webpage.

Go to the page, look for the offers, decide what you want to buy and do it. Then send the money to the bank account you are provided, and once the money is received the other person should free the bitcoins for you to receive them. There is the theoretical chance that once you send the money you dont get the bitcoins, but then the other person still loses the bitcoins, so it does not happen. At least, I have been using that page for a while and have never had any problem.

The thing is the "ownership" is not really an ownership. The local Fed's have stocks owned by commercial banks, but those stocks are not normal stock. They can not be sold and only provide 33% of the voting rights. The rest of the voting power is in the hand of the different governments. Would you call Coca-Cola a private company if 66% of the voting power belonged to the government?
And thats only the local feds, that only execute the orders provided by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, which is a federal government agency and its members are selected by the president and approved by Congress.
Thats why I think saying the Federal Reserve is privately owned is incorrect.

The Bitcoin protocol allows to send a transaction with chargeback, but its not implemented in the client.
To be clear, this does not mean the client would be able to recall any transaction. The client would be only able to recall a transaction that was created with this option and only within a limited amount of blocks. Also, I believe the receiver would know if the transaction has chargeback option or not.

But to have a protected Bitcoin network you dont need all the power on all the time. Imagine Bitcoin becomes a widely used world currency and therefore the demand to hold bitcoins is very high producing a high price. There could be one or some Bitcoin insurance companies that, for a fee, could guarantee your bitcoins against double spend attack. The insurance companies do not need to have all their hashing power on all the time, just enough to keep small thieves in check. If they detect a sudden surge in hashing power and decide is a double spend attack they can fire up all their hashigh power and once the attacker gives up turn it off again.

Its the miners and people running the client who decide what program they run and therefore what protocol the Bitcoin network is operating under.

But if at some point for whatever reason this situation changed and people started using another client the present developers could do nothing about it and could change nothing.

Again, what you are saying is:
1) Place some message in the blockchain.
2) __Later__, release to the web special encoding that transform said message into child porn.
According to you the result is the message is not really child porn because the date in the blockchain was before the released date of the encoding program and therefore, by definition, is the other way around. Is that correct?
Now, explain to me how is this different that someone releasing a decoding algorithm that transform certain parts of the present blockchain into childporn? Are you suggesting that depending on the word of the person releasing the decoding algorithm there is child porn or not in the blockchain? If he says the algorithm came later then by definition is not really an algorithm and therefore its not child porn. But if he says it was created before then there is child porn...

What I said is correct. You are just misrepresenting my words. I already said engineers working for government agencies created the protocol, but the commercial push that made what the Internet is today came from private companies.


This is not net neutrality. The law you are refering actually benefits carriers because it reduces competition and raises the price of the service. You can see in the early XX century when the first version of the law was approved how prices went up and a lot of local companies had to close. Curiously enough, the law that was sold as defending the consumers (as always) was not demanded by the consumers but sponsored by Bell, who had been losing marketshare since they lost their telephone patent.


Of course it is not, because the government is in the business of deciding who gets to be a carrier and who does not. Its funny that the USA has a regulated telecommunications system, yet somehow some people manages to overlook the facts and blame every problem on an non-existing telecommunication free market.




I just read your link. It does not say what you are trying to say. It shows how the regulatory system does not help the consumer but helps big companies. And that is exactly the system you are proposing (btw, who do you work for?).
You can use all the rethoric you want and be disrespectful but it does not change the fact that when the government regulated big companies profit at the expense of the consumer. And that is exactly the system you are proposing.

Argetina government has been printing currency like crazy. When prices have started to rise first they started chaging the way they mesured prices to understimate the effects and started blaming sellers acusing sellers of raising prices and being greedy. When private parties started to point out the obvious and published their own price indexes, the government sue them to stop them from releasing the information. Since people are now starting to get away from the currency because of the rampant price inflation, the government has started to implement capital restrictions so people can not abandon the national currency for other more stable ones and have to suffer the debasment.

This is actually a pretty good illustration of why increasing price is a good thing.
This person wants to sell his bitcoins for another currency (which he has all the right to do), in this particular case for dollars. But since he is not sure if the price of bitcoins in dollars will go up or not he is staying with bitcoins, hence increasing the demand for bitcoins and decreasing the demand for dollars, which is a positive for Bitcoin and negative for the dollar. It shows that if the dollar was not imposed by force it would not be used at all as a currency and would die.

Also, while the local branches of the Federal Reserve have private stockholders it does not mean that they are private entities. First of all, it has to be undesrtood that the monetary power resides mainly in the Board of Governmors of the Federal Reserve, which its a federal government agnecy, and also a bit in the FOMC, which has a majority of the members of the BoG. The local feds execute the orders given by the above mentioned parts of the Federal Reserve system.
But even if that was very importnat, the local branches are not private, despite having private stockholders.

Exactly the same as in an unregulated market. A Ponzi scheme, once it defaults, is in breach of contract and therefore can be sued and the person committing fraud has the potential to go to jail and have his assets taken.
The difference between a regulated market and a free one is that the free market will allow you to do whatever you want and only act afterwards, while the regulated market promises to detect for you the Ponzi schemes in advance (in exchange you have to give centralize power to a few people). But we know by experience this promise is void since they keep happening anyway.

If what you say is correct, how do you explain the numerous historical examples of societies that have run growing economies for decades decades with price deflation.
@_date: 2012-08-04 07:20:56
The deflationary spiral is not a myth, but it gets misused because it does not apply to all deflationary situations. The typical arguments against deflations are flawed (basically bullshit), but the deflationary spiral exists.
The deflationary spiral happens when there has been an overexpansion of credit that has produced a distortion on the price system leading to malinvestment (we call this a bubble). When the malivestment is discovered the bubble pops and the credit contracts suddenly because the banks are bankrupt (the overextension of credit was not profitable but the contrary). This obviously wont happen in a Bitcoin economy since it only happens in a regulated banking system, such as a central bank system for example.
@_date: 2012-12-30 19:31:33


And this is where you are wrong.
While the particular circumstances that humans are facing are different, in some cases even radically different, the way the world works does not change so radically. For example, just because you change planet does not mean the planet is not going to have gravity (obviously according to its mass). The same way just because the technology, the culture and world political situation changes does not mean that the problems of, for example, knowledge or economic coordination are going to disappear. Sure, economic coordination will happen between different types of production systems and radically different type of products, but the issue will ever be present.
Just because technology changes you can not claim that the knowledge learnt about how the world works is obsolete. The issues that Keynes and Hayek discusse are as present-day as they can get and will be for a long time Im afraid.

And to add to this, when you send bitcoins new addresses are generated. They are not generated when you receive bitcoins. So if you send bitcoins to someone a new address has been generated in your wallet.
But you dont need to back up every time a new address is created. The Bitcoin software (the one you downloaded from bitcoin.org) creates an excess of 50 addresses when its created and keeps using addresses from that queue. So when you backup your wallet you have a pool of 50 unused addresses. So you basically have to backup your wallet when you have used 50 addresses.

No. Regulation did not create competition as you said. Regulation created an oligopoly that punished consumers, and a change in the regulatory system made the situation a bit more even, but as in any regulatory system it was changed quickly to acomplish the objective of regulations: Help big business.
In a free market it would not happen because its impossible for the government to regulate.


I dont see the issue. Decades ago it was questioned if competition could be efficient to create big telcom infrastructure and some argue that government monopolies were the only way. Experience has showed that competition has produced better results everywhere. As an extreme example, in Somalia, when the government collapsed and despite their desperate situation, in very few years several telcom companies appeared and offered the lower international rates in all Africa (despite the markets in other countries being regulated, alegedly to help consumers).

I dont understand what you mean by "creates the premises for inflation". If you are implying like in the previous comment that it could, then its a wrong view, because without a central bank (and a central bank is impossible in Bitcoin) fractional reserve does not expand the money supply over the demand for money.

Well, but thats the thing, economics, which is what Hayek and Keynes are discussing is not much more specific than that. Yes, they debated about how an economy works, and that imply discussing about economic coordination for example. The topic might not interest you but it is of capital importance. Think for example at how a lot of academics were surprised that the people in the Soviet Union had to make queues to get bread and market oriented societies having bread available cheaply and on demand.
Any new system proposed that disregards the adquired knowledge as to how economic coordination can be achieved is going to make the same mistakes, just as an engineer that ignores Newston or Einstein ideas is going to have a hard time producing anything.
Guess what, every charlatan that wants to awe you, will start saying that its a new era and the old does not apply, that you have to think in a different way and bla bla bla. It has happened at every time in human history. Just because technology and political power changes it does not mean that suddenly human societies are not limited and affected by the same fundamental factors as any onther society has been. Gravity will keep affecting people, and the need to achieve economic coordination and the problems it entails will keep happening no matter what. If you ignore the knowledge we have adquire for centuries on the issue you are just going to make the same mistakes someone did previously again.

Just to clarify, nothing is redeemable by itself, because that, by definition, is being non-redeemable. To redeem you need two different stuff, the "coupon" and the object you redeem.
As I said, Ive heard that definition before and thats why I was telling you it made no sense. If you follow it you arrive to absurds or have to twist the meaning of words to make it appear like it works.
The historical definition of fiat is mandated by law. In fact, "fiat" comes from latin and means "by decree" (check the modern definitions: 
The problem is some economists (luckily not the majority, only some) got confused because governments imposed fiat currencies (that is currencies that had to be accepted because of some law) to scape the discipline of commodity currencies (like gold or silver). So they asociated fiat with paper and non-fiat with gold and silver. But the real definition of fiat money is whether it is imposed by law (by decree) or not. It just happens that because of several reasons, fiat currencies tended to go away of gold and silver and gold and silver were used as non-fiat currencies.
This way you can have fiat gold currencies, in fact they have existed. For example, when the USA government was enforcing a (sort of) gold standard, that gold standard was fiat, while free market gold standards are not fiat.
This definition is the historical one and also its coherent and it makes sense.

Ive been a Bitcoin supporter since the start, but my question to you is: Why are you trying to set a currency for your island and not just allow people to use whatever they preffer as money? Maybe people will end up naturally using bitcoins or maybe something else.
The issue here is if you guys choose a non-ideal currency the costs of going into it and then going away from it are going to be high andlikely to take a hit on the project confidence. By allowing people to freely choose the currency they want to use you make the process have a much more soft transition as people will probably try different solutions and will have real life experience when they decide to settle with one (or several).
Suggesting several options, like Bitcoins, gold, silver or whatever you believe its appropiate might be positive, but why decide on one fixed currency from the start? It will make for a much more simple and smooth transition if you let people try and decide what they want to use as currency.
That said, I do believe Bitcoin is very useful and could find its way into the island if someone provided a simple solution for people to use. The main advantage over gold and silver certificates is that it does not depend on a central authority and therefore the counterparty risk is highly reduced.

The central bank system relies on a government imposed monopolly on money and a government imposed olligopolly on credit. The central bank is the institution that the government designates to manage the monopolly on money and regulate the olligopolly on credit.
Answering specifically to your question, how many banks in the USA (or in any other country with a central bank system) do you know that dont belong to the Federal Reserve system (or in any other country to its central bank system)? They dont exists in any meaningful size because the benefit the banks that belong to the central bank system get are so big that its impossible to compete against them. One of the main benefits the banks get is access to cheap credit through the central bank, which allows them to offer cheaper credit than a bank not belonging to the system and relying only on savings of their clients to offer loans. The price to pay for this cheaper credit is obviously inflation, but since the effect is slow and delayed on time, the population does not catch on the costs of cheaper credit. You also have FDIC, government validation, etc..

I agree with this, but this is just empty speech that demagogues use, because it can mean one thing and the contrary. Im not shooting at you, dont take it personal, Ive heard this sentence from a lot of corporatist economists and you are probably just repeating it.
If you want to be pragmatic and diminish the size of this completely out of control and hypertrophied financial system, you need to get ride of the privileges the governments grant them. For example removing the government granted oligopoly on credit that the banks hold through the central bank system. Remove two laws (legal tender laws and forcing people to pay taxes in only one currency) basically taking all the power from the the central bank, and see how the big banks loose their power and influence and become servicial and fight each other to please you.

In economics, equilibrium is just an imaginary concept used mainly for pedagogy.
You can imagine the market as having an equilibrium, but when the people receive the signals and try to adjust to reach that equilibirum the preferences of the same people have already changed and therefore the equilirium is now in a different place. The people receive the signals and try to adjust to the new equilibrium, but while this is happening it has changed again... and forever.
You can imagine the market as a process where people is trying to get to a ever changing equilibrium that follows people's ever changing preferences, but because its constantly changing its never achieved.

Also, there is no added security. Since you are exchanging fiat for bitcoins, in the process of adding or removing fiat to or from the exchange you would have identified yourself.
The processor also has to be identified because he needs to have a bank account to recieve and send fiat.
There is really no point in having a fiat-Bitcoin exchange as a hidden Tor service. Once you are inside the Bitcoin economy you can be anonymous (if you know what you are doing), but if you interact with the fiat system you will be identified.
@_date: 2012-08-19 06:29:38
You are though, if they want to be pesky. Your bitcoins are traceable.
Remember, Bitcoin is only pseudo-anonymous. Basically, its only anonymous if you work on making it anonymous. In this specific case, if the IRS have access to the MtGox data they know where you spent your bitcoins, because they can follow the trace in the blockchain. So they can make you liable for whatever they might be able. Most probable the IRS will consider a bitcoin transaction barter and barter has to pay taxes.
The problem is not Bitcoin, but the fiat system. And once Bitcoin becomes in contact with the fiat system it stops being anonymous. MtGox is the perfect example.

And Bitcoin is very catchy, in part because how it sounds, simple enough, and also because it evokes what it represents: they are coins but in bits(digital)!.
Sure, once you try to delve deeper the analogy does not hold and might be even counter-productive, but that is not what the name is for. The name has to be catchy to grab the attention of a person overloaded with new stuff everyday and very little time. And Bitcoin does that fantastically.
Your name of Bitium or how says Ethereum, are weirder and much less familiar. They seem to belong to something very complicated.

True, but the problem of basing decisions only on correlation without knowing or discovering the inductive cause that produces them is that the underlaying causes that are producing the correlation can change at any moment and, since you dont know them, you will take a bad decision expecting the correlation to keep happening when its not going to.

It honors you.
The key here is not looking at the total of the debt. It is to look who gets to pay the debt easily by getting the new money first (hint: politicians, their corporate buddies, and the bankers), and who gets the money last and gets screwed (hint: us).
The other key: my whole exposition on fractional reserve banking relies on the premise that person B makes a sound investment that produces benefits so he can repay the loan. If that is not the case and he does not sell whatever he produces (in my example food) then the whole thing falls down, since person B has to default on the debt, and then the banker is in trouble because it can not return the money to person A.
And why do we see this type of crisis where everybody seems to make the same mistakes investing (bubbles). Because they manipulate interest rates, fooling investors about the kind of investment that people needs (long term vs short term).
Those are really the two key issues.

Bitcoin is probably a price deflationary currency, its not a monetary deflationary currency. The probably is because price deflation/inflation depends on a series of factors, but in "normal conditions" bitcoin should be price deflationary.

Banks could indeed change their cryptographic algorithms, but it would take some effort from their part. Similarely, Bitcoin could change the cryptographic algorithms, but it would take some effort, even a bit more complicated than the banking example because the whole community (or a big majority) would have to agree.
I spect more competing currencies to appear so different solutions to this problem could be implemented and you could choose the one you prefered.


Its a decentralized network, therefore the clients that have the most mining power is the protocol that "wins". Therefore if a flaw is found and a new client is released with the flaw fixed, the community would have to start using the new client.
This is actually simpler than it sounds. At the begining there were bugs found and people actualized the client without too much problem for the network.

False. The banks create debt. Most of the wealthy people are leveraged to buy assets.

True and false. It is true until a point when people decide to default and then the creditors loose everything.


I was oversimplifying and you have a point. The thing is that the money does not go equally to all type of assets. In general inflation creates bubbles and push up one or various kind of assets. The people with money or access to cheap credit can profit from this movements, at the expense of the people who has a wage.

The answer is that there is no absolute correct answer. Both solutions have pros and cons.
Having moving average avoids the issue of the costumers seeing different prices constantly, which can be very bad for business as is very anoying for the client. The problem is that you can get caught if there is a big change in price. The moving average will not follow the price quick enough and you will be expose to either have too low prices (and probably loose profit or even sell at a lose) or to have expensive prices for a while (until the moving average catches with the new "equilibrium zone"). 
Having the present or daily exchange rates has exactly the opposite cons and pros.
You could test using an exponential average, because it gives more ponderation to the recent prices. Alternative or in addition, you could use a moving average but set a maximum difference price with the present price, that, if triggered, makes the system change to present exchange prices until the bitcoin price stabilizes. Im sure different merchants have come with different ideas on how to face this issue.

Removing legal tender and "counterfeiting" laws would take away a lot of the demand for dollars and would open up the currency market A LOT. Imagine you can set up contracts in bitcoins and not being forced to accept dollars to settle.
The last one obviously is in favor or gold and silver, but I dont doubt that if Bitcoin gains enough traction it could be included.

You need to revisit your history. During 1929 there already was the federal reserve, and after the WWI it had revived powers to partially decouple from the gold standard.
As for the rest of example, all historic example of free market banking system were extremely stable as opposed to regulated ones who always suffer boom and bust, like the one we are experiencing now. Seriously, point to one example of free market banking system who was unstable if you are going to disagree.

Yes, there are changes in the regulatory regime constantly. Keynesians have an eye to pick the one that fits their rethoric at every moment.
For example, you dont mention that at the begining of the 40's, just after the end of IIWW there was a lot of __deregulation__. Keynesian economists said it was going to be a disaster (not only because of the deregulations but also because of the big reduction of government spending) and it happened exactly the contrary of what the keynesian economist predicted, the economy boomed. So it seems to me there is a disconnect between what really happened and what you are saying that happened.

Problem is the credit crunches happen before getting to your theoretical limit. Also, some economists tried to link the total amount of debt to the credit crunches, looking for a limit where above that everything collapses, and they failed. They discovered that in some cases some systems went in huge amounts of debt and were able to repay it while others went into smaller amount of debt and collapsed.
The reason is because the key point is how you use the money you borrow. If you invest it productively you will be able to return the debt, while if you invest it unproductively (even if for a few years it seems like it was an ok investment) you wont be able to return it. When the second is the norm, no matter the amount of debt the system collapses in a credit crunch.
You will never be able to find a limit amount of debt because it all depends on how the investments you make with that debt perform. And how the investment perform is related to the manipulation of the interest rates.

Actually, it proves Krugman point wrong. According to Krugman when the price of a currency falls everybody should be thinking about spending it, yet I dont see it.
@_date: 2011-07-05 05:18:40
Let me point you the mistakes:
1. Central bank model: You are missing from your model that the central bank buys government debt as well, and that is equivalent to the government printing money, because the debt will always be renewed and the central bank returns the interest on the government debt to the government. Basically a central bank returns its benefit to the government.
So the money supply nevers goes down because the money that the central bank gets as interest goes to the government that spends it in the economy. And the money supply even goes up when the central bank buys government debt (monetization). The central bank benefits the bankers (but we dont see it in your model because there are no banks) and the politicians, who get to spend much more of what they would only through direct taxation. The ones paying are us, the citizens, through higher prices.
2. Fractional Reserve model: This is assuming there is no central bank. Fractional reserve with central bank is completely different.
A guy, person A, has ten dollars. Deposits them in a fractional reserve bank, meaning that it has loaned them to the bank. The money supply is $10, all owned by the banker. Now the banker lends out 5$ to person B. The money supply is still $10, $5 owned by the banker 5$ owned by person B. Person B owes $5 (plus intererst) to the banker and the banker owes $10 (plus interest) to person A. Now person B uses $4 to buy food from person A while he is building a net to catch fishes. Person A puts those $4 on the bank again.
- person A: owns $0. Has loaned $14 to the bank.
- person B: owns $1. Owes $5 to the bank.
- Banker: owns $9. Owes $14 to person A, has loaned $5 to person B.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $19.
(from now and to simplify calculations we will assume person B pays always $2 interest on the loan a week, this is huge huge interst!!!, and the banker pays 0.5$ interest to person A for his deposit, this is huge as well. If you want to do it with percentages you will see that you get similar results but the numbers get uglier.)
Now person B uses the net to catch fishes very efficiently and sells enough to eat for a week for $2. Both person A and the banker decide to buy and relax for a while instead of going fishing for themselves. To do this, person A pulls $2 out of the bank each week. After the first week (banker spends $2 on food, and person A spends $2 on food, person B receives $4 selling food):
- person A: owns $0. Is owed $12.5 by the banker ($14 - $2 to buy the food + $0.5 interest).
- person B: owns $5 ($1 + $4). Owes $7 to the bank ($5 + $2 interest).
- Banker: owns $5. (9 - $2 to person A - $2 to buy his own food) Owes $12.5 to person A, is owed $7 by person B.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $19.5.
Now person B returns $4 to the banker:
- person A: owns $0. Is owed $12.5 by the banker (no change).
- person B: owns $1 ($5 - $4 debt returned). Owes $3 to the bank ($7 - $4).
- Banker: owns $9. ($5 + $4 from person B) Owes $12.5 to person A, is owed $3 by person B.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $15.5.
Another week goes by:
- person A: owns $0. Is owed $11 by the banker ($12.5 - $2 to buy the food + $0.5 interest).
- person B: owns $5 ($1 + $4 from selling the food). Owes $5 to the bank ($3 + $2 interest).
- Banker: owns $5. ($9 - $2 food for person A - $2 food for himself) Owes $11 to person A, is owed $5 by person B.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $16.
Person B again returns $4:
- person A: owns $0. Is owed $11 by the banker (no change).
- person B: owns $1 ($5 - $4 debt returned). Owes $1 to the bank ($5 - $4 returned).
- Banker: owns $9. ($5 + $4 returned by person B) Owes $11 to person A, is owed $1 by person B.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $12.
Another week goes by (banker decides not to buy more food, because he sees he will go bankrupt otherwise and catches his own food, only person A buys fish from person B now):
- person A: owns $0. Is owed $9.5 by the banker ($11 - $2 to buy food + $0.5 interests).
- person B: owns $3 ($1 + $2 payed by person A for food). Owes $3 to the bank ($1 + $2 interests).
- Banker: owns $7. ($9 - $2 food for person A) Owes $9.5 to person A, is owed $3 by person B.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $12.5.
Now, person B returns $3 to the banker, ending the loan:
- person A: owns $0. Is owed $9.5 by the banker (no change).
- person B: owns $0 ($3 - $3 debt returned). Owes $0 to the bank ($3 - $3 returned).
- Banker: owns $10. ($7 + $3 from person B) Owes $9.5 to person A.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $9.5.
At this point you can see everything is fine, if person A removes the money from the bank:
- person A: owns $9.5. ($0 + $9.5 removed from the bank). Is owed $0 by the banker ($9.5 - $9.5 removed from the bank)
- person B: owns $0.
- Banker: owns $0.5. ($10 - $9.5 removed by person A) Owes $0 to person A.
- Money supply: $10. Total debt $0.
(Obviously if person A decided to remove all the money at a previous stage it would not been there, when you deposit your money in a fractional reserve banking you are trusting the banker with your money specting he will have enough percentage of reserve to pay its costumers. Person A got payed interest because it was assuming a risk).
The net result is that person B now has the same money ($0) but has a net, which allows him to fish better and have more free time. Person A has been eating for weeks without working (at $2 a week) and still has $9.5 of his initial $10. The banker has been eating for 2 weeks (at $2 a week) and still has earned 0.5$ from being the intermediary to make a loan (between person B and the money of person A).
You can see the money supply remained constant, nobody printed new money, the interests were huge, the debt went above the money supply, but still was repayed. The idea that you need to print more to pay the interest is false, because money circulates (in this example buying food from person B). There is nothing inherently bad with fractional reserve banking (but keep in mind that fractional reserve banking WITH central bank is completely different!!).
Now the question is: If what I say is true (and it is), we see credit crunches in real life, where the debt can not be repayed. Why? Ill let you think about that for a while... ;)

The price went down because of 30% monetary inflation. The interest has not gone down in general. What happened is that the increase in interest completely overwelmed the 30% increase of money supply. When the initial big media lead wave stopped price went logically down. That doesnt mean that interest in Bitcoin is decreasing. In fact, the number of business accepting Bitcoin keeps increasing.

Fractional reserve system was born in monetary regimes that used gold and silver. Its only later that they centralize credit under a central bank and create the modern fiat paper systems. So not only can work, its how it was born.
Fractional Reserve works much better without lender of last resort because that way banks are restricted in the amount of money they can loan out and you dont see this recurrent bubbles and big crisis that we see now (and in a lot of other periods).

Just to clarify, I understand the basics of the problems that are being discussed, as it is evident by my comment about the fee market answering your objection that without a limit anything and everything would go into the blockchain. But I have not read and fully understood every paper and proposal that has been made about the issue, because I have a life and limited time.
But coming from this position of certain distance, the impression that I am getting is that one side is acting much more level headed than the other. And understand that I don't oppose off chain solutions. In fact, I think even if we completely removed the limit, the technological constraints would still make off chain solutions necessary. Whether that will be lighting network or another I have no idea. But I have read that lighting network has yet no implementation and is yet to find a way to make it fully decentralized. And most importantly, I am finding their attitude not conductive to forming a positive community environment.

If we want to be technical, any fiat currency is backed by the force of the government imposing it. The central bank only manages the money monpolly, it does not impose it.
But then we could say that bitcoins are also backed by the trust in the technology and the community behind it.
Usually when you say money is backed by something you mean something physical (although I agree force or trust is as real as any physical object).

There are two operations that create a new address:
1. New address (obviously).
2. Sending bitcoins. When you send bitcoins to someone the client automatically sends the rest of the bitcoins in the used address/es to a new address from your wallet. This is done to ofuscate who you are paying to. What the network sees is that a bunch of bitcoins went to one address and another bunch went to another. One of those is yours, but the network does not know.
Thats why you have more addresses even when you did not click New Address.

Nothing has intrinsic value, value is subjective. What you wanted to say is that gold has uses apart from being money and Bitcoin only has use as money.
This is true (and keep in mind Im a goldbug), but if gold stopped being money its price would decrease like 80-90% (who knows exactly but a lot) and if Bitcoin stopped being money its price wold decrease 100%. Honestly both situations are a fucking disaster. Yes, with gold you would still have 10-20% but is still a fucking disaster.
What gold has going on and the reason why is less risky than bitcoins is that it has a lot more tradition. Bitcoin in the other hand is much more easy to use over the Internet.

[I did not imply that you think Bitcoin should have inflation or you think that way]
But *something* could be exchange the "inflatacoins" to dollars (or the government currency of where you live), which is probably what would happen.
What is keeping bitcoins from being massively used is the lack of useful shops. There are not so many things you can buy with Bitcoin yet. As more shops start accepting them consumption will increase.

Lets make a difference then:
1. There is people justifying a self-interest, even selfish, positions while at the same time respecting and demanding respect for individual rights. For example, when someone was robbed Atlas suggested that people donated money to compensate the guy that was robbed, but that the chain should not be changed. Do you realize that if the chain was changed because of this issue the whole confidence in Bitcoin would be destroyed because the community would have showed that it could not be trusted to not mess with it? This attitude is fine. More than fine, its positive and benefitial.
2. There might be another attitude of people who justify everything including violaton of individual rights (btw, these people are not libertarians (*) ). This is not fine and should be dennounced. I just think that without being able to use government coercion these type of attitude wont get you far. The community will shut you off (and this is the reason why its important to denounce it).
(*) I want to clarify that libertarians dont say (or should not say) that people need to be selfish. Libertarians say that people need to respect individual rights. It just happens that everybody has a variable level of selfishness, and libertarians try to work with that fact.

False. There are numerous historic examples of decades of price deflation without crisis.
Also, the crisis happen because of the bubble created by the previous inflation, not by the price deflation that happens when the bubble pops.
So inflation hurts the workers because it produces bubbles and the consequent crisis where they loose their jobs. And also because it devaluates our wages.
Inflation is the main reason why the poor/middle class and rich classes keeps going bigger. I dont understand why anyone who cares about their fellow citizens can support inflation. Only people on financial and politics have a reason to support it, because they profit at the expense of the rest.

Where did you got the impression that I want a $1/btc rate or something similar? I understand why bitcoin is going up. What I am saying is that I suspect the motivation of a lot of the people buying bitcoins is just make money by holding the currency and then sell it, not use it for trading. Therefore at some point we could see a big correction. But big swings will hurts bitcoin credibility so I was hoping for a early correction that will be weaker than if it happens later.

Yes, Bitcoin is a young project and you have to be a bit entrepreneurial and realize the potential it has (the technology developed by Satoshin Nakamoto has been praised even by the critics of the currency) and take some risk.

And btw, the comment of Kruggy wasnt good, it say it was a good investment but a currency should not be based on being a good investment or not, but in what it can help to develop society, implying that Bitcoin does not help to develop society.

You are going wrong in one basic concept: Value is subjective.

Actually, vendors report is the other way around. Vendors reported increased sales as the exchange price of Bitcoin was going up (that is prices in bitcoins were deflating) and decrease sales when the exchange price of Bitcoin was going down (that is, prices in bitcoins were inflating).
My guess is that the deflating prices invited people to purchase as their bitcoins had more purchasing power and people would not know until when it would last. When the prices were inflating people delayed purchasings waiting for a better opportunity. Well see how it goes in the future.

Price deflationary period is good on people that live off a wage because wages are somewhat sticky and we get our salary increased.
Price inflationary periods on the contrary punish people that work for a wage because our wages get devaluated and it does not keep pace so we loose purchasing power. The ones that get benefited are the people with a lot of money because they can ride the bubbles and increase their wealth.
Thats why the difference between the poor and middle classes and the rich classes has increased so much during this last decades where there has been so much inflation.

It is normal for a young currency to be more volatile. When there is few people in the market, one decission someone makes has more impact. As more and more people join the community and start using bitcoin, it becomes more stable. If you check the swings from the beggining they were way bigger than now. Bitcoin is slowly stabilizing.
That said, bitcoin is going to keep apreciating in dollar terms. The dollar is a inflationary currency, its in continuous devaluation. Bitcoin on the other hand is designed to be a strong currency,  and the continuous and big influx of new users makes the demand for bitcoin grow, pushing up its price. For different circumstances this will not change in the future, bitcoin will always appreciate in dollar terms (in the mid and long term).
As synthemescthewise suggested you can grab the current exchange rate from your preferred exchange services with a few lines of javascript. You can even design it so the price only changes with big changes of bitcoin/usd but ignores small swings.
And he/she? is correct also saying that you should only save in bitcoin if you are willing to accept the risk that any young currency has. I personally accept it, but its a personal decission.

The article is talking about inflation/deflation as an increase/decrease of prices.
Regardless of your insults I think you are just confused. Its good that you have passion, but you have just been misled.


This is false for a very simple reason: Rich people dont have their wealth in money. In fact, most rich people have their wealth in different assets and even with leverage. So inflation helps them because it increases the price of their assets while at the same time destroying the debt. All at the expense of the people that earn a wage that dont get their wages actualized from year to year.
Inflation steals from the low and middle classes and benefits the politcally connected and the rich.
The people that promote the idea of inflation as a way to take away from the rich, when in reality inflation takes away from the middle and lower classes, are just scum.

Charting is not scientific, but its far from astrology, it makes some sense. Charting is based on looking to patterns in the charts, that have happened before and so are likely to happen again. I know, I know, they dont have to happen again, and a lot of times they dont. But the point of charting is that price formation is a psicological event and humans create patterns all the time. So by studying how humans reacted in the past, you can guess how they will react on the future or at least have a good aproximation.

There were some coincidences this Friday. First, 3 days before the wikileaks guy says that there will be an attack on Bitcoin. Second, when the sell-out started the forum went down (several mining pools received a DOS attack the night before). Third, when the forum was back up, a legion of trolls (or one post users, you decide) started mocking bitcoins and claiming they were going to collapse. Fourth, the attack happened during the weekend, when banks are closed, people can not transfer money and there is less volume, so its easier to manipulate the market.
It could be all random or there could be people behind trying to profit from collapsing a young market like Bitcoin. Any young small market is much more volatile than a stablished big market by its own nature.

You are correct. In the fiat system you are giving all your financial history to the government (at the end you are using the government currency). When you move from fiat to Bitcoin, you can be tracked because of the connection with the fiat system.
What you are asking is: If I have some bitcoins that are not anonymous (for whatever reason), how do I anonymize them?
There will probably never be a definitive answer and everyone will have a preffered option. I will give you two options:
1) Use a service that promises to make your bitcoins anonymous again. For a fee, you send them your bitcoins and they give you back some new or mixed ones to a new address. Usually the payment can be done with a time lag and in different trunches to disguise the use of the service. You are trusting that the service does not keep track of your deal.
2) Move them around. Maybe not an option for complete anonymity but probably enough for most cases. You could move them to a wallet (create the account using TOR), send the bitcoins back to a private account, back to another wallet, etc... Its not 100% reliable, but if you change quantities and break the payments it would be very hard to legally bind those bitcoins to you, although it would not be impossible to track them to you or at least rise suspicion that it could be you controlling those bitcoins.
Maybe someone else can give you better options.

Its completely different.
The early adopters are not doing anything wrong. They are justifying their actions because they did not break any individual right. This guy is trying to cheat and commit fraud (lying about the first use of the word Bitcoin).
To put it very very simple: A guy leaving his girlfriend and then going with another girl he likes. He would justify it by saying that you have to be with who you love.
Then another guy raping a girl and justifying it by saying that you have to be with who you love.
Both cases the person is looking for himself and justifying it the same way, but first case is fine while second case is an aberration. Do you understand that you are comparing two complete different things?
One thing is justiying it in self interest while respecting individual rights, and the other is violating those rights. I really though it ws so obvious that you were trolling.

Right now Bitcoin is in distribution phase and its heavily monetary inflationary and therefore its very price inflationary. In the future it will change.
@_date: 2011-03-01 19:23:21
Ok. Lets set the definitions clear.
I use inflation and deflation as an increase/decrease of the money supply.
But the article and usually the inflationist propagandists define inflation and deflation as an increase/decrease of the general price level (aka the CPI).
Bitcoin is NOT deflationary in the monetary sense, only deflationary in the price sense.
Btw, I agree that constant monetary deflation is bad, basically because the currency would end up disapperaing, it makes no sense. But some short term monetary deflationary adjustments are good, for example as a response to a change in the demand for cash.
But the article is not arguing that Bitcoin is monetarily deflationary. The article is arguing that bitcoin is bad because its deflationary in the price sense. And its a lot of bull.

Except markets dont work linearly. You dont get a 5% drop in price because of a 5% increase of the money supply. Stating that reality has to behave linearly is a very poor argument.
You can see this in real life when central banks intervene in the currency markets and the change in price is not linearly related to the increase of the money supply.

I actually think low power consumption should be up there even before speed and price. It will be a compromise obviously, but I would buy a more expensive chip that has a better power consumption.

You are not even forced to pay or receive USD for a debt. What legal tender laws say is that any debt can be liquidated with Federal Reserve dollars regardless of what the contract say. If both parts agree to settle the contract in gold there is no need to use FR dollars.
The point of legal tender laws and why they create a de factor monopolly is that if the other party is going to be able to pay you in dollars anyway, whats the poin on specifying a prefered payment method? Why should I write a contract demanding 2 oz silver for my services if the law allows him to break the contract and pay me in dollars? Because the law makes it pointless people end up using dollars.

Sure, everything has drawbacks, there is no one universal solution to all the problems. But you have to recognize that the solution I have proposed, while having some drawbacks, beats by far having the money in the bank.
Also, its not telling that I think on a third party to secure the money in the case where I have been submitted under violence. Its only logical that you can not depend exclusively on yourself to keep your money safe if you are being violently forced to do what you are told by someone else.
I think you are not giving enough credit to the fact that Bitcoin allows you to secure your wealth from violent attacks while at the same time not surrendering control of it to a trusted third party (they could only block you access for a few months). Consider that before Bitcoin, just a few years back, it would have been not only impossible but also unthinkable and here are we are two extrangers discussing about it like its something very evident.
And I am sure someone could come up with even a better solution.

Not necessarily. You could create special wallets to store your long term money where to access your money you need a private key you keep yourself and another you deposit at a safe location, somewhere they check you are not under duress. If you are worried about the government blocking access to your secure location you could create a contract that moves your bitcoins to some address you control after one year f.e.
I'm sure there even more creative ways to tackle the problem, this is just some ideas that came to mind.

Historically, liberals were forced to ally with moderate conservatives against socialists. Thats why sometimes you see this weird liberal-conservative mixes.
Its kind of similar in the USA were conservatives and libertarian are very different but they sometime join forces for strategical reasons.
In the USA the term liberal was highjacked in the early 30's by the progressives. Thats why in the USA the term 'classical liberals' was coined. So in reality the exact equivalent of a european liberal is a USA classical liberal, which are radically different from a USA progressive liberal. Libertarianism is an evolution of classical liberalism that started during the 60's in the USA, so it is quite accurate to say that european liberals are similar to USA libertaians, specially because the evolution of the ideology that is libertarianism has started to heavily influence european liberals.

Which does as soon as a few banks go down, like for example during the present crisis. If I recall correvtly the fees that the bank pay represent only like 1% of all deposits so as soon as more than that fails taxpayers are on the hook.
Also, all the banks being forced to pay the FDIC fee is bad on itself, since it forces responsible banks to pay for the mess of irresponsable banks, thus incentivizing irresponsable behaviour by the banks.
FDIC is a nasty idea no matter where you look it from.

Its all a process. Right now there are no banks because the Bitcoin economy is not big enough to stablish a lending system. There is people trying, but not very succesfully because there is not enough acticity. We will get there. And when we do, someone will offer fractional reserve, and people, slowly, will start trusting this entity and you will have the system in place. First, it will be normal loans, but slowly as the entity gains repuation merchants will start accepting the bonds and fractional reserve banking will appear.
But who knows, maybe instead of a bank, we get a "p2p bank" similar to Ripple, something like what Bitcoin has done to traditional money but to banking. But I have no doubt that we will see some sort of fractional reserve system, because its useful.

You have a lot of things wrong.


Glass-Steagal did not banned credit default swaps. Your confussion probably comes from the fact that the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, the one that repealed what was left of Glass-Steagal, also changed other regulations, including one that had to do with credit default swaps.
Its worth noting that previous to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act credit default swaps were not banned, contrary to what you are saying, and the act did not de-regulate them as others say, but what it really did is change the regulatory oversight from the SEC to the Fed.
Your account of what went on and a supposed de-regulatory process that did not happen (during the 80's there was an increase of regulation and taxes despite the myth) is false. Also, the 90's were not happy times. They were the brewing period for this crisis with the dotcom bubble.

This sentence is not logically correct, the conclussion does not follow from the premise, but more importantly its not an answer to what I wrote. The issue is that you were claiming keynesianism is not like that. I pointed to you it is like that. Whether you agree its a good or a bad solution is another issue.


Then why did __you__ brought it up in the first place? If its irrelevant why did you mention Keynes opinion? What you can not do is bring up his opinion, and when I answer say that his opinion is irrelevant. Nobody is going to take you seriously if that is your way of arguing.


I have no idea how you could infer that. I actually expect things will be different. But what will be the same are the basic rules of nature whether physics or economics.




Math tells you (or anyone else for that matter) not such a thing. Math can never tell you what to do. Math is a tool, a coherent logical system.
What can make some predictions and help you make decissions is some economic model. The model can use mathematics. But you have to be aware that all economic models are based on their underlaying assumptions, that is they are based on the opinions of the creators of the model. No matter how accurate or complicated the maths you use are, if the underlaying assumptions of the model are wrong, then your model will produce wrong conclussions.
Science is not math, it is much more. Math is just a tool. I recommend you read the basics of what science is, for example Karl Popper, to understand how science opperates, because it seems to me that you are missing some basic concepts by the way you are framming the conversation. Btw, you are not the first one who I read on the internet with this style of "thinking" so Im starting to think this is kind of a new wave of misunderstanding coming from somewhere, probably some "so called" economist or something.

Its a confiscation because its not a loss only on paper. The government has promised it will give back the money. Some years from now the politicians will say that people need to be solidary and they will cut part of the pension funds. Then some more years later another cut will be necessary for the public good. Then the retirement age will be postponed a bit, because we all need to contribute some more. Then...
Yeah, its a loss and you know it.

Because a lot of people, including me, believe its the start of the trend change.
You should understand that when the yield was raising and higher the USA was under a different monetary system and the government had a lot less debt. Once they switched to a new monetary system and got rid of stagflation thanks to Vocker creating a deflationary crisis, the new monetary system allowed the government to push the yield down and down while raking up on debt.
Many, including me, believe this is not sustainable and we are at the end of the game. The fact that they have not manage to inflate another bubble to hide the nasty results of the previous one is one big indication. They pushed the interest rates to 0% and still did not manage to push the economy into another bubble. The abuse has gone for so long that the game is over. No more easy bubbles are coming and we are left to face the consequences. One of those consequences is that with no more easy bubbles and being unable to push the interest rates further down, the USA government has to start thinking how it is going to pay back the debt, and the most sensible answer is that it can not.

The paper is a very quick overview of the theory of free banking, american history and one particular example. Its too short to need to point a specific part. I already cited that paper because its a very short overview and not a complete explanation.
The examples of free banking end up because of political issues in general, not because they dont perform. No human system can guarantee eternality if that is what you are asking, so no, free banking does not guarantee that it will be eternal once its tried.
The biggest problems that Bitcoin might face are basically on two fronts. One, the technical part on how we resolve the issue of the block size, as we are quickly aproaching its limit, and how that affects the size of the blockchain, and in turn how that affects the capacity of anyone to run a full network and thus the decentralization capacity of Bitcoin. Two, is the posible political interventions that might slow Bitcoin adoption.

So no resonse for the dismissal of your claim that libertarian ideas want no responsability towards anyone else in the community.
The rest of your message is just more talking points, with no real substance so I dont think there is much posibility of debate, but:


Dont you think this condecesding attitude of yours is not constructive? Why would you decide to be passive aggressive, specially when Im providing historical and present day examples, and you are not providing any.


Why not talk about historical examples that counter the ones I mentioned instead of switching to another area to throw another talking point?
But in regard to your claim, the patent system is a government system, it has no place in a free market. Patents dont promote development, but cartelization and stagnate development. So I dont see how you would throw the patent system as an example of the free market not working, when its an issue created by the government.


More talking points, no substance.
But you are correct that the situation in our society is unjust and there are differences that are not justificable. But that is precisely why we need a free market. Social-democracies and its regulatory regime give more privileges to the rich and politically connected while making it difficult for the poor and the middle class to progress and develop, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. Then to compensate the government creates deficient monopollistic services so people dont die and can keep working for the corporate system its regulations have created. And on top of that they force us and even "educate" us when we are children to thank them for those deficient monopollistic services, convincing us that without them we could not organize and everything would be caos.
What I want is the government out of the way so the oportunities of the people to prosper are not taken away to favor a few like socialdemocracy does. Most people are not useless and can develop into prosperity given that they are not stripped of the oportunities. For the rest private charities can take care of it. People in prosperous and non-violent societies are much more caring of their neighbours.
But you can keep thanking the politicians for giving you just enough so you dont die and can keep working for the corporate system.


I am from a european country. I live everyday your glorified and idealized government services, so I dont need lessons about them.
When you want to have a discussion that its more than talking points, you know where I am. I was a social-democrat for most of my life and I believed all the things you believe in so I know how you feel. I hope one day you will realize that its all a lie to keep central control over us.

Regulations, like in this case, protect the big owners from competition, allowing them to have most of the hiring power lowering the bargaining power for higher wages from workers. They are forced to accept lower wages. It allows them to charge higher making everybody, icluding the poor, standard of living lower, while concentrating the wealth in fewer hands. It also stiffles innovation which would increase everybody standard of life.

One mBTC is still very "cheap" if that makes you feel better...
Some things are mesured in kg and others in gr, and have a "similar" price (meaning the number for 1kg and the number for 1gr are similar). Prices are relative because value is subjective. The number itself means nothing. That you are buying 0.5 bitcoins is not less than if there were double the bitcoins and you were buying 1. I know some people struggle with it, but if you want to help yourself get it into your head: the number itself means nothing.

Sorry I did not answer this on time. Deflation (both price and monetary) per se is not bad and does not produce a deflationary spiral. Also, deflation is not always good, it really depends on the circumstances and what is causing the deflation. Deflation is usually just a symtomp. Sadly most people try to simplify the arguments too much and work with soundbytes instead.
For example, when deflation happens because there has been increases on productivity price deflation is the natural consequence. Its called good deflation. When deflation comes from the banks contracting the money supply because they are overextended (are being forced to contract to avoid bankruptcy) and not responding to market need of money, then it produces problems and its called bad deflation.
In general, like any other market, the money market should respond to the necessities of the clients. When it does not, it produces problems. So when deflation is a reaction to what people need (for example demand for money is reducing temporally) its good, but when its not (banks contracting to avoid bankruptcy disregarding the need of the market) then its bad.
Honestly, the best way to understand it is to study history, someting that unfortunately not many economist do propperly.

Its because of specialization, which any one year old economics student knows. Some people specialize in creating Bitcoin mining equipement and others specialize in managing it. If his reasoning was correct, nobody should sell capital goods ever, which is an idea that could be nominated to be one of the most absurd ever.
The fact that some people went into mining and lost money does not mean that all mining is unprofitable and a scam, the same way that the existance of profitable mining operations does not mean that anyone can go into mining and make a profit.

@_date: 2013-12-20 08:00:05
I dont think so. Centrallized systems were not created to solve problems of scale. Centrallized systems dont scale well, they tend to add more problems as the system grows bigger.
Lets take for example the Bank of England, considered the first modern central bank (there was a central bank in a nordic european country some decades earlier, but the one that everybody copied and popularized the idea of central bank was the BoE). At the time the king of England was ruined and with a horrible credit. Lenders were asking for 18% interests because they would not trust him. So some bankers devised a scheme to lend him money at no interest in exchange from economical privileges. Those privileges were the hability to issue paper notes backed by the gold they have lended the king (so not in deposit) and have the law force people to accept those notes at face value (legal tender). The king accepted and as the king needed more money down the road, the agreement was extended until it became permanent. Central banking was born.
There was no scale problem, it was just a different way to extract money from people since they were very wary of more taxes. Its also worth noting that the modern justification for a central bank came later, with the rise of democracy and the need of political marketing. Initially nobody argued that the central bank was needed to stabilize the economy, that reason was just created when it was needed politically. The initial motivation for a central bank was to allow governments to get more money without raising taxes, but still giving the lenders the profits they wanted, this time in the form of economic privileges instead of interests.
As I said, its a really nice sentence because it gives the idea of progress, without vilifying old institutions. The problem is that it is not true.

All of them. Thats the idea behind fractional reserve. The banks get a fee of the interest they earn by lending your deposits, but you receive an interest. The bank is doing the work of lending the money and taking a risk, thats why it gets the fee.
Thats why people deposit money in a fractional reserve bank. Otherwise there would be no point. And you keep not answering the point, which is there is no reason why people would not decide to earn an interest by depositing their bitcoins in a fractional reserve bank, like they have always done with gold and silver.

You need to re-study Gresham law because you dont understand it.
Gresham law states that bad money drives out good money when there is a forced fixed exchange at a different value than the market rate (usually because of some government regulation). When there is free exchange, its actually good money that drives out bad money.
The reason is that when you can freely exchange at market rate value, you are always going to preffer to hold good money, therefore bad money will end up not being accepted and used. But when you are forced to exchange at some artificial rate you are always going to use your overvalued bad money and keep the good money out of use until you can exchange it at market rates, therefore good money goes into hiding and bad money is used.
Since there is no artificial fixed rate between bitcoins and fiat currencies, it does not make sense to say that bad money is going to drive Bitcoin out.

But you are assuming that regulations always have a positive effect, when in reality its usually the other way. For example the case of the ban of onion futures in the USA. It was created under the believe that allowing traders to freely create futures increased volatility. But the result of this regulation has been more volatility in the onion market than in other similar markets where this regulation does not exist.
So no, regulated markets are not less volatile than unregulated markets.


Again you are assuming that regulations have a possitive effect, when its otherwise in reality. Most of the time its a regulated market the one that is too rigid and can not response to change of conditions.

First, when you say this 'we can all agree' what you are really saying is 'Im willing to push my standards on everybody else with violence if necessary', and if there are enough with a similar opinion you get your way. Dont sweet it, you should at least be honest about what you are proposing.
That you like something is completely fine, but that you assume that the rest also want the same it is not. You might have convinced yourself that you really know the preferences and needs of millions of people to justify to yourself your position as bening, but that is impossible.
Also, it is ridiculous to say that better wiring is there because the government is forcing it. There is better wiring because economic development has allowed it, because there is people going to work everyday to offer you better products. The government meddling is just an afterfact that has little effect and only somehow diminishes the big inequalities the government regulations produce in society in the first place.
Trying to argue that people can not cooperate with each other and need a central authority imposing rules with violence if necessary is the recourse of authoritarians, and usually also very corrupt people that want to take advantage of the rest, thus promoting regulations as a valid system.

The thing is there is no such a thing as inherent value. Nothing has inherent value. Value is subjective. Things have certain characteristics, inherent and circumstancial characteristics, that people find or not valuable at a certain point in time.
Bitcoin has inherent characteristics, but it does not have inherent value because such a thing does not exist.

First silver and copper coins circulated as money, as smaller denominations for gold.
Fractional reserve is not fraud, nor under the present system not in a free market. Fractional reserve banking does not issue more claims on gold that it has, it tells the clients that is going to lend out the money they deposit therefore there are no extra or fraudulent claims. If they do so without telling the clients then it is fraud and not fractional reserve.
If impracticallity would have been the only reason for bank notes, there would have been 100% reserve banks in free market systems, where people would have gotten to use bank notes from 100%reserve bbanks. Instead, historically people have always chosrn to leave the money in fractional reserve banks, proving that receiving interest was a important factor when chosing to leave the money in the bank.

I dont know why this myth is so extended. Do you think 'the rich' have their wealth in money in the bank idle and waiting for inflation to erode it? Obviously not, the wealth is mostly in investments, who tend to grow with inflation., and also with big leverage. Also big money has access to the best money managers to select the right investments for each inflation cycle.
On the contrary people with a wage, most poor and middle class, can not scape price inflation eroding their wages since updates are yearly (and a joke btw).
You can see how since inflation has been going up the separation between rich and poor has increased. During the 2008 deflationary crash the difference between the rich and the poor decreased as the investment assets collapset (most of the wealth ofthe rich) while people benefited from the lowered inflation. When the Fed managed to stop the crash by pumping imprecedented amounts of money the difference started growing again. Check the data.
Its interesting that I keep finding people Like you believing just the opposite under the false belief that the rich keep all their money in the bank (which would make the idea true). Someone must be promoting the myth, otherwise I dont understand it.

Yes, those are the __local federal reserve banks__, not the whole federal reserve system. Also, the local fed banks are not privately owned completely as it says in your own link, they are more like a hybrid.
But more importantly, is that they dont take decission on monetary policy, but obey what the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which is a federal government agency and takes most decissions, and the FOMC say.
So yes, saying the Fed is private is incorrect and saying incorrect things makes you look like a fool. Btw, that does not mean Im cool with having a central bank, it just means its incorrect saying the Fed is private.

He is correct in this point, Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value. The reason is because nothing has intrinsic value, value is subjective. Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, gold does not have intrinsic value, food does not have intrinsic value, etc...
Nothing has intrinsic value, value is subjective. So saying Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value is 100% correct. Now, if the person saying it is implying that because of it Bitcoin is somehow less or it is a flaw of Bitcoin, then that person is terribly ignorant.

Its true, it could. But its way harder than reporters looking for flashy headlines would make you believe.
Even the researchers that first claimed had "discovered" Bitcoin was not anonymous (which everybody knew as its explained in the original Bitcoin document by Satoshi) and developed a way of tracking identities through the blockchain were unable to find the person they were trying to uncover in their study. And that was when there were a lot less transactions in the blockchain. The number of daily transactions have multiplied several times since.
So yes, theoretically its possible to track someone, in practice its impossible unless you can get court orders (or without court orders these days) to get the info of all Bitcoin transactions from a lot of merchants.

You dont understand what people are demanding and specially you dont understand what Bitcoin and decentralization is about.
MtGox could implement some limits and no centralization would have happened. If people dont want limits they can go to other exchanges. The problem of a central bank is that it has monopolly power given by law backed by threat of violence of government. But people wanting another behaviour from MtGox has nothing to do with decentralization. Asking MtGox to halt trading when their system is completely oversaturated and then resume trading when they can handle the load has nothing to do with decentralization and its not hypocritical.

You are both very correct and very wrong in your post.
A lot of economists make horrible inverstors. Just because they speak the lingo does not mean they understand whats happening and even the few that have some valid understanding wont necessarely know how to profit.
Also, its common for old scientists to become stuck to the old way of thinking and just refusing to change. Thats why scientific theories that now seem obvious took decades to be accepted. Its the old saying that progress happens not because you convince people, but because the old guard dies.
Finally, a lot of people dont want to even consider it but there is a lot of wrong things in the economics taught in college presently. Economics is a theoretical field with very weak testing capabilities so its easily manipulable, and the interests in manipulating it are enormous. Its no surprise it happens at this scale. In lots of episodes of human history you had a bunch of "economists" being recognized experts but just sposing what was favorable to the powers to be, so why would it be different now?

You are mixing two different things. The historical situation with frb under gold and the present situation of Bitcoin.
Ive given you the reasons why historically people chose fractional reserve banking over 100% reserve, and the interest payed by the bank was a big  part of it, contradicting what you said.
In the present system there is almost no banking in Bitcoin because there is still not many opportunities to allocate capital. Until a sustainable financial system appears in the Bitcoin ecosystem there will be no fractional reserve. Once there is you will see how people will chose frb because they will be able to have their bitcoins available at any moment and at the same time earn interest. The fact that the currency appreciates over time does not mean that people wont go for a bit more (like they did under gold).
There is nothing wrong with fractional reserve banking, in fact, is positive for the economy because it allows to mellow transitory fluctuations in the demand for money. Without fractional reserve the bitcoin economy will be much worse off.

First, just because a price builds slowly does not mean its automatically more logical, its just that __usually__ slow build ups are more stable, but you will find lots of exceptions.
And its not true that there has been a slow build up to 130. Since the crash from 240, the price has been swinging between 60 and 160. And although the swings have become more mellow as more time passes from the peak, I dont see how you can find $100 that unexpected.

Its possible to have in demand because not everybody asks for the spice (bitcoins) at the same time.

Just for the record, while it is a good idea to come talk here, the ideas about money behind Bitcoin are not new (the technology is extremely innovative). We are not questioning everything humanity used to know about money. What happens is that we are living in a extrange time in history when (almost) all the currencies are state monopollies and people in general dont have knowledge of monetary history. Therefore people gets surprised when they discover that money can exists and has existed without being a government monopolly because they have not known anything different.
But economically and historically money as something different than a state monopolly is not new at all and does not question everything we used to know about money. Quite the contrary, anyone with some basic knowledge of monetary history can see that the demise of state monopolly money is just a matter of time, the only question is when.

No, you are very much incorrect.
There is a big difference between stablishing regulations through democracy (authoritarian way) and stablishing rules through voluntary agreements (in this case not called regulations, but you want to call them that so Ill go along).
There is absolutely no need to have a central authority stablish rules for all that you have to follow whether you like it or not. Rules can be discussed and decided by the people that are affected. You arrive to much more satisfactory situations for all the parts involved. There is no need to have a one size fits all society.
Also, its not true that regulations are more efficient. Not only because of how terribly corrupt they are (the real reason for their existance) but because knowing, applying and surveling their application is terribly costly.
And no, my naive friend, the NYC regulations are not precisey to protect tenant rights as well as landlord rights. Politicians dont give a shit about those, they just pass enough sane ones to give a good impression while getting the ones that give them power and money in as well.

Your argument if flawed. Just because a new car consumes less it does not mean is more efficient or environmentally friendly to buy it. Yes, you save some gasoline with the new car, but you have to add the costs of changing cars (including environmental costs, that unfortunately due to government regulations a lot of the times are not included in the price). You have to add the cost of producing a new car and the cost of disposing of the old one.
After adding those costs, getting a new car is probably wasteful and environmetally damaging. What your government is doing is just subsidizing the automobile industry (that 99.9% sure donated money to his/her campaign) under the excuse of environmentalism.

Not true.
The dollar or any other fiat currency works the same. It is only when you work throught 3rd party systems that you can get chargebacks. Same is true with bitcoins, there are several 3rd parties that act as scrow. And as usual the Bitcoin scrows work much better that the shittiest Visa or Paypal scrow services that tend to automatically favor the buyer, allow scammers to opperate in their networks and make everything more expensive for the honest buyers.
As for BFL in particular, the case is more similar to a kickstarter campaign since they needed the funds in advance to pay for development. And there has been lots of kickstarter campaigns that reached their goal, received the money and ended up not suceeding, and all of this using dollars.
So I dont understand how you can claim that dollars are better than bitcoins in this case.

Remember the article that was published a week ago here, if you bought bitcoins at any point except for a 2 week period you would be better off. If you would have bought dollars at any point except for the 2 week period you are worse off.
You are taking a risk by holding usd (or your local fiat currency). You are also taking a risk by holding bitcoins. You are taking a risk by going out of your home. You are taking a risk by staying in your home. Trying to paint a different picture where one currency has risk while the other does not is dishonest. Everything in live has risks, including the usd. Holding usd you are also an speculator and in a position that historically has been a losing one.

Because this is just some reddit comment, not academia, so stop the nonsense of: Oh you did not provide source for a 4 line reddit comment, you are useless!
If you are really interested in learning you could google "free banking" and the first link is wikipedia which contains several historical examples with references:  That should get you started, if you really are interested in economics.


By free banking I mean the economical theory of free banking (what do you mean by keynesianism!?!?). And you dont need to imagine anything, just check history.


This does not even deserve an answer. Economics before the 20th century is the base for the economics of the 20th century btw.


The fact that free banking system dont have bubbles also does not prove anything? So inflationary systems have bubbles and free banking system dont, but that does not prove anything?


Central banks are trying to make prices rise around 2% and several notorious keynesians have already stated that they would like a 4%. Also, the idea of the price aggregate is stupid, because half the production could go down 40% and the other up 40% and the aggregate would remain stable, but the prices would be anything but.
Worth understanding that prices dont need to be stable. Prices need to "transport" the information they convey through the economy. Usually in a normally functioning economy prices are quite stable, but if some sudden change happen prices need to react to reflect the change so the rest of the economy can adapt as quickly as possible. Price stability per se does not make much sense.
Also, you dont understand the people that defend price deflationary system. Its not about creating price deflation, its about not intervining and allowing the economy to take its natural course, that is price deflation.

All historical examples of free market fractional reserve system have been very stable.
In the USA during the second half of the XIX century and early XX fractional reserve banks did indeed fail in noticeable quantities and with important repercussions to the economy. The issue is that the monetary and banking system was not a free market but regulated by the National Banks Act approved by Lincoln just before the civil war ended. Compare that to the unregulated fractional reserve system that operated in Canada during the same period with great stability.
What its even more interesting is that all the historical examples of free market monetary and banking system have developed fractional reserve. Not one example exists where the free market adopted 100% reserve and not fractional reserve.

Speed vs Security (and trust).
Gathering your info from the p2p network makes it almost impossible (impossible to practical levels) to feed your wallet with false information, which could be used to steal coins from you.
When you get the info from the server, you are trusting the person running the server with not feeding you with false information.
Also, there is the issue that getting the info from the p2p network helps keeping Bitcoin decentralized.
At the end is a matter of convinience. In some cases you would want one solution or the other, for example in a mobile phone you dont want a full node, but in your home computer you probably want to do it.
Its also worth taking into account that there is a 3rd solution, and that is getting the information from the p2p network but only the blocks that are of interest to you, which is still quick and you dont depend on a central server.

It is idiotic because all examples of free banking in the history of humanity have been price deflationary and stable economically.
The main argument pro-inflationist use to blame deflation is the Great Depression, which happen during a period with central bank and inflationary policies. Yes, a bubble crashing produces price deflation (and usually also monetary deflation), but that is not the type of economic system that proponents of price deflationary economies support. In fact, the Great Depression is a great example of why inflationary economies dont work.
I think it is fair to call the defenders of inflation stupid, when they dont have a leg to stand historically and dont even address what the opponents are saying prefering to repeat strawman arguments.

Decentralization is the most important part of Bitcoin. In fact, the cap depends on it.
If a entity/individual becomes an almost necessary piece in the workings of Bitcoin, it could lead to abuses and to the cap being raised and the rest not being able to do anything about it in practical terms.
Also, if Bitcoin becomes too heavily centralized then it becomes an easy target for governments, like the rest of alternative currencies that at some point have threatened the government monopolly.

For some reason, technological early adopters tend to be by a big margin male.  Also, early adopters of new political tendencies tend to be male as well.
I dont really know why it is, but I personally suspect that men, or at least a big subset of men, tend to be more romantic and open to risk than most women that tend to be less romantic/more pragmatic and with more risk aversion. Its my experience that despite the topics, women are not very romantic themselves and just demand romaticism from men as a way to handle a relationship.
In the name of the political correctness that (unfortunately) we live under, I want to note that all of these is not good or bad, there is no right or wrong option. Being more risk averse and more pragmatic is a very legit life strategy, with its  pros and its cons, same as being more romantic and more risk inclined.

No it did not. Btw, the ultra conservative branch of the rebellion established a central bank even before the war was over, although this first central bank did not last long. And the same people lobbied for a second central bank, the First Bank of the USA you mention, that had the same president as the first one.


I dont see how this justifies a central bank at all. Bitcoin is a floating currency. You are confusing floating currencies for inflationary currencies, then you are implying that a bunch of government services are necesary and there is no better and more efficient way of producing those services. Thats a fallacy.


This sentence shows a clear misunderstanding of how money and banking works.


You should work in marketing: "the dynamism of democratically controlled currencies"... Thats a good one, its catchy. But back to reality:
Central banks always have adquired some level of independence because the more democratically controlled they have been the worse results they have produced. History completely dismantles your naive ideas about democracy.


The toll is being forced to use those currencies and the nasty effects they produce. Getting ride of them would be the best thing that could happen to humanity, and any short term effect it could produce is not comparable to the damage they do.

When I explain to you the historical evidence and you dont like where it points you turn to changing definitions and repeating the same points again. You should do some introspection into the way you debate. Its not helpful for you or for anyone around you.
The point is that the regulations were not unimportant. The most clear example is the experience of New England during the same period that I pointed to you and you decided to ignore without a reason.


Isnt this what we are discussing? You can repeat it all you want, it does not make your point more valid. And historical facts point in the other direction as Im trying to show you. It would be more productive if you discuss the historical facts that I bring up instead of repeating what you said again without any argumetn behind and ignoring the historical examples that I bring to you.


This is changing the era you yourself chose to argue your point, but Ill take it.
First, Glass-Steagal Act is not what created the crisis, nor it would have avoided it. The argument is that it would have been better or worse without it. But a lot of other regulations, specifically the one giving the monopolly on money to the Federal Reserve are still in place, which have a much much more heavy effect on the economy.
Second, the fact is that with Glass-Steagal Act the crisis would have been even worse, as Glass-Steagal Act assumed mortgages was a safe investment and was one of the few investments that was allowed to commercial banks. So instead of diversifying in commodities which has been one of the saving graces of bank during this crisis, they would have been forced to keep investing in mortgages. Imagine the disaster that this crisis would have been if the law was still in place.
You can also check how Citibank, the bank which investments were more similar to a pure commercial bank was hit the worse during the crisis, while banks who diversified into assets that were not allowed if GS was in place have been hit not so bad. To clarify, all banks have been hit bad, but the banks that opperated more closely to what GS imposed have been hit worse than the ones who were further away from which GS imposed.
As I said, you should not get your information from political pundits, and try to as objectively as you can look at what is happening.


Scams happen constantly in regulated environments too. See Bernard Madoff or how legal and regulated banks deal and launder ilegal money from narcs and similar. You are going to have a tough time arguing that in this sense Bitcoin is worse.

Bitcoin volatility is not due to design, but due to its small market cap. Go and check how volatile are small stocks compared to big stocks. Thats because small markets can be moved a lot by a single person, while bigger markets are way more expensive to move. Its a matter of time until Bitcoin becomes less volatile.
The only way you could do something different is creating a central entity with monopolistic powers to try to centrally manage the currency, which would not suceed and would introduce a bunch of other problems making the currency much worse.

You are very correct in the first part and very incorrect in the second. You can have fractional reserve with Bitcoin. But:


Unregulated fractional reserve system in history are far much more stable than regulated ones. Regulated fractional reserve system are prone to artificial credit expansions, bubbles and its consequent busts, losing the clients money when banks go under (or paying through inflation in "insured" system).
On the contrary, unregulated fractional reserve system have to respond to users and competition and the amount of credit follows cash demands, producing stabilizing effects in the economy.


Fractional reserve is not a manipulation, its just a different contract type (as long as its done openly with both consenting parties obviously, otherwise its fraud).

You are going to have to define what do you mean by exchange value. If you mean that bitcoins can be exchanged with other currencies thats not a value thats a characteristic (which will be taken into account or not when the people using bitcoins value them).
As to why Bitcoin got value in the first place the answer is easy. Go and read what the few people involved in Bitcoin back then were saying in the forums. They were holding bitcoins because they believed it could be a revolutionary technology that would produce a better world.

Thats not how it went. Keynes was positive on the economy just before the Great Depresion, he even said in1927 that now that the goverment had control over the economy recessions were a thing of the past. He was higly leveraged and when the market crashed he went bankrupt. Him being a rich kid got his parents to bail him. Keynes got the predictions about the economy before the great depression all wrong.
Later, he invested thanks to his connections on the goverment and made a lot of money. Curiously enough one of the assets that made him more money was gold, which he had said early was a barbaric relic and was lobying the goverment to devalue the dollar which made his gold investments more profitable.
Keynes did not make his money through predicting the economy but through his great political skills.

This is not true. Inflation increases the weatlh difference between rich and poor. The reason is simple: the rich dont keep their wealth in cash.
If the rich kept their wealth in cash, inflating the money supply would decrease their wealth, as you suggest. The issue is they dont. The rich are mostly invested and usually with leverage. Also, they have access to the best money managers in the world and can ride the bubbles inflation creates. So not only inflation does not decrease the weatlh of the rich, it allows them to take bigger leverage and ride bubbles to even make more money.
As for the poor (including low middle class) almost all earn money through a wage. Inflation devaluates the wages and the increases are late and never really caught on with the real price inflation. So inflation makes the poor poorer.
In conclussion, inflation gives the opportunity for the rich to get richer and makes the poor poorer. You can see it empirically for example during the housing bubble and its collapse. While the bubble was growing the wealth difference between rich and poor increases, and during the deflationary crash of 2008, with all the investment assets crashing, the difference decreases. When the Fed starts "printing money" and pumping it like never before in history into the banks and manages to refloat the stock market, the difference of weatlh between rich and poor increases again.
I dont know how this myth that inflation hurts the rich and helps the poor got going and why some people promote it, but its exactly the opposite. I guess that if I were rich and wanted to defend the inflationist system, its a myth I would promote.

You have exposed your doubts about the future of mining which is very intelligent and decieving way of arguing because the future by its own nature is speculative, and allows you some gloom and doom discourse about mining without the posibility of a strong rebuttal because the future is open.
But my point remains. Historically some mining operations have been highly profitable and others havent, even when they were operating during the same period, which directly contradicts your initial point.

Imagine if the EU could tax directly, it coul create an army somehow close to the USA gov one and start wars all over. Big interest will rule the place (even more). Etc...
But we will probably get to see it as a full european government is the final objective of the EU and the propaganda telling people thats what we need to "solve all the problems" is filtering over lots of news. If the EU survives my guess is that, in a couple decades, we will see EU troops "pacifying" and bringing democracy to several countries in the world.

Why? Computers change the price automatically. If a merchant is setting the prices in different currencies manually, s/he is doing it wrong. Just set up the prices in your local currency (or whatever currency you feel good using as base) and just let the computer calculate the price in other currencies using the exchange rate you seem appropiate (last price, last 1 hour average, last 24 hour average, whatever works for you) plus some charge or discount you may want to add because of the currency conversion (f.e. if you want dollars and the client pays in euros, and your payment service charges you a 2% for the conversion).
Why would any merchant set prices in different currencies by hand? Thats just asking for trouble. Even fiat currencies can fluctuate quite a bit in one day.

So honest buyers end up paying for the thiefs just because paypal is a shitty scrow and you have no option to choose a different one. How is that positive at all?

Economists like to call it "network effect". Since nobody is using your money, nobody finds it useful as money. The same way since lots of people are using your money, lots of other people find it useful as money.
Bitcoin was "lucky" in the sense that it was the first of its kind and grew because some people decided that because of the new characteristics that it had it was worth the risk to invest time, effort and/or money in it. If another currency is to rise it would have to be very innovative to the level of what the blockchain is (and these kind of thigns happen very rarely, once every several decades).

The issue is that substitution is not the main benefit that FRB provides. If it were the only benefit 100% reserve gold certificates would have developed when a free market for money has occured. Yet, what we see in history is that when there has been a free market in money we have seen fractional reserve happen every time (and in a very stable way btw, there is nothing wrong with free market FRB).
What FRB provides to the depositor is the hability to earn interest on his money, while at the same time retaining the hability to use it at any point (with certain restrictions). Obviously the interests are lower than if you commit your money with a loan with a fix time line where you can not touch your money, but it allows you to use the money at any point.
And for society in general, FRB makes the transmission of savings into borrowing much more efficient allowing for the interest rate to reflect better the rate of savings and producing a better allocation of resources. In fact, without FRB the economy would be much more inefficient.
The problem and the bad name that FRB gets is because of central banking. Free market fractional reserve and central banking fractional reserve are two completely different systems. Central banks allow FR banks to be free from depending on peoples saving and therefore can overextend credit and produce the results we see around in modern society. But history shows that free market fractional reserve banking is the most efficient system while being extremely safe.

Wall Street is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the USA, but regardless, my point is that being regulated does not guarantee more price stability, as proven by different empirical evidences.
I was not arguing for more or less regulations, just that some of your statements were incorrect. Also, while Im sure you are very good at what you do (I am so ignorant about cryptography that I dont even have the knowledge to judge if you are good or bad, but you have excellent references), your economic knowledge is weak. It honors you that you admit it, but I think its important to point where you got it wrong. For example, in the previous comment where you say supply shocks, you wanted to say demand shocks. When the demand changes and forces either a change in price or a change in supply (or a mix of both) that is a demand shock not a supply shock. Bitcoin can hardly have supply shocks. And btw the idea of supply and demand shocks is a bit useless and random (but thats another discussion).

Depositors in a bank are in reality investors. When you 'deposit' funds in a bank you get an interest, you dont pay a fee for the service the bank is providing. Thats because in reality you are not literally having a deposit in the bank, but actually lending your money to the bank who will in turn lend that money (thats why you earn an interest) even when the name used is 'deposit'.
So any person with money in a bank is in one way or another an investor.

If traders had any effect, they would smooth the process not make it more pronounced, because as a trader what you do to make money in that situation is sell before the expected deep (thus putting negative presure on the price prior to the deep) and re-buy during the deep when the price is lower (thus putting positive presure on the price and stopping it from going lower).
Unless of course the traders are bad and are losing money, but in that case they wont last.
If it is true that the deep exists so regularly, it shows a lack of traders and speculators in the Bitcoin market (at least competent ones).

Basically yes, you got it right, but you have three misunderstandings:


You can have as many accounts as you want, and they are not automatically linked to a real world identity. Thats how Bitcoin achieves its pseudo-anonimity.


Miners are not the only mantainers of the public ledger. Miners are the ones that introduce new blocks with the new accepted transactions, but anyone running a full client (not only miners) checks the integrity of the block.


Nope. Monetary inflation right now is way higher than 2%. Before the reduction of the block payment from 50btc to 25btc, monetary inflation was over 30%. The first phase of Bitcoin is distribution so there is a lot of monetary inflation, that reduces regularly according to a pre-stablished algorythm. At the end monetary inflation will be reduced to 0 with the hard limit of 21 million bitcoins as you mention.
Also, keep in mind that Bitcoin is the name of the protocol and the program, and bitcoin/bitcoins is the name of the currency (Bitcoins does not exists). You dont say I have 4 Bitcoins, you say I have 4 bitcoins.

1.Litecoin has never proved that decreasing block time period mantains security because of the increased probability of a fork.
2.Increasing block speed does not decrease bloat, it very slightly increases it (but its not really an issue).
Also, its worth noting that having quicker block speed is quite meaningless, because what Bitcoin is lacking, instantaneous transactions, Litecoin also lacks. A de-centralized currency with instantaneous transactions would be a real improvement. Changing a number in the code provided by Bitcoin to have the average block period changed is not an improvement.
Proof of Stake is interesting, but it depends more on the social/community aspect and we know how easy to poison human relations is. It would have to be tested for me trust it, but at least is the only crypto-currency that is not just a Bitcoin rip off (Im not counting Namecoin as a cryto currency since the goal is something else).

I have most of my savings in bitcoins yes. I still use euros to buy stuff I can not buy with bitcoins. But this was not my point.
The point is that it really does not matter if you spend fiat or bitcoins. Once you have decided to spend, no matter if you end up doing it in bitcoins or in fiat, you have renounced to saving that money (obviously). So it does not matter that you spent bitcoins and now are more valuable, because if you had spent fiat its the same effect. The issue is that you spent rather than saved.

There is no way to know. Even when the blockchain is public, the identities are not (unless the interested party reveals it or its detected with some kind of social hack).
Even if you saw a big chung of bitcoins in one address, you can not be sure the address belongs to a wallet or exchange and therefore those bitcoins belong to many people who have deposited their bitcoins in the service. Similarly, even when you see many addresses with bitcoins you can not be sure all those addresses dont belong to the same person. So even when the blockchain is public, it tells very little about the distribution.

This is a different argument, I guess you admit your wording was incorrect earlier.
But let me answer to this new argument with a question: If you think that by buying and holding bitcoins with your dollars youd be able to buy a bigger car in two months, would you buy a new car now? Yet people do.
No offense, but this fallacious argument gets tiring.


The scientific method includes testing an hypothesis repeteadly under very strict non-changing conditions. This condition of the scientific method is impossible in economics, so its completeadly outrageous to say that it has strong testing capabilities.
And economics is a theoretical field. You try to create theory that explains reality.

Gold also does not have intrinsic value, therefore by your definition gold is also fiat money. That 'definition' does not make sense because nothing has intrinsic value, since value is subjective. By that definition all money is fiat.
The backed by a commodity definition also does not make sense because gold is not backed by a commodity (it is the commodity itself), therefore it is fiat money also. Under this definition the only not fiat money are certificates, the only thing that is backed. Even if you expand the definition to say commodity or backed by a commodity, then every money is not fiat, since Bitcoin is a digital commodity and even federal reserve dollars are a commodity.
The only real difference that is easy to classify in money its whether it is voluntarely accepted or mandated. And in this front Bitcoin and gold are in the same side as opposed to federal reserve notes.

The article main argument about Bitcoin is wrong:


The government of California has not questioned at any point that Bitcoin is legal. On the contrary, they have implicitely admited it is legal. What the Cal gov has discuted is that you need a license to act as money transmitter if you are in the business of trading bitcoins. But it has never disputed the legality of Bitcoin, in fact it has admited it is, because you dont demand a license on something that is ilegal.


Thats not what happened and the prblem comes again from not understanding what the cal gov was demanding. As I already said, the legality of Bitcoin was never questioned, a license was demanded. So the response from the Bitcoin foundation says two things:
1. They are no money transmitter so they dont need the license to operate.
2. Even if they were a Bitcoin transmitter, they would still dont need the license because Bitcoin does not fit the definition of the license.
So the response from the Bitcoin fundation is completely appropiate and not squeezing because, again, the legality of Bitcoin was never questioned.

There is nothing inhrently anti-market about anti-capitalist libertarianism. I am as pro-free market as anyone can be. And when I say free market, I mean absolutely no regulations, I am a market anarchist. But capitalism is not free market. The historical examples that are named capitalism are regulated markets, and therefore subject to privilege and exploitation by the ones with connections with the government against those who want to freely produce and exchange.
The only way to support the free market is being anti-capitalist. From this point of view, Bitcoin is a great anti-capitalist tool.

1. All the members of the BoG of the FRS are selected by the president and ratified by congress.
2. The BoG of the FRS is a federal government agency that has a set of rules, one of which is having independence in their decisions. The idea behind it is that the politicians wont be able to influence the long term decissions with their short term needs. This is not something even particular to the BoG of the FRS, as other institutions of government have also independence. Whether you agree this should be this way or not, is another discussion, but it does not make it private at all. Also, the real independence of the Fed is more than questionable, as proven f.e. on the recordings showing how Nixon managed to presure the then chairman of the Fed to print more money and create a bubble to help him look good for the coming elections.
3. Yes, also the BoE and most of the central banks of the world have independence clausules. That does not make them private. I dont understand why you would bring this point again and again as if it proves they are private.
4. (Again) Yes, central banks are set with independece clausules from presidents and politicians in general, but that does not make them private institutions.
5. The Fed is not a for profit organization, or better said, 95% of the profit of the Fed goes to the government (while the rest goes to its member private banks). I dont understand how you can say their profits are not given to the government.

Such ignorance.
All human decisions are emotional. Humans are incapable of being 100% rational and that is good and helps us take good decissions. Even if the world was capable of being explained rationally (something we can not prove), the human mind does not have the capacity to analize every situation rationally. We need emotions to make any decission.
The thing is the same way there are good and bad logical reasonings, there are good and bad emotional reactions. What people mean by being patient and unemotional, in reality is to be in a good emotional state. I always find funny when someone says that they are not emotional... so ridiculous.

There is a confusion about the nature of deflationary spiral theories, even among most of its defenders.
Deflationary spirals dont just happen because there is price deflation. That is absolutely ridiculous and there are infinite well recorded events in history to show it. Deflationary spirals happen because the banking system is forced to contract the monetary supply due to being overextended. Once the debt reversal starts, its a self-reinforcing process, and the deflationary spiral happens. But for banks to be overextended in such a way you need to have some sort of government regulation allowing them to scape competition and costumer control, usually in the form of monetary monopolly and central bank (but there are other laws that also create similar, if smaller, effects).
Thats why Bitcoin is the solution to the problem of deflationary spirals.

The classical definition of democracy is a form of goverment, but yes Bitcoin is ruled by some sort of consensus among its users.
What you say is technically possible but unlikely. Why? First, blocking an address would severely undermine the confidence in the currency. Remember that Bitcoin is a voluntary currency, not a fiat one, it can be abandoned at any point if the confidence goes away. So the users (people who dont have/use bitcoins are irrelevant since they can not install the patch) have a vested interest on keeping the confidence, specially the miners that have invested so much money on it. That plays a counterpart to the guilt, etc... Would you risk loosing a bunch of your life savings because someone is trying to shame you for a crime you have nothing to do with and that it would have likely happened withou bitcoins anyway? People get all self-righteous in democracy because one vote does not really matter so you might as well use it to give a good impression to your relatives and friends, but in this case they are directly affected.
But imagine that despite all some users feel so strongly about it that decide to install the patch regardless of consequences. Then youll get two paralel networks, the old Bitcoin and the new Cleanedcoin. Now, depending on user adoption, merchant acceptance etc... each would trade at different value. This is a fundamental difference with a democratic system, where the winner imposes its will and the losers have to obey. Here each side can part ways and do its thing. In this hypotetical situation I believe the non patched version would come ahead easily and quick. Would you placeyour confidence in a currency that might decide to block you out, specially knowing the community is made of people who strongly feel they have the right to do so?
Bitcoin incentives are very well placed.

Empirically the dollar is not stable, but decreasing, at least during the last 100 years. It has an institution that makes sure the dollar loses value over time. And even then it has strong swings.

This is an issue now, but it wont be in the future. Custom hardware is the solution.
For example, lets say your computer iliterate father 5 years from now has 200btc (which will be most probably a small fortune by then) and wants to secure it. He will buy a hardware wallet for 0.1 milibit and easily transfer the bitcoins there. Then he will put the hardware wallet in a safe and be done with it.
For his day to day expenditures, hell have a second hardware wallet that he will carry around to authorize transactions. Or maybe even mobile phones already include some form of hardware security for wallets.
Hardware wallet prototypes are already planned to be quite cheap (less than $100), so imagine when they are mass produced. Securing your wallet wont really be an issue once hardware wallets are out.

If you really have a problem having a brothel in your building for example regardless of it not causing you any direct harm (lets say clients use an exclusive back door and are civilized enough, there is no noise coming from there, etc...), you can still prevent it by creating a building or a group of buildings where everybody has to sign special rules to buy or rent a property.

Its not that I call them keynesians, its that historically the separation of macro and micro is a keynesian idea. I dont understand why you would say "you probably identify as keynesian" when its not about my opinion, its history.
But it is interesting that you bring this issue up because until not so long ago (around 5-10 years) if you tried to argue that micro and macro where related, that macro was the result of the many "micro's" interacting with each other, you were called a wacko. Standard theory said that micro and macro were to be analized separately (there was even a law with a fancy name stating it). Right now even keynesians are backing up from that idea and are starting to try to build bridges between micro and macro to explain economic phenomena. It turns out that during 50 years austrians were called crazy for stating an idea that now everybody is pursuing.
Btw, you would be surprised how common this is and how common austrians are years ahead of what will be mainstream economic thinking in the future.


The issue is if the models are wrong, which is my point, the outcomes of the actions proposed will not be the ones said models predict, therefore it does not make sense pursuing those actions.


What about models that reflect how the economy really works (aka not keynesian models)?


Where did you get the idea that I want to rule out keynesian models because of Bitcoin? It has nohting to do with each other, if keynesian theory was correct, it would be correct independently of the existance of Bitcoin.
Keynesian theory should be ditched and forgotten like all the rest of wacko economic theories because its wrong. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. My opions on keynesianism come from before I discovered Bitcoin.






Yes, exactly, but I would argue that I know a fair bit about economics, specially monetary theory and history (my main point of interest) so I may know a thing or two about where keynesianism goes wrong.


If you allow me to be honest, I did not engaged on serious economic discussion because what you were writting did not seem serious and coming from a person that wants deep economic debate. But if you are up for it we can have a go, as long as it remains civil. Throwing some balls and making a bit of fun is cool in an unformal conversation, but if I discuss economic I preffer to be more strict and leave out the "hostilities". So its up to you, for example you could propose a point where you dont agree with austrian economics as a conversation opener.

But not really.
Buying bitcoins is straight forward once you have the fiat money transfer accepted. There is no complication trading bitcoins. The real issue is sending the fiat currency (including making sure there is no chargeback or other fraud). So the issue is not in the Bitcoin side, but in the fiat side. Once any company has the fiat currency, buying bitcoins is easy.
I dont expect that the fiat side of things is going to change much. Surely someone will find a somehow easier way, and people will get used to how its done, but I dont think its really a matter of time. Its a problem of how the fiat transfers work.

Not necessarely a backdoor, but it has been demonstrated that if you control enough nodes in the Tor network you have a strong probability of being able to undercover users over a period of time. I dont think its so difficult for the USA gov or the NSA to create a lot of Tor nodes and use them to spy on the traffic.
And given the information that is coming out of the NSA I would not assume straight aways that there is not a backdoor. Basically right now, I assume any electronic device is a compromised device that the NSA could have access to.

Gresham law does not apply here. Gresham law states that if there is an artificially set exchange rate good money will go into hiding (also stated as bad money will drive off good money). There is no artificial rate so no gresham law at effect here.
Although its true that the outrageous fees can produce something of the effect, but it should be an ineffiency that gets ironed out when more demand appears. At that point and with more commerce accepting bitcoins there will be no reason to not spend them.

Because that hability did not exist.
The USA government had forbidden it. After Rosevelt confiscated all the gold it was determined that only foreign governments could demand gold in exchange for the dollar notes. USA citizens had to believe out of faith hat the gov had the gold to back the notes as promised but they had no way of demanding the gold directly. In fact the market price of gold during the 50's and 60's the market price of gold was going above the official 33 and something lots of time with the USA gov selling gold to the market, creating even more distrust in the reserves it holded. The gov even created some special gold coins to pay the arabs for petrol because they could not buy it at the promised 33 and something.
Towards the end it was clear that the USA gov had lost control of the price, with huge spikes well above the official price, despite the help from other governments that the USA gov had managed to convince. The last effort was forcing the South African gov (the country was a big gold producer) to dumb gold which contained the price for a while more.
But at the end the USA gov had to default and the price skyrocketed during the 70's.
So no, the default did not come because people did not care to change their notes for gold. It was forbidden. As for the rest I agree, except that I believe the people of Bretton Woods knew very well what they were doing and the posibilitty of abuse was not a mistake, but their intentions is something only they know and we can only speculate.

* First point:


Central bank managed currencies are also famous for their crashes. If you check history is not complicated to conclude that central banks are a source of finantial inestability. Historically free banking system (completely unregulated fractional reserve banking) have been the most stable monetary systems. Statistically central banks systems are more inestable.


No, you are not correct. In fact, the closing of Silk Road (the online drug marketplace) produced some volatility but was followed by weeks of uptrend. If Bitcoin was mainly used for "shady" transactions then the closing of the biggest market would have colapsed its price, not make it skyrocket.


Central bank managed  currencies are a guaranteed loss as one of the mandates of a central bank is to devaluate the currency. Its normal that this policy pushes people towards looking for alternative investments. Bitcoin promises a currency free from central bank devaluations and inestability. Right now is still a risky investment, but the prospects are very interesting.
*Second point:


This is somehow more of the same of the last part of your first point. First, you dont have to assume Bitcoin will always be this volatile. We are bootsrtaping a new currency, its going from nothing to who knows. Its normal that in the process there are going to be big swings.
Secondly, the "people wont spend your currrency" argument. It gets somehow tiring since its such a fallacious argument. If people was so sure that Bitcoin is going to be more valuable in the future, why would they spend euros? They would just use the euros to buy bitcoins. So for the mere existance of Bitcoin and following your reasoning nobody should spend euros either. But people still needs to eat, and they want to go out before they are old, etc...
As an aside note, inflationary currencies do produce an increase in spending and consumption, but whether that increase is a positive increase or a surge of reckless behaviour is an interesting discussion.
*Third point:


People might recognise the potential of Bitcoin and decide that its worth the short term pains.
*Fourth point:


Thats why Bitcoin is decentralized. No node is more important than other, you can close any node of the Bitcoin network and the network will continue working.
Sure the government can make it difficult for Bitcoin to grow, but I dont believe it can prevent it. Also, remember that politicians are people too. During this financial crisis the french parlament (one of the most intereventionist of all Europe) was presented with a law to apply taxes to gold transactions. It was turned down, even my a lot of left wingers. Turns out a lot of french politicians own gold...

How do you determine the price of amagazine subscription? Supply and demand. Etc... So how do you determine the price of bitcoins? Supply and demand.

1. I told you to look into Suffolk Bank in New England. When you google that you get plenty of references, including a wikipedia article with more references. You did not bother looking into it and decide to say there was no reference.
2. The housing bubble was more than CDO's. CDO's were a part of the housing bubble, but only a part. If GS was in place, CDO's could have still happened through investment banks, while commercial banks would have been forced by GS to invest more heavily into housing and not have the commodities investments. Thus the crisis would have much much worse. You trying to say the crisis was only about CDO's is just not true.
3. As I said, all banks had it bad, all of them. But the ones more similar to a commercial bank had it worse than the ones who diversified, something that GS would not have allowed. Citygroup had it worse than JPMorgan and you trying to say it did not is just not true.
4. Months after Madoff, another ponzi scheme went down and it was almost not heard in the news. Scams in the dollar system happen continuously. Its ridiculous to say it does not.

The attack of the government against Bitcoin will come no matter what. One of the basis of the modern state is that it can finance itself through the monopolly on money. Bitcoin is a thread to that power. What do you think will happen at some point, politicians will say: "hey, all this people are so nice and are asking politely to allow them to take all this power and money from us so we will just let them" or will the political class say: "we'll explain them a lie like we always do and keep the power and money for ourselves"?

Thats one advantage, but not the only one.
Without FRB, the money that people decides not to invest would stay at home (or wherever, it would be idle). With FRB people have the incentive of keeping the money in the bank because they can retrieve it at any point in time (with some restrictions) and at the same time earn some interests.
So, with FRB the amount of loanable funds (therefore the interest rate) is a better respresentation of the amount of savings than without FRB. The interest rate is a key price in a market economy that tells investors the type of products consumers will want and will be able to afford in the future, therefore is a key price for the type of projects investors and entrepreneurs will go for. The fact that with FRB the interest rate is a better representation of the real savings, allows investors and entrepreneurs to have better information resulting in more coordination in the economy (therefore less waste, more efficiency).

The regulated market is the one in disarray because regulation stop the market from adapting to the new conditions. Regulations bring disorder, not appropiate structure.


Citing this example as one of Bitcoin regulations is lame, because the example shows how you need to comply with regulations to operate in the fiat side. But it has nothing to do with the Bitcoin side of things. So basically the example cited, is not an example of what the post proposes. Example the same when it uses Coinlab as example.
I truly wonder how people think regulators are not humans but some kind of gods that can oversee the future and the need of millions of people and then use violence to apply the necessary rules for the good of everybody.

I dont see how anyone can honestly say the fed is privatejust because the local feds, a part of the whole system thart has no say in monetary policy have some private participation wich receives the symbolic name of stocks.

This is a shitty paper designed to produce the results the authors had in mind before starting the experiment.
This same website tried to use the paper by the mathematician hired by some bank saying that 70% of the bitcoins were in possession of a few people and that was quickly debunked. Its the same case here. The authors are just looking at nodes and assuming that one node belongs to one person, which is an assumption you can not make as there are numerous cases where this is false. The webpage is desperately trying to say a few people are accumulation all the bitcoins, probably for political reasons, and can not find a reliable way to prove it, so it turns to pseudo-science.

Exactly, the worse thing that can happen to any person trying gambling is have early success. The brain will like it and the gambling experience will be associated to a good and powerful emotion. You will also rationalize it thinking that you are good at it, not that it was luck. Therefore you will  go again at it, chasing that good feeling even in the face of loses.
If you start losing you have a higher chance of getting disilutioned quick and just decide that is not for you without any emotional attachment.

Democracy is a violent and authoritarian system. First of all, it is all of that in theory, but democracy is even worse in practice because its a myth that the people control anything by voting.
Voting is just a mechanism to get people to comply with the system by giving an ilusion of control. Its impossible for the people to control the government by voting for several reasons that are too long to discuss in a reddit comment, but for example:
- People dont have the time and other resources to organize propperly to influence policy.
- People dont have the adequate information and knowledge to have an opinion on all the subjects democracy requires us to have.
- (this is specifical for representative democracy, the most and probably only extended form of decmocracy) You are forced to vote for one person to give him/her authoritarian power for (usually) 4 years, based on a broad spectrum of issues that you can not select individually. This opens itself to enormous demagogic manipulation as you can see every election.
I could go on and on. Democrats (supporters of democracy, not the US party) are no different than facists, authoritarians that will not doubt on using violence to impose their will over others.
To understand the problems of democracy, let me recommend you the book [The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies](

But the issue is the same. You fear that by raising the limit fewer people will be able to run the complete client and therefore fewer people will have a say about the rules under which the Bitcoin network operates, which can lead to collisions and abuses of power.
But if the limit is not raised and Bitcoin transactions become more and more expensive because of it, more people will just use third party services and therefore fewer people will run the complete client, producing a similar effect. Also, we've gone back to using a system that can be regulated (specially forcing identification) by the government.

This is false. If he had money to spend and save he could have save in bitcoins and spend in bitcoins. If he had only money to spend, it really does not matter to how wealthy he is now that he spent it as bitcoins or as fiat.
Op the issue here is that you are assuming that trading is easy, that your 'mate' has made money 'doing nothing' when in reality he has been trading which is hard and risky. You can go ahead and try it yourself but be aware that without any skill you will end up loosing money.
Now your concern as a user about the price fluctuations is legitimate. I too try to spend in bitcoins as much as I can. When I need to buy something the first thing I do is google 'whatever I need' plus bitcoin to see if I can buy it with bitcoins, and the price fluctuations are a bitch. But its something that will only be solved with a higher marketcap, so give it time. I wish there was a better solution but thats how things work.

Thats not true, it can be even more convinient that Bitcoin (although centrallized) because you can have inmediate confirmation and (maybe) no fee. But the key is that you keep repeating the only reason people wanted fractional reserve notes is because they were more convinient to use than the mineral itself, but that does not explain why they did not use 100% reserve notes. The fact that they used fractional reserve notes instead of 100% reserve notes indicates that the interest earned was one important reason. And that reason reamins with Bitcoin.
Also, of course a fractional reserve note represents a loan, but deposits is what they are called. And no, its not a fraud or a lie, people with fractional reserve deposits knew what they were getting their money into.

Second, I dont understand why they keep saying that XRP is not a currency when it clearly is being used as a currency. It does not matter that you say that you dont want it to be a currency if people decide to use it as a currency, and its specially suspcious when you have designed it to have qualities that makes it useful as a currency. Am I to think that the developers are dumb and they could not forsee that they would profit handsomely? Please... Nothing wrong with profiting from your work, but be honest about it, dont treat us as fools.
So yes, they promised it would be not centrallized and open source. But at the moment its centrallized and not open source. They are now promising it will be in the future, but then why not now? They keep arguing that XRP are not currency therefore them holding most of them is not an issue, but they have been designed to be useful as currency and, surprise surprise, they are starting to be used as such.

What you fail to see is that growth does not mean consuming more resources, it means producing what people needs/wants. For example, under certain circumstances producing the same but with less resources (because we improve the technology) is growing.
So your argument of continual growth under finite resources is false. If we are indeed running out of resources as you say, growing will mean developing ways of mantaining or even increasing our quality of life but using less and less resources. We are already doing that, cars consume much more petrol for kilometer, computers consume much more electricity to do the same and even more than previous generation, lighting consumes much more electricity for the same amount of light, etc...
Basically, growing can mean consuming less resources if the circumstances requires it.

Its not about monetary freedom or de-centralization of money, SDR is about centralizing money.
tl:dr They are just using bitcoins as an example of how the dollar does not work to promote a new arrangement where they believe they will get more power.

The Federal Reserve is not owned by private banks.
The local feds have stocks that are not traditional stocks but a special system created by the government and those are owned by private banks. Those "stocks" allow them to have some members in the board of governors of the local feds, but the majority of the members are from the local and federal governments.
Even more, the local feds dont set policy. Policy is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and that is a federal government agency.
Just read the law.

Other alternative currencies tried to stablish themselves before Bitcoin based on other political ideologies. None has come even close to the success and expansion of Bitcoin and thats for a reason, even when you preffer to ignore such ideas and label the people behind them as conspiracy nuts. But all your comtemp and disdain can not hide the fact that thanks to those ideas Bitcoin is succeding in the real world like no other alternative currency has done in centuries.
But if you think you can do better, Bitcoin is open source, so you can create an alternative changing a few lines of code. The developers, the people who have put the time and the effort, encourage it. Bitcoin wellcomes competition. Even the protocol was modified to allow to piggyback on Bitcoin processing power so your currency can be secure from 51% attack. So Bitcoin made it easy for anyone to create an alternative, go ahead and do it if you are so sure other ways are better.

While not definitive those are very strong evidences to the contrary.
I honestly feel that some people just hang to the myth that price deflation stops spending and disregards the facts. Bitcoin spending is doing explendid according to the data we have.

But the argument for not increasing the block size limit is that it __could__ produce some centralization due to the increased size of the blockchain.
Yet the solution you are proposing to not increase the block size and deal with the increasing transaction number implies centrallization and in this case for sure, and also including losing pseudo-anonimity.
Also, in the reasoning that an increase of the block size will lead to centralization its assumed that storage hardware wont get cheaper.

Libertarian political ideology is a way of organizing society, despite what talking points would want you to believe. And libertarian ideology is very clear about what you should and should not do to other fellow citizens, I dont even get why anyone would say it promotes no respinsability towards others. Its just ignorant.
Also, lets talk about roads f.e. In the USA roads were initially built privately. Most towns created a cooperative were they pulled funds together and built the roads from town to town. It workrd fine. In Sweden 40% of the roads are private and the world hasnt end (althoug Ive heard is very cold, maybe thats a sign of the apocalypsis coming because of private roads).
Or trains: In the USA there were initially three train lines that were constructed connecting the east to the west. Two of them were built through goverment subsidies, the third one was privately built. Only one of those lines remains active to this day, want to guess which one?
I dont understand how arrogant and misguided one has to be to call crazy to people that believe in something that is working fine presently and has numerous examples of succes in history.

Just a note, if MtGox is doing that, its not fractional reserve banking is fraud. When a bank does fractional reserve banking its paying you an interest on the "deposits" because you know they are loaning them out. In reality, you are loaning money to the bank, but with the condition that you can cancel the loan at any moment. But if MtGox is not telling you they are using the funds, thats not fractional reserve, thats fraud.

Mathematically, there is infinite real numbers between any pair of real numbers.
For example, if you chose 5 and 5.1 there are infinite (real) numbers between those. But if you decide to go deeper, for example decide to chose 5.000001 and 5.000002, there are still infinite (real) numbers between those two. So, while Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, theoretically you can divide them into smaller part infitie times. In reality, the protocol is designed to be updated until 8 decimals only right now, but could be updated if necessary.

Even without an altcoin, what would they do if someone (zerocoin guys or whoever) releases an alternate client which integrates zerocoin and a big majority decides to adopt the new client?
Remember, Bitcoin is not a fiat currency, it faces competition, therefore if its not the best solution available it will be phased away. We are so used to having to deal with the shitty government currencies no matter how bad they are by force, that we forget that Bitcoin is a free market currency, its not imposed. People can choose and it can die to competition if its not offering the best service.

People take kibertarians and anarchists seriously. Only people that resort to make fun are partisan hacks that dont care about the others and use politics to bolster their ego instead of thinking what benefit their fellow men.
The point is that you are willing to use violence to impose your point of view, but since you dont like it, instead of admiting it, when its pointed out you resort to disregarding the other party. Analizing the argument and reaching a coherent position is painful to you, so you avoid it. You should be honest to yourself at least. You are defending that position.
Also, using a non-issue like 'no exposed wire' as if you are caring for the poor to justify giving power to politicians and their corporatist buddies is asasine. Its the position you are justifying that produces the big inequalities we see around and forces people into much lower standards of living. What you are unable to see is that shit like 'no exposed wire' is just a way for politicians and corporatists to justify in front of the more gullible to give them power (violent power) because it allow them to abuse the poor and profit from it. Regulations forces the poor to live worse than they could in a free market.

Please, if you become rich and decide to help others, remember your inherent human limitations. Some people decide to help and do more damage because they think since they are rich they know better than anyone else: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions".
Dont just assume you know better and start forcing people into doing stuff. Ask around what people want and need, enter voluntary agreements with a component of responsability for the counterparty, etc.... In general, allowing people to organize for themselves is better than giving them the organization directly. Changing the conditions so they can organize and decide by themselves is the real selfless gift, forcing them into certain social structures is personal vanity hidden as false altruism.

This article is a trainwreck.


Because the Bitcoin economy is young and relatively small, so there are not lots of places to invest and drive lending. There have been some small efforts and tests in that direction. It will come as the Bitcoin economy grows.
But the trainwreck part is:


False. Absolutely false. With no government regulation, free market fractional reserve banks have to answer to their clients and therefore can not expand endlessly. All examples of free market fractional reserve banking in history have been price deflationary (they opperated over gold) because customer control and competition forced banks to keep the reserve ratio under a constant range.
Fractional reserve is very useful to counter act the seasonal and temporal changes of demand for cash due to trade patterns by expanding or contracting the supply of money to respond to the changes in demand. But slow ,long term and permanent changes, brought about usually by inrease on productivity, are dealt by a change in prices (thus the slow price deflation seen in free market fractional reserve systems).
Price deflation wont be a problem for Bitcoin, but not for the outlandish reasons of the article.

First, Im a buyer, I dont have a business.
Second, how is that a good example? You can acomplish the same with Bitcoin. Just send a reversable transaction.
But more importantly, you have to look at the whole range of regulations that the government has in place, not just one. The financial industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries (at least in western countries, like the USA). Thats why it is one of the most inefficient and abusive industries, with high prices and bad service. Because of that the government sets a set of regulations with the objective of having the oligopoly it has created with regulations to not abuse the consumer too much, to the point where people would actually not accept it. That does not mean regulations are protecting you.

Leaving apart the discussion of whether government spending stimulates the economy or not, what you say its not true. Without the monopolly on money the goverment could not finance the big fiscal expansions through debt that we are seeing now everywhere.
To sustain the level of debt similar to what most western governments are engaged in presently without debt relief through the central monetary authority buying gov bonds with newly 'printed' money, the level of taxes would have to raise substantially. It would be politically unsustainable for various reasons, but the most important one is that the poor (and not so poor) would realize the amount of money they are paying (remember inflation is a regressive tax) to sustain these keynesians policies and would not accept it. And before you say the rich will pay, no they wont. Rich people have the political power, thats the point of a socialdemocracy, and would fight any change even violently. 
So if you want to say it for marketing reasons or even believe it yourself its fine, but its not true. Socialdemocracy needs to shadowly tax the poor and the middle class through inflation, and to do that it needs to mantain the monopolly on money.

Well, you should first demonstrate that you can adjust the currency to achieve those objectives without creating worse consequences first.


Those are problems of central authorities but not the worst. The main problem with central authorities is their limited information due to their human limitations. They make decissions based on their own experiences and their statistical data which always lack the depth of local information. With limited information they have the impossible task of being right. Thats why I always think that people blaming central bankers for making mistakes are unjust. Central bankers are going to make mistakes not because they are evil or unintelligent (which some might be to some degree). They make mistakes because they are asked to perform an impossible task for a human. Limited information due to human nature is the real crux of central planning.

There was a negative trend already, so it was expected for the price to go down.

All the trade information is public so it might well be some bot trying to catch noobs, or it might be just our imagination of bad traders trying to mentally justify loses. Ive had that feeling when Ive lost money, but also when Ive made money. It does feel like weird movements happend when a decent amount of money is traded. But if you get the right trend it there is not much they can do, so in reality, even if its happening, its just an excuse for bad decissions.

Savings (which is the appropiate word since it only describes and does not try to imply connotations for demagoguery purposes) does indeed have an effect, which is signaling to producers the consumption time prference so they can produce the adequate type of products people desire. Savings are one of the basic coordinators of economic activity and civilization could not exist without.
Regardless (again) its irrelevant, the point is that the principle is the same. Some people assumed big risks and are now getting the reward. If they had lost it all Im sure you would have voluntereed to cover their loses in the name of fairness, right? right?

You are correct that increasing M0 wont automatically be reflected in the prices, the rest of the money chain has to be working too. But what you forget to mention is that it still has consequenes, and that the Fed wont be able to suck in all the money they created when they need to, so the price increase will come eventually. If you wonder why they wont be able to, its because of the type of assets they have adquired to create the new money, Im willing to discuss this more in depth.
You are incorrect when you point out that Bitcoin wont be able to do QE to solve a bubble crisis. The point of Bitcoin is that there wont be that type of crisis, because those crisis are created by an inflationary currency. So Bitcoin does indeed solve the problem of recurrent bubbles, by not creating them. There are numerous examples in history on how price deflationary currencies without regulations about money and credit are stable for decades without creating bubbles. You need regulations for bubbles to appear.
