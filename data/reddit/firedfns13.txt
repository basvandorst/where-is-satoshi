As a person who browses this for news regarding bitcoin but doesn't actually hold any, i think speed is probably the main concern with getting most of us onto it. There's a lot of risk when you buy shit and have to wait an hour with in person transactions. I guess it realy dependds on how quickly amazon prime on demand-esque services take off
@_date: 2015-12-04 03:14:32
Because it's not conducive to buying stuff at places like chipotle, CVS, etc

Google also has trackers embedded in the websites which use its advertising service. Look into all the things that Ghostery blocks.
I was making a point on how a lot of people won't use Twister's advertising because its a bad choice: why reach out to people who might be interested in your service/goods when you can reach out to people that are wayy more interested, almost certainly so?
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:19:27
Why even bother creating something like bitcoin if they already had the banking industry create the credit card networks?
Its a ton of R and D on nothing.
Even still with whatever market capitalization bitcoin has, it's chump change for the entire US economy.

open cryptography standards ensure they work properly. Look into the hundreds if not thousands of proprietary 'encryption' standards that are either extremely weak, improperly implemented, or have obvious backdoors into them (like say the company can reset the device itself).
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:38:25
At least there isn't shit in the water.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:28:37
huh. cool beans.
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:20:45
Anything pandering to advertisers means they're going to be sifting big data. Big data implies surveillance. 
I don't see why anyone would put an as that want targeted because every As device does it

I think it was the labelling.

I know a friend of mine who accidentally crashed a cuda cluster at our sister school. I don't think we actually have one though.
It was for his research, not mining though.
I'm surprised that it's got that much unused time though. Cool shit.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:54:27
Yeah even when I was typing that it didn't seem like a good analogy. First thing to come to my mind about all digital thogh.

@_date: 2014-11-28 05:58:57
This is great
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:37:47
Yeah they do.
I was talking to a CS doctorial student about Bitcoin, we joked about going to the DOE owned super computer nearby and mining on it.

Block chain is stealing them from their users. They've already had how many breaches and problems?
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:25:58
Well since they're collecting as much metadata they can get their hands on, I would guess I'm most certainly in their databases. I'm well over 200% sure.
I used the 'summon the NSA button' once.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:31:55
I meant by percentage. I thought I saw a discussion on about how bad it was. I think the pool wemineltc.com is the one with the most, because they have the easiest tutorial set up by a user. I bet most people don't choose a different pool even though its recommended that they do in the tutorial.

Wait what? Proprietary is bad. That means that they had to pay a ton of royalties to even produce their dvds or players.
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:37:50
Yeah. I think it's dumb that there's at least 5 studios which are only posting their movies to their own paid streaming service.

Most people don't have the time (or resources to make that time) to research and learn about everything that's important in the world. Especially in specialized fields. Especially with money, because money so complicated and fucked up.

I know what it's for. Apparently its woefully underfunded for it's potential liability

Perhaps Nakamoto's strange behaivor is caused by his need to be anonymous, which means he only checks his email/comments when he feels like going through the pain of using the anonymity software. Maybe he's exceedingly paranoid and has 1 laptop for this sole purpose and won't use it if people are around.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:32:20
My brother was ultra pissed people think Twitter is a good place to invest. Apparently twitter was downgraded because their stock is too inflated from their IPO price a ratings company suggested. The ratings company said there was no reason to be so much higher, at all.
So maybe, but perhaps not. I've never even heard of promoted tweets besides your comment. (Although I don't use twitter)

There isn't any money in the FDIC funds to cover people below 250K.
Also, you really think that banks won't "accidentally" steal all our money below 250K? Haha, thye were robosigning all sorts of ridiculous shit.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:50:56
Yeah was posting from my phone. it has the worst touch screen.
I meant to say ad service. Google and all the other ad servers send targeted ads to users based on the gargantuan pile of data they can track about your browsing habits.
Why would someone want to lose this advantage just to use something like this?

How about theft of intellectual property? That's all digital and carries a huge prison sentence...

I would just assume it's not possible to seize it like they can seize bank accounts.

Walking out with -$47K USD. WHOOHOOO
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:24:58
Uh... yeah... They backdoored Microsoft and apple products. Those are world wide name brands. Anyone doing business in the US likely has an office FBI agents could go knocking on and deliver the national security letter to.
Besides, they're working with GCHQ, so between NYC and London, they have most of the important financial companies there.
The cc network is worldwide as well. I can use my card in any country if I want to get hit by whatever conversion percentage it is.
Anywyas, the bullshit company I was talking about was on r/bitcoin back in november because they made the headlines.
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:55:17
They don't etch silicon. They won't succeed where IBM has failed. Chill your balls. Once IBM or another technology titan unveils a real, actually usable quantum computer, you can start fearing for crackable encryption.
I'm not worried about properly set up encryption because they were after lavabit's master ssl cert instead of just cracking it themselves. You have more to fear about improperly set up encryption, possible back doors, and the NSA using their computing clusters to take control of the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:41:37
We're already in the cashless age. I use my credit card like 90% of the time for things. 
The NSA doesn't need to create bitcoin to have all our transaction history. In fact, they stand to lose more from it because they can't seize, freeze, or use existing companies/infrastructure if they created bitcoin for this purpose.
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:12:53
a lot of places won't give IT money to do these thigns until this happens.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:27:18
Congress clearly never gave a shit, and now it's almost entirely out of their eyes anyway. Even still, they have been getting blank checks for at least a decade. I don't think they care or even consider their funding drying up. Look at the cost of their new datacenter vs the Air Force's cuts to buying new jets.

litecoin has pools already higher than bitcoin I believe.

I'm not surprised. They thought it was a growing operation.

There was that one bullshit company trying to do that.
But why would the NSA create bitcoin if the infrastructure and companies already exist which is has excellent access to?

GOOD DAMN IT I HATE APRIL FOLKS
@_date: 2015-11-22 16:48:07
I'd assume they're using side channel attacks and exploits rather than breaking the encryption. It's not even hard to find poorly written apps and get payloads in them.
@_date: 2015-03-28 01:25:19
Whoa.  I may stand corrected. 
Maybe their computer is garbage like their stealth jet engine

How would they detect that you're mining?
And if nobody could mine the block chain, doesn't the difficulty go down?
Also, you could just go back to using regular PCs, it would just take longer.
So unless we go back to living in the 1500s without the internet and any form of computing, yeah...
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:16:55
Wouldn't it be faster to use a different base than binary? You are a numeric genius, after all...
Or more cost effective at least. Due to the ink cost.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:38:00
Oh right. I forgot about those operations.
I'm going to adopt base 2^32 as my go to integer base from now on because it's hilariously large.

What does a retailer lose by allowing bitcoin transactions? They get the shipping information anyway.
They can also develop an easy software interface (like seriously, I'm sure your web design IT people are dying for something fun) that automatically changes the BTC price to what BTC is currently pegged to locally (via USD to local exchange rate?)
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:41:26
I'm not disputing the costs for a server.
I was stating that people wouldn't pay for the app/software they pirated if they were no longer able to pirate it. The papers I've seen mostly focused on pc software and movies, but I would think the reasoning behind it is universal to other platforms as well.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:37:41
I don't order like.... ever. So thats possibly true. I don't know what my state was thinking when it decided to charge tax to online companies. They lost a lot of business.

Isn't that what they should currently be doing? Like how do you just lose money? Can you just liquidate government funds into cash? Shouldn't there be a paper trail otherwise?
