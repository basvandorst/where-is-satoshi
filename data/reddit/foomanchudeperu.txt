Good for you bro.  Stack it up and ignore the haters.  Good idea not to broadcast but also like you said, it’s not like you put a public post on your personal Facebook “I own four million in bitcoin!”
People suck sometimes.  Let it roll off.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:29:02
Unless they spent more than that to mine it.  :)
Mining is a P&amp;L game.

That’s a good HODLER!

Just say this;
“You know how Visa and MasterCard and Bank of America have computers that service your online / mobile / ATM / phone requests to move money and buy stuff?  You need computers for that, you know.  With bitcoin there is no ‘company’, rather, it’s a bunch of individuals running their own computers, which they connect to the bitcoin network.  These computers are all partially responsible for handling transactions.  How do they get paid for doing this?  It takes time, money, electricity... well, the bitcoin network charges a transaction fee.  If you don’t care how long it takes for your transaction to process, you just make a transaction and wait for it t to process through normal queue.  If you need urgency, then you pay a premium.  Same as getting fast pass at Disneyland.”

“At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”
They want to know everything.  :)

Damn!  Nice!!!

It is confusing and it will change.  I’m just saying it’s best to assume that any gain you get in crypto, IRS will ultimately attempt to tax as a capital gain.  If you think otherwise you may find a rude awakening.  Maybe not in 2020.  But eventually.  And gifting it to someone is like gifting someone money.  You can only do that so much before they’ll want some of that money too.

Only fear Governments and the Wealthy.  They are more powerful than math.  Don’t be foolish.  We need to change the conversation to discuss the actual risks instead of walking around with hard-ons just because the math is badass.
@_date: 2019-10-15 01:56:30
This is a good thing.  They are normalizing it to the masses.  Whether it’s April 2020 or five years later, normalizing leads to mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:59:29
This is what we need more of.  Passion on the front lines.  Make no mistake, this is a war.  It’s early.  There will be a lot of threats to bitcoin.  So rather than sit on the virtue or geek out how you understand the mechanics more than your parents, play chess.  Anticipate the threats.  Preserve your King.
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:48:00
Government can make it illegal in a heartbeat under any guise.  If US, Canada, Australia, and EU did it, would go to nothing.  You are literally talking about less than a thousand people, mostly greedy idiots, who could shut it down.
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:56:51
The moment you transfer it you are taxed on the amount you sell it for.

Look at what Coinbase has to say about it.
All movement of crypto is reportable.  All of it.
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:59:29
That’s weird.  That’s literally one in every two humans in the US.  Must include corporations and LLC’s.
@_date: 2019-10-15 00:18:03
It’s a sale.  You are selling it on an exchange in the background.
@_date: 2019-10-13 07:50:20
This is for Christmas.  To gift to someone who doesn’t know bitcoin.  It’s a way to spread the “idea” of bitcoin to the masses for broader adoption.
Wide spread adoption means those who are invested in bitcoin get payed handsomely for their risk.  That’s the “good thing” about these cards.  ;)
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:04:10
Okay what’s the history?  You are suggesting you have solid argument that the people who control you won’t figure out a way to continue to control you?  Fool.
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:27:17
You are correct.
But if Trump says “I don’t like Bitcoin, there’s sketchy things happening there.  It’s illegal now”, then people will stop mining.
Not just Trump.  There’s lots of possible future outcomes that can kill bitcoin with nearly a single arrow.
You are owned.  Even with bitcoin.
The right thing to say is
“We believe in the cause.  We believe in the freedom.  We believe in the brave who will mine against all odds.  We believe there will always be good in the world and that it will be in the form of Government support somewhere in the world even if it’s leader countries criminalize it.  We are the HODlers and till death do we part with our Bitcoin.”
That’s what you say.  Not “omg the math is genius, it’s bulletproof!”
Guns beat math kid.  But they cannot meet resistance.

Seattle is worse.  Those freaks will knife you while naked and laughing.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:19:55
Yeah that’s one part of it.  It’s being actively worked on ahead of it being a problem.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:39:37
I’ll buy all of this comment for sure.  ETH has intrinsic value too.
Btw, SegWit.
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:50:20
Bitcoin is a global currency, not just a store of value.  If it were merely 3% of the world’s overall money supply, it would be worth 100k per BTC.
That’s without inflation.  As the dollar devalues by printing more, Bitcoin will rise accordingly.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:41:34
This is something I have intuited but have never articulated.  We are 8 billion cells making up the body of mankind.  Bitcoin adoption is heart mind and soul.  You peel layers of an onion.  It’s his insight and genius moves to intellectual acceptance moves to rational thinkers moves to “the norm.”  
Sara Jessica Parker said it best in Sex and the City “First you get the geeks, then you get the gays, then everyone else follows.”
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:13:17
Use data to support your argument.  Credit cards are 3% plus APR and some with annual fee on top of that.  Back wires cost money and often take 24 hours or more.  Bitcoin is near instantaneous with negligible fees to the consumer.  What’s a ridiculous fee.
How much do you think it costs to send $500 bitcoin to another wallet?
You have zero tangible support for your argument.  Just sentiment.  The financial world doesn’t care about your feelings.  Use data.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:16:13
Also, you are using ironic quotes wrong.  If I’m really sending money to friends, I’m not “sending money to friends.”

It doesn’t matter what you put.  It only matters what you tell the IRS.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:17:37
That’s not the case now.  And by the time it is the case, the problem won’t exist.  ETH is great by the way!
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:15:50
 Bitcoin is a currency.  You can buy houses and groceries with it.  Today.  Fortune 500 companies are building further infrastructure to support it.  Today.  When you retire, presumably in a relatively long time from now, bitcoin acceptance will be even more prevalent.
Ethereum is a crypto cloud for Pete’s sake.
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:16:30
Also, yeah, if you are using Robinhood that isn’t bitcoin.  Read the fine print.
@_date: 2019-09-28 01:23:49
Bitcoin IS a payment process moreso than gold is.  I can’t use my brick of gold to buy a t-shirt on Amazon or send $500 to a friend in 10 seconds.  I can with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:25:56
The average fee per BTC transaction is approximately $1.63 with the median being $0.88 over the past five years. 
So yeah, if you are buying bubble gum 16 times per day it’s ridiculously expensive.  Otherwise it’s not.
How intrinsically expensive are other means btw, not including transaction fee?  They get your data?  They force you a login and account on their centralized system, they have a log of all your personal transactions with vendors tied to your name and address and social.
Still cheap my friend.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:05:46
Okay.  Some of us will continue to use it as a currency that beats cash, bank, and card, and you continue to be delusional.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:43:37
Mostly good stuff!  Just remember a tech or math advancement could change things over night.  A government mandate could change things overnight.  These are the things we, who believe in liberation, should be adamantly fighting against.
