Wait what? I own Bitcoin but this is false statement. Ethereum handles more transaction than Bitcoin. In fact, almost half of all cryptocurrency transactions go through Ethereum and does so within minutes.

What the hell can he do about it? It’s been ruled as a commodity. It’s a futures product. It’s literally a global validation system so you can’t block it. As long as there are computers and internet, Bitcoin lives. He doesn’t have to like Bitcoin. Bitcoin will still exist and be immune to currency inflation.

Then it becomes over the counter market. There are even decentralized OTC exchanges that can’t be stopped.

I am just summarizing the Reddit community. This isn’t necessarily my position:
1. CME (largest future exchange) launched Bitcoin futures on 12/17. You can now profit from Bitcoin price drops.
2. Coinbase just so happens to release BCH on 12/19 creating confusion and volatility. New investors see a cheaper Bitcoin name and sell their existing Bitcoins.
3. Coinbase have already said they were hammered with new users with 3 currencies. It is confusing that they were trying to release a 4th destined to fail due to even higher customer loads. It is highly suspicious due to timing of CME Bitcoin release just 2 days prior where one can profit from Bitcoin’s drop in price.
4. Lastly Coinbase insider trading was obvious as prices of BCH spiked to ~$3000 in other exchanges before the announcement.
TL;DR - Coinbase made an intentional decision of failure (already unable to handle current customer loads) and many people think a “for profit “ business did that on purpose to profit from it. The conspiracy theories surrounding the timing of CME and insider trading are all connected to those datapoints.

I think Cryptocurrency and Cash can easily play nicely if:
1. All services / purchases must be made in USD.
2. All deposits into Banks must have validating ID's.
Now, everyone can speculate all they want with Bitcoin. It's just like the way we deal with stocks. We can trade stocks. Purchase futures. Transfer bitcoin. Etc. Yes, it's even a form of storing value. However, whenever we need to buy something from the grocery store, we use USD. Whenever we deposit into a bank, they take our ID, social security, etc. So, if we withdraw in USD, we are taxed on capital gains on the Bitcoin.
- People who want to stay anonymous, just stay in Bitcoin form. 
- People who want Bitcoin to become mainstream might enjoy this if the government allows people to buy as much as they want.
- People who want cash can still deposit Bitcoin in Banks.
- People pay their fair share of capital gain gets to tax Bitcoin gains because Banks have their ID (like we all currently do at a Bank).
I am open to thoughts, but that seems like a easier way to make Bitcoin very mainstream. Also allows the hybrid existence of Bitcoin and Cash until a standard becomes popular enough, but doesn't lock out either party. Nor does it allow people to avoid their taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:21:54
Exactly. Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous. If you use an exchange, it's likely they have your ID anyways. So, why not reveal your ID anyways when you spend. 
The form of anonymous usage is for money transfers. The receiver will get bitcoin. The receiver's name is not tied to a public key.

When Proof-of-Stake is introduced to Ethereum, you could run an Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (to generate money) and Bitcoin which is Proof-of-Work model (doesn't generate money, but since you already have an Ethereum node up...). Basically run both nodes on 1 Computer since 1 of the nodes will generate rewards. I am pretty excited in how Ethereum and Bitcoin is going to dance together in the future. Maybe as more Ethereum nodes come up, they also act as Bitcoin nodes and decentralize the Bitcoin network.

Sure, it carries the same risk as if someone deposit their cash in a foreign bank account. And yes, the IRS has also been cracking down on foreign banks and cooperating with respective country's officials. This is how all these high profile people have been fined / jailed for tax evasion.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:39:20
If you trade Bitcoin to USD on an exchange, you'll get ID'ed. At GDAX or Coinbase for example, they require your name / driver's license. Each deposit to and withdraw from your name is recorded. Even if Bitcoin itself becomes anonymous, it is not clear if the conversion between Bitcoin to USD can be anonymous on exchanges.

If I am reading this right, the purpose of this illustration is to demonstrate 3 things:
1. In the short term, Bitcoin is capable of fulfilling the niche for large wire transactions. Even with a transaction fee of $20-30 you are getting pretty close to wiring fees. And the illustration shows how this niche is the smallest of transactions (layer 2 on the left). Despite its niche the current Bitcoin price has already soared.
2. In the long term, with Sigwit and Lightning (perhaps in 2018-ish) Bitcoin would be able to handle small and large transactions. Essentially replacing the entire financial system (wire fees for banks, merchant fees from credit cards, etc).
3. The illustration regarding market cap (layer 1 on the right) and our current financial system is showing you how much Bitcoin would be worth if the entire financial system transitioned to Bitcoin (I.e. instead of transfers with fiat, every fiat converted to Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:26:57
Yup. And the proposal above wouldn't prevent that from happening. It only allow cash and bitcoin to cooexist until one form of method wins over. Also, it prevents regulations from stopping Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:12:06
Wait what? Way more millennials own Bitcoin than boomers. They have the largest percentage of ownership:

Came here for this comment. Tesla’s are way more fun to drive.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:37:58
Not necessarily.
There was linear rise in price from 2015 leading up to Halvening in 2016.
There was exponential rise in price from 2017-2018 after the 2016 Halvening.
That’s why I don’t really care about price. Just accumulating.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:55:11
Meh. I just stick to fundamentals:
-	Bitcoin Halvening
-	Litecoin Halvening 
-	ETH 2.0 Beacon Chain
-	Bakkt Physical BTC Futures
2017-2018 price jump was from the 2016 Bitcoin Halvening
We are current in a leg headed towards May 2020 Bitcoin Halvening.

Look. Everyone needs to have a more civilized way of thinking. Don't get stuck in "confirmation bias" mode. 
1. Yes, your statement is correct. BCH would need to increase block size even more. In doing so, people with larger resources would have access to storage.
2. However, BTC's Lightning Network is not too different. At a 1-to-1 exchange, it's not bad. As more transactions infuse the Lightning Network, you'll find clusters of centralized nodes passing payments to other parties. 
Honestly, I prefer everyone to think about decentralization AND transaction speeds together. It would be pretty epic if both BCH and BTC will recombine again into an agreed methodology. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:53:25
Scarcity would drive up price. If a rich person bought a ton of Bitcoin, the on going supply would get smaller. Supply and demand would drive price up.
Whales are doing this to make their investments more scarce and valuable.

No one knows for sure, but there is a fair shot at a bull run if Bitcoin ETF is approved and the news is lining up:
1.	Blackrock is the World’s largest ETF provider with over 6 trillion in assets.
2.	SEC relaxed the liquidity requirement for ETF approval last month: 
I totally get your cautious approach, but I just wanted to explain the other side of the thought process. Blackrock is not a small fish. Their major competitors will at the very least have a Monday morning meeting about crypto too. This is how institutional momentum starts accumulating.
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:23:05
Anybody know if there are more longs or shorts?
@_date: 2018-07-22 02:51:01
No, the proposed ETF is 25 Bitcoins per “share.” Purchase will be made between a combination of exchanges and over the counter. Not futures trading.
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:34:26
Here’s the reason SEC rejected the twins. If you think CBOE can argue against it or if their proposal is somehow different, please share. I really want a ETF approval but I don’t see how it’s possible with their rejection reason:
The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges.
The bid-ask spreads varied widely across exchanges, the SEC said. The volume in bitcoin futures markets are small: 20 percent the volume of platinum, and 2.5 percent that of silver.
As for assertions that bitcoin is uniquely resistant to manipulations, the SEC "finds that the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion."

If a $35 million hack can cause a market panic, I think $200 million is still a very positive number. Adoption will also increase as more young workers flow through the professional World. The financial World is shifting and that’s a good thing.

Not entirely true. A Bitcoin ETF is similar to a crypto open exchange. Except a ETF is locked and insured as a security. There are way more customer protections in place than a typical crypto exchange. 
Also a single ETF acceptance will open more ETF’s, making the space more decentralized away from exchanges (cough Coinbase).
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:42:32
Looks guys. This is not FUD and you should not be spreading false hope as it could cause a lot of pain and suffering. People could lose a lot of money if we don’t speak truthfully.
1.	Yes. 1 commissioner agreed with Bitcoin ETF but 3 did not. We won’t get an approval anytime soon. Track market price accordingly.
2.	Yes. If replacing commissioners are pro Crypto, we have a high chance at approval.
None of this is trading advice.
Also, here’s the reason SEC rejected the Winklevoss twins. If you think CBOE can argue against it or if their proposal is somehow different, please share. I really want a ETF approval but I don’t see how it’s possible with their rejection reason:

Today’s drop is due to Winklevoss twin’s Bitcoin ETF proposal. It’s highly unlikely CBOE will be getting their ETF approved.

There is one silver lining. There is 1 commissioner who is pro crypto and wrote a dissent against the Bitcoin ETF rejection. She will be on the vote until 2020. The remaining 3 commissioners are either getting replaced or term will be up before then. Therefore, if replacing commissioners are pro crypto we got a big chance at Bitcoin ETF approval.
