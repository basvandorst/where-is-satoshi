Mining costs are adjustable and self regulating. The only reason it's $44 per tx right now is due to a relatively small number of transactions and a relatively high block reward. As the reward is gradually phased out over then next 120 years, and number of transactions grows, the cost per tx will change with it. 
If you can't make back mining what you spend in electricity and capital depreciation, you'll stop mining. This reduces the overall network expenditure on mining, and increases mining revenue for those who remain, until in balances out... it's just a market like anything else.

It's possible that Mark Williams is simply averse to economic bubbles of all sorts. There are lots of people who study economic bubbles, noting that they always end in collapse, and who rightly identify that bitcoin is also an economic bubble. However, the one piece that Williams et. al have overlooked is that money itself is an economic bubble. It is a commodity that is obtained and held, not for its use in consumption or production, but only to be traded away again at a later time, just as what happened with tulip bulbs, south sea company stock, and las vegas real estate, and any other example of speculation. The only difference is that once a commodity bubble attains the status of money, it becomes relatively stable and can persist for thousands of years, as in the case of gold.

Yes, since mining not only validates current transactions, it also secures existing balances, there is a possibility that incentives won't line up. In that case I would expect that hard coded minimum fees would have to be used rather than a pure market rate. Alternately there may be businesses that insure bitcoin balances that would have an incentive to mine at a loss to reduce 51% attack risk.
