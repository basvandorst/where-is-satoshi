Every Bitcoin owner should be treating OpenBazaar as a craigslist of sorts and start listing things like they would a garage sale for random stuff in their house.  
If any Bitcoin owner already has some kind of store or online presence, they also should be pushing these Bitcoin utilities that are working with Bitcoin, rather than being a website that also allows you to buy in BTC too.

Consumers don't recognize their web browser is software that most likely was downloaded.  It's a weird mind game people play with themselves.   Any phone app is just an app, any desktop program is software, even though we all know it's the same shit, for some reason the mental block is definitely there in some thinking that OpenBazaar is any different than the millions of 'apps' they download daily on their phone.     I feel all computer programs and software would best just rename themselves 'apps' at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-26 18:42:44
As a seller, I have not once considered using their mediators or moderators, not that it doesn't have their place and I like that the function is available.  I don't see how not trusting the seller directly is any different than using another stranger to get a cut of our transaction.    So far all people that have bought from me get their goods earlier than I list, I always throw in bonus stuff, and I just do not send anything without tracking # and insurance.  
But if one wants to have like as little risk as possible, start selling things on OpenBazaar before buying if that's what it takes to just see how it works, I agree that as a seller the mediator issue is a near non-issue.  I am not saying there is special circumstances that could come about, but I don't know if those worries outweigh the direct benefits all Bitcoin users could be enjoying on this market made for us.     I know altcoins will probably come, but for all those hardcore BTC users, I just feel they should be trying this new tech instead of trying to convince old dinosaur sites to convert.   Lead by example.

You can view this OpenBazaar listing with your web browser here 


This listing is for a 6 month investment contract. The proceeds from the sale of this contract will be used in rural Kenya to buy one younger goat that will be placed with a smallholder farmer. The farmer raises the goat for six months and then earns a share of the profit (if any) when the goat is sold at the end of the contract. About 75% of the funds from the sale of this contract go towards procuring the goat, and the remaining 25% are allocated to the farmer for medicine/vet visits, water, feed, and for transport to a regional market for final sale. After the goat is sold at the market, profit will be calculated as the selling price minus $25 (the contract purchase price). The farmer keeps 60% of the profit and the remaining 40% of the profit (plus the $25 investment) is sent to the holder of the contract. The contract (tentatively) will be a colored coin asset, stored on the project's wallet though you can withdraw the coin to your own wallet if you wish. The coin can be sold/transferred before the contract-end if desired. [A different digital asset platform might be used instead, the space is developing rapidly.] Details on the Initial placement of the goat with the farmer (e.g., weight, measurement, ear tag ID, photo, farmer info &amp; GPS location) and periodic updates will be made available via the project's web site. [Also, TBD] The aim for this endeavor is to help rural (upcountry) farmers make the jump from subsistence farming to becoming succesful, self-sufficient commercial farmers through assistance from the project's cooperative. The farmers selected to participate will have land, foliage, will be relatively near to a water source, and will have spare time -- though most already raise a farm animal or three. What they don't currently have is the capital to build a larger herd to raise. A herd with a higher head count (e.g., 25 to 40 goats on a farm) with many farmers in the cooperative gives economies of scale that make it possible to have regular scheduled visits from the vet, to provide livestock farm education/outreach, and to share resources (e.g., the lorry for transport to market), etc. The photos in this listing and profile are from Phase One of the project (started late 2014) in which 120 goats were placed with 5 farmers. Phase Two is being planned for a mid-2016 start, with the goal being to place 750 goats with 25 farmers. Contracts sold prior to June will be placed with existing Phase One farmers. A coordinator for the project was featured in this video:  Verification for this listing:

I am not sure if you have tried the program since it came out a month ago, some of your list has been addressed and others you seem to just have your own vision for OpenBazaar that doesn't even seem to be the Bitcoin-centric program that it is right now.    Out of everything, just search needs to be handled, as much as Duosear.ch and BazaarBay have basically solved the search issue on the web, it needs to be complete within the program.

Having a shop on Etsy and OpenBazaar, Etsy sells more, but OpenBazaar feels better and is also I don't think comparable to Amazon or Ebay or even Etsy in it's current form.  Right now it is a perfect tool to handle crypto currency transactions and is getting better to be a full on marketplace, take a look at what on OB within your browser at  and whatever it is you have is probably welcome.   If you already have pictures and descriptions of your products, you should have an OpenBazaar store set up.

Bitsquare is probably one of the most important things going on with Bitcoin next to OpenBazaar.

I would argue it's better than nice.   Think of all the altcoins that are going to be directly going into the Bitcoin ecosystem in a super direct way.   Good for ShapeShift on getting their cut I assume, but past that, it is all those altcoins turning right into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-25 13:23:14

Nice, I think I was confusion this site when I seen it up the other day with the Mubiz.com site going on.  This looks really neat, good job.    Once I see that Mobile Hound for OpenBazaar had the ability to view OpenBazaar as well as buy and sell without having to download the client I got curious if websites would be the next step.
The site itself visually looks nice, seems to have loading issues in places but this looks more like proof of concept then complete but really nice.  Good luck with this project.

OpenBazaar and Bitsquare.  Please start using them and tell people that you are using them.  They are not demos or works in progress, they are fully functioning and have lots of users but need so much more.  Make these the killer apps that they are.

I have always felt a bit of the thought process that Bitcoin was a gold standard in a sea of cryptocurrencies, however the fact that there are so many other currencies I believe prevents a lot of growth overall for a type of technology we all do agree with, even though many coins means we all agree but with slight differences.
I also see Amazon and Ebay and Etsy and so many websites taking Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Paypal, etc.   Without anyone forcing you to use any cryptocurrency you wouldn't want to, it feels like a huge win win for Bitcoin users and other crypto coin users to have a marketplace to interact on that is different than just the Crypto Exchanges we currently have.

I had that apprehension about sharing this link at first, but in the end I honestly don't care about anyone putting their favorite coin or crypto related thing to the forefront though, if you are not spamming but putting good information out there, that is what counts.   I believe that people should not be sticking to just one currency anyways but supporting technologies that will work for them, and usually that will not come with just one coin.

Like I said, "needs to be perfected and get a push"     I would be a liar to say I found Bitsquare successful in it's older form, I loved every aspect about it, but it is not as simple as open the program click and buy like Coinbase is yet, but I believe if it is not within Bisq, there will be an application coming that will be *the* decentralized exchange.

There is more than plenty of help if you are having any issues at all, latest builds have been pretty solid, head over to if you need any help for real, the program is only improving and more users keep coming in.

After reading the article, do you mean Coinbase completely disses Bitcoin, still claims to support it, but just really tears it a new one by making it as though it has to do what Ethereum is doing.  Because "turns down" is a nicer way to put it.

I am not, I am not sure if the Fleming Family Farm is, or if Duosear.ch even offers such a service, because this is the first I've heard if they do.

I was hoping eGifter or Gyft would be doing some kind of bonus promotion on their pizza cards for today.   I still think I'll order a pie with BTC.   Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day everyone!

Wow, that is good to hear.  I have given $5, no joke, and just glad knowing there are real larger donations being made to progress this project.   Thank you for your help, I don't work for OB, but have received personal help from some of the OB1 devs who are daily busting their ass on some thing related to Bazaar because of donations I'm sure that motivate them to keep pushing on.

A donation to the OB1 foundation.    My first physical purchase coming soon, not for lack of choices of cool stuff, just lack of spending funds at the moment.   I just jotted down some favorite stores in another post, here are those, and I made the links clickable to Duosear.ch, so if the vendor is online it will pull up in your web browser
CHINA NUMBA ONE !! got me with both solid products and variety, plus humor  [ob://a930c023c05be077f2bdb56b68f91ba68f4aa5df/store](
The products here make me larf, on top of good descrips, I like the thumbnails too  [ob://
I like seeing Legos [ob:// and Little Pet Shop [ob://
There are ton of cool artists, here are just a few I like seeing their work and hope to see more [ob://

It depends on the vendor / seller as well as product I'm sure.  
I personally only use USPS Priority on my Bazaar, comes with both insurance as well as tracking. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:17:37
TOR is on OpenBazaar's roadmap, hopefully people who are only not using OB because of it not being Dark Net enough, will help code the way to something better.    Whenever Shapeshift integration with OpenBazaar goes on, it will be a real mover and shaker for Bitcoin even more than the little waves it has made. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:46:16
Wow, that does make it much better, I did not know they were considering hosting, not sure if that  path would have turned out good for OpenBazaar in the end.

A quick search for "Eggs" on OpenBazaar using DuoSear.ch shows [both fresh eggs as well as army ration supply options](        I would suggest giving them a link to [The Farmers Market store](    Send the people a message, you'd be surprised most people are willing to ship international if someone is okay to pay the fees.

What is your case that you are trying to make?   Did you see the items that the 3 sales cost?  It wasn't like 3 one dollar sales.   I deal in items priced all over the place, I got 6 sales in a month, I expected 0, but the cost has been so far been free, including a move to a VPS, if you or anyone needs a coupon I got one for DigitalOcean for $10 credit.

@_date: 2016-05-31 12:16:36
Ah, I am not offended, this is all text and opinion, not sure where you got that vibe lol.  I guess it is your opinion that 3 sales on larger priced items would be considered a small thing, so we just differ from that, no need to apologize.    I think you should put your expectations on a program that has literally been open only a month a little lower, and see the sales being made right now is a big thing, people are willing to throw there money at all into these untested waters means a lot.  Because of those early sales, the dev teams gets motivated to work harder, and now we have already a more stable app than we did when this all started.
Good luck on the store, make sure to hit up and the official OpenBazaar slack if you need help with anything, these are invaluable resources.

OB1 got funding, I remember hearing that during The Daily Decrypt episode that had a developer interview and he mentioned it I think.
["we’ve received $1 million in seed funding from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and angel investor William Mougayar to develop the OpenBazaar protocol and client, and build the first business on top of the OpenBazaar network"](

[Bazaar Hound - Mobile OpenBazaar app for Android, IOS, and Windows Mobile](
Just a week ago they posted an update on regarding [the adding of IPFS so we can have online stores for people not online](
Things are progressing but it definitely is not near final phase yet, but more than usable in it's current form for most people I think.   That first month was rough with connection issues and some operating systems not even working right, in a short time it has come a long way.

Had posted this on before seeing it had been posted on here on if anyone would like to discuss this with current Etsy users 
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:44:05
I had the same issues, moved onto DigitalOcean, was a pain in the ass, and documentation should definitely be updated just a little.  I had a ton of items not showing and other errors for a bit.   The devs need a guy on the side working for them doing clean up and making sure all these side things get done while the big issues are being tackled. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:32:23
I don't agree with this theory or where you get this as it is a 'should' thing, but I do like the theory and sounds nice.  Does it have any scientific merit?        Why should this be the way things should be, what is the positives and negatives to doing things another way?

Interesting, I don't think I have seen the OB1 guys be stubborn on the subject of altcoins, and I know a Shapeshift rep had been in the OB Slack early on, but compared to other things needing done I'm not sure if that is priority.   
I'm sure in the end an outside source will take care of payment method issues, as for people who use crypto currencies do not seem to have an issue with this, if they have one alt coin, they most likely have Bitcoin too.  It's more a matter of people just want more applications to use their coin is what seems to be an issue.
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:42:25
It is why a lot of us here still use Credit Cards over Bitcoin in a lot of cases, convenience.    I hope the people here who have given OB a try earlier on have re-given it a try, look in the [Mobile App]( and use the other means of searching like [BazaarBay]( or [DuoSear.ch]( rather than the built in discovery/search for now.
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:23:19
So basically the scientific merit here is this ideal sounds good in theory, which I agree, I'm still wondering if there is anything to back this up as a completely positive thing over the time the young one could be using just using the great tool or invention instead of needing to know how it is made before using it, as I know I personally live a life of using things I do not know how to make, and I gladly work hard to pay for other people to fix them when they break.  A car for example.
