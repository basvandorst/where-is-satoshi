I definitely agree with the concept. I’ve just never looked at the result in practice and wanted to make sure I understood why their blockchain size was smaller. Someone else sent me a link to find how full their blocks are. Practically empty. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:10:42
Ok that’s what I thought. I couldn’t find how filled their blocks were. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:19:27
Oh haha. Wow. Practically empty. Ok that explains it. That’s just what I was looking for. Thanks!

I don’t understand how you lost 30%. It says the whole $30 is available.

I was skeptical, but interested in bitcoin on and off since 2010. In 2017 I actually took the time to understand what it is and how it works. Been dollar cost averaging ever since.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:48:29
Right. But not everyone has $10k laying around ready to invest. So for most people to invest $10k they either take out loans and lump sum or dollar cost average the next 1-2 years. Regardless of if the loan ends up being more profitable, it’s still extremely risky and dollar cost averaging is the safer option. 
There are a lot of new people coming it and the faster they enter without knowing how this crazy fast this market works the less likely they are to stick with it.
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:12:21
Got it, awesome! Super excited for this to take off.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:53:42
It won’t be a straight line from here to 100k. Assuming you don’t have a stack of cash laying around, dollar cost averaging what you can afford is 100% the way to go.

Maybe that's our fundamental disagreement. I think if it is theoretically possible that it is also inevitable. Maybe not in my lifetime, but I believe it's inevitable. 
Either way, I think we both agree this hype cycle is bogus. :)
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:16:44
I’m not imagining it as some kind of being indistinguishable from a human. It may be able to mimic that but would be a general super intelligence that you can ask any question and it could answer no matter how abstract and no matter if has ever been asked before. Recreating the human brain was just one example, but there are plenty of ideas being worked on. But say we do only recreate the human brain and has our same logic/reasoning/deductive skills. When you pair that with instant access to any memory it or anyone else has every had. That would still be several orders of magnitude smarter than any human. I think it’s clear querying/understanding all of current human knowledge instantly can happen already. So that is no question a problem for this type of machine. The only question is does physics prevent that intelligence from answering new questions faster than a human. If so then maybe we are stuck with a machine only a few order of magnitudes smarter. But if it can be faster, then we get to the point where it is working on new problems at the rate of 50% faster than the collective human rate or in top cases it can answer new problems in seconds that would take humans several lifetimes.
Edit: sorry if that became incoherent, I was typing that and talking to my Uber driver at the same time. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:40:45
Right, so that’s a 20% fee which is outrageous. I agree you should dollar cost average if you are getting in, but you should lump them by month for lower fees.

��Actually, the average human has less than 1 testicle.

Ive seen people tip using like !lntip 10. But I don't see in there how to deposit to the bot to be able to send any.
Edit: figured it out.

I love the invoicing feature. I haven’t seen this in any other wallets. Is this unique to lightning or can you do this on the main chain? 
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:50:36
I used the emoji with glasses, of course it takes tri-balls into account. But less guys have 3 testicles than guys with 0 or 1.
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:11:47
But this shows me a descriptions of the transations and preloads the amount. Maybe I just havent seen that before. To be honest I've only ever sent funds to myself using coinbase and ledger.

While this is true, UX in crypto still isn’t great. It’s more secure on Coinbase that it is in a wallet you lost the keys to. Just make sure you understand how the wallets work and have everything backed up before you start moving it to your own wallet. And once you have something, send a little back and forth to make sure you understand before you send it all. 
As far as wallets, if you can buy a ledger right away go ahead and do that. Otherwise start with something like exodus on your laptop and then get a ledger when you have more than you’re willing to lost built up. Ledgers are like 60USD these days since the new one was announced so they’re not bad.

My question is, what is 4D printing supposed to be?

What limitation do you see that makes a general intelligence impossible? The human brain exists, there’s no reason it can’t be recreated.

I’m visiting India now. I didn’t realize it was restricted. It’s a shame too because they already pay for most things using a QR code so they’ve got half the UX already integrated.

People forget 99% of the population doesn't know how Bitcoin works. Unless we start inviting new people and not shaming them away it will stay that way.
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:12:16
I use Trust on mobile or you can do Exodus on desktop. If you have more than like $1,000 in Crypto though I would buy a ledger. I think they're even still 30% off.

They got upset that the bitcoin subreddit doesn’t allow BCash talk. Which makes sense to me for the same reason we don’t discuss dogecoin here, it’s the bitcoin subreddit.

Ah ok. I was wondering if they would stay tied up in limbo. Sounds like no. thanks!

Ah thank you. I will be sure to update that for the next release.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:25:30
In my experience you can send to an old address just fine. I assume they are different public addresses for the same private key. But of course if you're sending to any keys you don't own you should be more careful. It's most useful for sending to my Ledger or MetaMask from Coinbase without needing to be near a computer.
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:34:04
What does this even mean?
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:41:56

@_date: 2018-12-22 04:25:59
Don’t listen to people. Prepare to hold for a few years and don’t try day trading. Once you have a portfolio and want to try swing trading fine, but aside from that, do your research and invest in the right projects and hold. Btc of course will be the safest but Eth is pretty safe as well. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:24:05
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:47:57
Follow up question, I use "public key" or "address" in the App description. Which one of those are correct for what Im saving? I've always used them interchangeably but am learning now that that's wrong so I just want to make sure I have it straight. Is "Address" is the only correct name for what I'm saving?

Can you earn money running a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:23:20
I just use it for sending money around without having to have all the wallets with me. I mostly use it for sending money from Coinbase or Binance to Meta Mask or my Ledger without having to be near a computer or get my ledger out of my safe. It's also nice to have them all in one place where I can go to the blockchain explorer for whatever coins I have and encourage my paranoia that everything is still there.
Edit: Think of it as just a phone book.
