Market correction (the last four months of last year saw stupid growth)
Market manipulation (whales are working together to keep prices low)
FUD (truck loads of drama and fake news have flooded the crypto world as of late)
Tax time (people don’t have as much money to put into crypto at the moment)
No new buyers (a lot of exchanges had to stop taking new registrations because they were inundated with requests)
Take your pick. Any way you slice it I give it another month before shit takes off again. 2017 was the year when everyone bought hype, there was nothing tangible behind any of these coins other than speculation. 2018 is when these coins put up or shut up.

Nah the problem is he’s getting all the limelight. They interviewed him on Moneytalks(MSNBC I think) where he was supposed to talk about bitcoin rolling out LN and what it would mean for the system. He instead shit on bitcoin, saying txns cost like$100 per or something, and shilled the hell out of bcash.

It doesn’t. The tax plan (from what I’ve seen) only comes into play when you decide to cash out. The US government doesn’t give a shit about your funny money, but you can bet your ass they want their cut when you return to the fold.

They already have bots that are accurately(ish) predicting coin ups and downs. The only thing that really stops the entire process from becoming automated is the captcha most exchanges have. Outside of that I don’t see what would stop someone from running a bot once he’s logged in. But, that shouldn’t discourage you. Even with quantum computing these algorithms are still running on “best guesses”, they’re just able to crunch a lot more numbers than people. 
As for the trust thing: I trust these exchanges about as far as I can throw my computer. What I DO trust is a collective amount of random(multiple source) individuals who use said app without a hitch. The beauty about crypto currency for me (I go cross eyed from white papers) is that you can usually find a forum where someone gives the laymen’s version after giving the system a once over. 
The best thing to do, as is with anything in the crypto world: research. And then research that research, wait a few days and panic then go all in?
Edit: words

Why not? They insure your wallet in the states and they have a good exchange
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:08:52
As far as I know your best option is a hardware wallet. I don’t know of any wallet that holds those coins together.
That being said, I’m of the mind that more wallets is better, assuming of course you have a foolproof way of storing your seeds and passwords. I never liked the idea of putting all my eggs in one basket. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:15:36
Just keep it in Coinbase. They charge a hefty fee for moving bitcoin, but if you’re in the US they insure like $250k if you leave it with the . If you’re worried about security just enable 2FA and you’re good. When/if you feel like trading use Gdax, it’s Coinbase’s exchange so they’ll be nicer with the fees
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:29:01
What do you mean cash payouts? I thought futures was agreeing to buy BTC at a later date for a set amount, regardless of what the actual price is at that date?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:39:04
He’s implying that buying once simply isn’t enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:00:03
24 and climbing!
...oh :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:35:16
Don’t use localbitcoins. That place is shady as shit and many places (Coinbase included) will remove your account if you’re using it.

Nicehash is a one stop shop for mining that will pick the most profitable algorithm for your computer and pay you in bitcoin. My 970 gets me about 1.50/day. I use “one click miner” to mine vertcoin (mainly because I love vertcoin, but they just halved the block reward so it may not be that worthwhile anymore), or you could try minergate, which will probably have you mining monero. If you’re looking for a little more DIY, you could check out ccminer or cgminer, which will allow you to choose which coin you mine. They require a bit more input on your part, but the process is easily explained by google. 
Realistically though nowadays I haven’t found a coin that’s “profitable” to mine. Machines specifically designed for mining have completely taken over big game coins like bitcoin. I’ve been aiming more towards any miner that’ll give me a relatively large volume of coin in the hopes that it’ll be worth more money in the future. If that’s your aim, I’ve been using minergate to mine BCN with my cpu (I still use my gpu to mine vertcoin as mentioned above) and I’ve gotten about 400 coins. At the moment those 400 are only worth like a dollar but I’ve got my fingers crossed.

If you’re strictly sticking to bitcoin, pick somewhere that trades USDT.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:38:35
I’m willing to bet banks already have a decent sized hand in the crypto pot, or at least a plan to get it there. The real issue to be worried about is government regulation. Countries banning crypto exchanges is what hurts the market, and being in the US I’ve already run into a few exchanges that cant/won’t do business here. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:44:10
I think part of it is that bitcoin is the backbone for most other currencies. When BTC does well so does everything else, same for the opposite
I’m curious as to where coinbase gets their numbers. They’re always a good $2-300 USD/BTC above each exchange I follow. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:25:54
All of the coins I follow have a subreddit (although a lot of posts are just hype) and I’ve become a lot more involved on twitter since getting into crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:32:46
Where is this chart you speak of?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:25:16
Could you point me in the direction of where I could learn how to read graphs?

The question is: are all of these maybes worth 10 grand?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:31:36
If you’re having doubts look at the rest of the world. Entire *countries* are looking towards crypto currency because their paper money is shit. 
Wait for the dip, buy a little, wait for the dip, buy a little. Suddenly you’ve spent 5k and made 10
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:49:38
Could be whoever they were making the bet against felt the same way as you and set a silly price point? 
The way btc swings is it really that unrealistic to think it’ll hit 18k next month?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:28:08
They’re not buying bitcoin, they’re gambling on what the value will be. There’s no crypto exchange in the futures market, it’s all cash
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:49:26
I think the only place you’ll get btc unverified is at a btc atm
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:47:10
What coins do you have? Most altcoins will offer a wallet on their page. A few places you can get a (semi)all-in-one like Ethereum Wallet (any erc20 tokens, which you can check at etherscan.io) Exodus, and probably some others. 
Alternatively you could pick up a hardware wallet like the ledger nano. They’re relatively cheap and probably the most secure way to store your wallet, and from what I understand they can hold most coins
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:27:03
MakerDAO coming soon. Competition for USDT. Although to be honest I have no idea if we’re allowed to use it in the US :/
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:21:40
It works out. BTC goes up to 13k, new people panic and sell while the veterans wait for the price to dip and buy more BTC. Rinse and repeat
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:45:47
God damn really? Maybe they’ve been really busy lately I should look into that
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:17:20
Mining bitcoin with an “entry level” rig won’t give much. I use a gtx 970 and nicehash offers like $1.00/day. Look for a coin that is asic resistant
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:57:43
How are you sure it’s not miota?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:24:21
Coinbase is good. They insure your wallet if you’re in the US. As for the 1mil it’s pure speculation. Some people say it’ll crash and some people say it’ll skyrocket. Just gotta take your chances and hodl on for the ride
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:42:18
Yes, every wallet will have a fee. There are a few places that will allow you to download their client which comes with a wallet and exchange app, generally they won’t charge a fee if you’re just moving to/from their exchange. I believe there’s also a few that will waive fees if you download their Blockchain and run a node
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:19:53
Buying hash power doesn’t pay off until you start putting in serious cash, same generally applies to faucets. If you can only afford to buy $20 at a time, buy $20. You’ll make more with bitcoin then you will with it sitting in your bank
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:44:53
If BTC dips to 3k I’m putting all my money into it
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:42:03
Fuck Bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:03:00
Coinbase and CEX.IO will exchange BTC for USD, however most places charge a decent fee for converting BTC to cash. The best option might be to exchange to a different currency (Coinbase will exchange both ETH and LTC to USD, for example) and then exchange to USD
Edit: although at this point you may want to consider forgetting about it again if it’s money you can do without. There’s no telling how high bitcoin could go
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:01:48
So this is just a shit ton of people selling simply because Bitcoin hit 10/11k?
edit: Would you say there's a certain coin that is better to be holding right now while it levels out?
