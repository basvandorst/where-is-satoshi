I know you're looking for a mobile wallet, but consider a hardware wallet too. I highly highly recommend the [Trezor hardware wallet]( It holds up to 10+ different cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, ETH) and it's the most secure cold storage hardware wallet solution on the market right now. Also supports segwit. Never had a problem with it, works flawlessly. I actually have 2 for redundancy.

Yeah that's right

I agree. The idea of updating bitcoin is good, but if you do it too much I think it starts to hurt the credibility.

Well technically the idea is the community would move over to the best version after a fork. But your right, it doesnt effect the original bitcoin, they are just copies with new features or fixes.
My point if bitcoin has a fork every two years, bitcoin's credibility is much higher rather than a fork every 2 weeks, because with forks comes inherent market price instability and that is risky for outside investors looking at the tech.

Right. The benefit is the hardware wallet is not connected to the internet so you are immune to hackers and if you need to transfer coins out, it is secure (and I'll add very easy to do).

Actually even if it gets jacked the thief cannot steal your coins because of 2ndary passwords and pins.
And if it does get stolen you can recover all your coins on a second ledger nano s :)

If security is a concern for you, I highly highly recommend the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. You can get one here:

Glad you're protected. I personally like the ledger nano s more, but to each their own! For anyone interested:  
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:45:40
Both are open source I believe.

I highly recommend a hardware wallet over paper wallet. I have two of these and I love them: 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:13:20
Try this secure hardware wallet for BTC. I have two and I love them. Super secure, easy to use, and better than a paper wallet. Get it here:

And... This is why everyone should have an offline hardware wallet for their bitcoin. I have two and I love them. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:10:54
I would stick with the Ledger Nano S:

The problem with a paper wallet is it can burn up, get lost or stolen, and is tough to move coins around if you want. I highly highly recommend the Ledger Nano S, which you can get here:  I have two and they work flawlessly.

A paper wallet is simply pointing your coins to an unused address. However it can be a hassle. A cold storage hardware wallet offers the same security but you don't have to worry about losing it or having the piece of paper catch on fire and disappear. I have two of these and they offer the best security for BTC. I love them: 
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:02:54
I doubt any
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:47:44
I would say stick to the top 20 coins (by market cap) and no further. Some alt coins that I like are sia, ripple, and eth. Remember to do your homework before you ever invest. Each tends to have it's own niche.

If you do go the hardware wallet route, I highly recommend the Ledger Nano S, which you can get here: 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:50:06
The Ledger Nano S is very good. I have two. I split my coins up between these two just in case one of my wallets are double generated. I know this is not really worth worrying about but I have enough money in crypto that I'd rather be safe. You can get them here:  The ledger is really only stored online, so coins are "pointed" to your address and that's it. The USB only allows access to your coins on that address.

I would read all the comments on this thread, there is some really good advice here. I would also go with the highest security cold storage hardware wallet on the market:  I have two.

True. As long as you still hold the secret.
