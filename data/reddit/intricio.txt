Keep in mind that this is the Ledger Nano, not the Ledger Nano S (which does have a screen and physical buttons). That being said, trusting the manufacturers and the software behind the wallets (the potential for exploits one day) is probably the largest risk factor you would face in using them. Both companies have a pretty good track record though. If you have concerns and hold a considerable amount in BTC, you could always go for Cryptosteel or something similar. I personally use a Ledger Nano S though and hold 5 figures in BTC.

Try shapeshift.io/txStat/addressyousentthemto
Will tell you the status of the transactions. I've been waiting on some assets for over two days after opening a support ticket so, I would get something in soon seems like there are massive delays at the moment.
EDIT: They finally put the transaction through, at the same rate that ether cost 2.5 days ago effectively losing me 300 USD (14% of the value) by holding on to it that long. I would be weary when using ShapeShift in the future.

99% of the time, transactions have no issues and if they do fail, support is really good about taking care of it - there is even an auto return usually if something goes wrong. No idea what has happened recently though, lots of issues.

Sorry to hear that, unless you can recover the laptop, you likely are. I'm sure you don't want to hear this but FYI, keep a backup in a safe place next time or better yet - grab a hardware wallet (make sure to always have backups though no matter what method of storage you use).
