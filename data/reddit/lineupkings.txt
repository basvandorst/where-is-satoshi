Have no clue - it's just a representation - but Carter Worth on CNBC seems to think there is balance growing in the bitcoin ecosystem.

When do channels have to be closed and when the channel is closed does it take all of the microtxs and make them into one tx to add to the blockchain or are they still a bunch of microtxs?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:26:35
Is society balanced now?  What economic system created the need for homeless shelters anyway? With a fixed money supply, spending is not restricted as the value that a global currency would replace is not lost but becomes the value of the replacing currency.  This is not an overnight thing and will take time.  Probably why Satoshi designed the release of bitcoins to decrease over time.  imho I see many, many great possibilities on the horizon, especially for altruism

Can LN users will avoid closing channels to avoid the high tx fees?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:59:26
When it's looked at that way it totally disregards the needs of the miners.  As coins get harder to mine, tx fees become increasingly important to the miners.  They also have a say in this and here we are.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:53:33
Time will tell :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:21:30
but if people avoid paying ANY tx fees by keeping channels open indefinitely, where does that leave the miners?  Where is the motivation for a channel to ever be closed?  Would the fees only come from large purchases where a transactional record is desirable?

"where spending is discouraged, what motivation will they have to donate to charity"  -  With a fixed currency like bitcoin, spending is not discouraged - only speculation.  People will spend freely as they do now but will increasingly choose quality over quantity.  When a money supply is fixed, the costs of goods goes down (or up) over time to reflect the real value that they provide to society in general.  What do you think created the need for those homeless shelters?  Booms and busts in the economy.  A fixed currency stabilizes the economy.
"Manufactures would only produce as much as is needed, which would be less, overall."  - isn't anything more only speculation?

How long can a channel remain open?  Indefinitely?  The blockchain is the backbone of bitcoin and therefore the maintenance of the blockchain has to be the first consideration in any decision which means, as bitcoins become harder to mine and the large mining operations retreat from lack of profitability, the remaining miners will increasingly rely on txs fees to pay their labor.  Without miners, the blockchain will cease to exist and hence bitcoin.  Future maintenance and hence txs fees need to be the primary consideration in any changes.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:58:06
but the number of coins released is halving about every 4 yrs hence less reward - same effort.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:33:02
Bitcoin won't fix it but it will provide a new pathway where humanity's focus is no longer money centric.  What will we build, create, share, enjoy - only time will tell.

@_date: 2018-01-08 16:30:18
So all of the microtxs that happen after opening a channel are closed on chain as one transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:23:42
or 100 Satoshis
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:25:19
If all of the microtxs are added individually to the chain at closing there would still be the same amount of transactions needing to be verified as there are now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:06:48
"harder" probably wasn't the word to use.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:37:51
Our social structure is rooted in our economic structure.  The two can't be separated.  A perfect example is the exodus of people from the country to the city over the past 100 years in search of a more economically secure life.

It's called 'cut and paste' - it's only a 'what if' representation.

Not sure but the accumulated wealth of all the world has got to be huge.

"You cannot own more cash than the total capacity of your open channels"  What's that mean?  Shouldn't it read "You cannot own less cash than the total capacity of your open channels"  
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:24:57
Bitcoin is the most public of all currencies.  My post was just meant as sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:24:45
Is there a limit on the Bitcoin capacity of an open channel?  In the future 1 Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars and hence thousands (or millions) of transactions without closing to chain.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:11:16
Yes I can
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:05:21
Do you think Satoshi - with his absolutely brilliant and elegant blockchain - would not recognize the need for increased block size as transactions increase. If even one 'miner' doesn't make the switch to an 'upgrade' , it will eventually fail. Consensus is consensus no matter if you would like to have it differently. The blockchain will increase the block size naturally when the needed parameters have been met. Patience.

Over time, a monetary system based in bitcoin will not allow any economic bubbles and will pop those economic bubbles that are still being created as we speak.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:36:21
Bull***t!   A fixed currency, which bitcoin will become increasingly over time, is the poster child for a stable financial system. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:42:35
Thanks for your service in keeping value in bitcoin. HODL'ers protect bitcoin from crashes.  The real heroes behind bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:33:17
HODL'ers are the backbone of bitcoin as it grows stronger. Without HODL'ers the value of bitcoin would hit zero in a fear based dump scenario.  The HODL'ers keep it from falling below a certain value.  
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:17:49
I agree 100%.  But during the transition between here and there bitcoin has and will continue to have challenges to its legitimacy which can only be met through periodic value calls which level is maintained by HODL'ers.  Miners are incentivized to seek basement prices, but true HODL'ers do so for a very different reason that is Egalitarian in nature.  The cost to produce one bitcoin at the moment is less of an indicator of value to the general public than demand for bitcoin based on the scarcity of value within the rest of the financial system. 
People will spend it and it will continue to grow in that regards, but this is a monumental paradigm shift for the general public that will take time grow.   In time HODL'ing will give way to increased use but during bitcoin's infant years, HODL'ing is the most important factor to maintain bitcoin's existence and increase its perceived value to the general public relative to the current financial structure.

Well said brother 
@_date: 2018-03-04 01:36:24
Of course it does with the biggest being that a decentralized, fixed currency will have a huge, positive impact on the general population - especially those with skills that will be able to create value within a new monetary system that seeks such value.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:25:51
AGREE!  HODL growing pains. Buy it, store it, HODL it and forget about it. Bitcoin has a mission and for those who understand that mission and how public sentiment and use will continue to increase, bitcoin will reward them well. For those of you that are susceptible to FUD, just know that bitcoin has "crashed" so many times in the past and true HODL'ers know this is just another "Thang". Here's a brief history of bitcoin's past "crashes" -
1. Lost 30% from January 12, 2012 – January 27, 2012
2. Lost 57% from August 17, 2012 – August 19, 2012
3. Lost 33% from March 6, 2013 – March 7, 2013
4. Lost 35% from March 21, 2013 – March 23, 2013
5. Lost 83% from April 10, 2013 – April 12, 2013
6. Lost 50% from November 19, 2013 – November 19, 2013
7. Lost 87% from November 30, 2013 – January 14, 2015
8. Lost 34% from March 10, 2017 – March 25, 2017
9. Lost 33% from May 25, 2017 – May 27, 2017
10. Lost 39% from June 12, 2017 – July 16, 2017
11. Lost 40% from September 2, 2017 – September 15, 2017
12. Lost 30% from November 8, 2017 – November 12, 2017
13. Lost 70 from December 17, 2017 – February 6, 2018
My advise to all of you is to just buy, store, HODL and forget the FUD news. Peace
