Buy in the dips, use your bitcoin when it's used as currency ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:17:35
I think what's happening with btc and bcc is pretty shit and believe bcc is playin quite dirty. You do have a very good point tho.

@_date: 2017-08-29 14:20:43
Hmm intresting 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:37:30
If btc is around in 15 years I'll be very surprised if it's only worth 100k.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:22:36
They just got a new customer!

If you want to do transactions use litecoin if you want a store of value use btc

I set some btc 8 hours ago and it still hasn't gone through. This is pretty mad 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:21:51
It's completely up to you. I personally don't this will happen now, bitcoin I'd getting massive exposure and is in the news every day. Network effect is a big thing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:57:56
Far far far worse lol 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:05:39

Clearly you're new here. Crypto currencies don't follow trend line or and rarely has points of resistance. An old school trader would be seriously freaked out at crypto charts.

Good work dude! I hope your proud, you should be! 
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:33:43
Adding to this, on one of your previous posts you said "I've learnt my lesson" when talking about trading and you're now a HODLER 
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:48:09
So is there any way to look at my private key on my trezor or is it just locked away for my own safety? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:09:38
Well it's true really..
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:44:08
Can you expand on this? What do you mean by a family short? Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:35:18
So no transactions have gone through in the last 2 hours?

I'd actually cry with laughter. And then it'd turn to rage as they get said bailout.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:55:46
And I thought coinbase were thieves!

Do you realise that when thaad blows up nuclear missiles the nuclear misslies don't actually detonate? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:46:01
Keep calm dude. Give it 6 months and you'll realise how silly it was to doubt the hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:49:38
That's when profits get cray cray in a bad way

I'd love to try and support on the tech side more but I don't know a thing about coding or cryptography at all! Well done tho pal, sounds ace! 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:47:35
I love them both so so much.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:35:41
Yeah, that's a bit harsh mate.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:45:29
Exposure is exposure.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:18:56
Neutral would be good, but opinions make it intresting.

Ive been wanting to get an atm to help the spread of bitcoin but it's a little to much for me to afford so I thought about getting one of these. Can anyone help to explain to me how it works and if it's worth getting one? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:27:31
What the hell are atomic swaps?
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:24:52
I do feel bad for them tho. A lot of the guys at btc really believe in this! It's a shame. People will lose money, it's not a joke it's actually quite upsetting.
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:19:12
That's actually a really bloody good idea!

Shit alt coin. No fundamentals behind it
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:38:32
Hahahaha ahh that made me giggle. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:19:07
Urm.. Wat?
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:25:09
Genuinely brilliant article. If a bitcoin doomsday article ever rattles you a little just take a deep breath, read this article again and HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:42:03
So they can choose what blocks they mine? I don't really get any of it. I just know he's a dick.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:46:01
Keep calm dude. Give it 6 months and you'll realise how silly it was to doubt the hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:59:16
But even when there is good bitcoin news they still write a slanderous article.

Really proud of the UK. We're doing quite well!

I like it, have a thumbs up.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:42:14
I paid 0.01 and got £40 so not great but not awful 
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:56:05
They seriously need a watch with the bitcoin price shown in real time 
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:32:45
Oh my. You just changed the game.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:08:06
Look how long bitconnect has been going. Everyone knows it's a ponzi scheme and people have made bank from investing in it 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:17:28
People fail to realise how extremely manipulated markets harm bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:17:56
I'm proven wrong! I thought the ATH was like 6400 sorry guys.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:37:54

More likely to win the lottery a billion times in a row than generate the same key.

Try and beat my trading record. 100% profitable trades. My secret? It's HODL ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:47:17
You don't Bro. It's just not worth it!
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:24:02
It's a ponzi scheme. But the question is how long it'll be around. If it around for quite a long time then there's crypto to be made from it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:41:05
Sorry for your loss, but keep us updated. this is intriguing.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:30:57
Should be fine pal, I do it all the time. Just make sure your address is put in properly 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:20:47
Gold is lame. For the same price I'd rather just buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:13:05
I don't think it does in all honesty 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:27:42
What did you set that up with? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:08:16
Doubt it
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:19:28
Where are you based dude? Have a look on meetup there's quite a lot of events organised for crypto on there all over the country 
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:04:24

This x10000
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:28:27
So you're just here to make money on trades? Then go trade something else. Some of us actually believe in bitcoin and want it to grow, this will most certainly mean being able to buy coffee with it. Do you realise how selfish you sound? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:33:32
Cry more plz

It's the new £1 we have 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:08:52
Even with quantum computing the time it would take to crack the cryptography used in bitcoin is a very long time.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:43:18
Because they need new coins to swap and mix in with dirty coins 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:27:21
Urm dead post but whatever 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:45:21
Thanks, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:54:28
What exchanges do you guys use to trade on? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:37:43
That's what I'm thinking. Get in early and get out with my profits before the crash.
