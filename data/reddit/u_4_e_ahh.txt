Sometimes I wish I didnt delete my old account on here. I've been saying since mid June that we would be going to 6k-6500. And that prime buying zone for BTC is 5 to 7k.
And here we are.

Bet a BTC

Lmao. You actually believe they dont know how to seize your Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:08:37
For real. Just look at the log charts.  
Shit just look at the regular day charts. It's clear as day.

Asshat who just started crypto. You guys are on fire today.

Gentlemen have a glorious day. Dont forget, keep them private keys private!

Agreed. 6k is the bottom. Been saying it for a looong time myself.
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:31:28
6k is bottom from the run up to 13k-14k we had.
Then we start the climb. It's in the log charts
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:12:48
Down to 6k_ish. Then the smile will form
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:15:09
6k-ish is the new low from the recent spike to 13k-14k months ago.

Yup. It's a manufactured lie. There have been past oil reserves that were sucked dry of their contents only to be found to have refilled.

It's never touching 3k again.  3k was the needed bottom post the run to 20k.  
From there we had that mini run back to 13-14k or whatever it was a  while  ago. And got rejected.  
6-7k is the new low IMO.  It's a GREAT buy zone. And I think we are gonna hit it.
From there we will start making the climb to new ATH past 20k. And the log charts are playing out perfectly for that to happen coinciding with the upcoming halving.
