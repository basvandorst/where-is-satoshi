Ok so I did some of the math:  
In 2010 Total budget was **$3,550,000,000,000**.  
1/1000th of that would be **$3,550,000,000**.  
Bitcoin Price at the time was around **$0.07**.  
Bitcoin Price now: **$11,000**.
  
That would buy you **50,714,285,714.285 bitcoins**, which obviously are never going to exist, so assuming you bought the max bitcoins available at the time.  
  
Worst Case, buy all BitCoins on Jan 1, 2010:  
Total Bitcoins: **1,635,850**  
Total Cost: **$114,509.50**  
Total Value Today: **$17,994,350,000**  
Total Profits: **$17,994,235,490.50**  
Best Case, buy all BitCoins on Dec 31, 2010:  
Total Bitcoins: **5,027,250**  
Total Cost: **$351,907.50**  
Total Value Today: **$55,299,750,000**  
Total Profits: **$55,299,398,092.50**  
US National debt according to usdebtclock is at **~$20,633,700,620,000**.  
Worst case US would have a remaining debt of **$20,615,706,384,509.50**  
Best case US would have a remaining debt of **$20,578,401,221,907.50**  
So basically you'd have to buy out bitcoin, assume it wont affect it, hold it until now, and your debt wouldn't change much. Sorry :(
