Police Report... if this guy is stealing bitcoins like this, he's definitely into all kinds of other stuff the police would love to happen upon while investigating this.
edit: Oh, and I assure you, if it's a major metro area like you claim, the police there definitely have a Cybercrime unit and I bet you all of their detectives know about bitcoin, just an FYI

I see where you're coming from, but the only thing keeping BTC from hitting 2 trillion dollars is the advent of other similar currencies spawning.

Space travel and colonization is a huge luxury, there are more pressing issues going on back down here on earth that need attention first.

Yes, people are doubling their money off this chaos.

I'm starting to see a trend of people complementing terrible grammar as being good.  I think the literacy level of our population is slowly decreasing.

Now 111, and I sit here waiting to get verified as the price goes up.

You act like this is the first time Gox has dropped the ball.  The fact is, they have their shit together more so than any other exchange right now.
People keep thinking the grass is greener, but I guarantee a fraction of the horsepower used to "DDoS" Gox would cripple any other exchange.  People think the other exchanges are better because they're not getting attacked, but it's because they're obscure and account for a fraction of the trades that Gox does.

You don't have to time an absolute bottom, but you'll get a feel for the bottom after a few weeks, give or take $50 USD

If you're of the technical know-how to complete a Bitcoin transaction, you're also of the technical know-how to find free porn on the damn internet.

Why would it not recover as long as vendors still accept Bitcoin?  It's supply and demand with a limited supply of bitcoins
edit: I wish they'd crash it down to $1 and I'd buy $1,000 worth
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:30:15
I'm actually curious as to what exchanges you think have better security and can handle a similar DDoS more effectively?  I'll be waiting.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:43:28
Yea, the price is anyone's guess... but it'll never completely crash like a pump-n-dump stock as long as a BTC still has value, aka places selling goods and services.
As for the price, that's anyone's guess.  I don't think BTC is a 2 billion dollar market yet, that's for sure, but it's getting there.

Actually, it is a get rich quick scheme for the time being, the smarter people know how to play and the dumb masses who have no idea how finances work will help the benefactors cash out on their dime.
