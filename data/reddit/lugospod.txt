Everybody is saying this and still the price goes sideways or down :)))
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:27:12
If it breaks the 11k line it wil go down... lets hope it holds
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:00:46
There is no reason....
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:51
So basically it should stop falling tommorow when they all sold ?
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:56:20
This is what will cause the problem in the future because nobody is using bitcoin... everyone is HODL-ing it just as an investment...
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:51:21
Because everybody is buying :)) that is the only reason that shitcoins and coins with only a whitepaper moon :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:48:39
How is a bigger potential returns for those that bought over 10k? :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:45:48
They are also making money shirting btc :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:03:44
Can you explan this? What happens when they expire?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:20:51
Nothing to do with the bubble... just “news” from trouble making east
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:58:19
And how do you know thee is a lot of new money coming in ?:)
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:45:44
I never saw a liquid coin/token that holds the same price...so your analysis is obviously incorrect :)))
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:25:14
I didn't FOMO... :) and it  went under 10k :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:20:26
don't buy yet
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:02:13
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:46:24
This shows that bitcoin is totally unpredictable :) you win some you lose some.... today you are rich and tomorrow you are poor in crypto :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:12:22
There is no basis for that... only pure whishful excpectation because people have BTC and the price chart shows that in history price usually goes up :) nothing more than that...
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:24:15
How will you know you are right?:)))  by checking back in 6 months and see if it 1$?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:49:12
hehehe, nice try :) nope, in my book that doesn't count... but, to bo precise, that one also goes up and down... :) current info from CMC:  Tether (USDT)
$1.01 USD (-0.37%) ... so it is moving most of the times :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:07:48
It is more likely that it will go deeper
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:18:53
That only shows that you don't have a lot of BTC :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:13:54
That is what everyone was talking about 15, 14, 13, 12...and soon for 11 and 10 :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:48:00
People always need a reason... whether it is a religion (death), politics (poverty) or now tether (BTC price droping)...
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:29:43
So the ones that sold ad 10-11k and buy on 7-8k will regret it? :)))) strange but ok :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:26:45
:)))) it is a recursion... new money comming in requires new money comming in :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:30:16
Casino and put it all on Black
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:03:24
Can you explain what is the point of writing comments like this? Or it is just puberty catching up?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:45
And down the rabbit hole we go :(
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:12:41
Nope, it't the fifth
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:47:57
That is the same story everyone was saying on 15k, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 and now on 9 :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:13:57
I though so yesterday...and and now it looks like I should have waited for a couple of weeks
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:35:26
Bitstamp or Binance
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:19:15
You are a pure optimist :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:54:37
I interpreted your comment as a general one. My bad:)
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:08:20
Or event more if you waited 2 weeks, etc..
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:33:27
i doubt it... there were a lot of technical analysis flying around that BTC will have another dip..who knows....
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:34:14
Oh, aren't you a gentleman :)
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:49:06
It's ok... it might go down, and it might do up...you never know.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:40:13
Yeap :(
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:58:59
I must be strange cause i dont like to loose :)))
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:49:41
not for me :) my bottom line  is 9k :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:33:59
Only if you are sure it will go up :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:24:06
Maybe they are counting on BTC getting closer to 8k and making a profit? :) I don't think this was panic selling...
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:56:02
Everybody has a selling point... it comes down to the question if you are willing to loose all your profits/sell and buy lower or minimize the loss...
This is a pretty big hit especially if you look at this that this is all base on one rumor from china
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:46:41
How easy people talk like that.. how can a new investor (in other words : newbies that increase the market cap) suppose to know that? Nobody know what btc will do... somebody bought at 15 and had a profit on ATH, and a lot bought after 15k and now they are taking serious loses... if everyone assumes that the price is goong down than nobody would ever invest and newbies wouldn’t be entering this market...
So I think that we should not talk “from above” to the people who are loosing money because it could just as easilY drop 50% beneath your or mine entry price... and then you would not like people saying “it is normal” :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:10:54
If we are talking honestly, then you don't know anything... you are guessing...so it might, and it might not go up or down... so basically you are showing&amp;displaying your psychic abilities to forsee the future :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:52:19
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:11:35
If it breaks 11900$
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:56
absolutely right
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:28:23
Indicators are just visualization...any analysis makes a "positive" prediction and a pessimistic prediction...and after that it is a 50/50 chance :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:46:16
Because for btc to go up 1500% a let of newbies had to enter the market and start buying... so every one of those newbies that bought after 11k is now in red... and telling them “it went up 16x in 2017 “ doesn’t help them in this situation...  so naturally they are afraid snd panicing.
This market needs newbies because without them there will not be a mass adoption...
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:07:01
nope, it will go down again,... bots playing arround now...
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:28:23
It only means that they didn’t put the order... some people put ordera in advance and some (like me) don’t
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:33:58
Condom :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:28:58
yeap...and it looks like it ain't over :(
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:19:58
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:20:04
Yes but still if it weren’t for the prople who bought after 5k than it would not go up :) so people who “made” profit made it on the backnof those who bought after them .. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:37:57
And by the time it reaches 5k you have no more money to invest :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:03:09
what does exactly "expiring futures contracts" mean? How does it reflect to the BTC price?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:47:30
I saw a couple of them today :)) and they didn't do any good :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:51:31
That is fine... my “guess” is that it will not go straight up... and very possibly it will go down until “someone” decides to buy a hell lot of btc...
And btw i wasn’t talking about the bull trap.. i was talking about the general prediction... if it will go to 5 or 15... that is a big unknown :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:36:08
It is not cheap enough yet :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:47:09
That is the risk... same way somebody holding is risking that it never goes up :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:17:51
Nope...Nobody is thinking about that anymore...now it is just pure panic :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:41:37
It was recognized in many technical analysis... it should go down to 7-8k and than up...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:57:51
No you didn't cause it didn't hit bottom yet
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:24:42
I am waiting for 8300
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:58:02
And here come the red ones again :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:14:12
key word is "probablY" :)))
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:20
Yes that is also important... but obviously a lot of people don’t see the value since we dropped a lot in just a couple of days...
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:39:55
Where did I say to ignore them? 
1st: interpretation of data is potentialy subjcetive
2nd: you could choos a wrong method to make a conclusion
And ofcourse you could make a perfect selection and perfect interpetation and make a perfect decision.
If you could be so kind and explain how did you know it would break the 10k line? Or that it would hold at 9,2? Or your conclusion was “it will go down to 5 or 6k?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:24:24
I am glad for you, but all of this is just speculations... no one can know what is going to happen with the price...it could have easily bounced from 10k and jumped to 13k.... anything is possible...and going to 8k is also a possibility... the rest is pure fiction :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:09:18
On Bitstamp there is no buy wall :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:35:38
It is at 50% for ath :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:44:57
Yes, but most of the "market cap" bought in the fall and winter..so those percentages mean nothing to them... HODL is great for those which bough early :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:04:50
that wall can wannish in a second :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:23:23
Depending on the financial law in you country :))
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:23:06
You invested in crypto and you dont have money for a tv?:) brave :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:20:01
and down the rabbit hole we go....
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:41:33
Is it your bread/rent money or your "drink" money you are investing?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:46:41
Heheh small transactions :) not such a big volume (i’m looking on bitstamp). But i am very glad for a liftoff :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:54:16
Ok. Maybe I just don’t see this :) doesn’t matter... as long as it is going up
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:34:34
You have to put bitcoin as a splash sreen when they turn the tv on :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:41:24
Oh.. it looks like we only need to ask politly :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:38:25
on bitstamp it is arround1,5 mil. $ :( obviously they won't let the BTC go up... this means it will go down...
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:44:12
Don’t think so... :) there isn’t that much pressure on new years eve to break such walls :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:47:18
that is why it is dropping some more? :)
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:17:42
It just means it is all FUD... emotions flying around...and only big players are making money in such chaos...
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:57:10
there will always be someone to sell...it all depends on their "entry" price...
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:31:55
so you did that so that "maybe" you grab 2% ? :) It has to be a lot of money to be worth the effort...
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:51:16
nope...weekends have love volume..and a lot of bots are playing so there is little chance of seeing it go so high...
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:35:25
they had the same chance of prediction as the ones that said it will moon.... 50/50 chance...
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:07:33
Don’t waste words in him... it’s like in horror movies where fear “feeds” the monsters, only here he feeds with words :))
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:51:46
in my opinion it will not go back to 10k until some whale starts buying and that will trigger others to start buying...
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:57:25
Nope.. they are not dumb.. just not experienced... and if werent for “dumb” money btc wouldnt have gone so high.. and it will remain low (from ath) until that same “dumb” money returns
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:56:09
he said that today we should sell for thether ad 330 bil.. and it is over that... and it will go to 250... then going up to 12k is impossible :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:41:34
Thank you for a useless information :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:35:54
It will try again..then maybe return and try again..until it succeeds.. there are no bad new so I don't see a drop...maybe horizontal but BTC doesn't like horizontal movement :) 
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:45:03
Such language was usually used by rasists :) you want me to learn how you make a predicition based on thin air?:) damn, really, i wish i new how to do that :) that is for sure a lesson that I would like to learn :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:49:46
They are doing so that newbies get FOMO feeling, and start buying...most of the time they succeed - that is why it is used all the time... unfortunately... 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:56:31
You saw that there could be a potential security breach on binance?:)))))) wooow :)
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:47:05
yes, but only for those that bought then :) how much is the percentage for poor guys that bough in December? :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:13:19
And what will you say when it doesn't reach 7k by monday? :)) surely it will be a smart excuse why you were wrong :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:23:24
nobody knows...bud there is chance that the "dip" might take the weekend off...
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:27:30
market cap is increasing nicely... lot of volume...it looks promising..
@_date: 2018-03-19 09:30:37
I was refering to i.e. Bitstamp....
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:07:43
we are? :) i see only bots playing around 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:43:59
average person doesn't care about that :) 
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:50:35
many have said that about 10, 9, 8... :)
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:08:34
or maybe he will have the last laugh if it goes to 7k :)
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:56:25
key point is "I Think" :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:56:12
People that are trying to buy at the “bottom” :)
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:04:46
Don't you get bored posting same comments? 16 days ago, 13 days ago, 3 days ago...and now again... fine, sell it all...but spare us your copy/paste posting :) ok ?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:41:28
Positive? He just said he doesn't see the benefit :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:08:57
You mean sold at the top?;)
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:57:28
and maybe it crashes to 5k.. you have no way of knowing what is going to happen...and possible those "people" maybe will be laughing back at ya...
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:27:26
Who bought on 19k?:)
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:57:36
Somebody is feeling lucky :) 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:03:42
You are calling it too early... i doubt it will go below 10,8k... whole market cap is going up
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:12:32
damn..puberty hit you hard... :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:40:01
yeap.. they bought low..and now selling it...10% in 10 minutes...nice job..
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:07:46
Don’t waste words in him... it’s like in horror movies where fear “feeds” the monsters, only here he feeds with words :))
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:58:12
it is not just low sales...low buy is also an impact... with a relatively small amount of BTC you can raise or reduce the price... 
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:05:44
yes...that definitely makes economical sense... the price off X will rise forever...
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:45:32
I didn't see that scenario lately :) yes it is possible...but currenltly unlikely..
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:21:45
if it doesnt break the 200 day average (9k) it will go lower
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:03:53
somebody on Bitstamp is playing with 490BTC order :) showing/hiding.... he has nothing smarter to do today i guess :)
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:39:44
Unless you expect the current 
position to be more fucked :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:37:19
Where did you get that idea?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:28:32
This is like watching clash of the titans...50BTC orders flying around like they are peanuts :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:40:58
and taxes
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:45:03
bots have no need for BTC to go high...they just need 1-2% up and down...thats it..
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:41:45
how is it falling? someone just bought 2000 BTC on bitstamp... the price went up 20% in less then 4 hours...
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:11:14
or he is selling it to himself...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:22:33
Oh.. puberty in action :) ok..
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:25:34
Do you want some bread with that?
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:56:21
One thing I like about this small dumps... it terminates the whole "moon", "lambo", "nobody can stop us" posts around here :) bad side, it brings out the "Oh, we gonna crash", "is is mt gox?", "whales are doing this",.... :) 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:05:45
Nope...missed in every point... :) still this raise makes no sense... no reason for it...new additional news.... USA news were a couple of hours ago and it went down after them....
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:32:41
Just make sure ypu follow your decision if it come to 10.5.. i said that to myself and then waited waited because i tought it wouldnt go any higher :)
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:04:48
hehe, and you know they are correct because there is a 50% chance they are right... 50% to go up, 50% to go down (if there was a better chance that BTC goes horizontally then it would be 33,33$ :))
No one can predict what is going to happen... someone decides to push a lot of money (like it happend on 5,9k) ...that created a spike...that triggered buy orders etc. and all of the sudden it was all great and went to 12k.... the same is happening here... 
all of the "HODL", "SHORT", stories are people who think they have influence on the market by writing on the reddit or to ease their worried mind.... so they are basically expressing their hope and hoping that someone else listens to them and then they stop loosing money / or opposite..
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:19:50
No... someone would have to buy on all major exchanges... if they didnt the bots that “sync” the prices would just buy on one and and sell ond gdax and make a lot of money (sync bots have money on all exchanges ). So it would meen a lot more money than 88m
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:59:47
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:29:09
it dropped 500$ and you call it a selloff? :) what is the limit when you call it a selloff?:)
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:01:17
Nobody can predict the market.. unles s/he has a lot of money.... smiles? I smile if I find something funny.. such as dumb predictions... moon and lambo comments....
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:15:04
ANd why do you think so?
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:36:41
looks like that...
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:55:24
nope, went to churcs and pray to the BitLord :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:54:01
measly? if they bought at 6k...that is not measly :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:00:53
She is talking OK... she would like to protect peoples pensions.. also...why wouldn't people be able to sue companies that they invested in? makes sense...
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:21:26
Wait for the china and korea if you want to be sure which way it will go...
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:23:40
So basically you wrote that you predicted the 9500 support that happened yesterday? :) THan, why would we thank you later if it already happened? :)
This sounds like most of the TA... they make a pattern out of previous actions... and if it turns out that the TA wasn't even close..then you just draw another scenario where this NOW is the 4th (or whatever) elliot wave and not 5th as you thought just a day before :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:04:33
I am just saying that the price is something that is set by consensus between interesting parties. So if a lot of people think that IPhone is worth 1k, that it is..because that is the prices they are willing to give for it (although I have iPhone I really think that X has no advantages over 7, but it cost a lot more). It is the same with bitcoin..if people think 7k is cheap...than they will buy it..if not, then it will go down to the price where sell wall meets the buy wall... 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:08:48
They are taking a risk and trying to “catch” the bottom... plus there are bots involved and we musn’t exclude the iption that the whale is seling to hinself and raising the price
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:20:35
now we are sure that it is no longer a dead cat bounce :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:59:49
yeap...but look at it from a brighter side... if it goes much higher it is insignificant difference :) I would rather worry about the scenario if it goes below your rebuy price :) that is a bitch...
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:35:25
For someone to get profit someone had to loose...that is how the game is played... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:21:03
Depending on the Senat response... but I think they will say some political bullshit that can be interpreted both ways...

And the price/quality ratio is always correct?  :) Is IPhone X worth 1000USD? :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:34:06
I thought so too...but we could be mistaken cause there are a lot of BTC flying around currently...
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:48:36
hrm... bottom found?:/

That is why cheese factory has to have number of calories written next to each cheese cake? :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:02:52
Yeap that is what people were saying on 19k :) 18k...
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:21:57
I agree...and this "fall" was to be a sanity check... but this jump is too quick... but...who knows...
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:00:25
this wasn't a crash... it went 1% down in 24 hours
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:24:16
Price is being raised by small orders... no whales in play...
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:56:58
it shows us that we "know shit".. every day there are 100 theories on reddit what is the root cause, when it will go down, when it will go up... but unless one is a whale with lot of money so it can influence the market (due to low volume) we have to accept that any comment regarding the future trend is pure speculation/lucky guess if s/he gets it right...
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:27:27
Just bots playing... look at the size of transactions and it is xclear that this is a "fake" raise...
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:42:34
yes... but you might make more money selling...i.e. the ones sold at 11k now are buying with a discount :)
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:52:54
and this is what you said 23 hours ago: This is a huge Bull Trap. Sell for tether if the market hits 330 billion marketcap. It's getting close. The whales are going to crush it soon. Tomorrow we will see a total 250 billion marketcap. That's where I draw my line in the sand and all in.
make up your mind :)
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:01:07
bots + people believing that BTC is worth more than it is now.... this isn't news driven 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:31:33
Hope you didn't buy a lot :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:39:18
bots + whole world :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:41:51
grow up
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:10:21
Too many "big" sellers sold... I assume they plan to buy "low"...so it is a bit of a risk to buy in now....
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:20:24
If someone is looking for evidence then reddit is the wrong place to be :) every single thing said here is a speculation, wish or BS... no matter if you would like the bitcoin value to go up or down :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:12:40
Then I must have misunderstood... because as I understand they are limiting the credit card holders from buying crypto...not canceling their credit cards... if they are filtering and choosing what you can or can't buy then what is the point of that credit card...
In my opinion it is all about credit score... and setting the appropriate limit... and what I choose to buy with "credited" money is none of their business

your posts from last three days:
submitted 23 hours ago
Wow! all the charts point to 12k in a day. Amazing. I don't see it but if the charts are real btc will hit 12k then the jump to 25k. Been here for years and have seen how it works.
submitted 1 day ago
Just heard info that bitcoin will be over 12k in one week. Good news!
submitted 1 day ago
Buy the dip! running to 500 billion marketcap in 2 days.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:29:53
Why not buy over the weekend when it goes down a bit? :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:22
Where are you looking? On Bitstamp it didn't go lower then 7k
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:42:17
I just said "once again" :) who knows how many times it will try to break through :)
@_date: 2018-03-04 07:24:58
Why would you call it a SCAM? It is just a virtual representation of USD value... it is only important that the market considers this as such... if it weren't for tether then the volume would go down because a lot less people would be trading since only a few exchanges support FIAT2Crypto... i.e. Binance doesn't have it so a many traders would move their "coins" to bitstamp, coinbase etc. where they can avoid problems if btc goes down 60% like it did a month ago... 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:59:45
And if it turns now and drops to 7k? :) you never know what will happen...
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:49:59
It is the same price that was 24 hours ago... so there is no drop yet :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:07:43
And this? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:27:40
I see it going upwards non-stop from the bottom.... i don't like it is a low volume raise but still, it is going up..
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:07:05
It just shows that the yesterdays growth wasn't natural :) easy come easy go...
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:39:27
Nope... it is not that.... it was mostly bots.. and bots raised the price in the first place...
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:32:21
Why not? If nobody is selling then the price wouldn't go up... think about it that way... if everyone holds there is no liquidity... 
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:23:19
Bitcoin price could go up and down... so you could, in example, have 15$ worth of bitcoin in two months...
You are buying "something" for 20$ but you don't know how much will that "something" be worth in the future... it could be more or less expensive... so in ideal case, bitcoin price could go up.. and then you have to decide how much profit is enough for you (10%, 30%, ... ???). After you sell you could invest in other crypto coins/tokens or wait until the price of bitcoin falls down beneath the price you sold your bitcoin (10%, 20%, ... ??)... since you so little money and you are new there is no point in day trading (catching high and low prices of bitcoin) so buy bitcoin and forget about it for a couple of years (hoping it goes up x3-5) or try your luck with alternative coins which have a better chance of increasing your profit but with more risk...
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:10:03
Yes it is acting weird ... but somebody must be buying so they obviously feel it is worth something... ofcourse there is a lot of day trading involved...
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:05:19
nobody knows... it can as easily go down...
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:10:07
Everybody loves begginer when they throw their money when prices are mooning but hate them when they checkout :)  let them whine...  i have more problems with non-stop referencing of random tweets and web site with half or no truth in them...

One BTC Titan said to another "you shell not paaaass" :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:34:24
And I think that this has nothing to do with Tether...
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:04:49
If we knew this than we would all go "all in" and make a lot of money :) nobody knows what will happen... every answer you get will: a) frighten you because they will say it will drop b) create fake reassurance because they say it will only go up c) make you angry because they will say something like "i need to check my crystal ball..." 
Look at this as gambling... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:10:52
Thats is what everyone is saying each time btc goes up :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:17:28
To make money?:)
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:57:55
And it looks like 8k had a lot of support :) for now :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:33:22
9536 on bitstamp
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:11:38
and other big players getting in..somebody had to buy all that BTC... but the new owners won't sell any time soon (hopefully :) )
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:15:10
You see that from the absence of a huge green candle? :)
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:04:28

Everybody is emotional when they loose money... some are in big + so they are taking it with less stress... others are in - and each time somebody tells them to HODL they scream because it goes lower each hour...
This "shit-storm" is not near the end... a lot of people will buy now.. and tommorow another wave is likely to happen (if/when they close two more exchanges)...
So i except a lot more whining, lot more fud posts and a lot more "wiseguys" saying "i told you so"...

Everybody is jumping on people that are selling, but if you look at a bit carefully you will also see bots lowering the prices, whales putting walls when price starts to climb...  so this is a mixture of many factors but mostly people who are shorting...
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:32:39
He is just guessing... there is no way to predict what is going to happen... 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:32:32
Bitcoin as a safer investment?:) stock fell 4-8% and btc fel 70% :)))
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:54:48
bear trap
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:39:49
Putting a sale order with a lot of BTC -so for the price to increase the whole "wall" has to be eaten... which is unlikely unless the "panic" mode is turned on... panic eats through everything :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:53:48
In one year we will forget about this dip :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:47:51
It went to fast to remember :)

Yeah..a lot of people risking now...

There should be an age limit on reddit...

It is holding arround 9,9k for 6 hours.. bots are playing now
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:23:37
Don't invest in anything if this is your "bread" money
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:27:27
Just bots playing... look at the size of transactions and it is xclear that this is a "fake" raise...
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:04:13
you probably won't see 7k but it should go a bit lower than it is now
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:58:48
People need to learn that any prediction is worthless :)))
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:20:19
if you are on the exchange that has shorting...
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:10:54
And the fight is over...until the next time :)
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:33:25
Standard behavior on their side.... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:18:34
This is so funny... we have multiple levels of people depending on the "average entry price"... and as soon as it falls to the lower level those people start to selling, and the ones below saying HODL :) so we have the same comments on reddit every single day just by different "level" people :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:53:36
it didnt drop for 6 hours.... where do you see the drop? :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:02:07
good call
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:48:19
Saying it is 800% up since last year makes no difference for new investors... even greater the risk. People who invest in stocks such as amazon, apple don’t plan for a 70% increase in 2 year and you are talking about 2 months :) ... so the people who sold stock in the last couple of days are not the ones that plan to heavily invest in crypto.. sure they probably have a part in crypto but they will definitely not sell stocks just to buy bitcoin :) 
And also... how do you know we don’t have a bearish period for crypto? :) we don’t know anything... we just all have high expectations based thin air :) one regulation move could set us back a year back in progress
And just to finish with a positive note - I too have high excpectations for crypto :)

I guess you will be guessing the bottom all day 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:26:26
OK... so basically they would like you to buy something that they can sell later to reduce the loss if you fail to pay them back?
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:39:27
But it went up just 10%...not a great loss.. just a gamble... it will come a bit down and probably go up...it is never a straight line
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:51:45
now that someone put a big buy order everything stopped because bots can't go through that..shows that most of the trading this weekend was bots...
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:54:05
It went up 1300$ in less then 10hours...and you call this stuck? :)

@_date: 2018-02-04 17:04:57
I think that this kind of discussion is much more interesting than the non stop "bottom", "not", "bottom", "FUD", "HODL", "Don't invest more more..." and other bullshit that has no added value to any of the readers... 
I also think that it will take some time for new investors or new adopters to come back in... you can't have such "disturbance in the force" and expect that everyone will just say "ok, it won't happen again any time soon" :)

Because there is a chance this jump is just BUY THE RUMOR...and it will go lower... I personally don't see this news as a driver to former price levels...but it currently prevented further dips...

Credit card limit is the solution..if you are a risky customer (low income, high fluctuation of you bank account, ...) then they can minimize such a risk by a) setting a low limit b) not issuing you a credit card

You can't have two portfolios unless you plan to create portfolios by using different exchanges...1st portfolio on X exchange, and 2nd on Y (ofcourse I am talking just about KYC exchanges - all the big ones)
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:58:31
Yes that would help but first crypto has to start delievering... meaning - a high percentage of crypto is a scam or a non working product, btc awaits the lightning network to start overcomming current problems, ... after that it will be much safer for investor to come in
Also having people saying “i will eat my private parts of the body if btc isnt worth million $ by xxx” doesn’t help either :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:16:18

If you look any TA clown on youtube you might think the same... but in fact almost all are just clowns that make a business on “subscriber” counts... who cares who is or what does kim kardashian do or say, but for some, to me, unimaginable reason when she twits about on some cloth part the sales go through the roof... same here.. as long as there are sheeps that think he is “something” he will be present and making money... pure marketing... it is not important what is said about you as long as people are talking about you :)

@_date: 2018-02-05 13:19:15
Not exactly because the "customer" will have to pay the bank back... so there is no risk for the bank..this is pure "evil" to prevent the crypto to take a part of their "business"... People can use the same credit card for gambling...buying cars... whatever...and they NOW decide to prevent buying of crypto out of pure GOOD ... so they "SHOW" they a taking care of their customers :) not... 
I never bought with credit card and still I think this is an evil move motivated by fear of someone taking some of their profit
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:42:04
if everyone holds, then nobody would sell... the price could go to a million but it wouldn't make a difference because everyone is holding and not selling :) so the whole HODL routine doesn't make sense :)

You are talking about the same guy which said that he will it his private parts if BTC is not 1 mil. $ by the end of the year? :) you are still listening to that guy? :)
