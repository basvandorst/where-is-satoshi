That's pretty funny man.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:41:35
That's some dark shit man, I hope that was a troll.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:45:45
What app / website are you using to get that chart?

You don't have house insurance? How did the fire start?
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:01:43
I have a feeling it was the sata molex adapter, were you using one? I think I can make one out from the pictures.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:03:31
Wasn't that guy a troll?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:20:16

Why are you throwing money away? Are you a millionaire or something like that ?  Should probably just donate it instead of giving it away to a bunch of first worlders.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:51:24
I back.

Any recommendations on where to find more info?

He wasn't storing them properly you buffoon. He had them stored in an apartment complex garage, if they had exploded countless innocents would have been injured/killed.
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:16:10
Would Roger Ver be considered Frieza? 
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:01:50
More like pipe dreams.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:27:42
How did they lose their fortune?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:45:23
That is one serious piece of machinery.
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:03:36
Way back when machine should be able to prove this.

Using the loose definition being thrown around in this thread you could say buying a house is a gamble, the price could go down or a meteor could destroy the house.

It's incredible how many young people are interested in investing now because of crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:02:35
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:47:43
If I ever become a millionaire from crypto I'm framing this on my wall.
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:06:05
Yeah guys, we need MOAR beggars.
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:21:04

@_date: 2017-10-23 20:15:47

@_date: 2017-10-25 05:44:48
That's not cringy at all, don't let the haters get to you.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:16:59
What a bunch of degenerates.

Apparently the guy defending himself is the "CEO of Bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:12:12
So this means that in the past three days they have printed more than the entire market cap of bitcoin.

"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been accused of acting in the interests of Wall Street banks and hedge funds and of dragging its feet or refusing to investigate cases or bring charges for fraud and insider trading.[64] Financial analyst Harry Markopolos, who spent ten years trying to get the SEC to investigate Bernie Madoff, called the agency "nonfunctional, captive to the industry."
