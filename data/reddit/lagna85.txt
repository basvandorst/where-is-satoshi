Is a fact
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:24:04
And it concerns you that you needed to make a post about it? So do you feel better now? Tsk.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:04:32
Why are you trying to be a swing trader when u are not?
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:42:52
Last quarter of a $7k bitcoin.....before next month’s $6k bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:29:12
We will reach 8-9k in dec, then a very hard crash to 4-5k in Jan. Then we will start to rally till 2020 and the mega pumps at mid-last quarter of 2020.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:00:46
Don’t use Coinbase, it’s stupid. Use Gemini or whatever exchange that enables you to trade fiat/btc/etc with higher limits.
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:57:54
What’s that gonna do with age? I’m mid 30s and I’m hoping my few thousands of investment would become a million too. I fact, I could say the same for like 99.99% of the people here.
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:25:41
So those money will be transferred to crypto? Niiiice
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:43:22
To save on yearly inflation:)
@_date: 2018-09-08 11:44:40
True, I read up on jack ma previously and he said he loves to work and he’s not going to retire. Then today there’s news saying he is retiring. Something isn’t right.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:34:27
When u DCA till no more fiat and it still dips
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:05:39
Unlikely the price will be stable that long. Bcos the whales will pump the price to get the next bag holders until crypto becomes mainstream.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:31:28
It is the working adults that are actually skeptical about crypto currency. At least most of them like the hardworking blue/white collars one.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:35:39
I bought a new phone solely just for crypto trading. With no SIM card installed

@_date: 2018-09-06 00:42:36
Narrow minded guy, just pull the 1 day chart and laugh at yourself. A dump is if we go below 5900. At least learn some basic TA, it will help you in the long run.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:55:54
They are triggering the stop losses so they could accumulate.
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:36:29
It’s a mobile app payment, there’s no fee iirc
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:30:42
True. I asked around my circle, most of them aren’t interested and will NOT invest if bitcoin reached $60k. However, if it reaches 100K, only a handful of them are interested but still will NOT invest. The whales should know this too, I’m expecting the next bull run will be so ridiculous that my grandma will ask me how to get in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:54:57
Even if there is, it won’t be that exploding.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:32:32
So those money will be transferred to crypto?
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:35:29
It’s very common. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:53:45
For me I just play video games, I’m debating between black ops 4 or Battlefield WW2.
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:37:35
Just wait a while more
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:01:59
If u want your 1000x, u need your currency to be at the whim of 1000 people.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:38:41
If the bank is doing that, it is a good bank.
Imagine your crypto is fraudly used and there is no verification made, that would be worst. Why are u so happy then?
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:00:44
No really true, it was a gradual climb from Jan to June 17. That’s what we want to see now. If we are seeing a spike now, it’s just another pump and dump like June.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:38:44
lolwat? you just join crypto?
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:32:00
With so many shorts, it’s really hard to believe it will reach $50k
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:03:09
How many thinks that this is a sucker’s rally?
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:15:46
Unless most people are being paid in crypto for their day jobs, they don’t care
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:33:45
And what’s the difference for btc? They are the same. You do know there are so many people getting wrecked when invested during the early 2018.
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:18:46
If he waited a while he could have bought a few more.
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:05:02
If he waited a couple years, he could have bought 10 of that.
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:48:33
They are manipulating everyday on all exchanges. Not surprising anymore
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:51:48
He’s prolly have 1.5, but saying 10.5 to throw hackers off track
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:29:41
And it could be the reverse, this pull back is expected, why are u surprise 
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:29:01
Yea right
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:38:24
Well, the ‘hack’ could be an inside job.
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:17:31
Lol, find those credible ones, their TA all points to a bearish market and downtrend.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:36:13
You are complaining bcos you are too stubborn to acknowledge TA is something useful. I was once like u thinking TA is useless in the past. I can’t be bothered with u anymore, u will learnt it yourself in the future.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:28:57
So what’s stopping the price from dropping after we hit $7.4k? Nothing. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:15:32
Unless most people are being paid in crypto for their day jobs, they don’t care
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:50:31
Nothing is conclusive until we break the triangle which is at the 3rd week of Oct. Then it could go up or down but probably not sideways anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:36:25
All of them are afraid to lose their initial capital, when it’s only just 1k. I told all of them do u want to take the chance that your 1k may be $100k or even a million in a few years time? They replied they prefer to keep to the $1k than lose it all??!
I think they are all dumb and I gave up trying to convince them. I will let the results speak. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 11:45:09
Why not? It’s their country, they can run it however they want
@_date: 2018-09-07 10:58:48
well, he is right.
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:33:45
Yep, the next batch of bag holders will consider if bitcoin reaches 50k. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 06:19:02
The whales didn’t use the fake news, some smart Alec keyboard warrior did. 
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:30:31
I am stocking tulips, they will 28363628191x very soon.
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:40:07
No, the whales are the one pushing the volume, NOT the masses.
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:17:00
This means they are dumping. The price will go down.
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:46:50
Tbh it looks like a scam machine
@_date: 2018-10-13 07:36:56
Yea, I invested in Jan 2018. Another 2k means nothing to me now. I will just dca
@_date: 2018-10-29 14:49:36
-$100 is not really a sudden drop
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:14:01
Isn’t that normal?! Huge volume yet price stays flatline just means it’s manipulated
@_date: 2018-10-29 07:12:52
I have lots of friends and relatives in China, they said crypto is ‘legal’ at the upper hands, just not to the common folks.
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:48:58
It will be unarmed in the form of hacking.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:17:12
He is being so inconsistent with his words. 
Using lies to cover his previous lies. How can one be so thick skinned.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:25:43
The moment we reach 20k, we wont stop there, it will break out to few Ks more.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:12:10
Yes, but it doesn't mean this bull run will take btc to 200+k. It may be the next one
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:49:42
Crush? This is the start
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:18:02
When btc was $1, 20k seems crazy too.
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:16:25
Now we are trend reversing,  it is at most like in 2016. Why cant people understand simple thing like this.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:39:10
Same. Told my peers to start investing when btc is at 3k plus. They just laugh it off and say it is dead. When it reach 8k, they say it is just a dead cat bounce. I assure them it will reach 10k plus by 24 June (and I am right). Guess what they told me now? They said 11k is the highest. Facepalm them
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:02:22
If u think it will reach $20k,  why just loan 5k? 
Otherwise why do you even want to risk a loan
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:46:59
Is true, we aren't investing, we are speculating.
And I tell people I am a speculator. I do not like people to call me an investor because investing are for noobs who are willing to wait years for a measly XX% roi.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:09:55
I see early adopters posting their experiences,  I upvote.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:44:00
Since last year I was saying as a joke to my friends that the ETFs &amp; bakkt would be approved in 2020. Wouldn't be surprising now.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:47:59
That's what all my peers told me.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:21:10
This is why u buy a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:06:42
They sold at 11k
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:13:23
This one is the start before the retail FOMO. 
Spoken to a lot if people, most will be shocked if btc breach 20k.
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:52:32
Same here, all replied it's a scam or no balls to invest. When it reached 8k, all replied it's still a loss from 20k. Look at the retards around me.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:19:29
If the transaction is unconfirmed,  just wait a while more. No need to worry.
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:56:57
When the time comes of the dollar dies, btc will be useless too.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:28:17
When btc price is too high, people look at the cheaper and faster alternatives,  which is litecoin.
@_date: 2019-02-16 07:37:55
Shouldn't those be called tokens instead 
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:04:25
Would be smarter if u sell near top and buyback at 4k. But yeah nobody knows the exact market.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:19:38
With people like TS, I'm sure btc will reack 100k plus.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:05:03
Nah, they are saying 11k is the max.
I replied " Didn't you said that since 7k?"
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:32:31
It pump from 0.06 to 20k for no reason either.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:20:01
Nice math. U failed.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:33:31
Wow, at least she ask why. All of my peers just reply its scam, no backing, this is the highest u better sell...since 8k.
@_date: 2019-06-06 08:45:57
When people like him are your peers. Yep, me surrounded by these fools, it's hard to get by everyday hearing their measly gains in their stocks, bonds etc. And the worst part is they thinking they are making a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:35:52
U are bothered with your loan interest rate while speculating bitcoin? Then you shouldn't even loan.
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:57:25
Why cant people just hold?
@_date: 2019-04-27 10:57:17
Is like OTC. There are A LOT of lazy people who do not like to do trading by themselves. They just let their brokers do everything.
@_date: 2019-04-20 01:10:43
There is always a bigger whale. Your 50m sell off may trigger a whale bot to buy up.
@_date: 2019-04-27 10:55:51
The ETFs will trap the next batch of bag holders.
@_date: 2019-04-30 05:56:29
My wife too. one day, I explained to her about market cycle for 30 mins (surprisingly she listened to my explanation). Then she asked me to help her invest too, I rejected and told her to keep her own money in case shit happens.
@_date: 2019-04-22 04:26:30
Already in, just waiting for the pump money (from ETFs).
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:04:58
This guy looking at 1min chart.

@_date: 2019-04-25 05:20:22
TA is only useful to the person using it. You feel it is bad because you simply lack the knowledge.
@_date: 2019-04-22 04:28:32
I said before. It will be a battle between the golden cross vs the high NVT signal. Both have been proven reliable in the past.
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:38:34
I'm Chinese, I asked most of my Chinese friends, relatives &amp; coworkers (about 50 total) about bitcoin. 30% of them do not know what bitcoin is. 60% do not and will not invest in anything. The remaining 10% which is 5, only invested in stocks, they do not trust bitcoin/crypto and thinks it's a scam.
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:13:51
Yep, I asked all of the people I knew who are from China (about 20 of them). 80% of them had no idea what crypto is, the rest think the bubble has burst and no way it will reach $20k again like gold in the past.
@_date: 2019-01-06 04:37:35
I thought they will be getting back the cash value at that time?
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:03:53
I resist to buy for the past few months, still waiting for it to drop to 2k+.
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:20:44
At least make the font background whiter.
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:33:59
10 million market cap incoming
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:08:58
The past year? Damn...those bags.
@_date: 2019-01-10 04:06:32
Well, if it makes you feel better, there are people who are the same as you  just that they invested when btc is &gt;12k.
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:22:28
There wont be enough, so there will be 2 conclusions. Price of btc increase, or a 2nd coin to substitute btc as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:40:58
I will buy when it reach below $3k, which it will.
Otherwise, I will just buy during a bull market.
@_date: 2019-01-01 02:21:04
It will go lower in the coming months. Whether u like it or not. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:20:39
But there is definitely wash trading involved.
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:52:57
This bear market taught me to be patient.
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:30:44
A lot of people predicting 2.5k, that's the scary part because the whales know it. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:29:24
It's running down
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:42:59
They wont buy even if it reaches 20k. All the anti-bitcoin people I talked to have these weird egos . They are too emotional and does not like money which has 'no backing'.
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:58:02
It will blow up, the main point is by how much?
Last bullrun we had previous ATH 1.2k to 19.8k.
This bull run will it be 20k to 200k? Or will the bulls surprise us by going even more than we can imagine.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:26:51
Just talk to your peers, should be none of them are in crypto
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:57:46
It was created to distribute wealth from the rich to the internet geeks.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:48:59
Sry, read this story somewhere before.
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:19:20
TA is useful for you to stop losing more money than needed for beginners. All markets in this world is manipulated by the big players/whales. However, they follow an algorithm to maximize their profits. For example, who do most stocks crash every 10 years? Look for patterns.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:30:49
Yep, I dont talk to my peers about bitcoin now. They will talk to me about it in the future
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:30:27
It will keep happening. Go and study what is a market cycle.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:37:25
He's already rich and has plenty of fiat. We dont.
@_date: 2019-05-06 04:44:38
Just admit you lose money and is now finding faults for your mistake. Is that so hard?
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:27:48
Knowing China, they will just create a new RMBcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:57:56
We have seen these short squeeze so many times, only for it to go lower each time. RIP to those that fomo.
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:00:11
Kraken. Gemini. Are you from US?
I would actually diverse some into litecoin.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:26:47
Then why did you reply? Obviously you care.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:05:34
Yea yea 5 day account troll.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:50:49
I'm assuming you mean TAs on youtube, twitter and reddit? You NEVER solely enter/exit your positions base on some random people.
They just serve as a reference and they are great learning tools plus there are some that are quite accurate. Ultimately, u need to learnt it yourself. Start learning market cycles &amp; various indicators like the RSI, EMA, MACD etc and you could make the call yourself without any external advice in the future. Pls heed this advice, you will become a better trader in the future.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:23:28
They do not need to manipulate bitcoin, they just need to manipulate you, like how some believe the article.
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:57:51
Imagine we have so many ignorant people willing to pay such high premiums for btc at grayscale. Now imagine SEC approve, China approve, all institutions allows crypto trading. The price will confirm be skyrocketing like the gold rush.
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:27:57
Futures say Hi
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:58:08
Not yet...I repeat.. 
...not yet. Eventually it will because anything that is a threat to fiat will be 'fixed'.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:13:06
can u tell us what you bought with cryptos specifically?
@_date: 2019-05-03 01:53:35
Anybody who is not blind knows the chart is going up
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:30:39
It will be stable...at around 100k (after a dump from 300k). So just wait for it then, meanwhile just ride the wave for the next decade.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:43:39
It's already dead when futures are introduced. Just look at gold, silver etc 
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:53:30
a few mins later tsunami came, ride the wave or sunk with it.
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:17:37
Head and shoulders formed. Guess you are right

Bought at Jan 18, not sold a single satoshi because it isn't there anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:41:52
If fiat is useless in the future, btc will be more worthless. lmao.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:45:13
Yep, this market is a once in a lifetime blessing for this generation. You know what you are doing. Keep going, I know you will make your million soon. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:30:20
Because most are moonboys, and they surf cancer forums like reddit. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:24:46
6k would put btc at about 100B market cap?
For a worldwide digital asset, 100b is really low.
@_date: 2019-05-23 04:33:45
Nuff said.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:06:07
Ha ha hah
@_date: 2018-12-31 08:07:20
No, it wont even reach our previous ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:56:13
It seems like the standard of r/bitcoin is the same as r/cc. Low quality TA.
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:00:07
It will happen, just not next year or the year after.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:22:03
People will only hold if bitcoin will make them rich.
@_date: 2018-12-30 10:26:09
Your mistake is you are impatient and fail to respect TA.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:57:25
Doesnt matter if it makes me money

Pls educate yourself and read up on your bank. For most banks, the overseas credit/debit limit applies DAILY to ANY overseas countries you are in , understand?!
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:55:00
You would have sold at a loss or a little profit back then. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:27:54
I accumulate and had full allocations when btc was 3 to 5k.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:53:50
Might as well say 100%
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:50:40
It's because of futures dumbass.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:06:56
Why are you mad....and i probably have more bitcoins than you
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:03:33
Your dad invested something much more priceless.......which is YOU.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:54:08
Most people didn't live through a market cycle predict those. I would say 250k at 2021.
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:49:16
I too had a dream like this, but couldn't withdraw any because I saw zero balance for all of my coins. When I woke up, I bought a ledger s nano online.

Has cryptocrew uni Steve made a video today? If not, he is perhaps the smartest by not posting a video these past few days. Unlike the rest who keeps saying were retracing since 6k

Easy, just study TA. You will roughly know the top, stick to your plan.
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:56:24
Most people didn't use it, and if they do, do not understand it completely.
Trust me, i lost a lot in the past because i just trade on emotions and speculations.
Actually, we need more people like you, who don't use TA and just trade on emotions. Because you guys will be the bag holders while the people who uses TA will be the ones passing you their bags.

You could wait for a retrace or ending up with 0.5 BTC later.

It's just an indicator that there is a formula behind every market, perhaps I put it too bluntly. If u follow their algorithm, first well known crash is the dotcom, 2nd one is 2008, third one is now. The forth one is surely 12 years later. Same could be said for btc, expect a longer bear market for this cycle.
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:33:08
Is simple, just see the daily 50 vs 200ma, Or the weekly macd. You will know we are trend reversing now.
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:36:33
Yes. Its converging line, the bottom is around there, its expected if u TA.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:53:16
Then do u think it will reach 19k again?
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:18:57
Is like the internet, you dont need to understand to use it.
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:21:36
If your electricity is free, do it otherwise forget it.

You could have bought at least 15btc if you just waited for a few more weeks.

In Singapore it is a legal case. For examplez if I  mistakenly send a deposit of $1000 to another account, and if that account's owner withdraw the money, it is illegal. Best is the bank revert the transaction in time. For this case, if the cold address is indeed belongs to singapore huobi, there is a case.

Wont get approve till 2020

There are just too many people holding eth, the shake out period will be much longer.
@_date: 2018-12-19 10:26:04
Not the bank fault, they have limits in case your cards details were stolen for illegal usage. It's a good defensive measure. If you know you are going to exceed for that particular period, just widen your limit.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:57:46
It will, just not 19k anymore
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:59:22
Not if you keep changing it due to lost, damage, upgrade, stolen etc.
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:29:32
Pretty sure your case it's a gambling addiction 
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:30:03
Yep, got laughed at by peers. Whenever crypto is being bought up in conversations,  they just smirk and are contented with their small % gains in stocks.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:47:22
learn what is a market cycle before embarrassing yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:05:10
In Singapore, whatever doesnt belongs to u, u are bind by the law to not take it.

Not surprise if the 'cold' wallet suddenly turns hot and all funds were hacked. It's never a good idea to store your funds in a handphone.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:11:14
This is the problem about digital assets...prompt to hacks. I asked my friends, they said they will only invest in crypto if the local banks has a digital wallet service.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:55:22
Coinbase customers service are probably interns or part timers who only know basic troubleshooting. They are representing coinbase so saying " funds are not recoverable " is correct on their side. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:25:05
Spotted the guy that bought at 10k plus.
If you bought it &lt;3k. You wouldn't call it a scam.
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:10:54
Lots of good content, but man...the whole website is extremely uncomfortable to look at especially on the phone.
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:29:49
Just look at gold, silver and platinum.
@_date: 2019-05-06 11:26:28
