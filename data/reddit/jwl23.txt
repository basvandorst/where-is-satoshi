Tell the professor that since most of the things that we actually need to buy to survive, like food, gas and housing have been going up about 5-10% per year for the past decade (which puts the real inflation rate at about 10%), how does he like holding cash in the bank?

Averaged 2% for the last decade... the CPI?
Anyway, in Jan, 2013 M2 was $10.5 trillion. In Jan, 2014 M2 grew to $10.9 trillion. In just one year that's a 4.9% increase in the monetary base. So you're getting a 4.9% decrease in the value of the USD. In one year.

So they decide to claim ~$12 million in extra annual revenue, which would mean they have to pay more taxes, and hope they don't get audited for lying. But why?
You know it's illegal for a publicly traded company to lie about their income, correct? There is a paper trail (the blockchain) that they might even be submitting to the IRS which would show they were lying.

I always agree and say of course it's fake and a scam, just like every other currency is basically fake and a scam. The US Dollar (Federal Reserve Note) is a debt. When you spend money, you are literally paying a debt with a debt.

You'd only print yourself a few hundred billion? How much money has the quantitative easing program pumped into the banks?
They get to keep all the profits when times are good, and then when they go insolvent they just bail themselves out with taxpayer money. Pretty nice setup.
So let's see, what are the policies "assigned to them by Congress" (surely they didn't assign those policies to themselves!).
1. Promote maximum employment. Hmm, 7% unemployment now, but let's remember not to count the people who stopped looking for work.
2. Promote stable prices. Since 1913, how much have prices risen? Don't forget the definition of stable is enduring, permanent, steadfast, and not wavering or changeable.
3. Maintain moderate long-term interest rates. Do you consider 3.5% rates moderate?
They aren't even following their mandates. What exactly are you trying to argue? The Fed is beneficial to the economy? If all we need them for is to create money, Congress can already do that and there is no interest required.

The CPI is not a measurement of rising prices, only changes in consumer spending patterns. You're absolutely fucking delusional if you think the true inflation rate is LOWER than the official BLS report.

It's not that terrible. As adoption becomes more widespread (especially among retailers), the value of holding will eventually overcome the value of selling/exchanging to USD.

Actually I would argue that it would constrain growth in the short term by preventing asset bubbles and subsequent economic crashes. In the long run, growth would not only be much more stable but also much greater as a result of efficient and equitable use of capital.

The guy asked how Bitcoin would solve hyperinflation, in reference to Weimar Germany. I said Bitcoin would have solved it, because it could not have been used for hyperinflation. And now you're saying the USD is just as reliable as BTC when it comes to hyperinflation. Uhm, ok?
So what do you think is so embarrassing about the definition of CPI? You aren't even aware of how it's calculated, and you think I'm the stupid one?
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:44:56
You shouldn't have used any terms at all, because your entire line of reasoning is irrelevant.

If a state wanted to solve inflation, adopting Bitcoin would solve it because inflation would be impossible.

WTF is a "share" of bitcoin? What kind of an idiot makes a prediction about the price of bitcoin and thinks it's a publicly traded company?
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:43:22
Just think of it as the longer some bitcoins sit in a wallet and don't move, the more significant it is when they are spent. It's a better way to monitor the daily volume of transactions. 
Because otherwise some guy could just transfer the same 50 bitcoins back and forth between his own two wallets a billion times, which would make the volume appear huge but it would be pretty meaningless since it's just one guy moving money nowhere.
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:15:46
I don't think you understand. They own the money. It is literally called a Federal Reserve Note. It doesn't matter where it goes or whom then send it to. They own the actual money itself.
They issue it to the government to spend and demand interest for lending it. For some reason you think this is a great idea.

Where did I tell you to use the  money supply?
The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines inflation "as a process of continuously rising prices or equivalently, of a continuously falling value of money." Your CPI figure is not a measurement of rising prices, only changes in consumer spending patterns. That's why the Fed uses it and that's why they like it. Because it's bullshit.
But if you want to buy into their bullshit, be my guest.

Think about it like this. If you have 100 Bitcoins, how are you going to lend more than 100 Bitcoins out?
Well, only if you also take on debt yourself. Maybe you leverage your house or something. But you better receive a greater return on your 100 Bitcoin loan, plus interest to YOUR lender, or you lose your house.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:30:03
That has absolutely nothing to do with lending Bitcoin beyond its finite amount. Just because BTC can represent trillions of dollars doesn't mean you can loan out trillions of dollars worth of Bitcoins. You lend out exactly what the specified amount is worth.
In fact, I hope I'm missing your point because I have no idea what you're getting at. How are you going to deposit Bitcoins that don't exist into another account? With fractional reserve lending and the Fed's monetization of debt, they just conjure it up out of thin air. You can't do that with Bitcoin, so how are you going to do create Bitcoins that don't exist?
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:40:11

Well for one thing, nations couldn't wage a war on the scale of WW1 or WW2 if they were using Bitcoin. But it doesn't matter, taking on debt has nothing at all to do with the merits of Bitcoin. It's an entirely separate issue.

So he violated a statute with no injured parties?
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:10:29
Ok here's YOUR point. The Fed is "helping" the economy with, among other things, quantitative easing. Which increases the debt. The debt which has been outgrowing, and surpassing, GDP for 30 years. So just keep increasing the money supply and debt until... what exactly? Until we can't afford the interest payments? Ok so we got what, about 10 years left?
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:03:57
And the definition of stable is unchanging. So he's lying, and the Fed is also violating their mandate of maintaining stable prices.
