Is this sarcasm? The paradise papers have been all over the news.

I too think we should start mining poop

Fair enough. It seems as though they are indeed playing by the rules.  I wish taxes were simpler. A flat tax would be a godsend imho

I think the overall idea is that we would no longer be converting btc to the us dollar if btc became stable enough for merchants to price thier goods or services in btc.  Maybe that's not your point though. Obviously if the value of a millibit was $100 you wouldn't want to price a coffee in terms of 0.000054btc. I believe that if Bitcoin becomes that widely adopted, then slang for smaller donominations of btc would naturally become well known. Kind of like bits is already used to refer to (I think) a millibitcoin. Also kind of like we use k, mill, grand, cents, etc to refer to usd values in extremely large or small denominations

It prints out a receipt with your public and private key on it. Basically generates a new wallet for you
