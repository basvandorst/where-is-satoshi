Any publicity is good publicity?

Eh...im looking for a 8-core AMD processor, and the one i have my eye on is the AMD FX-8320, which is $171.20 + shipping at BitcoinStore - while its $159.99 + FREE shipping at Newegg, and right now on sale for $149.99. So some things may be cheaper, but i find Newegg is usually the best bet.
On top of that, if i ever have a problem with Newegg, they almost always email a prepaid return label right away and resend me the new product without any issues. Now im not sure how BitcoinStore works with returns, but thats another issue to think about.

Because i ~~forgot~~ left out an apostrophe? Yet you let "FIDDY" slide...

I also like the idea of "bits" but also "xbits" sounds better (as a bit is a unit of information and is kinda confusing).
1500 xbits

Wow - thats only 30 minutes from me and i drove past it the other day and didnt realize...i might have to take a trip.

Not from Ireland, i just have an irish background, im actually in Florida - and yes, i definitely think its something worthwhile - especially if we can get more people on board - if we could get it to have 1 or 2 users in every city, it would be a awesome app - but right now, the closest person to me is 30 something miles away.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:59:04
Thanks, and done.

Yeah, i wish more people knew about Mycelium so there were more traders that are closer to me, that is the only con i have on Mycelium.

Not really, for example, i used weselldoges.com last night to buy some doge with paypal, then i converted it to bitcoin with shapeshift. Or if someone wants to send you some other altcoin that you dont want, convert it here to bitcoin.

With 2FA this doesnt work.

You have a interesting point there, please elaborate.

Yeah, same here.

It just comes up as "Debit Card Transaction CIRCLE INTERNET FINANC 617-3268326 MA" for me and it looks just like a McDonalds or whatever transaction, so i dont think they would know unless they investigated it.
@_date: 2015-10-26 12:18:22
Huh. TIL. /s
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:29:46
If you have Chase, Circle will tie to your Chase account and give you instant transfers (you get the bitcoins instantly, but it takes the money out via ACH within a few days). The way it works is they check your Chase account to see if you have the amount in your account that you are requesting, and if so, they process the transaction.
The instant is for up to $100 per week. This is at least how it works for me. Results may vary.
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:18:35
I copied and pasted the Debit Card Transaction from my statement on the Chase website, but i dont have my debit card on Circle's website, so it has to be ACH - unless they have another way to take out my money with just my routing &amp; account numbers.

Dude, did you just tip him $120?
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:39:33
Still plain, but awesome idea and service, would love to collab with you and add some Bootstraps to it :)
