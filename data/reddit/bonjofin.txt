I'm not really going to argue with you, because you just came in here without hearing me out, and just saying all this random BS and making all these assumptions I'm just wasting my energy even responding to you. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:35:12
Nah. Olaf has been personally ignoring me on reddit. So I doubt it. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:18:22
It's obvious you don't understand what is happening. You see, this is what I'm saying. People like you I disgust a lot. Look at evidence. And still blurt bullshit. That's one of the reasons why time would be better spent not dealing with fools like you.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:58:52
Nah. I'm competent.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:28:34
It's called a contract. It's their duty to honor it. Go troll elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:18:16
Just because you didn't have a problem, doesn't mean they aren't scammers. You're just one of their puppies that they use to hide their heinous background.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:48:02
I'd love to give you more evidence. If you're interested, private message me. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:39:37
So if Coinbase cancelled your order saying that you still owe them $6k from a previous transaction and after you send them evidence that you owe them nothing they start ignoring you, you'll be fine with that?
lmao ok.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:30:43
No. Look at my response above.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:33:00
And I've replied.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:30:37
LOL? Think of it like a Ponzi scam. You may not have been scammed individually let's say because technically you got your money doubled, however, it as a whole is a scam.
And I've come to recognize whenever someone uses vulgarity, it means either THEY are a fucking idiot or just mentally retarded (like you). There's no point in getting mad. Calm your tits down.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:35:48
dude im not homo!
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:36:31
I find it funny how your name is quirk. Because you are one fucking quirk.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:32:42
Nah. If there was this issue, Coinbase would email me. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:34:49
blah blah blah blah. Say your opinion. But this post is sticking around here until those issues get resolved. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:34:23
If what Olaf does is customer service, then he should do some customer service to me. I'd love some customer service rather than getting slapped in the face with something called no response.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:59:15
Once again just like that other dude, if you wanna see evidence and promise to stay unbiased throughout the whole process, message me.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:23:40
Well I made a 100 BTC order 3 weeks ago and they have been ignoring me ever since.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:36:41
You can't beg on reddit. It's against the rules.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:58:09
You seriously want to see evidence and promise to be unbiased when reviewing it? If so, message me.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:35:33
If you're talking about Coinbase's incompetence, then yes.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:39:36
It's fine. You wanted to fuck me, and I just felt it was suitable to counter fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:23:09
It's not a smear thread, it's a genuine point. Go troll elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:32:19
Not really. I'm pretty sure it's a contract. Because if it isn't, I'm pretty sure Olaf wouldn't be going around on reddit and honoring some people's transactions. Because if it's not a contract, then he's just solely doing it for PR purposes.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:26:41
Well yea I'm level 2 verified. I bought 50 BTC on two separate days, one after the other. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:25:33
There's a difference between a bad experience, and getting scammed. You sir need to refresh on your dictionary definitions.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:27:19
I don't care what circumstances they are in. They have no excuse to scam. If they scammed you, they scammed you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:56:26
DAM SHE'S HOT! Thanks for letting us know her name. :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:27:51
How's this slander? lmao.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:30:07
No what's surprising is that they didn't even ACH anything out of my account. They never do this before. I had a transaction that was like $6k before and they charged me the very day I placed the order. It's just seems as if they were meaning to cancel it (for whatever reason they say), and were never meaning to charge me and refunding me and going through all that hassle.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:20:16
Well unless they resolve those disputes above, they are still scammers in my eyes, no matter how many "good" transactions that they made.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:59:53
Hey Mr.Troll. The sun's bright. :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:28:37
Read this.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:16:23
:/ they havent honored my deal yet... :/
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:40:36
I'm pretty sure he's doing it on purpose. I mean, they blocked my phone number on their merchant line. What else is there to this story. lol
