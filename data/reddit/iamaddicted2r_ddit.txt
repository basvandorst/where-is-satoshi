Explain? Afaik, they both have the same problem where there is another chain that uses their algo and has more hashpower than them, so in theory they could both fall victim to a 51% attack (Litecoin for Doge, Bitcoin for BCH).

There is no one definitive "mempool." Johoe's node probably crashed and slowly got re-flooded with most of the txns it lost.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:30:57
The problem is that many pools like Antpool seem to have a soft coded 2 MB limit, so the amount of actual 8 MB blocks being mined is lower than it should be. Those pools' fault if they want to miss out on tx fees though.

Tbf, I'd rather receive $298 in any alt that I can shapeshift/exchange for anything I want cheaply, rather than (presently) fee-laden BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:49:16
Also don't forget coins like Zcash with a bullshit "dev fee" that essentially gives the creators license to print money for life as long as the coin holds some worth (20% of every block reward + Zcash price &gt;$0 + no overhead whatsoever = unlimited funbux). I suppose I can get behind the idea of devs being rewarded for their work (crypto is a valuable concept and does require lots of coding expertise on the backend), but if you write a good coin and foster a good community base for it, that should be its own reward as long as you hodl some of the coin (ex. Satoshi).

Unless fiat collapses before BTC surpasses US$1M, more significant figures are going to be necessary because 1 satoshi will exceed 1 cent, so the precision increase that you're talking about seems likely.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:33:40
You can see the fee in sat/B on that page; what you used works out to 27 sat/B, which is not at all a competitive fee right now. In case you didn't know, sat/B stands for satoshi per byte, or the size of your tx (in bytes) divided by the fee you paid on the tx (in satoshi). Each block is limited to 1MB, so miners are going to prioritize the transactions that have the most fees in sat/B so they can make the most money. Right now a competitive fee is between 100-150 sat/B.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:18:35
You're welcome. Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:36:22
What's likely to happen is that it will just be booted from the mempool (unconfirmed transaction ledger) after two weeks and returned to your wallet, which is network policy. In the unlikely event that a ton of low fee transactions clear within the next 14 days and 27 sat/B becomes a competitive fee, it will clear at that time. You could also use an RBF (replace-by-fee) tx to push it through if that wallet supports RBF, or put it through a tx accelerator such as BTC.com's (

Thanks for that. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're saying is that Bitcoin is going to evolve to an XRB-like currency where everyone only knows their own balance and the balance of the person they're transacting with, but that's ok because it's still verifiable against the main chain if necessary? Why not just use XRB then?
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:27:47
What fee did you use in sat/B?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:45:38


You change the blocksize back to 1MB or 2MB and fork. Like increasing the blocksize, except in reverse. 


"The miners" are not the ones making transactions. It's true that they secure the network, but we control the actual value of what they're mining. If we fork and they don't want to follow the new chain, tough shit, they're going to be mining a worthless coin soon if they don't follow the fork like the rest of the community. Overall it should be self-correcting via greed - they'll want to mine whatever is most profitable, which will be the chain with the most community support.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:56:50
The most important philosophy is that of "hodl." Don't day trade and don't sell dips and you will make a net profit even if the price happens to go down in the short term.

Huh, interesting. I clearly need to research more on this. How exactly did IOTA end up being centralized, anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:22:49
Well, I mean, every single means of improvement requires user consensus in some form. You can soft fork like we did with Segwit, but then the fix isn't effective unless a majority of the community is onboard, so you're back at square one. All it would take is supermajority consensus that a small blocksize increase would be an easy fix to the congestion (doesn't sound like a hard conclusion to reach), and then if that small blocksize increase became an issue for whatever reason, supermajority consensus that it has become an issue and a fork back to the old blocksize is needed. Ultimately, you're right - the outcomes of forks can never be predicted, but they don't *have* to create network splits. If you can get 95+% of the community to agree to a certain change by hard fork, the old chain will die within a month.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:25:07


@_date: 2017-12-29 21:41:10
No. You basically have three options: 
* Wait for it to be booted from the mempool and returned to your wallet, then send it again with whatever the competitive fee is at that time. 
* Send a replace-by-fee tx with a competitive fee to push it through, if that wallet supports RBF. Tutorials are easily accessible on how to use RBF in most wallets. 
* Use a tx accelerator such as viaBTC's ( or BTC.com's ( which will include your tx in the next block mined by those pools (for a fee, paid at the tx acceleration page).
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:04:00
If you go about a month with no confirmations your tx will just be booted from the mempool and returned to your wallet. That might take a little longer or a little less time, depending, but it should happen eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:12:23
The problem with Segwit isn't just users, though. Obviously everyone who can is using Segwit because it's the rational thing to do, but we have little-to-no leverage over how it's deployed by exchanges and other large Bitcoin transactional hubs, which make up a *huge* amount of Bitcoin txns on aggregate. Sometimes if you want the big players to comply you have to fork (but even that might backfire if they choose to follow the old chain). 
Regarding LN, I'll believe it when I see it. It seems like worthwhile technology, but I believe that on-chain txns should still have a place post-Lightning, and I also believe that some type of blocksize increase will be needed for LN to really work and scale properly. If it exceeds all expectations and is able to work with full security and trustlessness for all users of the network while maintaining the 1MB blocksize, shit, sign me up.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:27:15
Thanks. I found BTC.com's as well, so I'll try that if this one doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:47:13
Yeah, but NH doesn't payout to external wallets until you accumulate at least .01BTC, and if you choose to use their internal wallet you can payout sooner but the fee to withdraw to a real wallet is still like $4 which is cost prohibitive for the $2-$3/day that the average miner generates. By necessity you have to store your BTC with them until you accumulate at least $100 or so.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:04:28

Now, when you say "received," do you mean unconfirmed but sent, or confirmed? I still think CB might just not show incoming txns that aren't confirmed yet. Also, check that you copied the address correctly - even if it was just a simple Ctrl+C (I know nothing about Trezor) there does exist malware that will detect crypto addresses on the clipboard and change them to an attacker's address.

It's an inside joke. Years ago, during a price dip, some random very drunk guy posted on the Bitcointalk forums "I AM HODLING" accompanied by a massive rant; the sub has since co-opted the term to mean "don't day trade, don't sell dips and play long."
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:08:05
You are almost definitely overpaying on fees, that looks like a wallet that didn't update its algo for the fee market. Right now 150 sat/B is enough for a next-block fee, which should come out to way less than $30 in fees unless that tx is some major dust collection.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:59:39
Are you sure about this? I'm super bullish, but to invest any amount of money that you can't afford to lose in anything that does not have a guaranteed return is a poor choice.

Keep in mind that you're still an early adopter (&lt;5%). The majority of the USA still doesn't even know what Bitcoin **is**, minus maybe their geeky nephew who tries to talk about it at Thanksgiving or a five-second mention of it on the evening news. 
Technology-wise, Bitcoin is fully primed to reach 50% adoption and up, as long as Lightning Network (which I don't fully agree with, but whatever) goes through and the transaction throughput overhead is removed so that merchant growth and adoption can continue.
Also keep in mind the 21M cap. Assuming a perfect world where all 21M existed and were circulated, that wouldn't even be enough for the entire USA (which is less than a tenth of the world population) to own even 0.1 BTC. And we've already lost about 4M of that 21M from innovators who abandoned the concept and no longer have access to their private keys, or variants on that situation.

As he explained it, 100% LN usage sounds like a distributed ledger (used by IOTA or XRB) with extra steps. It doesn't make a ton of sense to me to basically retool a blockchain-based crypto to be a distributed ledger-based crypto when you already have multiple coins that were purpose built to use distributed ledgers. Let BTC exist as a blockchain, IOTA exist as a tangle, and XRB exist as whatever you call its ledger.

Yeah, I guess $100 is like nothing next to $500k. Still, I think something @ 100 sat/B and something at 150 sat/B would both have the same chance to be included in the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:35:26
That sounds weird. Network protocol is that txns that go unconfirmed for two weeks are booted from the mempool, but some nodes that haven't booted it yet might re-propagate it, and every time a node receives a tx the two-week timer resets. So it might take a little longer to actually be removed.

@_date: 2017-12-29 03:03:11

@_date: 2017-12-07 04:46:06
Every 216k blocks, to be precise; it's not time-based. If all the hashpower left the network and no new blocks were mined, the block reward wouldn't continue halving just based on 4 years passing. It happens to be 4 years because 216k blocks / 6 blocks/hour works out to about four years, which was almost definitely intentional.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:12:09
Good point. I think ultimately the reason that hard forking is a thing is that any issue, foreseen or not, can be resolved with a simple hard fork. If 8MB blocks really proved to be a problem, there wouldn't be any issue just forking back to 1MB or 2MB or whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:12:37
See if it has an option for custom fees; if it does just set a fee of 100-120 sat/B or around there, which should be only $3-$4 unless that tx has a lot of dust inputs.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:37:32
This is where we might see the decentralized rubber hit the road. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's principal code aspects, but the majority of Bitcoin holders and users (first-world, at least moderately affluent) haven't had a need to invoke it until now. 
What it means for Bitcoin and NN is that Comcast and Verizon can easily choke centralized exchanges or pools like Coinbase if they want, but all full and partial nodes remain online as long as they're not connected to a centralized service. It is logistically impossible to choke or ban all Bitcoin nodes from operating, and while they could just block port 8333 (used by full nodes), it takes two seconds to map a new port and push new software, ad nauseam. This means that the Bitcoin network will survive and continue operating in almost all logically probable scenarios, and while there may be hiccups like temporary hashrate reduction because of pools getting choked, 0.5%-2% hashrate operational pools are abundant and we can just keep moving to them each time they choke a dominant pool. 
Essentially what I'm saying is, the fundamental decentralization of Bitcoin means that although they can target voluntarily centralized Bitcoin hubs, there is not one "Bitcoin" that they can block or throttle and there never will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:57:21
If this sub's theory that BCH just airlifts the good bits of code from BTC is true, we can just sap the whole Lightning Network part-and-parcel when you guys are done with it.
/s, obviously, but seriously, what impedes BCH from simply copying the BTC LN implementation with minor tweaks when it's done? We'd need Segwit, but we could probably get majority adoption of that in under half a year, faster if by hard-fork.

Ok, if it has confirmations and you're sure that the receiving address is identical to your Coinbase address, you need to contact Coinbase and get help. If it was sent to the proper address and has at least 6 confirmations and still isn't showing up in your CB account, that's a problem on their end.

@_date: 2017-12-07 05:32:24
Personal opinion. Every time BTC goes on one of its mini-bull-runs and hits a new ATH, which happens almost daily these days, it corrects at least $1k because the smart money that's been waiting to cash out sees the ATH and cashes out. This is the best "dip" that you're going to achieve predictably, so wait for a good ATH (like the $14k that we just hit), let it correct $1k-$1.5k, then buy.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:42:21

@_date: 2017-12-10 01:49:02
You're now worth over $500k. Realistically, you cash out the lot and just claim it, but if you wanted to learn a little bit about Bitcoin and start holding it as an investment, you could cash out maybe 75% and continue to hold the last 25%, for example. Don't cash out less than half, though.
I would definitely hire a tax lawyer and examine the conditions under which you acquired the computer (did he give it to you? is he dead and it was willed to you? etc), which will matter for tax purposes.

And Coinbase is known to show unconfirmed txns?
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:03:18
This is true. If blocks weren't full, LN would, at best, be a solution to slightly reduce the number of on-chain txns by providing a faster off-chain avenue for microtransactions that you perform frequently and that don't need to be on-chain. I don't think it was supposed to be the be-all-end-all of transacting.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:27:22
I support Cash, but I think that Ver has no place being the figurehead or speaker for anything, much less the proposed direct competitor to the strongest cryptocurrency on Earth. He's a hotheaded idiot with very little applicable knowledge and barely passable public speaking skills, and he makes Cash look unpolished and boorish. I think that BCH communities have only adopted him as a figurehead for lack of a better one - they like to brag about their strength in different development bases (which is a valid thing to have), but even great developers like Andresen aren't that good at publicly advancing something. 
I guess the policy that the community applies with him is "no such thing as bad publicity." Every time he does something retarded, BCH gets a spike in attention because of the ridicule on pro-BTC communities. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:53:52
As a BCH supporter, the main reason is that it improves tx throughput right now without waiting for Lightning and can still have the same layer-2 solutions implemented on it when they're actually ready. I think any given person is talking out of their ass if they claim to know what's best for scaling in the long term, but I do know that right now, tx throughput increase is desperately needed and 8MB blocks aren't difficult for hardware to handle in any major way.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:29:00


Bit early to say that, but what we have already seen could be promising. 


If that's your only solution to scaling, then yes, but a big-block chain can still have all of the layer-2 solutions like LN built on top of it. It doesn't need to scale vertically forever.

I'm bearish on almost all crypto in 2018, because I think the BTC bubble is going to pop soon, which we all know will have a direct impact on most other crypto prices. I think the Ripple banker-coin might survive because its investor base is different from the people investing in real cryptos, but I'm still hesitant to hedge with it because its system is too trust-based. I hold 50% BCH, 25% ETH, and 25% XMR and I am pretty confident I'm going to see all of those going down within the first few months of 2018, but I'm in it for the long run. Once we recover this crazy price but with organic interest instead of speculative interest, there'll be nowhere to go but up.

The cashier at my local 7-11, who has a GED and lives in the bad part of town, holds almost a full BTC and stays super up-to-date on most alts, so go figure I guess. I barely believed him until I saw he had a new Note 8 one day and he told me he cashed out like 0.1BTC to buy it, and then showed me all his wallets on it with like ~0.8 BTC, 2 XMR, ~1 DASH, ~1.5 ETH, etc. The newest thing he's on is this penny crypto called Electroneum - he bought 10k tokens in the ICO @ $0.01ea and the price is already $0.11 and still climbing like 15-20% per day, so he turned his $100 investment into $1100 and counting. 
It's actually kinda cool because I can have a mini-conversation about crypto every time I go to buy a soda or whatever and catch up on prices if I haven't checked. He even took the time to introduce me to Electroneum and convince me to buy about 1500 tokens against my better judgement, so I'm thankful for that, too! And I've frequently seen him hyping crypto to the other customers and on rare occasion, selling them like 1000-2000 bits for cash to get them started. We're everywhere.

I'll break this up into logically progressing tiers. May require more than one comment. Like I said, my knowledge is limited to what I researched for a school project so anyone who actually codes blockchain applications can correct me on the technological bits.
* Bitcoin is based on the SHA-256 algorithm, which is a hash function. A hash function is defined as something that takes an abstract piece of data and converts it to a different type of data as per a constant set of rules (for more information, see the Wikipedia on hash functions). 
* Thus, every block on the blockchain has a distinct and forever unique hash code associated to it, which is just a really long alphanumeric string (to see this in action, go to a site like Blockchain.info, click any block and then look at the "hash" data field). Miners' job is to compute that hash code based on the data of the transactions in the associated block. 
* However, while this is relatively complicated math, even a low-end PC could probably still get a couple hundred correct hashes a second, which obviously doesn't jibe with the 6 blocks/hour constant rate. It also doesn't work because, if the network hash power goes up, the block time would go down, which would make for unpredictability and possible severe price fluctuation. 
* Thus, the difficulty algorithm. Under the DA, transaction data is actually only a small part of what is computed in a hash - this data is computed before hashing begins in something called a "Merkle root." All valid hashes actually have several derivatives: the Merkle root of the current block, the Merkle root of the previous block, a timestamp, some other assorted constants and then a random piece of data called a "nonce." 
* (As a side note, what makes the blockchain secure is the fact that all valid hashes must include the previous block's Merkle root. This means that in order to tamper with the data of any block, you would have to control more than 51% of the network hash power so that you could get the network to accept the corrupted subsequent block and get the changes that you made in the tampered block online. [Hence, the term '51% attack.'] This is why more confirmations = more security - every time a new block is mined, it takes the previous block and cements it further in the network with its Merkle root, making it so that you would have to undo and redo more and more computation the further back you want to go. The industry standard for a 100% irreversible transaction is six confirmations.)
* This nonce is the key to the whole process. The DA functions by adjusting what is considered a "valid" hash using a complicated checksum - so, not only does a submitted hash have to include all of the correct data, it also has to achieve a value below the checksum.
* In order to achieve this magic value, miners compute billions or trillions of hashes per second, changing one value with each hash that is rejected: the nonce. A new nonce gives an entirely different hash and thus a new chance to achieve a value under the checksum. 
* When more hash power joins the network and more hashes per second start being submitted, the network adjusts the acceptable parameter so that more hashes overall are required to get a valid hash, thus keeping the blocktime at about 10 minutes. This adjustment occurs with every 2,016 blocks that are mined, and means that older and less powerful miners are organically forced out of the system as newer miners join.
* Miners are paid with something called the coinbase transaction (unrelated to the company of the same name). All miners include one unique transaction in their submitted hash that pays the block reward and TX fees to their address, or their pool's address in the case of mining pools. Thus, if their hash is deemed to be valid and included on the main blockchain, the coinbase transaction automatically gets paid by consensus. 
* Once a hash has been accepted, that hash and all of its constituent data are stored on the blockchain as one block and propagated to all the network nodes, and all of the new transactions included in it get one confirmation.
You can see a very slowed-down simulation of how mining works by going to satoshistruevision.com and clicking on "Mining simulator." This will show you a real-time example of how the nonce is adjusted to produce a different final hash.
That's all of the important tenets I can think of. Let me know if you want anything clarified.

Honestly it's all up to how much adoption we get, and how fast. 8MB is a soft limit, which can be relaxed to up to 32MB with consensus, so in theory we shouldn't need to think about layer 2 solutions until full 32MB blocks, which is five-odd years off at least. This is, of course, barring the circumstance that big blocks actually do create some type of problem, in which case we can either tighten the soft limit again or fork back to a smaller blocksize, but in both cases layer 2 solutions should already be ready by that point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:40:53
You seem to misunderstand how the difficulty and the 21M cap works. 
The difficulty is dynamic in relation to the network hash power so that one block is always mined about every ten minutes on aggregate. Looking at the amount of blocks in the past 24h or past 7d from a site like blockchain.info will corroborate this. This means that the difficulty actually doesn't dictate how many BTC are awarded in a given time period. 
What you're looking for is the block reward. The block reward is the new BTC that are created and paid to the successful miner upon each new block, plus whatever tx fees were paid in the transactions of that block. This is configured to halve with every 216,000 blocks that are mined, which works out to about every four years @ 1 block / 10 minutes, so right now it's 12.5 BTC (although the unusually high tx fees mean that it ends up being closer to 15 BTC with fees factored for). 
This is how the 21M cap works. The block reward going down exponentially combined with the block time staying constant means that the amount of new Bitcoin created year-over-year will decrease further and further towards zero until it can no longer mathematically be divided. I.e., bitcoin has eight significant figures (decimal places) under the current code, which means the minimum amount of BTC that can ever be transacted or held is a hundred millionth (also referred to as a satoshi). Thus, the block reward will halve until it reaches one satoshi, and then will simply cease to exist once it reaches the point where it would have halved again, because continuing at one satoshi would exceed the 21M cap if another 216,000 blocks were mined, and it cannot halve further to continue on under the cap. 
This puts the stoppage of BTC issuance at around 2140, so all of us should be dead barring an exceptional medical breakthrough. Of course, this is providing that a fork doesn't occur that introduces more sigfigs, which might be necessary as the value of Bitcoin climbs (once BTC exceeds US$1 million, its smallest denomination [the satoshi] will exceed the smallest denomination of the USD [one cent], which will be problematic unless fiat currency dies before then). Should more sigfigs be introduced, the block reward will then continue halving until it reaches its minimum denomination under the new set of sigfigs and will then cease to exist again.
No matter how many sigfigs are introduced, though, we will never get to a full 21 million BTC; it's a classic variant of the go-halfway-to-the-moon problem. If you go halfway to the moon, go half of the remaining distance, go half of the new remaining distance and keep repeating, you will forever get closer and closer to the moon but will never fully reach it; however, if you allow yourself to travel the same distance at any point twice in a row without halving, no matter where you are or what the distance is you will reach it. This is exactly how the block reward works, except there's a cap on the denomination to which you can halve unless more sigfigs come into play.

Wouldn't that create a trust-based system, though? AFAIK, if Person A opens a Lightning channel and uses it to send BTC to Person B, Person A technically still owns that BTC until Person B settles on-chain. Also, if Person B wants to use the BTC somewhere else, they would *have* to settle unless the place where they wanted to use it had LN and had a valid routing path to Person B's channel. Anyone who has more in-depth knowledge of Lightning can correct me.

I feel like Ethereum is one of the safest hedges right now if that's how you're feeling.

Plus, it has multiple strengths in the ability to execute smart contracts/dapps.

I'm not opposed to soft forking, but the problem of consensus still exists. Segwit is supposedly a great scaling solution and would almost completely resolve the current network congestion, but we can't even know that for sure because it's still hovering at like 10% adoption. You can soft fork a billion protocols and none of them will do anything unless the community agrees to adopt and use them, which is the operative problem.

The whole point of Bitcoin, and of cryptocurrency in general, is to use and spread it. Believe it or not, you're doing something much better than any of the people who are just "hodling," because you're advancing the future of decentralized money. In fact, the pizza guy has gone on record saying he doesn't regret a thing and he was happy to be the first Bitcoin transaction. Ultimately, we're not here to make money, we're here to make being your own bank a reality - for everyone. And even if none of your family or friends give two shits about that, you've still done them a great and honorable service - money is often hard to come by for almost anyone in the bottom 99%, and they're going to thank you if they ever really need it.
As the saying goes, the best time to buy was in 2009, but the next-best time to buy is right now. 10k? 20k? Anything with just five digits? Crypto is still in its infancy. All the people who think that the quick money has already been made are idiots, and they'll be kicking themselves silly at 100k and again at 1mln. How long it's going to take to get there, who knows, but it's going to happen.

BCH supporter here. Not all of us are fully proponents of the "more-more-more-more blocksize" argument, but I think any idiot can agree that right now the Bitcoin network is unreasonably congested and 8MB blocks do not cause any significant problems. The beauty of open source/decentralized software is that if an issue manifests with the current chain, you can just fork, and as long as your fork has a legitimate reason to exist and has community backing, you have fixed the issue. 
In a nutshell, we believe that there's no true downside to 8MB blocks: they can handle the current level of throughput easily, layer 2 solutions and other fixes like Segwit or LN can still be implemented on top of them, and if big blocks truly end up being a problem - for whatever reason - we can always just fork back to whatever a sustainable blocksize is.

They're unpredictable. They usually start when some very large interest cashes out or moves to another crypto, flooding the market and satisfying all the buy orders above a certain amount and thus driving the price down to that amount. The dip itself starts when those who are less experienced or knowledgeable think that the price decrease will continue as a trend, so they sell while they think they're ahead and thus the price keeps going down. Eventually, all the people who are jittery enough sell out and the price plateaus, then starts climbing back up as normal when the smart money buys the dip. 
They used to be semi-predictable at psychological barriers (e.g. $10k) - many people were expecting 10k to correct hard because of all the sell orders and all of the people who finally think they've profited enough and cash out, but we barreled right past it, so clearly can't count on that anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:37:29
There's a gigantic transaction backlog right now (which means giant fees) because a lot of miners knee-jerked off of BTC and onto BCH because it was short-term more profitable to mine.

No. To put your (lack of) profitability in perspective, your phone is getting 4 KH/s (four thousand hashes a second). Modern (i.e. profitable) miners are measured in multiple terahashes (trillions of hashes per second). Assuming you ran the miner 24/7/365 (which you wouldn't, because you actually use your phone), you would make about two millionths of a dollar in one year. 
There is an emerging crypto called Electroneum that can *only* be mined with a phone, so that might be profitable for you if you have a somewhat recent or powerful phone. Look into it.

Like a stock, basically - as with almost anything else that can be bought and sold, it works off supply and demand. If more people want to buy bitcoin than are selling it, the price goes up, and if more people want to sell than are buying, the price goes down. Of course, the actual amount of people that want to do either of those things is dependent on a number of factors, but it boils down to what they think is profitable based on market analysis.


As with all things that you can put money into, follow the golden rule of "don't invest more than you can afford to lose." While it's a slim chance, you shouldn't invest so much that your life will be ruined if BTC goes in the tubes and 1BTC goes back to $50 like in the old days.


Buy through a respected exchange like Coinbase (that is the one that comes to mind for me, just Google "good places to buy bitcoin.") It might be more problematic for you because most good sites require ID and you're underage, but if you can get a parent/guardian to cosign on it and buy the BTC in their name, that'll work. 


I won't add my personal opinion of NH, but you should be aware that it's not really representative of mining profitability in any way, shape or form, and shouldn't be used as a test thereof. You're not really "mining" with NH - you are contributing hash power to a large multipool and getting paid in BTC for doing so, which is not the same as raw mining even if it seems similar on the surface (because what you get paid will depend on what NiceHash buyers are buying on a given day and how much they're paying for it). 


Home mining is uniquely profitable right now because of the value spike, but again, do not invest more than you'd be afraid to lose lest BTC tanks. A good miner like the S9, if bought at MSRP and used in a state with non-obscene power costs, could ROI in four months or less in the present scene, which is incredible for a single home miner. However, the up-front cost is obviously large, and there are some prohibitive things about it. These include noise (any miner you can buy today will be OBSCENELY loud under operation, so it will have to be placed somewhere that is a good distance from any human activity), power (if you're underage, you will have to compensate your parents for their power bill by surrogate), heat dissipation (they pump out as much heat as a small space heater, so good ventilation and probably A/C in the summer if you don't want throttling) and internet (modern miners connect through Ethernet and are used with a remote client, so you have to either run a CAT5 cable to the miner or set up one of those WiFi to Ethernet boxes). However, if you can tolerate and/or work around all of this, and you're willing to take something of a gamble on the upfront cost, home mining is quite a fun experience and is also easily scalable these days (once you ROI, you can easily buy a second miner or sell the first miner off at a slight profit and buy the newer model). 


First, pick a miner that will maximize profitability (hashrate, hash to power ratio, upfront cost, resale value) and a HIGH-QUALITY, EFFICIENT power supply (Bitmain APW3++ if you live in a 220V country, any 1600W PC power supply that's rated 80+ Gold or better if you don't). (If you have a PC PSU, look up how to jump the ATX cable to get it to start without being plugged in, or just buy an ATX jumper off Amazon.) Set up your miner in an area that is well-ventilated, temperature-controlled (if natural ventilation isn't enough), not extremely moist (or actively dehumidified), away from human activity (unless your household is deaf), and has Ethernet access, either direct or through a WiFi Ethernet box. Remote into the miner with a desktop PC on your home network and set it up (you can Google this for your specific model of miner, there are always guides); you will need to pick a pool to mine in, so do some research and pick the one that seems the best for you in terms of ethics and profitability. After you configure it and you verify that it's hashing for about an hour or so, you can leave it alone (although do check in at least daily to make sure something hasn't snafued somewhere, obviously). 


Ideally you use a hardware wallet like the Nano S, which will provide the best blend of security and functionality, but the major downside is that you are extremely fucked if you lose it or forget your PIN. If you don't want a hardware wallet, just keep most of your BTC in a wallet on your PC (obviously, take regular external backups and make cold stores on DVDs too if possible) and put some in a separate wallet on your phone anytime you go out.
I hope that covers all your questions. If you have any other questions or clarifications just let me know.

I wouldn't take his word for it at all.

@_date: 2017-11-19 04:50:33
Here is a very ELI5 explanation. 
* Many transactions are occurring on the BTC network at any given time, which have to be securely computed into the blockchain in order for the trustless protocol to work. 
* The solution to do this while keeping it decentralized is to make network members do it with their own hardware. 
* However, you have to incentivize them. So, for every block (set of transactions) that they process, they receive a block reward (given amount of bitcoin, currently 12.5). 
* The network also makes the processing itself artificially difficult so that it takes a long time to compute, about 10 minutes per block, adjusted dynamically. (I.e., if the network hash power was 10EH/s and that dropped to 7.5EH/s, the difficulty would go down at the next difficulty adjustment to keep the block time at about 10 minutes). 
* The hardware used for it gradually evolved as Bitcoin gained popularity - at first, desktop CPUs were used, then powerful discrete GPUs, and finally ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) built specially for Bitcoin mining. Because new and better ASICs are developed at such a blistering pace, the network hash power (and thus difficulty) tends to go up very fast, necessitating the purchase of newer and better hardware all the time in order to keep pace and stay profitable. 
* Also, as the network hash power went up, single miners became very unlikely to successfully process blocks, so "pools" came out (massive networks of individual miners all hashing together under one network to solve the same block, then paying out the block reward [if one is achieved] evenly among the miners based on hash power contributed). 
In order to get started, you need a competent Bitcoin ASIC (5 TH/s or better) whose power costs do not exceed its total earnings. You also need an ATX power supply with enough 6-pin PCIe connectors and enough current to run the miner. For older USB miners you'll need a host computer too; for newer ones that have Ethernet ports, you can remote in via IP address and then just leave them to run. 
Speaking about NiceHash, it's somewhat weird in relation to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It basically indexes 15+ unique mining algorithms (example: Bitcoin's SHA256), determines the algorithms that would be most profitable for your computer to mine, and then sells your computer's hashing power to whoever wants to buy it (for Bitcoin). So you're not, in fact, really mining Bitcoin nor supporting the Bitcoin network - you're just mining whatever random algorithm and then getting paid in Bitcoin for doing it.

Ridiculous transaction fees. Small blockers have turned the currency into a store-of-value rather than an actual transactional currency, and S2X failed so we're not seeing TX scaling until off-chain solutions (e.g. LN) arrive, which is a year off at absolute minimum. There could be another official attempt to fork a small blocksize increase as a stop-gap, but considering how badly S2X flamed I think they're hesitant to try that again.

I'm assuming autocorrect fucked up some of your wording, so I will put what I thought you wrote above each of my responses, and you can correct me if I guessed wrong. But I'm certainly glad I could help. 


[LEPA's G1600]( is probably the cheapest you'll find that actually hits Gold efficiency and doesn't have piss-poor build quality. If you wanted to pay about $150 more upfront to get more efficiency (=more profit) and slightly better build quality, [EVGA's 1600T2]( is another solid choice. 


ATX PSUs won't start unless they detect that they're connected to a motherboard, for whatever reason. The thing is, this detection is done by just a couple of pins on the ATX cable, so if you just short them together with a paperclip you will trick the PSU into thinking it's connected to a motherboard.
If you're a tightwad and want to DIY it, plug the ATX cable into your PSU and then find the fourth and fifth pins on the top row (top row being the one closest to the locking tab). (It is important to do this on the cable connector and not on the PSU connectors themselves, because female modular connectors on PSUs are NOT standardized and you may cook the PSU if you short the wrong pins.) Grab a paperclip, bend it straight, then stick each end into the fourth and fifth pins that you found, bend the clip into an arch, then secure it by some means (duct tape is what I use). If you did it right the PSU will turn on without being plugged into a motherboard. 
If you don't want to DIY it and have $10 to spare, buy something like [this]( (or just search "psu jumper" on your shopping site of choice). The power switch on the one I linked is not necessary, but could be nice to have.


Short answer: no. Long answer: you probably could, but one of two things would happen: your hashrate wouldn't be as high as advertised, or some of your hashes would be invalid, neither of which are good. The reason for this is that the APW3++ can only provide 1200W on a 110V (US) circuit, so it doesn't provide enough power to run an L3+ or S9 at full capacity. That being said, if you wanted to buy a lower-power miner like the Avalon 741 or the very first batch of S9 (if you could find one), the APW3++ would work, as long as the rated power of the miner is under 1200W. 
(As a side note, I wouldn't at all recommend buying an L3+. Any Scrypt coin right now will have SHITE profitability and expansion potential compared to Bitcoin (Scrypt is what the L3+ mines, as opposed to SHA256, which is used by Bitcoin and is what the S9 mines). So stick to Bitcoin.) 


One of two ways. If you are over 18 and have a bank account, you can use an online marketplace like Coinbase, which will let you sell Bitcoin on an administrated, peer-to-peer marketplace and pays out in bank transfer. If you are underage or you don't want your money in bank transfer, find a real-life Bitcoin ATM near you, which will dispense cash and can be used by anyone but has other downsides (high fees, exchange rates are sometimes not as up-to-date as on online marketplaces).

No, the blockchain does hold your cryptocurrency. The blockchain is a comprehensive list of the Bitcoin amounts assigned to all currently active public keys, and individual users can prove they own a public key (and thus claim the BTC associated to it) by providing its attached private key. The only thing that the individual user (or wallet, such as Coinbase) holds is the private key.

I haven't heard about anything remotely close to that, and I'm active in most Bitcoin communities. Some governments are cracking down on it and starting to regulate and tax it, but given its scale that's the worst that would happen in the US. And I doubt even that would happen because I'm willing to bet most of our lawmakers still aren't aware it exists.

The project is actually *specially optimized* to run on ASICs, after a niche in the volunteer computing market found that people wanted a use for their bitcoin miners that they had retired. It's not for just anyone to run on their standard PC.
