Yea, the new red locations are where it's at, the shops are aware they carry it which is a big plus over the old ones who had no idea.

Occasionally, I see google ads, but adblockplus is pretty great, and I love not seeing most of that shit.

Remind me again, did the tulip price recover after its historic collapse?

Definitely prefer the English version that used to be available on bitcoinwisdom.

And it's all just a little bit of history repeating:

You're right...the word is distribution, not accumulation...edited.
My timeline seems in sync with yours though, the "handle" if formed over the next 6-12 months will result in a breakout that could yield extraordinary gains from there due to market conditions, speculation, and maybe even an ETF thrown in there to get the party started.

We have that already with GBTC...it's a company with stock that tracks the price of BTC like an ETF without having actual ETF approval.  ETF is different than a stock.  When the ETF launched for gold...the price of gold went up.  Since bitcoin is not a company, you have to either have a company that has stock that tracks like the price (like GBTC), or get an ETF approval which allows the correct kind of protocols for large scale investors to buy at will...hence everyone thinking moon upon approval or non-contested approval.  The analyst does not name any reason it would be rejected...so while the probability of committee certified approval is low, the probability of rejection also seems low...so my money is on auto-approved without signature.

My crystal ball says we'll hit 500 again before making the next breakout advance.  Loose timeline: 6-12 months before we fully recover...more downside likely, but between three to six months, be looking for dips to buy back in on...while it may stay flat around 600 for a period of a few months, it will start its ascent again from there and won't look back.  I don't hope for this, but it seems likely based on the chart formation known as a cup and handle, just look that up on google and checkout the weekly chart on bitfinex to see the cup we just formed...extrapolate 
from there.
Chart formations don't care about news (although sometimes they seem almost predictive)...like a honeybadger doesn't care.

Calling onecoin an imitator is giving that scam far too much credit. They are, at best, a ponzi scheme (but I doubt anyone can truly get their money out before the disappearance act) preying on minorities and anyone they can who doesn't understand the first thing about bitcoin but wants to profit from it (your parents and grandparents perhaps). 
I would call Alt-Coins imitators...onecoin is fermented shit.

The flow of capital into and out of btc right now screams market maker distribution (selling so much so fast that they can buy back in at a lower price at a later date)...this can be seen by the cup and handle formation that occurs as a result.  William O'Neill (founder of Investors Business Daily) believes cup and handles are of extreme importance for finding securities that are being accumulated by fund managers and large scale institutional investors.  Once we break through the previous top on Bitfinex, ^ this guy will be regurgitating everything he took but keeping the uppers.
