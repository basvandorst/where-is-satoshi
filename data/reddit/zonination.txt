*All* of the comments were removed in the interest of neutrality. Vote brigading is frowned upon on Reddit, and the user will need to repost his question at a different time.
Sincerely, the PF mod team.

The problem was that they weren't voted on or suggested by quality; it essentially devolved into branding. Everything that was non-bitcoin related was downvoted, and everything that was bitcoin-related was upvoted.
As I asked elsewhere, if dropped in like this on one of your threads asking for help, what would be your judgment call?
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:33:05
We would prefer not to have this sort of thing happen again. That's why we may need to be talking shortly with the moderation team to ensure our sub's posts don't get hijacked in the future.
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:28:36
That is not a solution we are looking at at this time.

Moderation != censorship. Please read [this section]( of the thread.

Our community is *very* protective of itself. Our decision would be no different if something like came over and started making suggestions...
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:02:28
I'll be sure to make a note. Thank you for the heads-up. Though I don't think that measure was overzealous...

At one point, some of the useful non-bitcoin comments had been downvoted so far that it would have affected the OP's judgement in determining whether it was actually good advice. That's another issue we ran into as well.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:43:40
There was really no other option our team could decide on. For three reasons:
* Allowing the brigaded comments to stay would have resulted in irrelevant discussion, and wouldn't have helped OP.
* Removing *only* the bitcoin comments would be censorship, potentially rousing the ire of That would be counterproductive, plus there were even some good bitcoin suggestions. However, all the non-bitcoin posts got downvoted. What's the OP to make of the comments section when the only decent comments that are present have been gamed?
* The only remaining solution was to lock the thread, have the OP repost, and remove all remaining comments.
What would your judgment call have been?

Thank you for your quick and diplomatic response. I appreciate the move, and hope it's temporary. I'll forward this info to our team so we can discuss this further, if need be.
As of right now, there is no blacklisting of bitcoin on and we wish to keep it that way since there are some valid uses for it. Thank you for the information and the rapid response.

One of the mods of PF here.
Nobody has been shadowbanned, and Bitcoin posts are not being bot removed; you have my word. We respect that some applications to Personal Finance could involve tools or products like bitcoin, and we even cater to users who have questions about digital currency (though we also offer caveats about risk). We just want to avoid brigading, is all.
Thank you for reading; I hope you find this an insightful reply. :)

That subreddit basically saved me from myself. Decided to give back for a whole year and a half, and eventually was chosen to help moderate. I apologize if that's all you took away from the sub; if there are any suggestions you might have to better improve your experience, please offer them in our modmail.
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:24:46
Please note that this was decided after discussion among multiple members of our mod team, after receiving dozens of bitcoin posts/reports in a short period of time. This was not a unilateral action by "some mod". Like I've said before, the OP was instructed via PM to make a repost at a different date to find the help he needs.
The decision was made to remove all posts, even the helpful non-bitcoin ones, in lieu of alienating the community.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:58:59
That is your own prerogative. I've already informed the OP of the vote brigading via PM, and asked him/her to post at a different time.
In the future, threads on PF will continue to be removed in this manner if this kind of vote manipulation doesn't cease. We try our best at PF to provide the best advice possible without being partial to a particular good or service. We've become extra sensitive to that now that we're a default sub, and are often the target of private interest / spam.
That being said, I've nothing against bitcoin or the community. In fact, I've speculated and bought items with small amounts of BTC in the past. So don't take this to be censorship; we just prefer to keep our advice free from raids.

Thank you for your response. I appreciate that NP is strictly enforced here, but it's all too easy to simply work around it. This is evidenced by the fact that comments about bitcoin were made almost exclusively after this post was created.
I'll send your team a modmail as soon as I get home. I'm sure there is an equitable and diplomatic solution that doesn't involve extreme measures.
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:06:56
It still resulted in a heavily skewed vote tally, and a *lot* of negative attention to the poster who pointed out the brigade.
Not to mention that this was more than a "few".
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:36:13
That forces its own question: Does it really help OP to have the majority of the comments be some variation on "bitcoin!!", and having all the other perfectly valid suggestions downvoted?
What would be your judgement call if did this to one of your threads asking for advice?
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:33:28
Eh, there are some cards that offer $z cash back after $x spend in y months, so some situations it can make sense.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:13:39
Of course. Folks down there like to call it "manufactured spending".
1. Credit balance --&gt; Bitcoins + points - fee
2. Bitcoins --&gt; cash - fee
3. Cash --&gt; Credit balance
Residuals: fees and points. If the points outweigh the fees, it's worth a try. I know of several cards with signing bonuses that could benefit from this. Same with cards that offer 2% cash back.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:03:27
I wonder if would appreciate this.
