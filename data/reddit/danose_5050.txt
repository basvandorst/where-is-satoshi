1000 BTC of course

We can't, that's why it's still the wild west. 
Exchanges can claim it's tainted and ask you to provide more details while locking your account.

The biggest point of failure for crypto anonymity is purchasing physical items. 
Sure you can mask your payment by using mined coins but when it comes to Shipping, you're exposed.

If that hit the earth, everything will end. 
Even Bitcoiners

Sub told me this is good for bitcoin cause lost keys take BTC out of circulation.

Give up the private key if/when robbers use hammer on you, life more important?

Take whatever you read online with a pinch of salt and use your own judgement.
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:01:47
Eh? 
Please don't tell me you kept all on an exchange or Coinbase/Gemini. 
If you're not actively trading, keep them in your own wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-08 11:35:56
That's pretty! 
Where did you get that?
@_date: 2019-08-08 04:44:54
sorry for your loss, 
do update if Malwarebyte able to detect it. 
I'm using it at the moment.

Amazing work!

Banks do not keep the full amount of cash of their customers. 
Bank run happens when people withdrawing more cash than the amount the bank have.

To add on, when you want to send crypto to another address, always double check the 1st/middle/end few alphanumeric when you copy paste into the addressee address.   
There's some malware that hijack the copy/paste into hackers address

Is there a list of which UTXO he claimed?

Just remember, you don't need to buy one whole BTC. 
You can buy 0.1 or 0.001 or USD100 worth

Crypto users: “fuck government interference”
Also Crypto users:”fuck yeah! Glad government taking down libra”

Didn't BTC price dropped as well during 2018? 
Should have change it to 2019, where only BTC stood firm. 
And like others mentioned, Night King died in the same episode.

When the world is flooded and no machine can process those btc transactions. lol
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:17:01
That and also some of us, buy bitcoin when it’s Low and spend them when it’s high.   Basically the “magic internet money” 
Sure we’re still using fiat-bitcoin-fiat as transaction in most places at the moment, but we are sure one day there will be more merchants willing to accept BTC as payment.

Glad to see these type of posts rather than that stupid "I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING" Leonardo meme.

I enjoy the rollercoaster meme actually, cause of that cute coin guy.  Lol.

Anytime you key in your seed word is a chance of exposing it.

Google search for bitcoin all time high? Bullrun!
Hashrate all time high? Bullrun!
Triangle? Bullrun!

Scroll  newsfeed yesterday.  There was a post about Indian bank limiting withdrawal to $14 per day.

Just use Icelandic word generator. You can get
Eyjafjallajökull, Hofsjökull, Reykjaneshryggur, Theistareykjarbunga

Don't listen to the extreme views.  It's your BTC use it however you like.   
Now for the question, 
Best scenario would be business that accept BTC if not, 
If you have plenty of crypto and you want to spend it, get a crypto card.  I'm using MCO card for spending at the moment. 
But if don't have any crypto and want to use crypto card, then there's no point.  Why would you want to convert your FIAT -&gt; Crypto -&gt; FIAT.

Thanks for the links!

Mixers are service that mix your bitcoin with other bitcoin, so that it’s not easily traced
