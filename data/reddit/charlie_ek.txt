The example used in my post?Greece and Cyprus for sure. Probably and the rest of Balkans. I know eastern Europe is supposed to be west in regards with the rest of the world but you get my point.

I know next to nothing about mining but bro if you are about to start a mining business and you are asking about the capital needed in Reddit then probably you are not ready to start that business.

No, not really. It's probably a rumour but it was openly stated back in the days when he was still finance minister of Greece. This and that he was a consultant for some Asian crypto exchange.

Correct me if wrong, but I think that this guy was an advisor for a coin a couple of years ago.

Crash further? Bubble? If the post was supposed to be posted yesterday ok but at the moment we are at -10% from last week BUT +88% from the last month.

I m not the tech guy that can explain, and explain in depth all the advantages of the Bitcoin. Or crypto in general. As an everyday guy I m gonna use a real life example tho.
I work 10/12hour shift in a really hard work under bad conditions for a really shitty wage. I know you don't care but had to make to it clear that my money are REALLY hard earned and appreciated to the last cent. A couple days ago I wanted to transfer some fiat money to an account (sepa transfer). Nothing sketchy.  From my account to my buddy's. The bank for some reason had the transaction in hold for 3 days and after a few calls to their support the final comment was "your transaction is on hold, we can't do anything about it, you ll be notified when and IF it will go through". Another 2 days passed by just to reach "processing". 7 working days total to send 50 euros. You see the problem? The bank had on hold MY money, from MY account and I had to wait almost two weeks to be able to use MY FUCKING HARD WORKED MONEY the way I WANTED. meanwhile my buddy who has no clue on what crypto is, began from scratch, created an online wallet, received the amount I sent him and after all got into crypto. All that in two hours.

Badass story with strong moral. Here's my upvote sir.

It's pretty funny watching Western ppl arguing about the fees and how useable btc is in everyday life. Some of you use the possibility of government taking over your bank accounts as something terrible but unimaginable. On the other hand ppl in eastern Europe had to face that terror EVERY SINGLE DAY for about 2 years. We had to make peace with the fact that the government may or may not use half the money from every account overnight to bail the banks (and the country) out. And every morning we had to make sure our life savings where still in place. Also we couldn't withdraw them cause the capital controls for over a year only allowed withdraws up to 60€/week per account. 60€/WEEK. Be my guest, try to survive  with 60 euros for a week and pay everything with that. Rent, food, gas, everyday expenses etc . On the other hand if you were smart enough (I wasn't) to "store" your money in btc you could probably profit on top of having peace of mind. Still think that store of value is bad? Step outside your bubble and see the whole picture. Some of us don't care if we can buy coffee or games over steam. Some of us just want to be the Masters of our hard earned money. Sure that was not the point of btc in the begining. But still, even now, with all it flaws, it's still really useful for some ppl. The world is not just the us and rich eu countries.

I don't really get what the problem is. Just create a new wallet and with your wife present (so she cannot claim later that you fooled her) withdraw half of your amount. Or you can just take it all and when she asks about it say "honey Bitcoin is currency and as every kind of currency deflates so does it. Now we only have 0,002. Being the better person I ll let you have it all"

The point of the post is neither about superiority nor prepotence. An early adopter in the "crypto world" has been through dips like this quite a few times. Knows what to do and what to not, doesn't panick, knows the feeling of seeing your balance (temporarily) in the absolute red, blah blah blah. In a few words has gain his scars and medals in the battlefield. On the other hand, for me this whole experience is my first. So while I brag that I managed to not do any panic movements (panick selling, liquidation or any of the stupid things to do etc) he just sits back, smokes a cigar and watch me with a smirk on his face. 
For me it's a great experience, for him (where *him enter random experienced dude) is just another Tuesday. Ok now Sunshine? Is it clear now?
Also yeah at LEAST I know what FOREX is but I couldn't care less about it. 
I'm not here for the easy money investwise. I m here for the tech and the ideology behind that idea.

m8....thanks for your 2 cents but read my post again. The only thing i complain is the possibility of not going ALL IN in btc at the lowest possible price!

Ppl seem to forget what it actually is. With all it's flaws, all it's drawbacks, all the drama. At the end of the day it's just currency. And maybe for people in the west it's just something to invest/gamble on but for others (Latin America, south/east/southeast eu etc) it's a really viable solution. For everyday usage and money storage. As an Eastern European I had to deal quite a few times with the possibility that the banks with the blessings of the government could put my savings on hold or even worse cut in half to bail the country out of an economic crisis overnight.  You don't know the feel (and really wish you to never have to deal with it)  of getting informed in the middle of the night that starting tomorrow your saving will be half of what it was. Eventually we evaded that scenario but got through capital controls. Long story short for over a year we could withdraw only 60 euros/week. Imagine the panic. On the other hand now that I got involved with crypto I do WHATEVER the fuck I want with my money whenever I WANT without asking permission from some criminals with ties. And if i lose it is my fault.

Is it really? I hope  n wish it's just the begining (cause I got onboard really late) but there is no way ppl like me (late 2017 and with a small budget under 1k) will ever be able to see profits like investors up to 2015-16.

The vast majority if not all of them are scams. Just to get people to download the app and gain from the adds. And that's the good possibility. The bad possibility is that the random Dev knows that 95% of the users who download such an app most likely  use their mobile for crypto transactions with next to minimum security.
