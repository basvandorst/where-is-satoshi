Do you use iTunes? I'm working on a way you can use your bitcoin for anything on iTunes - whatdo you reckon?

That's crazy - I could've sworn Changetip was more popular than that... Could I estimate at least 50,000?

Thanks! It went well, and we've already got money streaming through :)

Thanks for the detailed reply, you've given us a good deal to think about. Donating and tipping are tricky topics, but it's their implication in empowering greater public control of wealth distribution that has us determined to help in any way we can. The biggest issue we see is the 'black hole' nature of addresses -- people, more times than not, are sending money away without any transparency as to how much the receiver needs it, what impact it makes on their life, or any metrics as to what has already been donated. We've addressed these problems in our prototype (through curated stories, goals and better data display) but we definitely aren't placing any bets.
In regards to valuing the work of open source developers and seeking financial compensation, I agree that a good formula is still a fair while away. Although we can't hope to make that big of a dent over two days at a hackathon, we're pumped to at least test some new solutions, even if they only show us and others what else won't work.
Again, thanks for the reply, great to hear from experience. Keep up the good work.
