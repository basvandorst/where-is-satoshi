Yea I see where OP was thinking this might be effective guerrilla marketing but failed to take into account how the general public view Bitcoin compared to the well-known American dollar. 
In my opinion, the best guerrilla marketing would be more businesses accepting Bitcoin and posting "Bitcoin accepted here" stickers on their windows while offering discounts for purchases made in Bitcoin. This could spur interest among their existing customers and lead to them wanting to learn more about Bitcoin. People not interested in Bitcoin could become curious if the local deli they've been shopping at for 10+ years suddenly promotes purchases made in Bitcoin. At least that's my two cents from a marketing view.

Guerilla marketing is just a low-cost unconventional way to create interest in a product or idea. It can range from something as creative as a viral youtube video to simple stickers on the front doors of shops in a community.

I created ww.clipono.com a few months ago to serve as a bitcoin business directory and free advertising for bitcoin specific discounts. I recommend creating a free account to appear on our map and also offer a discount for purchases in bitcoin. Best of luck with your business :)

I love this innovative idea and feel it will greatly help with global access to Bitcoin but I don't see it as appealing in the U.S. because of the legal red tape. Every small business would "technically" be required to register as a MSB and if they don't then they're risking their entire current business. Too many small businesses owners don't understand Bitcoin enough at this point and I don't feel they would be willing to risk their main source of income for something they don't fully grasp. Any smart business person sticks to what they know.

I created  along with my friend a little under 2 months ago. It's based on googlemaps and anyone can easily create an account to register their business/ATM/non-profit and manage their own listing. In addition, any business can create a Bitcoin exclusive discount and advertise it on the home page for free. 
It's taken many painstaking hours to get the map to the point it's at now while making no money from it so if you could at the very least visit our site and give some feedback it'd be much appreciated :)

Finally, Bitcoin is cool..

She makes some really awesome geometric graphics! Glad to see another Bitcoin-accepting merchant that offers a discount if you pay with Bitcoin. I made her business a profile page on our site ( and listed the discount as well. Best of luck :)

Never click anything in a suspicious email. If you're unsure just contact the supposed business directly to see if the email is legit.

I could be wrong but I believe this is the first car that was purchased with Bitcoin. A Lamborghini dealership in California sold a Tesla Model S to an anonymous Florida man last year.

I just made you a business profile on our map 
You can click own this business to claim it and gain exclusive admin rights to edit info, add pics, and list advertise discounts for free. I'm personally a big fan of renewable energy and hope accepting Bitcoin/giving a discount will lead to more people switching over to solar. Best of luck :)
