I find it odd that the best way to become rich in capitalism is to contribute less to society.
Number movers and property owners are the prime example. They've found a niche to essentially bring in money with very little work.
I am parroting this from a podcast but it makes sense. Please confirm or refute this idea.

I was bought one bitcoin as a joke very early on. I think they spent $50 on it. 
If this happens in my lifetime I don't even know what I'll do. I've been poor all my life. This would be insane.

I don't understand this. When you sell, isn't it the same thing as someone else buying. 
Like you bought it from someone that had a positive effect on the market, so why doesn't someone buying it from you have a similar effect?

Honest question, when I first got into bitcoin, and mentioned on here that I used Circle people downvoted and shit on Circle. It seems we've come full circle? Why is this?

CIRCLE STOPPED BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS?!?!? ELI5

What comic is this from? I've recently gotten into Marvel because of my girlfriend and this image looks very interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:14:31
Awesome! I always thought comics were so lame when I was younger, but now I am really starting to get into them. Kind of the opposite of how it usually goes. 
Thanks for the info.

It's interesting. I sold around 5,000 and nobody gave a fuck about bitcoin then. 
I did a presentation on bitcoin about a year ago and since, I've had 3 people message me saying they should've listened. My mom claims my cousin told her about it first, my grandma wants to buy everyone $100 of bitcoin for Christmas. And my ex girlfriend is still a whore.
It's crazy how fast things change.

Question for you. Do you believe the definition of a word is created by usage, or by the act of defining?
Because if it's the latter, well logic dictates you're wrong. If it's the former, congratulations, you played yourself.

I'll save this post and come back to it OP, but I'm a first year Uni student working full time with a full load at school. If you want to write some papers for me this semester I'd be glad to reimburse you. 
They'd have to be up to my standards of course. I have bitcoin, and you have time. Let's make this work. 
Message me if you're interested.

Why do you say that? I know he has views that conflict with the majority of Reddit but I'm genuinely wondering why you think he's a douche?

Well, I had it so well for so long, I was using Circle knowing little to nothing about Bitcoin and gladly being oblivious to all of the technical jargon. 
Now I have to change that, and learn about the intricacies of Bitcoin. 
So where do I begin? Or is there another place I can go about being an oblivious moron?

I agree that unconsenting circumcision is fucked. I'm just arguing against the dude shitting on my parents when I simply made a joke.
It's definitely not okay, but like I said they were young and uneducated and being guided through the process by people who didn't necessarily have the best intentions in mind.
Also as far as I'm concerned it is a process that's covered by insurance? Maybe not. Either way, when you're 19 and a 50 year old doctor tells you it's healthy for your baby to do something you're probably going to do it. Especially before the Internet. Now I can Google it and see the pros and cons. Back then it was much more accepted AND they had other things to worry about.
Plus I much prefer the look of a circumsized cock. I'd probably end up getting it done either way, so they saved me some money. Thanks for making my dick pretty mom!

Yeah like if Palestine was a country, Bitcoin couldn't support it 
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:50:59
Huh. As far as human history is concerned it is.
I agree with your sentiment but you're wrong. It is how this planet works. 
I maintain that it's wrong but you're being blatantly wrong.

Wow, that's aggressive calling people idiots. Neither of whom graduated from college, not willingly. You must be pretty perfect yourself there partner, can you mentor me?
When and where I was born this was a commonly accepted practice, and honestly most people didn't put much thought into it. Especially two kids who were more worried about feeding their new baby than questioning something that was seen as common practice.
Thanks for your supreme knowledge and virtue, may your light shine down upon me again in the following comments as I'm undoubtedly sure it will.
