I assume you're talking about Euros and not SEPA. And nope, I have no idea. But it's also irrelevant until the currency becomes useless as a medium of exchange, which is not the case.

The differences between bitcoin and a work of art from one of the most famous artists ever are innumerable (it's physical, can be burned, can be insured, has aesthetic value, etc. etc. etc...).
Moreover, barring an apocalypse, a Picasso has no chance of dropping 80%+ of its value in a matter of months, much less in our lifetime.

So you never plan to sell any of it? If you do, you're speculating like many of the rest of us, not using it as a store of value.
If it were a store of value, the price would be stable. The impact of people buying and holding is small to the amount of money being thrown around on speculation, as seen by the dramatic price swings.

While I agree with the sentiment of disrupting banks, why did you accept a foreign check as a payment, or leave the foreign country without cashing the check first (where it they are easy to cash with ID)? I'm actually impressed that the bank was able to do this for you.

Wow. That *is* truly ridiculous. And yes, hopefully the rumors prove to be true!

He has nothing to do anymore with the new Mega... he was bought out from what I remember. (Owned by a Chinese investor now, if I'm not mistaken.)
