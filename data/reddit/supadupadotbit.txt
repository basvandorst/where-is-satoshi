A friend of mine who is a large investor dumped around 5000 in a few orders so... Even if it goes to $0 it just means you buy 500 Bitcoins and wait...
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:04:33
I sold 50 Bitcoins @ $420 a coin and 5 Bitcoins at $355 a coin. Currently I'm Cryptoless as I sold all my Dogecoins , Peercoins , Litecoins , Primecoins and a bunch of random Altcoins I consider just complete Pump and Dumps I'll admit it.

Also you seem to know everything about me so here's my current loans page and what's remaining in debts
PS: The other people I owe have passed away so thanks for being an asshole I have contacted their families though to try to pay it off. 2 of them didn't know wtf I was talking about and the other 1's family is already rich.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:27:49
14 more emails added showing how much I had to contact them...

Name me one store you ACTUALLY bought stuff from with your Xapo Debit Card...
Just one...
Go ahead and make something up...
I got all day...
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:12:21
I cursed at them once I have countless emails with them where it has nothing but a struggle to get ANYTHING to work at Xapo.
I took to cursing as their support team is useless and they made this garbage platform on LifeLock's dime.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:11:25
It was absolutely not and I'm confused how I could make Xapo look any worse their customer service is garbage and always has been and I'm not even trying to openly plug AdvCash it's just genuinely better.

Trying to protect my funds?
I waited nearly 8 months total to be given a completely useless Xapo Debit Card that could not do anything...
The AdvCash Virtual Mastercard cost me $1 and worked instantly using Bitcoins to fund it.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:15:54
A well known scammer?
I owe one 17 year old teenage young adult man 4 Bitcoins?
I'm the biggest scammer in the world dude...

Also in reply to your first statement
Wences founded Lemon correct but Lifelock purchased Lemon a completely seperate technology.
While Wences and other staff at the future Xapo were working at Lemon (Lifelock) they created Xapo on Lifelock's dime.
Using Lifelock's resources ie computers , networks and general technology.
The response he gave was he was working on a "personal bitcoin storage" which is a complete load of shit as Xapo was raising 20 million dollars of Investor funding WHILE he was still working at Lifelock using Lifelock's resources.
Then when they actually launched it was riddled with problems.
The Debit cards never got issued for a lot of customers.
Customers asked for replaced cards and were charged fees.
It wen't from there is 0 monthly fees to there is a %2.5 monthly fee to it's not going to be repaid to it's going to be repaid in Bitcoin.
The Xapo Debit Cards have never worked AT ALL for the majority of things.
One thing they have never worked for is Gambling or anything Gaming related where the majority of people that would want a Xapo Debit card is to be able to purchase whatever they want wether it be Videos Games , Gambling , Food , Bills , ETC
Everything I've ever tried to purchase with my Xapo Debit card has never worked.
I was never willing to risk going to the store and buying groceries and having my card denied which is why I cut it up.
Every purchase I've ever made with my Xapo Debit card has been reversed and I've tried it at nearly every major retailer available.
Maybe next time YOU should get your facts straight.
That's why I have an attitude kid...

Exactly this is the exact problem. I don't work for and am not promoted by AdvCash at all but they have direct contact with their card provider as they buy the cards immediately and have direct access to them. Because you can fund on the fly and you don't need to worry about exchanging Bitcoins on the fly it's the best possible solution for me. I deposit Bitcoins at the exchange right AT THE TIME of deposit and get the exact amount of fiat currency based on the exchange rate AT THE TIME of deposit not after deposit and fluctuation.

The price currently is under $68 USD per Bitcoin @ MTGoX , so let me guess.. You are going to halt trading until the price of bitcoins becomes at a price you are happy to cap at correct? You know because Free Trade doesn't exist on MTGoX right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:54:21
Bitcoins are a decentralized currency , yet MTGoX holds nearly complete centralization over the USD Value of it. Do you honestly think you have the right to halt trading whenever you please simply because your lack luster servers cannot handle any real traffic?
