yes and when u buy a pizza they should write how much profit they make... facepalm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:48:38
exactly. same as buying at 0.3 cents and selling at 20 USD.
  
its stupid to not take such % of profits
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:53:53
will it work unsynced ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:13:00
fees joke would still be valid just it would be. 10$? why do you need 25.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:18:31
well he coudl re-buy back some in 2014-2015
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:15:39
at least i wont feel ive lost opportunity.  
wit hevery opportunity there is risk.  
which risk is bigger - to have enough to get good life when its at 2kUSD or to loose some money when it hits 100$?
@_date: 2015-12-27 14:09:32
My advice was at gains 100-500 now u are in greed zone, no advice here :)  
Due to greed zone i didnt sell LTC at 50usd when i got them at 2-3.  BUT i had BTC pofits so this was more like risk than pure greed
  
Do nit tell me u wouldnt prefer to sell btc at ie 500 and after 2 years buy back at 400. Due to inflation this 400 now is like 350 before
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:22:13
this is.... hilarious!
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:59:29
its logical to sell at 50-100-500%. if you know abuout this price races and not sell - your greed is thinking over you ;)  
  
i wasnt aware BTC went from 10usd to 200usd. if i was, maybe i would sell at 100.  
@_date: 2015-12-26 19:47:31
Check 2 past posts on  i wrote about that
@_date: 2015-12-26 19:51:33
Im no where ealy miner but i had a bunch of btc at 4-10 usd. I sold most at 200-300. Like any thinking person would do ;)
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:32:19
i have to say BTC/LTC/DASH withdrawals are not working since almost 2 weeks (ony small amounts are) BUT you can get money off buying some coins and dumping to Bittrex (with loss of course)
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:16:20

Who is zhou tong?
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:38:30
I know it started at 0, but ive joined at 4-10$.  
And yes, you should have sold at 1.85 and buy back at 1 etc.

@_date: 2015-06-25 04:56:57

ive seen this websites since long time on google, they are known on the no prescription market ;)
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:45:34
nodes should get some fees just like miners do.  
if BTC is gonna be forked - that should be added.
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:48:02
Good for you man, but sill u should get what im saying :) most early adopters didn sell at 1k but at 100-500 range.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:17:39
doesnt seem so, but we have to wait ;x
@_date: 2015-12-15 14:14:39

totally joining that, my posts are coming.  
so i wasnt the first who thought of it just i put this as miner for everybody [gpus,scrypts etc] + instagram.  
so waiting for any instagram users to speak + help decide which of the 2 tags is better.
@_date: 2014-07-04 17:15:21
True that :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:05:09
hence i can take escrow bet that this is real.  
lets not pull words but money onto what we claim here.  
we woll take respective btctalk escrows like monbux bitpop dannyhamilton or so.  
want to make free 1BTC? :)  
as i have proof this is real.  
anybody saying this is fake i take for an ESCROW bet. i can take unlimited bets on this.

i have same situation with mine
@_date: 2014-11-16 15:04:51
**it was real to some kind - cryptsy was just NOT SHOWING balances for coins for around 5 minutes yet you had to have this coins in wallet to trade them**  
yet i did have this balances. video is 100% not edited. i was just right on time to make video before they literally minute later fixed this.  
so while this is not fake at all, this is not entirelly true.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:11:49

you treat it like gridseeds [first batch] - buy in bulk of 10-20 etc.  
also price is cheaper on bulk buying, this is just review of one machine.
@_date: 2014-11-23 02:16:42
the 3 minute GUI bug that they fixed literally after video ended recording doesnt mean theres anythign wrong with the exchange ;)  
cryptsy been stabile since long time i never had problems with tickets there.
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:20:46
tracking - ok
but forking chain to get coins - kills bitcoin way of working. u just cant WANT to do this. u do this - BTC is out of game.

@_date: 2014-11-13 15:50:03
what u say is right but also - we as BTC fam like ot be tipped and tip out - like DOGE does.  
do not forget how big DOGE went due to tips inside community.
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:20:15
thats normal - i added BTC and alts to many shops and they hardly get sales with them - but they get extra traffic for promotion

@_date: 2014-11-23 03:08:26
erm.. everybody knows im dev of EXCL and a blogger.    
and yes ive called it 'hack' - i thought it was funny since ive released it after this was patched already.  
my sense of humor is not always shared by others - lately on  in freenode our bot was speaking jokes that members didnt like - that we had to clear too ;)  
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:48:26
go with btc-e.com way more trusted place.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:39:50

@_date: 2014-10-21 00:44:04

@_date: 2014-08-05 06:39:15

@_date: 2015-01-04 03:23:58
yeah circle always felt for me like PP heh
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:04:23
yeah selling shares but can we estimate [even a little] how much of money will go into BTC to estiamte its possible pump?
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:02:56
really? you would spend 4USD on something worth nothing with alot of issues to make transaction work ?
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:03:36
hmm good find
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:54:20
you guys need to invest in promotion.  
ive never heard of you ie.
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:22:24
so this is to be hostedo n some CMS drupal wordpress or decentralised?  
just please explain ;)
@_date: 2014-07-13 10:50:10
thats whats sad about BTC as currency - you never know how much you actually pay
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:16:46
nope in game ones :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:36:37
im trying to get U then i have full saturobi!
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:31:55
yeah no good news for LTC
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:37:05

@_date: 2015-01-04 02:05:55
bad call -  
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:44:42
no more Table 'bitcoin.smf_boards' :(
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:06:31
most people dont buy back after spedning - or we wouldnt be where we are
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:46:31
i also got in BTC early [full stroy here -  ] yet i was different, i sold most at 260 range since i was buying at 4usd and waiting YEARS to make them be worth anything  
with LTC NMC PPC im loose now.  
@_date: 2014-09-27 17:45:53
nicely done whollyhemp !  
at least we know how u would act if this was real
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:57:31
wooho upped ya :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:21:46
if everyone here had at least 100 we would be at 10k already!
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:32:07
i got 6 from the game so far ;)
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:26:31
because if i bought BTC for 300 and its now 350 - i can buy goods of 350.  
yet i cannot buy back again to 300.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:47:34
just add EXCL bros :)
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:23:58
they might be dead. doubt anybody wouldnt sell at 200-1k price spikes.
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:05:29
which ports needs to be open or forwarded for the node to be open to public? i run windows qt ;)
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:39:53
show me love!
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:44:53
seek for bitcoin atms
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:03:30
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:19:39
u are right on time to buy
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:57:45
yep confirming i didnt get my money they claim this is the transaction of BTC - 
@_date: 2015-01-29 08:12:32
might been competitor!
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:22:45
that was fast :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:05:55
and still are used ?
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:57:07
where is that i cant see it?
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:37:32
cloud mining always ends bad
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:50:31
it might been a glitch but just letting people know since we are in unusal Times now so all 'temporary not working' withdrawals should be noticed right on time
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:39:21
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:46:44
as soon as i can test i will check, maybe its back - i surel hope so!
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:23:22
**ok actually they replied to my tweet and confirmed the issue -  ** 
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:09:15
wow this is crazy
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:43:05
oh i see :(  
just dont use GD, i used to be in domains business and heard loads of bad stories about this guys
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:20:31
best year of BTC supossed to be LOLZ.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:39:29
then i assume you bought it already.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:01:42
thats the kind of move that makes BTCs price to raise - not just pure merchant adoption
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:02:53
i have to say XPY is XPY but i didnt expect them to turn off "always profitable" hashing..
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:23:28
Come to Warsaw Poland -   
  
The BTCs there are cheaper than on polish online exchanges.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:58:00
its as simple as create account, move money and bet.
did u read the article? :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:16:26
with a bot this could be actually free money
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:32:45
hilarious :D
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:38:40
they send emails from various exchanges YET now they started adding btcjam there and files have extensions .jar which can attack both windows and mac
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:44:52
ok so when do we go for it?
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:21:46
sad what happened but just 1 thing.. godaddy is famous for beeing ***holes, locking peoples donmain and such.  
godaddy is cheap to get nonimportnt domains wit htheir discounts and transfer out later.
why didnt u go for namecheap who also accept BTC for payments.  
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:59:47
nope only if you double click the file
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:10:11
on jan they sold!
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:41:51
got it too, but only reported
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:25:48
yes just since normally it was same virus using mailing companies seems now they moved forward to your possible customers - so just giving a heads up to everybody!
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:19:38
loving this game i play it daily
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:34:49
thanx a lot!
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:45:06
Poland 
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:17:55
well this is not entirelly true, my guys from Atomic Trade had licenses too, later on they moved to Canada tho.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:23:37
that made me lulz too!
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:27:51
too late :(
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:22:03
Yes i got this spammer to me too
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:48:35

@_date: 2014-07-04 18:04:48

@_date: 2015-01-14 23:55:23
its working now i got NMC DVC LTC but..  
*BTC is still not here.*
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:23:21
open or forward?
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:49:13
how come PL is missed? PL has decent infrastructure and few BTMs.
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:45:40
This currency works a bit different.  
Exchange buys back coins and BURNS them from its profits.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:56:51
5% from bitcoin average YET exchanges are above worldwide average so thats how we got here.  
whats usual % in other countries ?
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:47:17
How did u do tails with persistence on windows btw?
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:18:21
seems we cant have good things on the internets!
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:51:47
Th have ddos thats it, i logged in and did some trades
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:29:03
This just killed GEO heh
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:50:15
 is thinking of getting one of this machines i know
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:30:23
supported it -   
4k+ followers heard ;)
@_date: 2016-01-08 00:49:31
now it started working like 2h ago
@_date: 2016-01-11 02:23:24


I mean, i knew its gonna collapse. I did this:  
buy DASH -&gt; sell on Cryotsy 20+ satoshi up -&gt; buy DOGED/EXCL (1-2 satoshi up) -&gt; Sell on Bittrex. 18 satoshi profit per coin - fees.  
  
Was a fun ride. I had like 2 BTC on Cryptsy + i got ouf of it with this "trick" with like 5 :)  
  
Been posting it to my newsletter tho so im sure many guys followed me.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:10:27
And what do you have agains homophobes?  
Get tollerant dude.
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:09:43
Would be impossible without third party imo
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:25:57
1. Open wallet on blockchain.info. 
2. Import your wallet. 
3. Install ie Elctrum
4. Send btc there. 
5. Enjoy
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:43:42
Thats most likely since what they can make of fees and products must be tiny.. There is 35 in staff ie, thats a few salaries
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:32:05
here is my older report -  none of this sites have 0 edge BUT some give away faucet money to play with.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:18:53
This is interesting.  
 I would like some more tutorials tho
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:23:07
and how did it go? should been instant
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:36:20
just travel to EU or USA and sell them without an issue
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:50:46
Poland will soon catch you :)
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:51:19
Sure man, try it and let me know
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:58:10
LTC will pump to 100USD soon, i love it and its best for moving BTC now
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:17:07
Is the wallet encrypted? (In spare time write o blockchain support)
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:11:06
pretty obvious. if u have bitcoin u know how to sell it probably..
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:53:17
Best read ever
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:32:12
since its 2012 as people said - download core, run it.
when it syncs - close it
replace wallet.dat with ur 2012 one
u will see amount almost right away, just u need to sync to spend it. 2013+ are the longest years to download 2012 will be like 1-2 hours
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:12:34
haha thats it.
world is falling.. ;(
@_date: 2016-01-22 04:05:56
i was kidding a bit on all 10k per BTC people ;)
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:34:38

@_date: 2016-01-11 00:09:44

@_date: 2016-01-18 14:28:42

ive invested and got you a bonus for investments - thats all.
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:13:07
Whioe i dont care of 6cent fees there is thing u are missing here.  
If btc reaches 10k usd this 6 cents will be 600 dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:19:06
i will LOL if Karpeles [or somebody from his team] is Satoshi and he was just playing a doofus
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:52:24
Thanx cryptsy for all thr mooniez u made me, thanx for me withdrawin on time
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:11:22
Possibly in future this app could drop all kinds of coins - or have variations for different coins
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:23:44
Love your work man
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:56:37

@_date: 2017-03-06 17:01:47
Declare them then and pay tax
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:23:44
they fixed it now
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:23:19
nothing suprising
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:35:14
1 ounce of gold = 1 satoshi
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:45:10

@_date: 2019-11-04 05:19:56
get BTC anywhere, use anonymous bitcoin exchanges to buy another crypto 
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:21:35
Check post from 
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:46:35
of course there are many movies about that
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:35:13
i remember there was some guys making one in chile years ago, not sure how it went
@_date: 2016-06-08 02:23:50
oh so they show futures amounts? i thought futures trade at 800usd
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:50:25
and hw ma y btcs are not moved since like 2 years? Id say from this number we can estimate a little.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:29:03
great find, really interesting
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:37:05
yeo there was almost no arbitrage possible (other than coinbase) everywhere it went same moment
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:59:29
ill surely move to LTC more
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:31:03

@_date: 2018-10-11 01:48:51
im strong!
@_date: 2019-11-27 03:00:01
u need ot digg a bit, but PL pretty much did most job to help defeat germany. engima, taking hit from germany/russia when being alone, flying in battle of britain...
  
and got only pwned for all this
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:42:57
Propably u need o also offer him some money, doesnt seem like hes doing this for e-fame
@_date: 2016-06-03 02:08:28
looks like scammy website to me
@_date: 2016-06-19 04:04:11
Pm vitalik he gives u 100% guarantee to double money or forks it back. Cant loose with him
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:52:06
yep i have the same problem
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:54:49
uve missed some easy winners LTC EXCL XVG in the loop
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:44:41
yeah i have there only looses
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:52:21
i woudknt use it but i like the idea for users who have hodling problems ;)
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:02:58
im sure you can avoid some of those 
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:50:44
if such huge exchange got hacked its gonna be big
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:50:15
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:59:22
keepkey is also out of stock, only  has 1 left lol
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:38:12
i thought this company was out of the market already
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:11:16
only ATM is anonymous 
also sometiems you can go to countries near you to use ATMs to get even more anonimity.
localbitcoins is meeting a person in some place, leaving phone trace and more.. its hardly anonymous
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:41:49
shouldnt the story be totally opposite?
bitpay freezes amount for X time.
so when price was 750 when bitpay generated QR, the guy lost 250USD per bitcoin not got in his pocket.
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:40:29
LTC will make it first
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:48:04
i would go for solo too
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:35:32
i dont claim this is a true story but:  
  
if you have acc with 500 BTC and write that publicly it makes sense to be redditor for 1 day and use throwaway
  
he never said its all his money, maybe he has 2000 BTC more ?  
  
3 of course seeking legal advice here is odd.. but maybe he writes to save others
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:04:03
great app, just installed it
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:51:03
yeah hodl is a decent name for such business :)
@_date: 2019-08-18 01:16:59

@_date: 2016-12-27 19:29:39
why do you want BTC in Airbnb?
Airbnb needs your data and full verification. If you want to be fully verified to buy somehtign you dont need BTC.

and u knew of it even in 2014.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:14:09
graphene is technology that Bitshares use and indeed its way faster than current BTC technology is that a fork of it or what ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:59:14

@_date: 2015-07-22 15:51:32
its not for public use, its just something i need for tests
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:36:04
yeah the only method would be:
buy BTC now
open shorts
SELL on actual exchanges
they can ie send Feds to BFX also, no need to buy then ;)
@_date: 2015-07-02 05:11:19

Roger is not a member.  
He stated even publicly he thinks this site is scam.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:11:53

anyways enjoy!
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:21:45

@_date: 2017-04-25 01:43:05
possibly BTC will be gold but LTC will be for usual daily buy/sell of stuff. I suggest to get more LTC now
@_date: 2016-02-18 21:36:58
ok i will just redownload whole chain then move wallet.dat - maybe somethign got corrupted.  
will write again if this doesnt fix the issue.  
I would go other route BUT my .dat file is like 25mb and blockchain.info wont let me upload such big file ;)
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:50:43
How much can u buy for it and how secure is it there?  
Also did thr guy just give u this cash or rather sent u wire to bank account u made there?
@_date: 2016-02-05 03:09:57
wallets should be open source but.. if they are - how will they make money.
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:43:51
which wallet lets u send with 0 fees now ?
@_date: 2016-02-17 02:22:05
ok i have installed latest QT version and im getting this error from time to time.  
sometimes when syncing, sometimes after like 2 hours running it.
@_date: 2016-02-04 09:33:58
The one hour rule makes sense
@_date: 2016-02-04 09:26:19
But on [cloudbet here]( you can put up to 50btc per bet. Nobody else has such liquidity
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:41:06
do not forget of  too
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:49:27
wheres that screen from ?
@_date: 2017-04-27 01:52:16
that wouldnt make any sense.
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:42:19
but you know this processors that have BTC can add LTC really easy? there was just no need before. now with block problems and LTC fixing them, it can be done
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:45:13
everybody browses this magazine due to lack of TV on this planes :)
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:52:06
or Poland that is close too: 
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:55:38
 +  and u can be legally
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:43:16
how can one do this on purpose - just be putting small fee or none??  
this is a really bad law in new version then.
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:43:16
Okay im giving you best answer:
  
This site is a killer.  
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:53:38
get some hasing power from  or even use your GPU cards, just dont use pools of Jihan nor litecoinpool.org (it doesnt signal segwit every block)

@_date: 2019-04-28 23:16:34

@_date: 2016-02-29 01:38:41
Any idea which wallets are nit doing it? I thought all were.
@_date: 2016-02-18 01:21:28
Windows 7 64  
On the other releases everything was smooth (im running CORE since 2011!)  
There is small thing im doing since years tho (before there was option to install in different disk) im using this as windows shortcut:  
  
D:\bitcoin\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=D:\\bitcoin\Bitcoin   
But it worked smooth before. And no my disk is not in bad shape, im running loads of things on it. I have SSD for system and extra disk for installations. If the disk was in bad shape i woulnt be even capable of writign to you now ;)  
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:24:59
that ^^
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:20:53
Check  u can bet there on sports and has casino too - up to 50btc per 1 bet (!)
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:44:53
yeah indeed, i was using predictions for 2016 (they got up by 21%) but yes they are not in top10 for 2015.

@_date: 2018-07-20 23:44:50
thanks i will have a read.  
  
i did research a bit but seems its so new nobody exactly understands it.  
  
what i mean is, i want to run the node. i understand the routing between nodes. i just dont understand how i can be in the middle of routing of others or what should i do to make my node popular. currently most BTC goes by literally 1 node.
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:42:38
i want ot hear of 1 spot in PL that has ATM of Chp Chap.  
The only ATM network in Poland is

@_date: 2015-04-22 04:11:59

@_date: 2019-09-03 02:31:17

@_date: 2015-09-07 16:06:49
Thing is this are not refugess in 80% they are coming for free social money. There is numerous videos where they are putting food and water to trash and destroy things.  
There is hardly any women there, mostly men in 'soldier age'.  
ISIS is flooding EU with their people using refugee hype.
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:31:03
thats why i biy only BTC and.. EXCL and LTC
@_date: 2015-09-06 11:46:12
Does that mean sites will b having 1 dns and different ips all the time?
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:54:25
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:58:19
good call - im not owner of the site, but it does work.    
i myself took out CLAMs the normal method - by installing wallet but it was too techy for people to do this swaps, so when i found htis service [and verified the owner is old bitcointalk member] ive made this post
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:51:52
I thiught MAYBE the nides i have are more flooded than some others.  
Ie when i tak. Cash from some exchsnges it travels easily
@_date: 2015-09-21 00:09:51

@_date: 2015-09-06 11:47:38
Howmdoes this site have dns issue fixed? Dns usualy needs to be centralised, even if it thn changes to other ip
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:27:34

indeed, so dont mix refugees with economical imigrants who just want to do nothing and get social :)
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:59:51
 - this are economical young men who do not wan to work  
 - goodbye hungary, hello germany  
  
 - invaders attack on EU  
 - food destroying by imigrants  
to be clear - there is war in syria, but 80% people you see in tv/medias are young men ready to fight who dont come from other ISIS/Islam regions, just ready to flood EU.

Since most ppl in the world do not speak english as 1st langusge theres bigger chsnces nonnatives have decent infos than just small nglish 1languagers ;)  
Ie put up china, russia and japan as examples here.  
I do loads of typos due to ipad autocorrect but i often give infos from really good sources - ie i had btcs when thy were worth less than 10 usd
