Algorithmic money probably doesn't need to be mined. But we're probably not near that era yet.
Without being mined, you and 999 other members could create a ledger with 1000 units. You each are assigned one account, and 1 unit goes to each member in the initial distribution. You agree the unit is an interchangeable form of value among each other. The 1000 unit is created out of thin air. You could also modify in decay and growth rates, if you wish.
Fiat currency operates in a similar creation, except it's very centralized through the government and federal reserve. They add extra zeros or more numbers to their account, and now they have more money, and also more fractional reserve.  
One of bitcoin's characteristics is serving as a public ledger. The mining is an artificial limit and construct, that also provides infrastructure and a network for the public ledger. And the public ledger is really a bunch of identical ledgers distributed on the network, where each participant have their own copy, actively synchronizing.
Off-topic, imo, one of the most revolutionary aspect of bitcoin is the solving of the Byzantine Generals' Problem. We are still at the cusp of bitcoin application; Rumsfeld's unknown unknowns. We are still in the infancy of imagination.
A second off-topic. Hybrid of centralized/decentralized money. 1 unit is generated for one member per day, the central power gets as taxed, a small percentage, such as .01% of the 1 unit, for maintaining infrastructure and providing social services, etc. That's the only tax ever. A company generates 100, pays 60 to the associates. Company keeps 40, associates keep 60. No taxes, since that was already taken from the 1 unit generation per member per day. Note: these are example numbers only. Algorithms can decide rate, amount, and decide decay and growth rates.
