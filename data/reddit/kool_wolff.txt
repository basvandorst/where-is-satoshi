The hardest you are protecting Bitcoin and raging about how it's not a failure, whatever argument you may use (i've seen all of them) the more money you have invested in it and don't want to see it fail, and the more you argue about it, the more we see you are only protecting your interests. Bitcoin is done, like many other great ideas that started good and failed through history, deal with the facts.

Yeah, but not with Bitcoin, it was like the Beta test, in a few years a new cryptocurrency will arise all patched up and then it will be viable

Because it has a lot of issues, first and most importantly, a great amount of them is in hands of a few, second, the is a limit of the number of Bitcoins that can be mined, and lastly, this is the first crytocurrency that went full media, more like a test to me, generally the first try fails but it sets roots for the next one to be successful, and since Bitcoin can't be patched i think it's doomed to fail in the near future. But only time will decide.
