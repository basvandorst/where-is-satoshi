Sorry, I don't believe you..
The netherlands are home to the finest MDMA pressers in the world, like the bitcoins. 150mg - 220mg a pill is the trend. 
Shit pills don't sell well here, and if you know what you're doing you won't buy crap.
Check pill reports, and stick to the popular brands by a trusted presser. (Example: Nintendos, Superman, Bitcoin, Q-Music, Android)
Also, heroin?? That makes zero sense, it's more expensive plus it won't work. Piperazines or BK-MDMA would be way more likely
I've never bought a bad pill here in my life

It's going down all the way kid, but it might come back again, just like last time. How long will it take? A year, two years, a decade? Or never?

Although I have to say moving into early adopter phase might be a tad optimistic, as the bitcoinmarket cap of $250 million is still only 0.16% of US GDP..

Try the electrum wallet which doesn't need the blockchain, or try an online wallet.
Or you can manually download and add the chain, little bit more difficult:

That's right, this meyhod is already a very acceptable first prototype, it's fast and easy. I guess the weakest link for non-tech people is the use of a smartphone + app. But maybe it will become more and more normal

This whole thing is a mess..
Luckily I have my main stash in an offline wallet. I just sold the few coins I had in mt. gox and am wiring the money out as we speak.

I would strongly advice you to hire a good pr-figure. This whole thing just screams unprofessionalism.. There's a lot of money involved, and emotions run high when shit hits the fan.
Customers dont want to be left in the dark for an hour when they have a couple of thousand stored on your website. They want immediate updates, every 15 mins, right on your home page.
No crappy post on facebook, not reassuring at all when you tell the world of your glaring security problems.
I like your service, and was always quite happy with speed and market depth, but your way of dealing with this situation made me doubt your competence.
Good luck!

Great article! I'd say I disagree with his reasoning that bitcoin will lose its value because of competing new crypto currencies, on basis that some miners would attack threatening newcomers. Other smaller miners will jump on board of new currencies, but they will work in tandem. Both LT
C and BTC can and have value..
Interesting observation on bubble behaviour, we'll see how it pans out!

Seconding this comment.
What a beautiful post, this is what should be about. You have a talent for expressing your vision, and it makes my day to think that there are people like you out there.
I believe the coming decades will be very turbulent and defining for our species future. What will hapen when the pyramid of global plutocracy begins to crumble? Constructed out of a vicious feedback of cheap wage slaves fueling excessive consumption, the ever inflating buy more, waste more economy is the only bubble we should worry about. 
I share your belief as well, cryptocurrencies might be our only shot at radically redistributing wealth, and to change into a conservative economy of resources. 
Anyways, cheers to you for seeing the possibilities so early and your succes!

I think there's a good chance the project will fail to be a global currency. A would be a victory for the ruling elite.
But, if the opposite holds, bitcoin will rise like a phoenix out of the currency war ashes. With it will come a new elite; early adopters of bitcoin. 


Fiat is a measure of value. $40 gets you roughly the same amount of goods as 1 BTC. These people hope to see a huge increase in value, not too cash out in fiat, but to be able to buy eg $1000 of todays dollars worth of goods for 1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-20 11:05:23
I feel the same way..
 I saw a very interesting graph some weeks ago, showing a three wave bubble/correction pattern. Each time the bubble would grow about three times as high. This wave, the 2nd, was expected to pop at 90. Does anyone have this graph?
@_date: 2013-10-06 07:21:10

Ok, I must have been lucky then..
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:24:28
Im buying bitcoin because I want to obtain bitcoin. I recognize they have value because of their scarce nature, a mathematical secured scarcity. 
So I will hold on to my coins even if the market crashes.. because they will bounce back, just like last time.
But yea it still nice to see those 300% profits ;)

Did you just casually tip 1 BTC !??
@_date: 2013-02-13 09:56:40
If I were you I'd convert at least 50% of that money back to $ again right now, with the current bubble-ish rising of the price you can still pocket some nice change.
Sorry, but this whole post just screams financial incompetence. Do you not know rule nr. 1? Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
You're investing a $30,000 loan. If bitcoin fails you will be fucked, and even more so your family will be fucked.
These kind of things are truly life ruining situations. Anyways, you're already blinded by the overly optimistic outcome of this scenario


So I guess you'll just ignore this advice.
Godspeed buddy
EDIT: Btw, I also think bitcoin will take off, especially in the long run. But there may be very large price fluctuations coming, the market could have dramatic price drops in the coming years only to bounce back. Who knows? Question is, will you be able to handle the stress these drops bring with them, and will you panic sell at a huge loss?

You could still use physical bitcoins. You'd have no way to check your balance without internet so yea it is a little icky
