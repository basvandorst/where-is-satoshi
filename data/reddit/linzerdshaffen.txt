Petro convertible means all coins.

You are free to have your opinion, and I respect it. I live in Venezuela, I have seen our economy crumbling day by day. The product shortages and increasing inflation. And lived the oppression too. But still, it is a breakthrough for crypto. Not for the Venezuelan Government or Nicolas Maduro. Bitcoin was designed to avoid centralization.  "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution". For good or bad, that's the function it is fulfilling.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:34:16
The article has a source. Read it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:59:15
HEY HEY HEEEEEEY
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:09:32
Yep. Iran has also stated that they will create their own cryptocurrency. And Turkey has proposed the creation of its own crypto coin: the "turkcoin".
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:43:56
Some sources differ from what you say:
 
 and multiple others.

It won't affect bitcoin. If you ask the shills, they will tell you that bitcoin is down because of this. But it's not.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:54:12
We will see if his claims are true...
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:08:00
[It's a trap!](
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:38:21
This will be a big thing for crypto and it should help to stabilize the market!
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:44:26
He said that all coins would be accepted. Please read the article.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:47:00
lol skynet is upon us... kinda
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:55:40
The Petro is not featured in this article. They say they'll accept any cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:31:38
According to Sakamoto's Vision, no. According to investors, yes.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:10:36
I respect your stance. I only wish for you to see the facts in perspective to understand mine.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:49:01
Nadie habla del petro, amigo. Por favor lee el articulo y trata de entender las cosas en perspectiva. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:57:36
The Petro is the least important thing about this news. Imagine going to buy gas and pay with Bitcoin or going to a hotel and pay for lodging with Bitcoin. Adoption is the big part of this!
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:43:12
"The impact seems to be limited to internally-used engineering test cars only, and our initial investigation found no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised in any way."
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:22:42
I don't think so. Think of it as a forced trade to FIAT!
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:53:32
I agree! I am Venezuelan, I know that better than anyone! But still, this is the greatest thing that a nation has done for adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:51:17
oh, ask and you shall receive: 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:05:20
Yes, but the brive for an asic miner should be high... 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:51:27
If you achieve the hard task of passing an ASIC miner through customs in Venezuela, you deserve to be called a GOD.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:59:34
That's right.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:36:50
Yes, maybe with this new development they will expand to have FIAT pairs
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:09:44
No es lo ideal, pero sea como sea es un paso adelante para la adopcion de las criptomonedas. Y es la primera vez que un estado toma esta postura. Con que intenciones? Repito que es incierto. Lo mas seguro es que sea con no muy nobles intenciones. Pero te repito que un hecho es un hecho. Igual no critico tu postura, es una postura valida. Pero trata de ver los hechos en perspectiva y entenderás la mia tambien.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:14:46
It is a different world now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:49:45
Again, you talk and talk about the petro. All coins will be accepted.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:49:10
Maybe it will...
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:42:49
You're free to browse through my account posts. I gain nothing from lying.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:58:19
Yup. That's a bit contradicting, but it's like that. They want the cake, even if it gives them diarrhea later!
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:10:08
some less tech-savvy folks can fall for it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:43:18
Petro convertible means all coins.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:44:36
Thanks for worrying!
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:39:05
Yup but they only mention that it will be a popular option in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:51:27
lol. It states ALL coins! Read the article!
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:59:56
Hermano estás equivocado. Lee bien el articulo y verás que solo relata declaraciones. Es un hecho lo que se declaró. De alli a que se cumpla es otra cosa. Con que interes se hace? Eso es incierto. Pero lo único que he querido resaltar es la adopcion de las criptomonedas para pagos por un estado. Más nada. No estoy diciendo que sea bueno o malo. No estoy tomando parte en la noticia. Lo unico que estoy comentando son hechos. A mi tambien me ha tocado dar coñazos para comprar una harina o una azucar. El venezolano que te diga que no lo ha hecho es enchufado o es un privado con mucha plata. Pero hechos son hechos y las declaraciones comentadas en el articulo son reales.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:32:39
Nope. Why should anyone? There is an economic disaster here. But facts are facts, and if what has been declared is true, it will be a major breakthrough for crypto in general. We'll see shortly.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:47:58
You are still missing the point...
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:44:47
Agreed. But it is today.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:29:43
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:08:44
That would be a good idea.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:36:10
That's wrong. Some governments, like China have ban stances. This marks a departure from that position. That's why it is relevant.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:53:57
Yup, the Petro; but they stated that they will accept ALL cryptos
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:29:11
It states ANY crypto coin. That includes Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:32:30
He said ALL crypto! That includes Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:17:30
According to Maduro's declarations, it was. That's the only indicator that we have now
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:34:48
It's all over the internet. Just google it. You'll find plenty.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:52:10
We'll see shortly!
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:34:53
Maybe it is an experiment for implementing it on a larger scale.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:25:35
I don't know how you only consider dubious URL's only if they include coin...
From the Presidential Press Twitter account.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:55:24
which coin? It says that all coins will be accepted
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:52:27
Well if you don't consider him important that's a valid POV. But I think that he is. It up to everyone to do his judging.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:13:30
it's is scary for me in the sense that another hard fork could be ahead!
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:47:20
Indeed... Nakamoto's vision taken one step further!
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:20:44
Nope. But still, this is a different kind of proposition by an important member of the community. I understand your stance but try to understand mine.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:00:47
I live in Venezuela, I know what's happening here... But facts are facts, and this is huge and historic for the cryptocurrency world.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:02:27
Yeah potnet 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:06:57
WASSU WASSU WASSU WASUUU WASUUUUUUUP
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:50:25
Crypto was made to transform the world! If this helps to stir things even a little in favor of adoption, then it's good news!
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:30:56
Yeah, but we are comparing launch prices. Still, it is a valid point! Thanks for taking the time to read the article.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:18:14
It is not so easy to find dollars nowadays 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:29:21
There have been reports of people receiving it, and even Cobra, that also called bullshit on it retracted via twitter
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:10:10
Operational savings. They cite that they can save up to 20%
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:08:10
Would not know about the details of the implementation.
