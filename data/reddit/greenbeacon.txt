This guy,
Is trolling as a puppy adopting fanatic a new 4chan meme?
I’m starting to believe you can’t be serious

Isn't limits on payouts completely normal?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:16:23
Hahaha look at this guy everybody!
In your mind:
1. everyone is an American.
2. Every dog not adopted is from a “puppy mill” that starved and kills the ones they don’t sell.
3. If someone is not retarded like you, they are a Donald trump supporter.
Do you think every country is as fucked up as yours?
Puppy mills like you describe don’t exist in a bit more civilized countries ��

FYI, I’m no Trump supporter.
My choice would be Bernie (funny how I have to explain this to every American on reddit who acts like you)
I’m just happy Hillary lost, she would’ve been far worse for the rest of the world.
And fuck you dude, like others have pointed out, you’re a hypocritical piece of shit.
The way you act could make anyone puke, Hillary supporter, trump supporter, Bernie supporter, your mom...

You yelled at them for that?
Do you yell at them for eating meat and driving a gasoline car too?

I'm a noob at patents.
In the top right it says March 29, 2018.
But in the section along with "inventors", "Applicant", "Family ID" and "Appl. No." It says "Filed: September 23, 2016"
What do the two different dates mean?
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:02:31
So a more correct title to this reddit post would be “intel applied for patent on bitcoin minking chip in 2016”?
