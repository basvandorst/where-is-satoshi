Get the txid to prove it was yours and pay taxes on the gains. Might take time for them to research it but if you can provide proof and they still don't release your funds, contact the news and an attorney to let them know you're not fucking around.

If you buy something with fiat, you replace such fiat by working to earn more. So you take it a step further by saying you're trading your work for a product.

Christ, no it wasn't. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:11:15
XRP (or another similar crypto, such as Tezos once it hits exchanges) will replace the current money remittance system, not BTC. I think I saw somewhere that BTC can do 7 transactions per second, where XRP can perform 70,000. An hour or more to confirm BTC transactions vs 4 seconds tops for XRP. Not to mention XRP charges just .2%, so no need for +-5% markup/down
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:39:35

Absolutely never EVER curse and be rude to your customer service rep. 
Being a dick like that will never get you to where you need to be in the amount of time you expect. 
That interaction placed you at the bottom of the list for the people who didn't fuck shit up and are trying to HELP you.
Go to a branch and request a copy of your transactions (not most recent statement) in and out of your account. Show where the mix-up happened, explain dates and times of when you spoke to service reps and when they agreed to fix the mix-up, when it was fixed and when it was un-fixed. The branch manager has access to a clearing account to immediately remedy the issue while the back office fixes the mix-up with the clearing account making you whole a lot faster than the route the back office can take when you're being an absolute dick. 
20k is chump change in regards to their clearing account. You could have been made whole while they sort the issue out with a different account not related to yours. 
Sorry man, let this be a lesson but at this point you have fault. Don't be a dick to a CS rep.
