No, it never went through. They blamed the delay on their banking partners. After threatening them with legal action they credited my CEX account with the amount. So I just bought bitcoins with it and sent it off-site for liquidation. I don't think they ever instructed a bank to process my transactions, or perhaps they did try to process the transaction through the banking system but the banks refused to process the transaction. I have no evidence of this, of course. It is merely my opinion. I might add that I found their support system to be atrocious. It felt as though they were delaying talking about the matter purposefully. I also tried to verify their PCI compliance certificate but I was unable to do so using the version they provide on their website.

Did they also refer you to Crypto Capital?

What do we know about Crypto Capital though? Everything is very well hidden behind a Panamanian Company. It could be a way by CEX.io to get your money into Panama and then make it disappear behind a secretive company that nobody knows anything about.

PS: I have been informed that a legal firm in the UK, called Selachii, are able to assist with bitcoin-related legal matters in the UK.

I would like to do that but I don't have a card (yet) for the account that I'm withdrawing to. Other people are saying that they are eventually getting their withdrawals, it's just with an added delay, so I'm a bit less worried now, but still, this is quite a stressful experience.
