If I understood this all correct, I think the premise was that the two largest pools collaborated to "take over" bitcoin. And my argument was that if they did this, people could just leave the pools - thus no longer making them the biggest. And I agree with you, it is in the pool's best interest (long-term) to stay benign and take the transaction fees. It's the same with online casinos, they *could* make a short-term gain by scamming, but they're better off on the long-term to be honest and just take the vig.

Yes, that's totally fine. You can be happy that it's (finally) gone. I am too, even though I got left holding a big bag of goxcoin. But lots of people say things like "anyone who lost money in gox *deserved* it". Statements like that are pretty stupid. Everyone's always a genius after the fact.

It's because I didn't make a mistake. And I've explained why. The only thing that needed appending was acknowledging that you get to say that you were right. My original argument remains: You cannot generalize your opinion to a consensus. You used hindsight bias in order to raise the status of your prediction.

This is post-hoc analysis. There was a risk involved, any most of us knew that. But then there is *always* a risk involved when you're investing. People said that bitcoins were a scam and that "the writing was on the wall", but overall the coins are doing OK. There's always going to be a group of people that get to say "I told you so" after anything happens.

Yes, I can definitely agree there - it is easy for a lot of these exchanges to pack it up and take off with our money.
I do hope that this all causes us to pause before leaving money in exchanges. I hope we also get to see more verification from exchanges that our money is safe.

[Hindsight bias](


Only true for USD. SEPA and JPY were working just fine (more or less).
The point I was making was that I didn't come on reddit when I made thousands on bitcoins or dogecoins to show off how smart I was. Or how I was using arbitrage on gox/coinbase/btce to make guaranteed money...all the while telling people how stupid they were for not doing the same.
Yeah, gox was a risk - but it's not fair to blame the victim.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:46:41


It bothers me when people say this since you benefit from hindsight.Do you hold any bitcoins? People have been saying that bitcoins were a scam from the beginning...I see it much the same
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:07:27
I get your point. But the criminal is first to blame, and the victim accountable for their risk. I never disagreed with that, but the OP was stating that it was all the investors fault for everything and Gox a distant second.

Seriously: fuck you, you sanctimonious prick.
 Yeah I knew the risk and am willing to accept that my money. But there is no need to go one step further and say that "I'm to blame". GOX IS TO BLAME. Period. I didn't do anything wrong, GOX fucked up and stole the money (at least that is likely the case).
What you're doing is basically telling a woman who got raped that she shouldn't have dressed that way.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:06:28


And I admitted to it. I never said that there was no risk. The OP stated that people like me are to blame FIRST. That it's basically all my fault I lost my money, and Gox is a distant 2nd? That's absurd. Gox was a functioning exchange for years dealing in both fiat and BTC with withdraws working fine for both.

Someone isn't a moron just because they disagree with you. Especially if you're trying to claim that everyone should have come to the same conclusions as you have. That's not a realistic position to maintain.


Translation: You like to come to and be a negative Nancy.
You made arguments that Neo didn't have a good business model. You were right, but you didn't have unarguable proof of anything. Other people came to different conclusions. You get to say that you were right, but you don't get to say that everyone should have come to the same conclusion. There is no way to come to such a consensus without being about the predict the future.
For a good example, lets look at all the people who said that bitcoins were a scam and that they would never amount to anything. All of those people were wrong (at least are wrong right now) despite having some evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:12:54
that's my concern too. If we get a fraction of our bitcoins back in the form of USD from coins sold at a fraction of it's value....then we're going to get next to nothing. My 38 BTC * 27% of BTC * 16% USD value = :(
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:35:13
But pools themselves don't form up of like-minded people. The pool could disperse and form their own pools or join others.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:56:38
Gox had problems for a long time but were paying out SEPA/JPY/BTC. They weren't paying out USD withdraws because of problems with fincen. So they weren't perfect, but that's not necessarily a recipe for disaster. In the end, they died because they had bad security and auditing - but it was completely obvious that it was going to be the case. You make it sound like it was 100% clear that things would end this way and you can only say that after the fact. There have been MANY times where people have declared something a scam when it turned out to be just fine. Coinbase is a good example of that.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:42:55
35 BTC.
 All the time and effort in trading over the past year is down the drain. 15 of those coins were from being an early-adopter of dogecoin, and were basically free. It really hurts to first lost 10 bitcoins when Schermbeck (WDC) turned out to be a scam, and then GOX scam.

1. You chose to transact with bitcoin in the *most* expensive way possible. Bitcoin transactions are free if the block size is small, which I am going to assume would fit your situation. Any why you're moving coins around over 100 times, I don't know.    
1. You chose to transact with fiat in *leas* expensive way possible. Also, as others pointed out, merchants pay a fee for you to use your credit card and some (all?) of that is passed on to the consumer. But to the main point, sending money to 3rd parties is *not* free with fiat. Neither is sending money to someone in a difference currency. Neither is a bank draft. Neither is certified check . Neither are ATM fees (with some accounts).
Bitcoin's strength is being able to send a non-reversible transfer of funds to someone else anywhere in the world. If you want a currency to move around into accounts you own, 100s (1000s?) of times then bitcoin isn't for you.
Finally, there is one other scenario that might be to blame here. Perhaps the fees you're paying are on exchanges? This is a more valid complaint. Exchange fees for withdraws are very high compared to the true transaction cost. But this is an issue with *exchanges* not with bitcoin.

Easy to say after the fact. [Hindsight bias]( When bitcoin came out a *LOT* of people said it was a "stupid risk".

Yeah, I should have clarified my statement. Mtgox (and bitcoins) are no where near stable enough for reserve banking (IMO). **IF** they are doing that, they really shouldn't be.

@_date: 2014-04-16 22:28:30

@_date: 2014-02-28 14:57:47
That's the issue. It was an exchange. It didn't say in bolt letter across "Buy coins here at a higher risk than other exchanges". In fact, because Gox was the market-leader it implied *less* risk.
Do you own bitcoins? If you do, I can easily put you into this "greed" category.
There is no need to blame the victims here with Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:48:08
That's all well and good until your wallet gets hacked. I thought I was being safe by storing my coins in the largest exchange and enabling 2fa. We haven't seen the full fallout yet, but I still find it hard to believe that all the money is just "gone" unless this was an elaborate scam.

Lost 35 BTC.
I'm not buying back in right now. I think the price is going to go down before it goes back up, but I do believe in crypto in the long-term. If someone really did steal 740k BTC then they're going to try to sell that - which is going to drive the price down (but I think that general FUD is going to keep the coin down)
We obviously need to figure out a better and safer way to hold our coins.

In any of those situations, *someone else was the cause of the missing money*. 
Or maybe I should wait until the next time you take out your wallet. I'll take any bills I see and say "hey, you shouldn't have risked flashing that money around!". Hey it's your fault for not keeping all your money in the bank! Or maybe i'll spy on your PIN number and then blame you for not covering it up enough. Either way, the cops are going to send you to jail because it's your fault right?

On one hand, I'm happy this is going through but on the other hand the fact that anyone who used gox gets in on the money kind of sucks. Means less money for us bag-holders....(if there is any money at all).

you have to go through the entire checkout and then at payment select bitcoin. It's the very first option. Don't worry, you're not committed to buy if you go through (that is, you can go to the end just to see how it works if you like)
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:44:26
Wouldn't that only be the case if they had no btc left? That seems a bit crazy, but then maybe they sold it all to try to cover their debt? (Oh shit, I bet that it went down that way....)
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:35:59
That's a fair criticism, but it's an issue with coinbase and bitpay and not with bitcoins. That is, hopefully those companies (specifically CB) get that part to work a bit better.

First, you're allowed to talk on reddit without making baseless insults. Calm your jimmies.
Second, you can claim that YOU knew that things would be bad. That's fair. But you cannot claim that EVERYONE should have known just because you made an argument.
You get to say "I told you so" but you don't get to say "everyone should have known" just because you thought you knew.

I disagree there. Especially for those addicted to drugs, they really don't have a choice. But someone chooses to break the law to try to profit off of the addiction of others.
Part of the reason that these drugs are illegal is because they are bad for the society. Our taxes go to set up welfare, shelters, drug treatments, etc. So a drug dealer profits, doesn't pay taxes, and the general public is left to pick up the tab for those left addicted.
Of course I'm talking about smack, crack, etc. Not pot.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:07:19
No one knows, and many people have a vested interest in seeing gox survive AND a vested interest in seeing it fail. Lots of people sold their gox coins for *cheap* and would prefer to see it fail than it come back - since if gox came back and everything was fine they would be out money.
That's why some people see so hell-bent on seeing everything in the most negative light possible.
Again, no one really knows.

Fortunately you have all of 2014 to wait for the IRS to announce formal rules for Bitcoins. It is likely that they will do so this year.
But for sure:
1. Bitcoins have a real monetary value
2. You won Bitcoins in a contest
3. Contest winnings are subject to tax
You should record the value of bitcoins when you received your prize, because this is what you need to claim as lottery winnings. THEN if bitcoins appreciate in value you need to claim THAT profit as well.
I'm not a tax expert, so there is a disclaimer here that I'm not giving you exact instructions. But you *do* owe tax on your winnings and should claim it lest it get you into trouble.
[Here]( is a very good reddit thread by a tax attorney about the tax implications of bitcoins

Isn't a big part of this that Charlie was one guy that could be isolated? I remember reading that the cases with HSBC (and the like) is that they obfuscate things in such a manner that they bosses can all point a finger somewhere else and thus it makes it very hard to press charges against a single person.
OBVIOUSLY they shouldn't get away with it, but we just might not have had enough evidence to prosecute an individual. And thus what I'm saying is: it's probably not *only* about the money.

I just think it's easy to draw the line at drug dealers. Many users are addicted and we're doing them a disservice by also throwing them into jail.
Alcohol shouldn't be banned because of how easy it is to make at home. It's way too difficult to control and, as a society, we would be wasting a lot of money trying to catch people. IIRC this was a major part of prohibition.
And anyway, I think all drugs should be legal. I'm with the general sentiment here in this thread.
What I'm saying is: You can't pick and choose the laws you follow. Society falls apart if we just choose to follow the laws we agree with.
Put our efforts into changing the laws instead of ways to circumvent them, that's my 2c.

You don't think that drugs are a social ill? I've had my car broken into just for the change and my wife had her purse stolen by a crack-head. Those are just my experiences, but drugs do have a social cost.

go back through your posts. You don't ONCE give evidence to support your case or refute my arguments.
I'll say it one more time: Just because your prediction was correct doesn't mean that everyone could (or should) have known it *would be* correct. Moreover, just because you said it once, here on reddit doesn't mean that everyone read it.

It's naive and insulting to infer that anyone dealing with Mt Gox was simply "greedy" (if that's even a bad thing, seems like a weasel word in an attempt to discredit someone).
The withdraw problem was attributed to an issue with FINCEN. SEPA and JPY withdraws were going through so there wasn't a reason to be suspicious.

Yes. People are happy that gox is gone as they saw it as a scourge on the price of bitcoin.

Uh. No. So you're saying that anyone that uses ANY exchange at ANY point is the "stupidest fucking thing you could do".
I trade on a DAILY basis. How can I do that without keeping my coin in gox? I had been trying to get it out for WEEKS. I didn't lose everything, and I'll recover. But it's not my fucking fault for using the *exchange with the most volume*.


I do. I risked using the site and lost my coin. But FFS it's not my *fault* that the coins are gone. It's GOX's fault.

The only safe place is: cold storage (unless you lose it!) so that's not that great. You could make a computer that ONLY for coins, put a clean linux on it and unplug it from the internet, that's not very useful.

It's not hard to do if you're selling your bitcoins for cash and using coinbase or something like that. But if you're mining, and then buying stuff, then it's not likely that you'd get busted.
I reported my coinbase income this year because it was so high, I'm *sure* that they reported it to the government. Better safe than sorry. I don't want to end up in jail.

Just bad luck and a sucker for "positive statements" from companies. Each company above released positive statements (lied) before and during crashes. Frankly, I don't see how it's even legal. For instance, Freddie Mac came out and said "We're fine, we have enough money, we'll survive" literally 1 day before it was revealed that they were almost completely broke (and the stock crashed to almost nothing).
Overall, I'm up in my lifetime - these are just the worst of my decisions.

1. You chose to transact with bitcoin in the most expensive ways
2. You chose to transact with fiat in the least expensive ways
Bitcoin's strength is sending non-reversible transactions to  others. It's especially useful if you're sending to someone in a different country.

Their official stance was that they couldn't do USD withdraws anymore due to FINCEN regulations in the US. They were still doing JPY and SEPA withdraws just fine. So they *appeared* solvent. But for people in the US with no way of getting their money out, they had to buy coins in order to get their USD out, which bumped up the price. Also, they were the world leader in volume. There were many reasons why the price was higher and it wasn't just "because it was riskier".

It's just my opinion: but it depends on how much they're in debt. Someone could rescue gox if it's worth it to them to buy the debt. That is, if they think that they can still make enough money with gox that it's worth repairing it's name.
I don't think many people would go to gox2.0 if gox1.0 money was never returned - even if it's a new company.

MtGox is fine for buying bitcoins if you want to withdraw the coins from MtGox - especially if it's &lt;10 BTC. MtGox has some issues with fiat withdraws and with large BTC transactions usually because the transaction fee was too small.

drugs aren't illegal just for morals. They're a social ill. No one likes having crack heads break into their cars. No one likes have drugs dens in their neighborhood. No one likes seeing their daughters sell themselves in order to get a hit of something. So it's not just mumsy and dadsy saying "don't do drugs: they're bad", but rather it's the drugs have an inerrant cost to the public. Not to mention the cost to the tax payer in welfare, shelters, drug rehab, etc.

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know the legality here. I found [this]( link which made it sound like you shouldn't keep it.
The moral thing is to find the next of kin and return it to them, it doesn't belong to you. Your situation doesn't change what is right. And ignorance of the coins doesn't change the morale situation (or legal situation - if there is one).
But practically, I would play moral relativism here: how rich was this family (I guess based on the estate sale)? If they're struggling like you, then you should return it (or most of it) - if not, keep it for yourself. Or if it's about equal, maybe tell them you found $500. (Be careful here, humans are greedy and if you tell them you're only giving them half then be prepared for them to come after you for the full amount)
Anything if you keep for yourself, you should probably launder the coins just to be safe: buy gift cards via Gyft or pay for items directly. I wouldn't sell the coins for cash through an exchange.

Unless you can show me a historical chart, I'm going to respectfully say: bullshit. Or at least bullshit for the last week. I've bought and sold a lot this week and I compare with coinbase every time, to see where I can get the best rate. Their spreads were routinely off by $5-10 (already &gt;0.5%) and sometimes up to $20.
I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem fair to ever see a spread of $20. Just seems like gouging to me.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:20:28
First, it didn't say estimate. It said "By nov 20th" and I got my money on the 21st.
Second, I made withdraws and deposits on the same day. They both had the same settle date of nov 20th. The money was taken out of my bank account on the 20th, but I had to wait until the 21st to get my money - a full day late from when they said it would be there. Just seemed suspicious since the money out of my bank account was on time.
