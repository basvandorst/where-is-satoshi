Notice that NO LIST MENTIONS the Israelis, or the Zionists or even DEMOCRATS TRYING. To self destruct our INTERNET? Don't even think its all republicans this time.
WHY ISN'T ANYONE SHOUTING DOWN DIANE FEINSTEIN AND HER REAL ESTATE TYCOON HUSBAND TRYING TO BANKRUPT THE POSTAL SERVICE- so they can buy the lands those offices sit on at ROCK BOTTOM DISTRESS RATES AND MAKE A KILLING ON THEM,
Funding the retirement fund SEVENTY FIVE YEARS in advance! WE CAN EVEN KEEP CONGRESSES PAWS OFF OF SOCIAL SECURITY'S funds; yet there's MS FEINSTEIN &amp; HER Cronies; killing the postal service so she can PRIVATIZE AND KICK UP ALL THE RATES OF SHIPPING MAILING ET AL!!!
Note that they neither mention the  Plutocracy and rich munitions tycoons meaning to foment war;
 REALLY? 
What is ISIS MADE OF?
All the LITTER OF OLDER VERSIONS OF ONCE STATE OF THE ART WAR MACHINES.
When the US STOPPED BUYING THEM?
Munitions companys do what they ALWAYS DO; sell them to OUR ENEMIES; arm them; the pay people to blow something up.
What we are ALL MISSING? 
The corporations &amp; Countries want to STIFLE the Internet; 
CISPA, TPP AND WORSE WILL PROBABLY be SHOVED THROUGH on the strength of ATTACKS with which we DO NOT KNOW Who Backed them.
 Each time stocks SHOOT UP on munitions companies and the congress rips even MORE MONEYA FROM SOCIAL PROGRAMS kicking enormous amounts of CORPORATE WELFARE; to multi nationals...CORPORATIONS THAT DON'T PAY BUT MERE SUCKY PERCENTAGES OF THE TAXES THAT THEY OWE.
NO one is bothering to mention the 150 BILLION STOLEN FROM SOCIAL SECURITY TO BALANCE ANOTHER MILITARILY HEAVY BUDGET- 
in PEACE TIME? 
WHERE IS THE COMMENTARY &amp; the PUNDITS ON THAT? Where is Rachel MADDOW ON THAT?
Reddit? Where is your take  ON THAT???
Reddit?

I beg to differ here. At least TWO TIMES the Russians have gone after the pre courser of ISIS in 1996/7 and again in 2015; EACH TIME in a small amount of time; the RUSSIANS HAVE KICKED ASS.
What have WE AMERICANS Done in that same time, BUT BLEAT about the ISIS ADVANCES and put more REQUESTS FOR FUNDING ON THE TABLE?

They are suggesting shutting down the Internet and the first form of money that doesn't need to go through the giant multinational banks- the biggest pushers of CISPA, TPP ET AL? The multinational corporations who want the power of making us all peons and serfs again, while they lord over us all.
