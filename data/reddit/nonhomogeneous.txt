No need for a passphrase. Just use a pin &amp; a password with the associated seed phrase (recovery phrase). But make sure you’re aware of your public &amp; private key &amp; keep them safe. Passphrases are for advanced users which bnuttall obviously isn’t as you wouldn’t ever recommended that level of security for an entry level person. I bet she doesn’t even use one
