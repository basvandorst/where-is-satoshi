it's not about exchange, it's about locking obviously ill gotten funds.
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:37:16
why can't large holders of suspicious addresses be blacklisted and funds locked until they proven their identity and source of funds? There can be a "bitcoin security foundation" that issues these blacklists and guarantees to compensate legitimate owners for inconvenience if they blacklist a wrong person. But if the funds are recovered (by overwhelming support of bitcoin community after several years), they keep a portion of the stolen funds? 
This foundation can pay miners when they make changes to the blacklist. They can have a public hearing room for verified owners of blacklisted wallets who want to claim their money. If the public overwhelming supports releasing of the funds, the security foundation can pay the claimants for their inconvenience and update the blacklist. After one year of blacklisting, if no owner comes forward (with verified identity) it can issue a reverse list to miners to reverse the theft transaction, while collecting 5% to 10% for the foundation's service.

Bitcoin is a property like gold. It has no similarity with paypal.
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:43:28
rollback returns the system to an  earlier state. this is like, creating a new state where previously stolen funds are retrieved and returned to the owner. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:34:42
bitcoin is like electronic gold, its value is from people holding it as cross-border assets.
This is just about stopping the massive damage from massive thefts. It's really not more complicated than this.

in additional to giving users bonds at face value, they can be given call options on further bonds with a cash strike value of say, 90 cents on the dollar. So, if the user dumps the bonds early, say for 40 cents, they still have a chance to recover some loss if the stolen money is recovered and the bitfinex bonds increase greatly in value. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:19:02
Hypothetically, to finance $60 million in liabilities, bitfinex can issue the following (as examples):
- $10 million of 5 year bonds at 2% interest
- $20 million of 15 year bonds at 3% interest
- $30 million of 30 year bonds at 5% interest
Then, each user whose account was affected will receive a $1 voucher for each $1 value of loss, for a total of $60 million of vouchers. These vouchers can be used to buy the $60 million face value of bonds of different maturities in an open market.  Once all the vouchers have been spent (or auto purchase if user takes no action by a set date), the bonds (altcoins) are then traded in a cash market. 
If bitfinex ever recovers the stolen funds, it can buy back these bonds.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:27:51
why not spend the money and energy to reform bitcoin to have reversal of these huge thefts? you're angry at people who didn't have bad intentions but ignoring the criminals, does it make any sense?
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:56:07
I'm just looking for people that want to recover their massive losses and make their voices heard. I laugh when I heard whales want to sue Bitfinex but care nothing about the pirate horde that's staring at their faces. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:04:15
It can create a group of traders who are loyal to the exchange, to help bitfinex get on its feet again. Giving out Bfxcoin alone doesn't have the same effect.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:31:34
It doesn't matter if he breaks the theft up into a ton of bitcoin addresses, the whole tree can be followed, all of them can be simultaneously locked. If he deposits them into any legitimate exchange and tries to convert into a different asset form, then he exposes his identity and loses direct control of the coins. On back channels, his ability to quickly convert millions of dollars of assets is nonexistent. Think of it this way, if hackers can safely and quickly convert millions of stolen coins today, they would not be sitting forever in their wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:43:18
It's Bitcoin is the people who paid billions of dollars for its value. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:10:26
it's not any more central than the handful of developers who create and approve bitcoin code.

The biggest potential benefit of staying in business is to catch the thief. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:10:39
Bitcoin can be transferred, stored, digitized, wallet opened and looked at, talked about, studied, developed, and traded; it's not really any more frivolous than gold. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:17:36
If I'm holding an altcoin which has better security profile than btc, or I'm holding fiat not on loan which is immune to crypto theft, why should I subsidize holders of the more risky btc? If you try to spend your life savings on lawyers to put bitfinex into bankrupcy, you could be suing a company that will have all its balances withdrawn, and get nothing but negative lawyer fees. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:13:50
It's not the gold industry but the thousands of policemen who can take care of issues like returning any stolen gold, especially when it's $60 million worth.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:38:39
It's much better for the exchange's continued operation if a large number of accounts can be isolated from any damage at all, while the other accounts are compensated slowly over time from bitfinex's continued operation and growth, and even possibly recovery of the funds if the thief can be nailed (this is not out of the question for such a large sum and attention from law enforcement).  
This can keep a core group of traders happy, as long as the security issues can be laid bare and decisively addressed, while the unfortunate ones can hold up hope that bitfinex will eventually make full amends for their loss by staying a strong exchange. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:51:13
you want to have no place where you can buy/sell bitcoins, utterly irrational.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:08:28
Only when someone makes a claim against your account. The claimant is responsible for first revealing his or her identity, to show their earnestness. If Bitcoin Compensation Initiative decides to blacklist the defendant as a result, it will be responsible to compensate the defendant (for time and inconvenience not for damage) if it turns out to be a false claim. To prevent frivolous claims, BCI can require a deposit from the claimant, which if he or she loses will be used to compensate the defendant's time. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:15:43
I think in practice the *capacity* of these sideband conversions will be very very limited. Any system designed to accept anonymous conversions can be at risk of BCI following the tree and locking their wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:03:27
the blacklisting will stop the thieve's wallet from spending more funds.  A reversal can be done by the mining software by destroying coins in the blacklisted wallet and creating new coins in the source wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:35:38
Did you do anything special to sign up for synapsepay? I haven't received any emails from them even though I kept a lot of USD in bitfinex. It was sitting in the exchange account. Was your money in the margin account by chance?
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:04:13
Fiat balances not on loan must not be taken away to pay others. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:48:56
stolen property is never fungible. if it was society would have no order and no computers to run bitcoins on. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:24:21
whether you claim this is what the community prefers, this rule doesn't make any sense. This means no intermediary is ever responsible for any of the user's bitcoin, no trust or commerce is possible with the scheme you describe. 
The fact is bitcoin is treated as property by U.S. government, the silkroad guys had their bitcoins taken away and auctioned as confiscated property. A technical convenience does not define title to property, there are societal norms that are contrary to what you claimed. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:34:14
Thank you. I haven't heard of him before I need some time to digest this. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:14:55
excuse me, you're right, if the borrower sold short the  btc you lent them, then they have the cash to re-buy the btc's to repay you.
Btc are property, if you bought the property through whatever means, whether borrowing USD or buying from a shortseller, you assume asset risk which is associated with the properties of the asset class. If I borrowed money to buy a warehouse, and the warehouse burned down I lose the property and still have the same liability to the lender. If someone lends me a warehouse in exchange for promise to return one just like it, and I sold the warehouse, I have the cash to build another warehouse to repay the warehouse lender. The fire risk of the warehouse is then assumed by the buyer that I short sold to. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:29:51
you could be a hacker to be this committed  to protecting thieves
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:06:18
if there aren't well known, easily understood consequences, the issue probably just hasn't been pursued aggressively enough.

Money is not fungible if it's illegally obtained. If the foundation behaves badly it will lose credibility with miners and they won't honor the foundation's requests. Bitcoin is decentralized but in fact the developers have overwhelming influence. The security foundation is no different, it adds an additional responsibility for the people that highly influence bitcoin, shows they care about the safety of user's funds, while not unnecessarily limiting bitcoin's freedom.

I use electrum with one white and one gray trezor.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:06:25
it will be a big difference if the chance for a big theft drops to zero. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:39:39
It should not be criminal playground. All the value is from people holding it like electronic gold. If it was a coin for drug junkies it would be worth $1. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:33:58
BCI will just use their judgement. If they have bad judgement, the miners will no longer trust them. If they solve the big problems without creating problems for normal use, then they can thrive as a business. It's just like anything else that gets implemented into bitcoin.

Then bitfinex can pay itself and let other users withdraw, your only friends will be the lawyers you bought. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:20:43
If bitfinex goes out of existence there's no chance to recover any funds. The best argument for restructuring is to stay alive for the stolen $60 million, hopefully this argument can receive support from the bitcoin community. There should be someone who's looking for the massive amounts of stolen money and make life hard for the thieves, it makes no sense to shutdown and just take the loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:31:41
you're overreacting, blacklisting pirate hordes will only make it worth more
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:32:59
Everyone who was fucked by this should work together to reform bitcoin to have reversal of such obvious thefts. No more excuses. If bitfinex dies there's no one to go after the hacker and claim title to the funds. $60 million of users' property will die with it. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:10:14
yeah it would be way harder to steal and you can pretty much trust the exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:56:33
Five years ago they would probably overwhelmingly believe BTC cannot fetch more than $500. Opinions change if there are good reasons to change. Bitcoins can maintain immutability, you can reverse a theft by destroying the blacklisted coins and create new ones. We should consider technical and political issues separately.
What I would now call Bitcoin Compensation Initiative doesn't need to bless every transaction. It just considers claims and tries to make wise decisions that solves hundred million dollar community problems, without affecting normal everyday use. 
The hearing can be implemented online, where the public can comment and be polled on big cases. BCI would make the decision and its overall integrity would be measured by the miners. In a case of a a new wallet popping up with 20,000 bitcoins, coming from a major exchange on the day it lost half of its coins, with no owner willing to come forward with an identity on this amount of wealth and explanation for why Bitfinex owes him this money, is there any serious doubt of what should be done?
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:26:43
it will be worth a lot more, because the criminals will become scared. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:59:54
crypto coins are considers to be property, they're not the same as currency. Caretakers of property always have liability limitations built into their term of service.
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:44:21
bitcoin software should be able to blacklist these wallets and all transactions that are sourced from them. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:59:11
IOU's depend on the counter party's ability to repay, it's their repayment ability that got socialized, which is why it affects the lender.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:52:14
Bitcoin Compensation Initiative holds open hearing for a year, no one with a sane mind thinks the money belong to the attacker, and show it in their public comments and voting. The miners agree BCI is sane and continue to honor their requests. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:27:35
your biased opinion only, you could be a hacker
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:38:33
Not sure who you represent, but that's really a shit attitude you have for hundreds of millions of other people's property. I hope you have nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:34:16
it's got nothing to do with getting out of btc risk. you took on repayment risk in exchange for interest payments. you exchanged btc for promise to repay btc.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:42:24
great ideas, I'm interested in developing the IOU idea: 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:01:42
you want hundreds of thousands of bitcoin owners to understand this or understand that, but you don't care about getting one or two thiefs?
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:36:17
The vouchers given to affected users can only be used to buy bonds. 
I don't know what's bitfinex's exact profitability. 5% interest is $3 million per year. If they can afford 10% interest, that would not be unattractive, plus the chance of recovering the stolen funds by staying alive and paying attention to who's moving those addresses. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:50:33
the people that do this, they probably spent years targeting the money that's spread around, right now one or two groups "succeed" one or two times per year
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:58:23
I'm not suggesting to have blockchain rollbacks at all, but to lock ill gotten funds, eventually destroying the coins and issue new ones to the correct owners. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:57:43
I like these suggestions, instead of IOU's bitfinex can issue an altcoin that's tradeable and honored as a 30-year bond by the company. If the owners panic sell these bonds, bitfinex can buy them back much more cheaply than the $60 million face value. 
It's much better for the exchange's continued operation if a large number of accounts can be isolated from any damage at all, while the other accounts are compensated slowly over time from bitfinex's continued operation and growth, and even possibly recovery of the funds if the thief can be nailed (this is not out of the question for such a large sum and attention from law enforcement).
This can keep a core group of traders happy, as long as the security issues can be laid bare and decisively addressed, while the unfortunate ones can hold up hope that bitfinex will eventually make full amends for their loss by staying a strong exchange.
