Bitcoin could potentially let you programmatically send and receive payments. Think about that for a second:
1. I make a standup comedy routine and put it up on Youtube. I'm becoming popular, how do I monetize my content? Charge viewers a per-minute rate (maybe $0.01 / min?), or serve ads to them if they aren't paying.
2. My buddies and I made an indie game, and while we're all smart people, we don't want to have to deal with the hell of setting up a payment method for our game. Right now, the solution is the Steam marketplace, but Steam takes a cut of your revenue. With Bitcoin, people can immediately come to my site, deposit into my wallet, and grab an auto-generated download link to my game.
3. I'm visiting the city and I really want to use the restroom. The city knows that public restrooms are easily vandalized and hard to maintain. The city decides to levy a small fee upon usage of a public restroom in order to help maintain it. The city understands that the friction of having someone pull out their card and swipe, and securing a POS inside an unattended public restroom, is difficult. Accepting only cash limits their audience/revenue and will artificially limit their audience. Bitcoin over NFC can make it painless to deposit funds and gain access to the restroom.
These are just a few examples of what you can do once *machines* can ask for payments. Until now, only people could, and very complicated mechanisms were put in place to have software request payment.
I'm not one of those *fiat will fall, all hail the rise of distributed currency* people. I just think any technology that reduces friction helps the market work more efficiently, signals actual supply/demand more accurately, and helps keep prices low due to the market finding a better equilibrium. That was exactly what the internet did: democratize information. Now we're ready to democratize payments.

A lot of external observers think that Blockchain tech will be useful but not Bitcoin per-say, and in my opinion, are being naive. The thing with Blockchain based tech is that it's very difficult to get right. Take a look at Ethereum. Bitcoin has the advantage of being worthless and heavily doubted when it first came on the scene, which allowed it to make early mistakes. But now Bitcoin is already a trusted source of value. Rather than try and reinvent the Blockchain, it's easier to use one that already has value, and that's Bitcoin.

If you want to try and mitigate the problem of fees viz. small transaction amounts, take a look at

In an ideal world you would use an open printing firmware that has been audited and trusted, but in the real world, this isn't really a possibility. One practical way to go about doing it is to encode your private key using BIP38 (2FA for your keys basically).

God you summed up my thoughts on Haskell exactly! I'll definitely give the codebase a thorough lookthrough after work, and if time permits, try to get a PR or two in. Thanks for the good work!
How are you testing this? And I can move this to github if you feel that this discussion is out of the scope of this channel.

I haven't looked into this with huge detail but I believe he's implementing  Read the doc for more info, but he's essentially using a multisig address to hold multiple payments and then payout once the sending party agrees that the full amount has been paid.

OP I can see your repo is in rough shape, but great work nonetheless! I'm also Haskell fluent (albeit with low Haskell experience), so I can help too if you need some!
