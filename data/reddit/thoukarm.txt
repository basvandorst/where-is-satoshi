Oh yeah, I am certainly not naive enough to think that legal action would actually do anything, but it is still strange to me that a company who has lived and died by their proprietary code base wouldn't spend the 15 minutes to take this down. They exist in virtue of digital property, and this is clear theft of digital property. I suppose Satoshi should drop a record or something and maybe the RIAA would get involved. App would be gone in a blink.

So, it is somewhat concerning that there is no legal recourse for these people. I understand that there is probably little they can do to go after the author, but now that this code is public and Google is allowing it to stay up, shouldn't they be culpable at least for negligence? This guy just lost 60 btc, which is legally considered property. How can we get the right people to look more closely at this?
Thanks to the trolls in advance, I really appreciate your advice.

It's not much, but I had a bit of fun with it. :)
And of course the classic for reference:

Which was obvious sarcasm which I have repeatedly poured on and you've repeatedly missed!
Is this an interesting topic to you? I am bored of this.

It's mocking the idea that they stole it from themselves. Which of course they didn't do either.
At this stage of technological development, I always find it silly when people and entities (or, usually their fans) try to make strong cases for originality. We are swimming in a sea of divergent technology, predicated on so many pervious innovations that it would be ridiculous to try to give every deserving party credit.

Yeah, I was kidding, but that has to be pretty cool to have seen changes. I am sure this September seems like a long one...
I am sure there are many, but what is one notable cool or silly change you've noticed has you've watched communication technology become a thing?
@_date: 2014-04-22 04:47:19
This is interesting, and really perfect for bitcoin transactions which are technically barter now too.
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:39:29
Sure, but I am talking more about getting the attention of Google. Strange that they haven't acted more quickly when users are being victimized from an app they're hosting.
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:20:32
Lol, thanks!
I kept doing the voice under my breath reading it and chuckling to myself, so I am glad if you got a chuckle as well!

Pragmatism to undercut the potential of your new tool?
What are you saying?
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:19:01
Wow, I am juuust old enough so that vaguely rings a bell. I can remember playing with my father's Palm Pilot circa 1992 thinking this thing has some potential.
Would the smartphone classify as both the coolest and the silliest thing so far? Has to be in the running for both titles...

Leading with, 'No, just no' never did anyone any good.
Nowhere in my post did I say Google was to blame. Also, to restate: Google is not to blame for this situation.
Google has known malicious code sitting on its servers and being distributed through its retail system. Better security -- which you mention as a goal -- would take them all of 15 minutes in this case. Further, the idea that they can allow a giant retail system to self-moderate is ludicrous. They should simply take this down.
This really has nothing to do with your harangue about how inept users are: we all get it. Everyone on the internet should be presumed inept until conclusively proven otherwise, and that is NEVER going to change. What should, and could easily, change, is the attitude of this giant company toward reasonably protecting and enforcing the security of their users.

That's a post-scarcity scenario you're describing there. Bitcoin will have been dead for quite a long time by then.
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:26:32
Yeah, but it's hardly their own concept. The idea showed up in Star Trek in the early '70's. In this case, it's about execution, and whether people like it or not Apple captured the tech and got to market with a well executed product first. That's why people adopted them.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:06:27
Wow, great point, stellar.
@_date: 2014-04-26 06:30:59
Wow, you're amazing!

I currently own and operate mineral mining operations in Latin America. It is costly and logistically complex to work on this planet, let alone outside of it, and there is *plenty* of known mineral wealth available on this planet to meet demand for the reasonably foreseeable future. Not to mention recycling which is expected to improve.
From a "focus directly on it" technological perspective, asteroid mining is probably not much more than 40 years away, however we are hardly crawling at this stage: getting there is hardly the challenging part. However, from a "sufficient economic incentive" and logistical feasibility perspective, I would be surprised if it happens inside that timeframe.

Really one way to value BTC: expected userbase/total amount of BTC.
That's just another way to say, "demand/supply". If demand outpaces supply, price goes up; if supply outpaces demand, price goes down.
Right now supply is still increasing, but since there are a fixed amount of bitcoins which will be mined, that's not going to be the case forever. So the thinking is that bitcoins are cheap because we are still in the process of building the userbase (increasing demand), which is expected to continue to grow, while the supply will slow and ultimately cease.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:07:00
What timeline are you looking for an increasing userbase? Over the last year there has been quite a lot of evidence, and for a medium of exchange that's a very short period of time.
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:23:47
Yes, that is another example. Apparently, similar ideas were in the zeitgeist as early as 1915, according to the *History of tablet computers* wikipedia page.
And I mean that's sort of what you'd expect, no? The closest input to the experience of the time was pen and ink, so that's where the mind would tend first.
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:35:44
Yeah, it is amazing to see that happen, especially with the acceleration of change over the last, say, 300 years. If you go far enough back (8-10 generations even) things weren't changing within lifetimes: you had a horse, and so did everyone back to the middle ages. But you saw the beginning, life, and progression past the space age. Cool, man. And now, paradigm shifts are a dime a dozen.
Even in my lifetime, (I am 28), I saw the internet become real. I can remember paging through an Encyclopedia Britannica in my parents' den at maybe 8 years old, and I even remember the salesman who came and sold the thing to us. The thing was ancient 5 years later, and now I'd be hard pressed to find one at all.
Kids today (lol, right?) are *swimming* in technology, permiating every aspect of their lives, and it will be real interesting to do the same look back at the pre-internet when I am your age. I already feel like a relic around my younger cousins.
Cheers to another 52 and beyond.
