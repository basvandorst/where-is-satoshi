Here in the states, I accept Bitcoin via BitPay with 0% fees and the option to instantly convert to fiat to avoid volatility (I happen to choose to keep the Bitcoin I'm paid). I set that up in about 30 minutes. I'm hoping they service Taiwan or there is a comparable service there. That's why I'm here.

Lol INTP here. I feel like a large portion of INTs are early bitcoin adopters (at least relative to the general population). I wonder what effects this will have on society in the future with a lot of us ending up very rich or very poor, depending on the outcome of bitcoin. Maybe bitcoin is finally a way to bring power and influence to us nerds on a large scale using what we do best, technology. This could have broad implications for the future of our culture and society.

The following description is how I understand it, but anyone can chime in to make corrections if necessary. It's a network of computers that run the OB software locally. These computers belong to the users (buyers and sellers) of OB. There is no mining required since there is no common ledger, like with Bitcoin. A seller's "store" is broadcast from their computer and received by shoppers on OB. That's why it's peer-to-peer; the stores aren't hosted on central servers like with ebay. This means there is no censoring of transactions and no fees.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:33:22
Yeah. Is that a bad thing?
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:50:22
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:39:46
You buy/sell fiat for Bitcoin. Just like one would buy or sell any other good on OB. So, for example, if I wanted to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin for USD, I list $100 of USD for sale and someone pays in Bitcoin.

Talking about how many transactions we make. Wants to get rid of credit cards.
They created an entirely new payment process called "ApplePay".
Its is one-tap checkout using NFC on iPhone 6.
iPhone 6 has a chip dedicated to security.
Uses TouchID for security
They're working with banks and retailers to implement system.
Focus was on credit cards, now theyre talking about online transactions and how cumbersome they are.
ApplePay has one touch checkout online/on mobile. (it looks just like Braintree's solution they announced yesterday.)
ApplePay works on Apple watch

I think she's saying that it is similar to the creative/apple analogy in the article. Bitcoin is obviously the superior technology, but because it's not as user friendly and lacks adequate interface with the existing paradigms in which we all operate, it is not actually the most useful to the average consumer.

Bitcoin works well when you're transacting with a business, but until mycelium's local trade functionality was implemented, distributed exchanges of bitcoin with anything else was impossible.

I'm not weighing in on whether this is a good decision or not, but with any investment, diversification is important, especially with something like bitcoin that could continue to grow exponentially. If it were me, I would just reduce my position by selling the majority of my holdings. If you keep .5 btc, for example, you won't notice the reduction in USD from selling, but you still maintain a low risk position in bitcoin. Just my 2 bits.

Bitcoin is like smartphones in 2007. A few people had them and there was minimal infrastructure to make them useful (app stores, millions of other users), however, they had potential for growth as a platform since they are so versatile and relatively easily adopted. Now, the people that didn't think they need a smartphone in 2007 can't live without them. Furthermore, in 2007, many of these applications, upon which we are dependent, hadn't even been conceived yet! The same is true of bitcoin. It's as useful as a pre-App Store smartphone; it can do some cool and convenient things, but it's true potential is far from being unlocked.
Bitcoin is a platform, like iOS or android, upon which services can easily be built. It's just a matter of time for these services to be developed. And once they do, they will be unparalleled by any existing monetary system.

I've gotten 15 out of 270 orders payed with bitcoin since I started accepting. That's about 5% or 1 out of 20 orders. I have payed 1% transaction fees on the bitcoin transactions since they were processed by bitpay. That is opposed to 3% by paypal and cc. The difference has saved me about $19 so far. However, my bitcoin holdings (I hold all bitcoin payments) have gained and lost a lot of value. For example, my first bitcoin order was about half a coin for a $50 purchase. But, I also got a few orders on Black Friday when bitcoin was at about $1000 or so. Point being that volatility has far overshadowed the amount saved on tx fees.

You're right about the volatility. But for your second point, a bitcoin can be immediately verified with an off-chain transaction.

I operate an online store that accepts bitcoin via bitpay. With bitcoin, my transaction fees come to about 1%. With paypal and shopify payments, transaction fees come to about 3%. This means someone paying in bitcoin will net me 2% more than of they payed with traditional methods. I think this 2% bonus should be shared by the merchant (me) and the customer since we are both necessary for this bonus to be "rewarded" (I have to be willing to accept bitcoin and they have to be willing to spend bitcoin). So this would mean I should give a 1% discount to customers who pay with bitcoin (and keep the other 1%) . However, I don't do this because it seems like a trivial (and almost insulting) discount. Thoughts?

If the safety of the bitcoin network relies on the personal security of a couple people, the system needs to be reworked.

Exactly. The function that controls the amount of bitcoin mined is designed to imitate the mining of a finite resource such as gold or oil.

Looks like craigslist for 2015. Their interface is so old fashioned, I'm glad to see a modern competitor. This may be pedantic, but it should be "Blockchain.info" in the video. Every Bitcoin transaction uses the blockchain.

Every address holding a balance has a public key that has been broadcast to the network. So wouldn't any address thats even used just once be vulnerable? Meaning bitcoin would be broken.

Can you elaborate on why BitUSD is doomed to fail? I don't know things.
@_date: 2015-04-03 01:17:48
Not sure why you care so much. It's like when people try to tear down Bitcoin. These are people who are pushing the limits of technology. If they fail, they contributed to the technology by performing a valuable experiment. If they succeed, they revolutionize an industry. Win-win

Ibn Khaldun, a 14th century Tunesian historian, detailed his observations of change through generations in a dynasty. His observations are that the first generation ruler is hardened from living a difficult life in the desert. The second generation ruler is raised as a ruler, but lacks the toughness of their father. The third generation is utterly spoiled as royalty and is a poor ruler, and in the fourth generation, the dynasty is overthrown and the cycle begins again with a new dynasty.

Could it be transmitted securely via a RFID chip embedded in the card? Maybe like each card/bill you have is like a wallet/account. You might have a personal card, business, savings, etc. But the hardware wallet is so cheap its disposable or transferrable. Would that work?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:07:42
I've been thinking this too. Only in the last few days have I seen a lot in the media about this and the only reason I've seen those is because I was linked there in this subreddit. People still don't know what's happening. The amount of people who own bitcoins is a minuscule percent of a fraction of the population. I think the price will soar over $1000 before the bubble pops (if it indeed does).
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:04:33
Great input! Thanks! What if the bill had a flexible e-ink display that could display or not display various keys (public or private) in the form of a 2D graphic. Could private keys be stored and displayed securely?
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:03:11
I think it's in the same vein; the internet and computing in general have changed the way we consume information, pay our bills, drive our cars, etc. in a manner that is so rapid that policy is left in the dust, resulting in a disjointed society.

I was aware that the private keys are maintained privately. I have not completed my research into the implementations of bitcoin into a physical currency, so I was unsure of the possibilities and limitations of the technology. I have decided to just make a paper wallet. It already works as a technology, so theres nothing to develop. and I can make a real one myself. I was thinking how all of my classmates are making fake currency, but I'll put half a bitcoin on two of my paper wallets and give one to each professor for my class as actual currency. I bet no student has done that before.
@_date: 2013-05-13 13:45:11
I think what I'll do is when I see a purchase from a customer using the discount code "bitcoin", Ill send the them an email with the price in USD, the price in bitcoins using the mt.gox exchange rate at the time of purchase, and my wallet address. I'm definitely in bitcoins for the long haul. I don't care about short term volatility. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:33:41
I called them to see what options I have to accept bitcoin (it's easier for them to ignore an email) and the guy said they're looking into the tech, but there are no options right now.

Thanks for contributing. If this is the only reason to use bitpay, I think I can get away with using the method I suggested. I sell custom made products, so they aren't shipped for a few days anyway.

As the value increases, some of those with many coins will spend some. Eventually, the wealth will even out more of less.

Looking at the summer 2011 spike, this is what happened. A gradual decline for a while, then a gradual incline. I don't see why it wouldn't follow the pattern considering how analogous the two spikes have been.
@_date: 2013-05-13 12:45:11
Yes, I use shopify. I don't see why someone hasn't made a third party app for accepting bitcoins yet. It seems like there would be demand for it. I have free shipping on my products, so I don't have to worry about that not being discounted. Anyway, I cant wait for Shopify stores to accept bitcoins. Thanks for contributing.

Dude! Hold into them. The value will very likely go up (deflationary currency). If you have enough money invested to ruin your marriage, you will very likely be incredibly rich in the next 10 years.
Our current financial infrastructure can't work at the speed of the Internet. As time goes on, the general public will demand even more speed and control (the "now" generation). Currently, bitcoin is the only financial technology that can keep up with our modern communications infrastructure in a market where the name of the game is market share. People want fast and convenient technology and bitcoin will enable that.

This is great insight! Maybe paper money doesnt make sense, but rather a hardware wallet that can wirelessly connect to your smartphone (bluetooth 4.0 is really low power. maybe that would work). If it could be cheap enough, it could be easily transferrable to another owner (such as with paper money). Do you think that is a more practical design?
EDIT: I'm just going to design a paper wallet. No technological innovation. Just a paper wallet. It'll be cool because I can actually make a functional currency, whereas my classmates projects will not be real. I'll literally be making money. hahahahahahahahahahaha
EDIT2: hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha
EDIT3: I just thought of a cool feature for the paper wallet. Maybe instead of the private key being hidden by obstruction, perhaps it could be hidden in plain view. Let me explain; there could be something printed on a portion of the bill that can only be read when another portion of the bill is overlayed on top of it. You would fold the bill in third, revealing the private key, which would be visible when the transparent parts of the bill align. Does that make sense?

@_date: 2013-05-14 13:14:50
I'm not sure if this is a serious question, but I'll answer it anyway. We get a lot of goods and services in exchange for taxes. Most of which we probably take for granted because they seem so basic now. As citizens, we have an agreement with our gouvernement. They protect us, allow us to live there, and they provide us with a host of goods and services in exchange for taxes. It's fair.

I don't see why btc has to be a currency. Wouldn't it be perfectly acceptable if they we just a means of investment and transferring large amounts of funds? I should mention that I earn, buy, invest, and spend btc. But it seems like we don't really know what this powerful tool to should be used for, but we know it will change the world, so we're trying to find out.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:27:49
It seems to me (a layperson in terms of programming a cryptocurrency) that it would be relatively easy to modify Bitcoin/Litecoin/etc. and release that modification (though, obviously not a few hundred dollars easy). Couldn't there even be a currency designer program where you can set the specifications you want for the currency, tell it go, and it sets everything up. I'm sure its not as simple as that, but couldn't it be?
