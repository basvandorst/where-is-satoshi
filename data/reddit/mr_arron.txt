To tax bitcoin transaction they first have to qualify it as an asset which they have not done yet. You are liable to pay tax if you earn a certain amount. The amount differentiates between states do your own research. If you cash out less than the annual minimum wage and that is your Total earnings you are exempted from tax in North America. They can't tax us but maybe we will have to back taxes. But the day they ask us for back taxes bitcoin is a legitimate asset and the price increase would be enough for you to pay them. 
Good luck.

You can use [QuadrigaCx]( autosell address and forward custom ratios to it depending on your preference....That would satisfy any autoselling, they also offer Merchant stuff and pay fast if your verified.
I'm not affiliated but its pretty much the one I've found in Canada that works ok.
You can also run a script in python using their API that can sell a part of the earnings and keep the rest in a cold wallet. **Blockchain** should lead to decentralization I encourage you to save that 1% and create sustainable systems which will *compound* and probably end up saving you a **ton**.
Good luck on your business!!

Yes you are right !! I saw the same post before posting that is a bummer indeed I wish quadriga would have let it develop more. However my solution was making a custom Python instance that would automate most of the PoS services. Look at quadrigacx APIs for reference they also provide auto sell features that enable you to basically submit post request that auto sell at the highest bid price. 
That was my whole point making a custom solution will save you a ton as all these services provide you with this same functionality as less than a 150(roughly) lines of Python. The whole point of bitcoin is to enable the individual in times like this. When you don't see a solution it doesn't cost you a whole(time+github+slack+time) lot to make one. I'll write a sample sell bot for you when I have time if you want. 
Sorry if it isnt the solution you were searching for.
