I fully agree with you (though I want the market to remain as pure as possible, i.e. no more regulation-fraud protection at most). And I will always hold/respect bitcoin for that. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how many of the new users are interested. New people see it like a swiss bank account, and I think that's a legitimate use case. But it's not what get's me out of bed. As an analogy, I like metal; the Beatles aren't really my thing.

You don't think that an anonymous payment network is valuable? Not saying that BTC is it or that it is sustainable at its current value. But that's more than funny money imo.

Yep.The Monero/BCH/ETH subs aren't in a cold sweat for this reason.  This is also top buyer central, imo.

I just tell them to all in PiggyCoin. It gets the same reaction and I get to feel like I'm giving advice.

If it makes you feel any better, it was probably $20-40k. But I agree, yikes.

Bitmex rekt is a liquidation bot. It only tracks margin calls. What you're saying might be true for CBOE (honestly, I have no idea), but this was standard margin trading on bitmex.

They do, but this wasn't a futures contract. XBTZ17 is the futures ticker
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:45
This is bitmex, not CBOE. This is not the first 1m+ liquidation on bitmex (which has been around for a long time). Bitmex closes in bitcoin exclusively (so the product is completely dissimilar). And, its not even a futures contract (XBTZ17 is the current futures ticker). 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:17:08
All rekt tweets are margin calls. The first number is quantity [in USD]. The second number is their average entry. We don't know the exact liquidation price, but you can guess from the timestamp.

More like 100x leverage is gambling.

This is a fair point. I'm probably looking at a lot of them the wrong way. That said, this guy paid $15 for a $1.66 transaction. He and his friend are the new money I was thinking about:   
Also, I just know that I wouldn't have stuck around crypto if my first experiences were with the Bitcoin platform as it currently stands. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:14:55
Not even a little bit
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:19:55
This wasn't futures though
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:28:02
OP is karma trolling with a hideously misleading title (XBTUSD isn't even their futures ticker). Nothing special happened on Bitmex today. As always, there were a lot of liquidations (both short and long) from people using ridiculously high leverage. This was a big one, but nowhere close to the biggest. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:14:11
Bitmex doesn't allow you're account to go below 0. It might not even be his whole account. There are isolated and cross margin options on Bitmex.

While this is true, they would almost certainly be buying from Coinbase. If they don't know that you can buy $10 worth of Bitcoin, do you really think that they will be tech savvy enough to transfer to GDAX to avoid fees, set up a Segwit wallet (or buy a $50 ledger?), etc? Seems like their first experience with crypto is bound to be terrible if that's the case. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:31:43
That's right. He probably lost around $24k, but might have more money in his account if he was using isolated margin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:52
Palm, Blackberry, Nokia, Motorola. Why would Bitcoin be any different? Tech moves quickly and BTC is still in its infancy. How long can it coast at the top with a bad user experience? 
Especially with new money "Hey, I just bought $5 of BTC!" posts coming in--you were actually too late. If it doubles again, maybe you'll have $10. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:05:01
Depends on the margin percentage. Bitmex allows for up to 100x margin, which gives you almost no wiggle room. Most of the rekt feed is ultra high (50-100x) margin plays.

Holy shit. I just realized that the article calling Tether the "Holy Grail of cryptocurrencies" is **not** an opinion piece, while this article is.

Overstock used to accept 40+ coins (not sure if they still do). And any vendor that uses Coinpayments.net as their payment processor accepts a ton of alts. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:49:45
Do it by sectors instead (the coin itself matters less than sector, imo). I see a couple areas where altcoins could come into play. Obviously, the sectors can overlap. 
* Anonymity
* Platform Launching
* Fast/cheap payments 
Alternatives to Bitcoin's Proof of Work formula:
* Asic Resistance 
* Proof of Stake 
* DAG
* Long term scaling (alternative approaches to what happens after all coins mined)
* Governance Systems 
More speculative categories:
* Supply Chain / Anti-fraud
* Decentralized Exchange
* Collectables/In-game credits - People really like collectables like skins and in-game credits. It's hard to pick a winner, but I would be surprised if something cool doesn't pop up in this category. 
* Internet/VPN

Exodus wallet allows you to hold both BTC and LTC (and ETH) and exchange between multiple high quality alt coins.
