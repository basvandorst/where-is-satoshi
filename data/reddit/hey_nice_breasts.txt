Couldn't the same be said about the early bitcoin miners who just let their computers run? I'm sure his process is a bit more involved than doing essentially nothing.

not a chance haha, different passwords all around.

Well yes, that is a possibility. I can't say if that's gonna happen or not. I can certainly say it's more profitable to be honest than not, I hope he continues to do good. And judging by the address from which he sent my coins back, he's doing quite alright ;)
There are definitely people in the real world who return wallets when they're lost, he just happens to be the digital equivalent.

Go ahead and search walletrecoveryservices in this subreddit and see what others have to say. Here, because you don't seem to be too much of the type to dig beneath the surface, I did it for you:

I couldn't answer that, I don't use BitcoinQT (although I have it), just Blockchain and Electrum (and Coinbase fwiw). Perhaps someone with a better understanding of debug console in BitcoinQT could answer that one.

Well certainly if I knew how to write my own script, I would have! 20% may be a lot to spend but not when a) it's your only option and b) you've already made 10 fold what you payed for the coins. I'm sorry you were ignored, I can't speak for him but I'm sure there's some explanation.

They do use very strong encryption. For his service, you give him your best idea(s) as to what your password could be. His program generates however many combinations based off that for brute force decryption. It's not as if he could just go to any old wallet and crack it.

recovering lots and lots of money for people for sure.
