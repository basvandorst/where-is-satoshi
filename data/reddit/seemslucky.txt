You like that ETH is doing better than BTC?

You are not real
I saw you write this same comment in another topic
You are a bot, probably in the service of fake booze

There are no "wallets". You're not holding the crypto. You're holding a complicated key that allows you to sign the currency over to someone else. A wallet is just storing your key. It uses that key to tell you how many coins you have access to and let's you sign them over to someone else.
As long as you have the seed words you can generate your complicated key again. Open a new wallet and put in that seed and boom, that wallet can sign the ledger for you.

I don't think you meant to respond to me. I said exactly what you said in my conversation with him. I agree with you. I would love for Bitcoin to get fixed. But, as far as I understand it the throughput is capped. So, I suppose the only thing is to fork it or switch to another coin.
I would love for Bitcoin to be fixed, but lightning network seems like a fix in the wrong direction.

He doesn't really sound like he's fear mongering. It sounds more like he's trying to remind people that there was an influx of new, uneducated adopters. And, that we shouldn't just yell "hodl" at them. But, maybe help them think critically.
But, then again, what do I know? I don't post non-stop moon/hodl memes, so I must be doing it wrong.

I'd agree with that, there's like 1200 and only about 3 or 4 are even interesting. Mostly because they're not copies. But actually bring something different.

I agree that Bitcoin was usable as a currency. At this time, it is most certainly not. Hopefully lightning network can fix it. If not, something will replace it.
And other cryptocurrencies aren't shit advice. That's like saying that Xanga was obviously the best, why would I ever use shitty MySpace and screw this Facebook thing.
Learning about things is never the wrong choice. Every. Only cults are opposed to their members learning about alternatives.

That's a weird post-masturbation thing. Using your own face to clean up. Meh, to each their own!

Everything you said makes it sound like you're following a religion. Cryptocurrency is a technology. A disruptive, amazing one. But, it's not a religion. It doesn't require your belief. But, to be better... to become what you want it to be, it does require critical thinking and scrutinization.
The new people coming here aren't joining a cult, they're investing in the most dominant cryptocurrency. They shouldn't have people just shouting "HODL!" Instead, they should be pointed in the direction of information about what crypto is, what it could be, and how it needs to improve.

No, it's diety. Deity with less calories.
Also, for some reason, my phone thinks diety is a real word.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:33:20
Who cares what he thinks? Who cares what any of them think? Just do the research, back a winner, and let the technology fight it out.
This argument is stupid. Everyone seems to think cryptos are religions and you have to pick the right diety. In the end, the consumer will choose. And the consumer always wins.

Oh, yeah. I'm subbed. I agree that they have problems. But a lot of them do, this is a marketplace that grew absurdly fast. I can't withdraw Monero from Binance (and others for a long time). Bitfinex is... yeah. Bittrex constantly gets accused of losing funds or stealing. They're all shit.
I'm just saying, Coinbase is nowhere near insolvent.

That's called being a douchebag.

I have a Ledger Nano S, it's nice. But, it's a pain if you buy more than a couple of other cryptos or if you need access to your funds often and easily. It's the most secure, though. Good for using as a "bank" of sorts.
I keep a little money in Coinomi on my phone for spending.

Uh... you didn't include any sources. I have no direction.
Also, I want to include that I think how they handled the BCH thing was shit. It wasn't insider trading, but it was shit. But, it doesn't change the fact that when I talk to people outside the crypto community, Coinbase is what the think of as where you get Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:29:10
Watch that. It's not super complex. Very informative.

The dollar is representative of a trade. Labor, goods, w/e. When I give you 10 dollars, I'm trading you my previously given labor or traded good. At the moment, bitcoin is not that. It doesn't represent any trades for goods or services. Hopefully lightning network succeeds so that Bitcoin can represent trade again.
But, the point is: the new people know none of this. They should learn about transaction fees, the lightning network, and other crypto technologies that could replace Bitcoin if it can't fix the fees.

It's really bad speculation. They are THE marketplace for people new to cryptocurrencies/Bitcoin. And, I think it's safe to say that EA, Comcast, etc. show that upset customers mean nothing when you lead a marketplace.

True, but this subreddit is like going to the BMW subreddit and constantly reading about Ford Pintos.
Have you ever heard of Frank Smith, the guy who prefers Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin? No, because no one ever makes posts about him. (Also, he's not real since I made him up.)
Just put a sticky up that says: "Buyer beware, Bitcoin.ORG is for Bitcoin and Bitcoin.COM is for Bitcoin Cash." And then never speak of him again.
