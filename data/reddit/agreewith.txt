Because that is literally WHY the U.S. Dollar is the official currency of the U.S..  You must pay taxes or you go to prison.  And you must pay taxes in U.S. Dollars...there is no other option.  That, Sir, is the definition of a fiat currency...in a nutshell.

Nope.  That is a running reddit joke.  Regional finance manager here for Fortune 500 company.  It's just one "m".  Or, usually no m's at all because it's just implied.

No, the Canadian Dollar is an official fiat currency.  Again, a bad comparison.  
Bitcoins are a "currency" in the same way that apples are a currency.  They can be traded for stuff, but they are NOT a real currency.  So, I guess you can claim you are right...both bitcoins and apples are currencies.  Good job.

So, bitcoins are more like craps chips at a casino?  No really worth anything unless people want them to be?  
Bitcoins are not a legitimate currency (i.e. fiat) because you can't pay your taxes with them.
