BTC is never stored anywhere but the blockchain.
A hard drive may contain private keys to a public key, which gives you the right to move the respective BTC
Hardware wallets like this are a safer way to handle private keys. It makes sure it never leaves the device. It's also recoverable if you lose it. 
That being said, you still need to keep safe a "seed". 24 words used to recover your private keys if you ever need it, but it's much more convenient than securing a hard drive.

We can't know for sure
But think for yourself: is there a solid reason for the sudden down trend? Did something happen that devalued bitcoin all of a sudden when a lot of new buyers are appearing each day?
Sure, I'd be naive to believe that long bear markets are long in the past; but I don't think this is it because nothing significant happened

Yeah but it's do hard to balance with fiat.
When I started on crypto I made a huge investment on bitcoin. Something like 25% of what I already had on fiat.
But it grew so much it's now the majority of my investments by far. I don't earn enough to keep up putting money on fiat investments to match bitcoin growth. I'd end up depleting my bitcoin wallet to be able balance it, so I simply don't.

I think the biggest risk is of extortion.
Keep this in mind if you leave all your BTC in a single wallet.

Double check the address you're sending. Even if you copy paste. Human error can occur
Also, your clipboard can be highjacked

I don't think you truly grasp what Bitcoin is doing to our instituted financial system
It's inevitable
The very success of Bitcoin is detrimental to banks as we know it. It is going to be a war.
People getting in Bitcoin better be prepared when that happen. That's exactly why decentralization is the most important going forward.
Exchanges are going to be targeted.
Hot wallets are going to be targeted.
Like any revolution in technology, it is going to disrupt the major players in the industry. The thing is, bitcoin is poking the money industry.

This is exactly what we should be doing.
The idea to HODL and not spend underlies the assumption that BTC will keep growing in value. I'm right there with you, folks. 
But if you're assuming that BTC will keep growing in value, you should trade fiat for BTC as soon as possible always. If you're doing that, you can purchase goods and services for BTC with basically no loss since otherwise you'd have just kept excess fiat in your bank account for spending. Sure, you would have saved on fees, but still lose value in the end for missing the BTC growth.
So instead of just holding and not spending, buy more as soon as you can, and spend it as needed.
You can save money in the end.
As a bonus: if the assumption is incorrect and things goes to shit someday, you'd still benefit from the valorization

That's just impossible to know. You can't tell how many addresses belongs to the same person and how much people "have" in exchanges.

That's exactly why I'm buying as much as I can right now. We know where this is going in a couple of years, I don't want to miss this.

The thing is... In 2011 that guy didn't pay 55000 USD for two pizzas. 
If you make this comparison then we are all eating the most expensive food in the world everyday since we could have bought bitcoin instead.
