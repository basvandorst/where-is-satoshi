Perhaps you should also strongly suggest someone check a user's profile before handing the bits off. If it is a throwaway account then the recipient won't care if he or she is publicly known or not. You are talking about giving a tenth of a bitcoin to a total stranger after all.

I feel owning one whole bitcoin is an amount large enough to justify storing it in a variety of ways, especially if you plan on increasing that amount and holding it long-term. Some could go to Coinbase and some can go in an HD wallet or two (Electrum, Amory, Bitcoin Core if you have the patience for it). Smaller amounts meant for easy spending and tipping can go in an online hot wallet or ChangeTip/Cryptiv. That way all your bases are covered and all the eggs are not in one basket.

And even this thread is unable to escape the tipping frenzy. Kudos for your attempt to address this.

I'm not sure that Bitcoin will ever be as easy to use as conventional financial services. A main premise behind the financial structure used today the tradeoff between personal control and ease of use. We *give* our money to a third party that then has complete operational control over it and trust them to give it back when we ask. In return we don't need to be hassled with storage, security and figuring out how to move it around in a convenient manner. Keeping complete personal control over money will probably always require a much greater level of personal involvement that is opposed by this fallacy of human nature.

Yes, I always find myself staring at the advertisement on the sidebar of this subreddit that says "Use Bitcoin to eat pizza tonight!" My willpower to resist is eroded just a little more each time.

My experience has certainly been a positive one; I've had the chance to see bitcoin in action as a vehicle for good. There's plenty of evidence of that just in regards to something like tipping. Take a look at a subreddit like  and you'll see the spirit of generosity I'm talking about.

@_date: 2014-10-29 21:25:35
You're right. I suppose my argument here is that the current system we use would be different and provide underlying benefits similar to those provided by the bitcoin network if people were willing to be involved with it to a greater degree rather than throw a large measure of the responsibility onto other shoulders.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:27:39
Coindesk.com does a good job staying on top of the latest bitcoin news. (I'll edit this post if I think of anything else)

This is certainly a way to generate interest by making bitcoin more "tangible". But do you feel people would be willing to put in the extra effort required to transact bitcoins once they learn how to use it?
