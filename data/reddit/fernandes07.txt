@_date: 2013-12-13 05:01:11

@_date: 2013-12-12 06:42:56
i havent posted one up yet.. but i would have to figure out a price after i see if theres any real want for it .. yeah i was thinking the same thing about the border though
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:49:20
Probs should mention this is Stainless Steel not Aluminium.. So its much stronger and engraving last forever pretty much
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:12:30

@_date: 2013-12-13 04:51:49
Hell yeah ahah
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:45:05
This gave me a idea and i made this with a laser engraving machine.. it took a few minutes designing it and about 15 mins to make...  i dunno what do u guys think
also for size here is one that i made attached to my keychain
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:18:18
Taking longer than i thought and also doing multiple sizes and different shapes
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:24:25
haha yeah well thats the plan.. but still would give people the option to pay with paypal incase they dont want to or cant pay with bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:35:17
i probably will wrap it up and chuck it in a envelope.. it wouldnt cost much hey couple bucks and probs take up to 14 days to get it 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:50:05
yeah.. id have to figure out cost and stuff.. but it shouldnt be to pricey..think id make a website for people to upload their qr codes and shipping address.. payment through bitcoins and paypal.. yeah pm me and ill figure out price
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:28:54
