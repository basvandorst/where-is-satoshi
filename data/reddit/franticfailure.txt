How is this relevant to Bitcoin?

It sounds a lot like Bitcoin to you because you hold 2 coins and want to get rich without working. 
For the 17 billion people outside this sub it doesn't sound like Bitcoin. 
Lately half this sub is filled with non Bitcoin relevant news. Just because you dream and hope doesn't magically make it relevant. 
I wish this trend would stop. It seems the lower the price goes the more desperate these kind of posts are getting.

Another non Bitcoin related post without any explanation where we have to guess what the point is. Just like the trend is lately.

So you already know you wouldn't be able to point out 1 single paid shill in this sub. Just like the 100 other people who claimed the same thing. It's always amazing to see people live in fantasy land like that.

Ah of course. Because i like to see Bitcoin relevant news here i am a buttcoiner. That's how it works right? If you don't join the circle jerk you are a buttcoiner or even better a paid banker shill.

Let me know how fast you usually are able to send bitcoins to your bank account. Then we can compare. Because right now your comparison is absolutely pointless as everyone can see. 
Edit: i just thought of something but i'm sure i'm wrong. Because that would be so extremely childish no one here would such a thing. 
For a second i thought you on purpose made a completely irrelevant comparison just to be able to start a Bitcoin circle jerk. But nah, no way you would do such a silly thing. We're grown ups here.

I so hope my friends and family never run into this sub.

So if people don't agree with you or don't like Bitcoin they deserve to get their shit hacked?
