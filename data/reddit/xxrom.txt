I am intrigued, sir! ��

\&gt; (which makes me think that you are probably a user of a major currency, probably the American dollar, am I right?) 
Euro. Do you know any major economies, where there are several currencies? Not sure how that should work.
\&gt; This is minor at a global scale, but probably enough to start a chain reaction later..
Well you probably also should mention the Silk Road or any other black market. Sure, that would work there. But people selling there still need to convert to fiat money, if their goal is to live a "normal" life - buy stuff, services, etc. So basically you're saying it's an alternative instrument for transactions, which I agree. But this is not how it can get a traction. You should think about the majority, because they are driving economy on a big scale. Not the minority.

Why python btw?
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:45:22
Why exactly do you think so?

Those stories make me think bitcoin is a new scientology or sth ��

I get the point. But currently you cannot seriously call bitcoin a currency in a broad sense. A speculative instrument maybe. 
I don't think you completely understand how economy works. Currency is a medium of exchange. If merchants won't adopt it, then why should majority of buyers bother then? Most of the people don't care about opportunities of bitcoin, they just need a medium of exchange to buy food or pay their bills. As long as their bills are requested in fiat money, they will want to earn that fiat money. So, I dont see why would anyone would make a pressure to get paid in BTC as you're saying. Or maybe I am missing something in your argument. Could you please show me a mechanism, which makes sense from the economical point of view?

That reply doesn't really address the issue. If you know sth useful, please share it :)

I think part of the problem is volatility. As a merchant I am not interested in hodling or fighting the money system. I need that money I get from you to reinvest it right away in my business. So, if you want me to accept bitcoin, I need an easy and fast way to convert it back to fiat money reliably. If I am under constant uncertainty about the rate of convertion - that is a big problem for me and I won't play along.

That is a really boring photo and story. �� No offense..

I think it's "Pad thai"

Nice art, but you shouldn't trust in the code. Its written by people, some of them are really stupid. Or dangerous ��

Cant make bling bling out of bitcoin ;)

Imho it still was a bubble, no matter what lens you choose to look at it.
@_date: 2019-01-13 11:33:38
How is that a ponzi? If anything, its a speculative bubble, which is something totally different. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:40:05
Probably an exchange point. Takes normal money and converts it to BTC
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:44:55
Yep, proven by the well known granny method.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:40:20
Well that approach is eliminating a big number of possible applications for bitcoin. Hence less audience, hence less demand for bitcoin, hence lower price. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:19:23
Thats how a bubble works, sadly

Stems from official Bloomberg news feed on instgram. Look it up

That info is very easy to validate, just learn a little bit about Google Trends
