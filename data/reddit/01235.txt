Question about Samourai Wallet: under "features"  it says "Never link previous change outputs in a transaction. " 
Obviously, users are going to have to spend change outputs at some point, so how could these outputs be spent without linking them? If you mean to say that change outputs will only be spent on their own, then what would happen if a user has enough funds to make a transaction, but all the funds are tied up in change outputs?

The chain with the most proof of work will be the post BIP 66 chain. And since BIP 66 is a soft fork and not a hard fork, blocks mined afterwards will also be valid on the old chain. So, the old chain miners will just have to deal with reorgs every time they produce invalid blocks until they upgrade, rather than actually building a separate chain like after a hard fork.

The problem is that Bitcoin's reference client has already been implemented and is running the network. Any *accurate* rigorous specification (a spec that when implemented exactly would not fork the network) would have to detail the way `bitcoind` actually performs consensus, including all "bugs" and corner cases.

Edit: I made this its own thread:
I hereby propose Simulated Reversible Transactions on an Irreversible Payment Network:
This is a protocol so that when you hit "send" in your wallet, instead of actually sending the bitcoins right away, the wallet would first send a message to the recipient that the transaction will arrive in N days. Then, if you did nothing the wallet would actually send out the bitcoins in N days. But, if there was a problem, you could "charge back" by going into your wallet, and hitting cancel. The wallet would then inform the merchant that a chargeback has taken place.
If this system was done with a multisig wallet like Green Address, then Green Address's signature could be delayed by N days. You could charge back by calling up Green Address like you would call your credit card company.
N could be adjustable based on the risk. This way using Bitcoin allows Simulated Reversible Transactions when appropriate and regular transactions when appropriate.

My question would be then what incentives miners to connect their pool sidechain to P2Pool instead of a centralized pool? 
The problem with P2Pool versus centralized pools is that P2Pool users also have to run their own nodes, which is an additional expense on a low margin business. 
I could see how the Pool Sidechains idea might solve the problem of having a P2Pool with a difficulty that is too high, but then I thought that wouldn't that relatively low hashrate pool sidechain be susceptible to 51% attacks whenever larger miners want to steal pools coins (which could then be redeemed for bitcoins)?

Absolutely. Just remove all the clutter having to do with PoW, solving the Byzantine general's problem and decentralized consensus with "one central bank, one vote" for transaction finalization. The Fed could still use ECC signatures to decide whether or not to update balances. Instead of dollar users having accounts at banks that have accounts at the fed, just let every ordinary dollar fan have an account directly at the fed. If the banks stop earning revenue for unforeseen circumstances (even by economists), the fed could still bail them out.

I guess it's simply a way to mirror the current credit card system, except Green Address would have to arbitrate a chargeback instead of the card company. I just keep reading posts about needing some consumer protection story, but I guess the commonly spelled out scenario of having the buyer, seller and escrow each having a key is the superior system, because the escrow would have more leeway in deciding exactly how to divy the payment between buyer and seller.

I do agree with you that having a slow transaction time could be bad for day to day transactions. 
In terms of market value, however, hoarders are a blessing. They reduce the supply of BTC on the market, therefore increasing its value. Having too many merchants at this early stage of the game that just immediately convert their BTC into fiat, on the other hand, drive the price of BTC down in terms of fiat.

Right on! And when grandma "sends a transaction ", instead of sending the funds right away, there should be a protocol where the wallet sends the recipient's wallet a message saying that the funds are on the way in a day or so. This emulates the "legacy" system of reversible payments, so that grandma will be able to cancel a payment after she accidentally sends to the wrong address.
And also, another open source protocol to abstract addresses altogether and allow grandma to send to a person/organization instead of an address.

In PoW, miners join large mining pools to reduce variance. In PoS, an exchange could offer to pay out 99% of the block reward to the coin holders (and take 1% in commissions ). Reduced variance would be a good incentive to keep the coins on the exchange. If the exchange then controls enough coins, it could mine multiple chains, or double spend, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:21:20
They probably wouldn't want to right now because people sending transactions would then stop overpaying. 
Otherwise, each pool could provide an API if it wanted to, and wallets could provide fee estimation by downloading data directly from the pools. There would still, however, be a problem in that pools may decide to lie, hoping people will keep overpaying, but still processing lower fee transactions.
Another idea would just be to have a server sending various types of transactions with different fees. The server would then publish the statistics on the lowest fee it was able to pay when deliberately trying to find what the lowest fee is (this avoids putting too high fees into the calculations.)

Lending money to banks for them to relend does not necessitate fractional reserve banking. I can lend money to a bank using, say a 1 year CD. This means that I lose access to the money for 1 year, but     the bank promises to return the money to me in a year with interest (which the bank earns by lending the money out). No additional money is created using this scheme.
Fractional Reserve Banking, on the other hand, is when a bank lends out new money that didn't previously exist. This new money was not previously lent out to the bank. Under this scheme, nobody loses access to money while the money is lent out, so depositors and debtors now have claims on the same funds at the same time.
See  for a much better explanation.

2 and 3 have no reason to exist if you are only dealing with coinbase. Consider the following scenario though:

* 2. Company A buys bitcoins
* 3. Company A transfers bitcoins to Company B
* 4. Company B sells bitcoins for local currency
* 5. Company B pays the merchant
where A and B don't need to be the same company. They don't even need to trust each other or be in the same country. 
Fiat only systems do not allow you to do this. As of now, I can't use google wallet to order something from someone who takes paypal.
I guess a chargeback free debit card, like iDEAL in the Netherlands, would command the same discounts though, but only if all the major banks involved in the transaction decide to sign up for such a system.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:03:44
You're right that it is complex. Obviously a third party would still have to be able to arbitrate a chargeback like the card companies do today which is neither easy nor cheap. I just keep reading different posts about needing consumer protection when paying with bitcoin, so I guess I merely showed a way to be no worse than credit cards in that regard.
On second thought, maybe this may actually be more useful as a way for people to avoid sending coins to the wrong address: by first sending the merchant a message, the merchant would then respond something like "payment pending from address X for 3 pairs of socks", your order id, amount and the shipping address. If you see that this is correct, you release the payment. If not, then you have prepared to send coins to the wrong address and can fix the sending transaction. If this sounds silly and redundant, it is, but another problem I keep reading about is people sending coins to the wrong address.

Yes I knew that 1 bit = 100 satoshis. I understand that measuring in bits is useful because it is easier to count than the equivalent in BTC: 0.000001 (or even to say 3000 bits instead of 0.003 BTC when ordering a cup of coffee.)

I don't think that fractional reserve banks can be viable long term in bitcoin. Any time there would be a financial crisis, people would immediately withdraw all their funds from the bank in cash (real bitcoins), an event also known as a bank run. Depositors at different banks, after hearing about what happened at their friends banks will then try to withdraw all of their funds from their banks as well (and with bitcoin, you don't even have to go to a bank, you can withdraw your cash on the internet). Without a government that can issue additional currency to back them up, the only banks that will survive will be banks that have either full or near full reserves. 
Also, full reserve banks could try to steal customers from fractional reserve banks by scaring people into withdrawing their funds. They could advertise that they have full reserve and that they do cryptographic proofs of reserves and could run commercials challenging other banks to do the same. People who own real bitcoins have an incentive to deter people away from fractional reserve banks because it would make their real bitcoins more valuable.
tl;dr there is reason to believe that fractional reserve banks will not survive under a system with: cash as easy to withdraw as making a normal bank transfer, cryptographic proofs of reserves, and no arbitrary costless issuing of new cash.

On second thought, yours is the better solution because the escrow would have more leeway to divide the payment between buyer and seller while Green Address (in the scenario I created above) could only either cancel the whole payment or send all the funds to the seller. 
My solution may actually be more fitting to a different problem: that of sending coins to the wrong address. Upon receipt of the message, the merchant could reply "payment pending for Order X, for two pairs of socks, 1000 bits". If you receive the message with the correct details, then you could release the funds and the merchant could start fulfilling the order. If not, then you could still cancel the transaction from your wallet.

In a traditional bank, people hold demand deposits/current accounts, which give the right to a depositor to withdraw his funds as cash/M1 at any time. Using traditional currencies, people tend to withdraw only small amounts of cash because it is generally more convenient for a payor to simply direct his bank to transfer its IOU to a payee (such as with a cheque).
Changing the rules so that making payments by cash is easier than using a cheque would probably mean that people would withdraw and use cash more often. This would incentivise banks to accumulate enough reserves to cover a much larger portion of their assets than under a traditional system due to the need to satisfy more depositors withdrawing cash. And since banks now wish to have a larger percentage of their assets backed by reserves, they would be likely to create fewer liabilities as compared to the traditional system. Fewer liabilities being created by banks is something that can stop the increase in the money supply.

51% of miners could choose to not build on top of blocks created by miners not advertising they we're running XT. Quickly the 51% of miners will create a new longest chain with only their own blocks. Then the "implement big blocks" algorithm will look at the last few blocks seeing 100% of them advertising big blocks.

Right now, much of the ecosystem depends on zero confirmation transactions not being double spent.

And we know this will happen eventually due to fee incentives and miners' self interest. Rather than wait to have this happen by surprise, we should schedule a time for mining pools to adopt full RBF so that the ecosystem has time to prepare in advance.
