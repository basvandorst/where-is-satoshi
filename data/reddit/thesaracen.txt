It's not just XKCD.
The point is that everyone who knows about TrueCrypt (and you can pretty much guarantee that all law enforcement agencies of state level or higher know about TrueCrypt) also knows about the Hidden Volume capability. That pretty much sets the default assumption as being that you *have* a hidden volume, and the password for that would be demanded as well.

Gimme your password.
Now gimme your other password.
What other passwords to you have?

The real question is: how many RasPis would you have to Beowulf together before you got a decent mining rig? ;)
Probably so many that a single Radeon would be cheaper, but it's a neat thought.

You know you're dedicated when you need 3-phase power.

How does the network tell which transactions have been "claimed?"

Can this moron have your coins?

Sorry, I don't have the answer to that. I've got a reasonably clear idea of how Bitcoin works on a technical level, but market stuff is scary hoodoo.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:45:52
What I mean is that your wallet doesn't contain the coins at all. The "coins" are just the end result of the network tallying up all transactions that involve a particular public key (address) and agreeing on the amount.
The wallet file only contains pairs of public and private keys. The public key is the "address" that you can send coins to. The private key is the secret "passphrase" that allows you to create a transaction outgoing "from" a corresponding "address".
Edit to answer the rest of your post: You can't feasibly calculate the private key from the public key. The private key gets generated first, and the public key is derived from that using complicated one-way maths. Trying to figure out the private key that corresponds to a specific public key can only be done via brute-force, and would take longer than the current age of the universe.
The private keys are usually generated randomly by the Bitcoin client software, so most people don't write them down elsewhere. The exception to this is "brain wallets" I think, but these aren't especially safe. The usual way to back up a wallet is to either make a copy somewhere else (which OP did not do), or print out a paper wallet (a pair of QR codes, which OP also presumably did not do).

I swear, people talk about Nakamoto like he's Hari Seldon or something.

Any further detail on this? Brand/model etc?

Android apps are *written* in Java but I was under the impression that they're compiled into proper machine code instead of Java's bytecode. The name "Dalvik" is coming to mind.
The point being that you can't decompilation of an Android app becomes as problematic as decompiling something written in C/++.

Oh, and for those who still think open source is the great panacea of code review, check out this advisory for a memory corruption issue that went undetected for TWENTY FUCKING YEARS
@_date: 2013-10-10 07:23:43
It's public source, which as far as most people are concerned is the same thing as open source.
Those who care enough to quibble about the difference are...a different breed :-)

When Steve Jobs launched the iPad he kept referring to it as "this magical device." He'd spent decades cultivating a customer base of technological illiterates, and he was targetting them very carefully with that presentation. It wasn't about the CPU speed or amount or RAM or operating system capabilities or any other critical details*, it was all about getting the monkeys to stare at the "magical device."
Leaving aside my persion opinions of that kind of marketing strategy, I think Bitcoin can't yet afford the luxury. I think it still requires just that little bit too much technical aptitude for the general iPad\*\* crowd to be able to use competently, particularly while people are still trying to figure out how to secure their wallets and exchange accounts (maybe I'm conflating two different issues there but you get my point).
If too many people are conditioned to think of it from the start as "magical Internet money" we run the risk of large swathes of people taking it at face value, diving in, doing something stupid (e.g. password 123456), getting burned straight away and souring on the whole system (because anybody dumb enough to use that kind of password is going to be dumb enough to blame the system for their own shortcomings). And tell their friends about the "magic Internet money **scam**."
Basically I think too many people still need to have their hands held before they can use Bitcoin safely and responsibly, for this to be their introduction to it. The original "magic Internet money" ad felt to me as though it was just a fun gag intended for the "in" crowd. I think it's a bad strategy to use long-term.
\* He did have the advantage of it being the first device of its kind with no competitor for people to measure its tech specs against, but that's not the point
\*\* The existance of iPad Bitcoin apps notwithstanding
**TL;DR** As long as we still have to explain on a daily basis what makes a sufficiently secure password for Bitcoin use, we're not yet ready to be marketing to non-tech people.

They're still "there", but they're assigned to an address for which nobody has the private key.
It's theoretically possible for someone to serendipitously generate that private key for themselves and discover they have 7500BTC waiting for them, but it's highly improbable.

Queensland Police Service aren't well known for being tech savvy. A couple of years ago they sent the paedo-squad to storm the home of an elderly man (LiveLeak user Biggles9) simply because he posted a video of a Russian circus performer swinging his baby around by the arms.
