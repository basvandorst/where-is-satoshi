Ok, SpyHunter 4 has found 2 threats called "startsear.ch Hijacker" and "PUP.DuckDuckGo". 
The description doesnt fit exactly, but hopefuly this is it. I will try to get rid of it now. Im still really unsure about logging in etc since Im not really sure I dont have anything more infected in my computer though...
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:33:58
Yep, trojan, watch out...

This email box kinda sucks, It doesnt have any possibility to check the access history nor 2FA...:/ 
I will run some malware remowal tools and scanners as requested and we will see...Thanks btw ;)

Access denied? Am I the only one?

I only logged in on phone today on public wifi, at school.
Thanks for tips, Malwarebytes is working.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:38:29
Ok, sounds reasonable, thank you

This guy just returned all people's money...

"...but thank you!"

I believe your CC should work with Circle, I'm from Europe and it works just fine for me. Try it.

HAHA YEAAAH :D

Ok, 11 threats were found, but completely different than SpyHunter ones. I dont think any of them was the matter but i have now deleted all of them. I will scan again tommorow and will see. Thank you very much though!
Update: MalwareBytes didnt found anything today, but Im sure there is still something in my PC. Some random ad tabs pop up, browser is much slower, etc...I will try to run some more anti-malwares...

I'm just as happy as you are but I don't trust his BS...He just got scared I guess. We will see...! :)
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:50:17
yeah, i think its available for US people only or smth...:/
@_date: 2014-03-30 09:10:47
I just ordered one from bit-card.de
Not so nerdy I would say, cool looking and especially the encrypted one is pretty safe too.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:35:02
I dont :/ I will just have to believe the buyer now..I contacted the support too though
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:57:22
It was worth around 320 dollars, i doubt he would be so nice...now he turned unresponsive..
And if he would just withdraw it then i guess there is no way their stuff could do anything, right? :/
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:49:31
1. Yes
2. Depends on the price and location, but usually atleast 2 per day
3. Im not sure but I think its 0,4
