There are other ways to attack the production of very dangerous drugs and human slavery.  
  
The truth is that that's way down at the list of priorities of many governments. Realistically the main use of military and police is protection of lives and private property of politicians and businessmen. 
  
I am not and never will be comfortable with rogue government preventing whistleblowers and activists from surviving by 'disabling' their ability to buy and sell.

Good. I don't see a way to use those laws to instantly shut down any future "dangerous" opposition activists .  
  
I am not from USA and as I said, the main use of police today is protection of CEOs' lives and their stolen property. Anything that could improve the lives of low-income households is done half-assed.  
  
I can't believe you are comfortable with the ability to immediately freeze the bank accounts of protesters and whistleblowers in the corrupt society.
  
  
Many governments are in bed with multinational corporations and you trust them not to use centrally controlled currency to crack down on dissent. Now that's naive.
