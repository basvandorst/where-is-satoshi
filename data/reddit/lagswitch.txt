If anything spelled the end of bitcoin long term, it was the 2+ years stalled followed by endless bickering

Coinbase is the first time I've seen BCH as green.  I've always seen it as the B angled the other direction with the rectangle around the circle (to look like a dollar bill)

If I remember correctly, even Bitcoin was at risk a few years ago when one of the mining pools got too large. On this very subreddit there were posts for days about them having like 48% or 49% of the network's hashrate.

Not the person you responded too, but I've got a few questions regarding the channels and relaying.  A friend tried to explain LN to me a few months ago, but I'm not sure I understand it completely.
So if A and B have a channel between them and B also has a channel with C, then A can do transactions with C without having to open a channel?  When these channels close, all the transactions between the parties will result in 2 on-chain transactions (1 per channel)? Is it true that the size of a channel limits the net transaction between the parities?

You should have called in.  I'm sure he would have *loved* to hear your opinion.

I thought that the US government or at least the IRS said that bitcoin will be treated as property rather than currency.  Does this change anything?

There was a good amount of anticipation, at least for me when Lyft announced that they would be coming to Rochester.

Sites that give out free BTC for clicking buttons/viewing advertisements every so often. When BTC was younger, they were more generous (in terms of the amount of BTC they handed out).  IIRC they were more of a "get started with bitcoin" type deal.

Thank you, for the info.
I was looking into this deal specifically:

If they had full time jobs prior to getting called in for jury duty, do they get paid by that employer while they are on leave?  How does that work?

Honestly didn't know.
 


Do BTU devs have anything agaisnt working with Core (in a scenario where they "lose")? Would Core devs allow it?

Which I guess is why I had always assumed they'd work together to keep bitcoin alive no matter which solution.

Care to explain why you think that?  
Both subs just love to trash each other and it is very rare to see actual discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:22:07
Probably referring to the white paper
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:46:23
I don't follow the bitcoin scaling controversy that closely, but I ways always under the impression that whichever option ends up "winning", the developers from the other proposed ideas would still help out with development.  People are obviously passionate about bitcoin, so I had assumed they would want to help ensure the future of bitcoin no matter what (even if they "lose").
Is this not the case?
This tweet (and a few other things I've seen) seem to make it into a "who's better/smarter" argument, rather than a "what's best for the future of bitcoin" argument.

While I understand that this is a result of ever-increasing block sizes, doesn't the increase in network difficulty do something similar?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but as network difficulty increases, those with lower hashrates (lower investment) will see less and less profit and eventually leave the market. That leaves us with less decentralization and an inherently weaker network, right?

Reading comments in this thread alone would lead me to believe most don't actually believe in the idea of cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based technologies.  They just believe in bitcoin.

Wow all these responses don't actually answer the question. Now I'm not the most knowledgeable person here, but apparently I'm the least biased. 
Last year there was a fork of the Bitcoin code &amp; *network. I believe it all started with a debate about how to scale Bitcoin to handle more users/transactions. 
What is now BCH (usually called Bitcoin Cash) is the fork that implements adjustable block sizes (fitting more transactions in a block is the idea). Supporters of BCH attempt to just call it Bitcoin because they believe it is closer to the "vision" laid out by the whitepaper. The company pushing BCH the most is BitMain, a company that sells ASICs for mining. Their hardware uses has a patented tech called ASICBoost.  Reddit discussion for BCH is mainly found at r\btc.
BTC (Bitcoin) is the other part of the fork (I believe BTC is technically a continuation of the original). It implements SegWit (segregated witness) which changes what data is stored in a block. This change gets rid of (fixes) transaction malleability, which makes ASICBoost no longer work. SegWir also increases the number of transactions that can fit in a block. ~~SegWit is also needed (?) for Lighting Network.~~ *Not having to deal with transaction malleability makes implementing Lightning Network easier/simpler. Lightning Network is a 2nd layer solution for scaling. The idea is that most transactions (especially ones between parties that move money frequently) are handled by channels between users and are not directly on the blockchain. The net of all those transactions show up on the blockchain when the channel is eventually closed. BTC is supported heavily by BlockStream. Reddit discussion for BTC is mainly found here, at r\bitcoin.

I believe Chrome and the Apple App Store came out about the same time as Satoshi's white paper, if not sooner.
