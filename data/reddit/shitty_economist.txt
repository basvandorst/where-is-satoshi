So you're buying 2 grams of hash?  Don't forget to consider shipping costs. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:17:27
No because we say so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:01
Has your internet speed increase in the last decade, has you hard drive size increased? Why can't your blocksize be expected to be increased at all? The tech used to propagate and store the blockchain is only getting better. 1mb blocks are just mad.

How is it market manipulation bud?

I am a big blocker so I guess that makes me an BCH supporter nowadays. But really I'm more of an ETH guy. It's good to have a diversity of opinion though. Calling me a troll isn't an argument
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:55
Oh you're right my bad I didn't mean to ask questions to make this sub think.... I'll excuse myself
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:20
It's a Fork they can name it however they please, if I remember correctly it was this very same community that supported "Ethereum Classic" even some core devs did... They didn't complain about that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:51
Lol you're so clever lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:44:17
Are you trying to flatter me? I don't deserve to be compared to Ver. He's done more for Bitcoin than most of you ever will. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:01:29
well it wasn't to obtain some kind of credibility, but more because he called me retarded so what was I going to say?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:48
Like that wouldn't have been possible if they announced it early. No matter how they did ot, they would have advanced knowledge that would influence the price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:42
You're holding the bag mate. It's the slow high fee coin you seem to worship
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:15:26
They don't want a fight/ competition, that's why they're mad 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:48:17
My shitonomics degree tell me 1mb blocks are the best, for reasons and lightning will solve all your reasons against it so yeah man. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:10:44
some of us have been waiting a little too long for the promised messia... i mean promised lightning network that will magically fix everything.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:05:22
damn we really do need all those Ethiopian nodes to decentralization... what am i thinking 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:34
You're so clever
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:24
Been around since early 2013, they aren't crazy over there. The blocksize being increased is an easy instant way to increase Bitcoin useability and speed/ reduce fees but core refused to implement it. There's no downside at all
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:23:24
Lightning is like a band-aid on a gunshot wound. It's not the promised Messiah of low fees and fast transactions for everyone. We have a solution now that is proven to work, why not increase block size?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:58:33
As if bitcoin hasn't become a cult following of Core....
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:58:35
its actually called E-Classic /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:57
Or perhaps it's money you can move is money, if you can't move it it's worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:25:59
Lol you probably bought in btc at 5k+, I think you're just trying to avoid cognitive dissonance. At Least I'm a rich retard.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:21:24
But... but... how will I lightning network without a centralized entity :0
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:51:46
Me neither but I like it. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:24:28
If they go to a 2mb fork they are directly contradicting themselves when they said it wasn't possible to increase block size. There are great developers working on other forks who are not actively lying to us.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:29:14
That was a beautiful day, I remember the sell wall at $300 USD like it was yesterday...
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:38:50
Developing world transactions are spam because they don't want to pay the transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:22:03
Yeah quick as in a majority of the hash power is supporting a proposal almost 2 weeks before August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:44:27
As mostly an eth guy, I'm glad Bitcoin got this sorted quick
