Provinces and territories supported: All (Canadians residing abroad also eligible).  
Payment provider: Vogogo  
Fiat deposit options and pricing: Interac and EFT, free until March 1, 2016. 1% deposit fee after March 1, 2016 ($10 CAD min and $50 CAD max for both Interac and EFT).  
Fiat withdrawal options and pricing: EFT only (through Vogogo), $10 CAD flat.  
Exchange pricing: Maker-taker model with trade fees ranging from 0% to 0.26%.  
This has to be a massive typo, $50 max fiat deposit? wtf?

They won't ever do this because they can't pull funds from your bitcoin wallet if you vomit in someone's car or leave the driver waiting and they cancel to collect their $5. And the argument of Bitcoin primary method, back up CC makes the Bitcoin part trivial.

If you dispute a charge with your CC and not Uber they ban you. I'm not sure how you've been able to do so multiple times, if you dispute with Uber they usually credit your account.
