As someone who is into crypto but not super techy this sounds a bit complicated but achievable. To your average Joe I worry this is borderline witchcraft.

Yeh but the other guy said he read a wiki about it so he must be correct on this /s

I was in Bolivia at the time of the election and subsequent protests last month and it's a terrible example for what you are describing. Morales went against the constitution when he had a third term (after losing a referendum that would allow him to run and staying in power anyway). He then ran for a fourth time and the election audit found significant deficiencies. Everyone I met there was entirely fed up with him, mass daily protests in La Paz.

I agree that prices can be inflated, but I think that substantial purchases (house/car) would still be well out of reach for most buyers without debt. Ultimately this wouldn't lead to car manufacturers reducing their price to $1000 so everyone can buy a car, they would just stop producing more expensive cars altogether. A limited market where everything is cheap would stifle innovation for better/faster/more efficient cars.
Then again I'm probably biased as I don't see a problem with borrowing against my future earnings (e.g. mortgages). I only have a problem if debt becomes unsustainable (which it has on a global scale but not a personal scale for me).
