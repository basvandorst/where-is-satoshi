It works out in my favor because I am paid in USD but need RMB for living and Bitcoin RMB prices are generally higher than the purchase price in USD. Not to mention I skip the bank fees which can be pretty nasty for atm withdrawals here.  If I was to use the atm directly bank of america takes a fee for the international transaction, they give me a shit exchange rate, and if I use a bank other than China construction bank the chinese bank will also take a fee for using the atm. However when using Bitcoin, I have little to no fees plus a much higher exchange rate. I'd say it probably saves me about 10% but that's a rough estimation. It would also work great the other direction because to send usd from a chinese bank you get hit heavy with fees and you have a limit to how much you can send per year but I never had to go in that direction so I can't say how worthwhile it would be.

Alipay acts as its own bank a lot of times, for example you can deposit money into alipay and get interest returned to you considerably higher than any chinese bank might offer. Alibaba is a monstrosity of a company when you look at just how much they own when it comes to chinese e commerce and it does not stop there.

Although not official it's speculated someone in the government wants to keep Bitcoin active in China. With the chinese government cracking down on every obscure means to stop capital flight it seems like a pretty large oversight to just bypass Bitcoin.

Although I do agree with that the difference between running a store and a bank is that things at the store are not necessary for everyday life. Having a bank account is pretty damn important unless you are living off the grid and even then getting things done 100% on your own without the assistance of others can be a real nightmare when it comes to financial transactions. Banks make enough on these low income accounts with overdraft protection fees and a policy should be in place forcing them to take one for the team.

I can relate to this as I buy Bitcoin both for a community I run and for personal investing. If you have money you can afford to lose just buy it and don't think about if its going to go up or down. Buy it and wait and see what happens. Even at buying 15k you still made some money and if you bought at 19k, it will still probably go back to those heights at some point.

As a faucet operator, I think its worth noting that for some countries the faucet are sustainable for living. That being said I found the article itself to be a little mis leading. Google has nothing against faucets themselves but a select few have tried to break the terms and conditions by either placing too many ads on a page or by trying to enduce clicks with shady javascript. Both of these are highly frowned upon by google.  Also the article writer is risking his own adsense account by posting his earnings as thats against the terms and conditions of adsense as well.

As an expat living in china and someone who uses houbi I have not heard so much chatter about the exchanges being goxxed pretty much everyone is concerned that their bitcoins are going to be permanently stuck in the exchanges with no chance of withdrawing. It's going to end up causing a bag holder effect because if you can't remove the bitcoin the only option to ever get value out would be to sell in withdrawal and im pretty sure no one is going to be adding money into the exchange to buy up all those coins that can't be moved out. 
fiat withdrawals still work fine as I still use bitcoin to circumvent banking atm fees by simply purchasing in the states and selling on houbi for rmb. However as of late I have been selling just on localbitcoins because I can get a pretty large increase on the bitcoin rate and the money is instantly delivered via wechat easily. 
I also doubt its a goxx situation because all of the big exchanges here are in the same stance that PBOC has thrown the book at them and they are forced to try and comply with probably extremely unrealistic anti money laundering rules which are more to prevent capital flight.
Predictions on localbitcoins receiving the great firewall treatment will probably result within a few months as more and more people start using it here.

careful with using a credit card, a lot of cards have been treating Bitcoin as money which generally has a much higher interest rate. I had a friend who purchased through a company using a capone card and they treated the purchase as  a cash advance. I am sure it depends which company you use and which card you use but it is a word of warning.

depends on what your card considers the merchant transaction to be. Out of experience I bought some bitcoin on circle with a credit card and the card did consider it a cash advance so you need to be very careful on that.

Snapcard offers Daily instant buys
$50 - for tier 2 verification
$250 - for tier 3 verification (tier 3 requires 60 days of good account standing)
To use either you still need to perform an instant buy verification which requires Fill out Credit Card authorization form &amp; take a phpto with you holding said form.
Maybe a few more hoops than coinbase but it works pretty well.

snapcard made changes to how the transfer system worked recently, it does not matter which one you send to but I believe when sending to an external address the tx fee is automatically calculated in the conversion rather then taking out when sending from the snapcard internal wallet.

Probably not, This time of year is always intense in china due to the political meetings that occur but things always ease up afterwords. This is always the policy of china.
For example people under 18 are not allowed to play in internet cafe's in china. all internet cafes have a few spare ID cards for kids that want to play, This is technically illegal but is just overlooked.  This rule becomes extremely strict during the high school entrance exam periods of year where the government wants kids home studying. Many internet cafes outright close or set a curfew to ensure rule following but if you get caught with an underage user during this time you might as well kiss your internet cafe license goodbye.

With a VPN yes, localbitcoins uses cloudflair which inherently blocks all Chinese traffic. Intentional or not cloudflair requests you to solve a captcha from time to time and the captcha provider is from google, because the google.com domain is blocked in china you cannot load the captcha and therefore cannot enter the site without a vpn.
The same can be said for site owners who use google to load javascript libraries, if you do so your site will look like absolute shit and probably not function to the typical Chinese user.

I would like to raise the argument that if this is money you are depending on you should not dump it all into Bitcoin. The first being security Unless you are absolutely certain you can keep your coins secure you are putting your retirement money at risk. The second is Bitcoin is young noone knows what the government is going to end up doing about it (inb4 the people say nothing can be done) you will still probably need fiat for everyday things have you considered if the government prevents all banks from accepting funds from Bitcoin activities and you will be pretty much forced to do pretty much localbitcoins under the radar.
However if this is extra income and you are not at risk of putting your retirement at stake absolutely go for it.

I'm in china but I wouldn't call Bitcoin the talk of the town by any means, My friends have all heard of it but most people have a negative view of it the government has done a good job portraying it as a "Fake stock market backed by nothing". However the huge draw to it of course is the potential gains.  A lot of bitcoin scams have also popped up around here "Cloud Mining Investments" ect.  All in all I think it's going to be a long time before it ever really catches on here because of the lack of government support and especially when china already has easy online payment methods such as wechat and alipay, plus is largely still a cash based society. However if you are looking for places to discuss you can always find an active QQ channel. searching Bitcoin and BTC in baidu gets mixed results as the word is technically censored you can see evidence in this by trying to search either term in 1688 or taobao.
