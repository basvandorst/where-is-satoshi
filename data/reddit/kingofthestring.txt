If you use an exchange site like Coinbase, then you have to pay a 1% fee to deposit and the same for a withdrawal fee. If that's what you meant by one time fee, then I apologize. But converting $2K USD to ~2.5 BTC costs $20 and then back to cash should you choose to immediately will cost another $20. So depending on how much money we're dealing with, it varies. I know if you're investing with a online brokerage account (e.g. Sharebuilder, E-Trade, etc.), you pay only a flat fee of $8 or so whether you're investing $100 or $10,000. Taxes are an entire separate matter though. But if Bitcoin does indeed gain enough traction to become a truly widespread currency, then we can indeed start to see some taxes on it which will make the 1% fees look like nothing.

Buffet is one of the biggest single investors in banks. Of course he has no interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed.

Unfortunately, it's going to be practically impossible to get your BTC back unless you actually manage to scare him like another poster said. Best thing you can do is secure yourself better in the future and constantly scan your PC.

Exactly, this is definitely not a SRS, but rather more of a voluntary response sample, so this is plagued by response bias and provides some extremely flawed statistics. Anyone taking this seriously should take a minute to read how they actually conducted this survey.

I know we're all in for optimism and such but please, there's a limit.

You're asking r/bitcoin, where most people hold BTC and expect long term growth, if they think a crash is coming? The response is expected.

Doubt it, especially with the Chinese New Year coming up.
