Wait a minute. We have a lot of antibiotics for viruses. They are called antiviral medication. Aciclovir, Ganciclovir, Oseltamivir, Foscarnet, Zanamivir, Lamivudin, Entecavir, Adefovir and even medications against HIV (HAART).
I don’t know about this DRACO project, but it sounds like nothing new. However, I’m not in any way discouraging the Pineapple foundation from from financing medical research. I recommend some antibiotic or cancer research or maybe research for treatment of some rare disease which usually get less funding.

Damn. It is like lottery. But my address only matches in first number. Everything other is different :D
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:35:20
Hey, i am grateful for whatever you gave me :D
@_date: 2014-05-24 06:36:33
Yeah, it would definitely be connected with [Google Wallet](
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:14:37
Sadly I don't have time now to study how to protect my wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:36:24
Thank you! :D

The question is, how long will the rectum stay unused?

Remember 1000 Satoshi is not the only fee. Besides to that you have miners' fees. May add up to a bit more than $0.0065, but still quite cheap for most of the users.

I have already made the copies of all of the keys and I'm flying to the states to find that Toyota car, parked in front of your house. Seriously?!

The one pictured on the link is connected to [Bitchest.me]( microwallet. When you get 6000 satoshis, you get paid to your BTC Address. Considering the fact that some faucets pay 300 or even 500 satoshie, you can achieve the payout goal daily.
@_date: 2014-05-30 08:21:40
Let's get lucky :D
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:00:22
Good point.
@_date: 2014-06-10 20:19:11
If it comforts you - last week someone sent 800 BTC to a wrong address.
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:51:57
If it says this is your address it means you can top up your wallet by sending founds to that address.

Am I the only one who hates these kind of submissions. I mean, couldn't we all go and check the graph ourselves. Or are some people just to lazy.
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:03:14
I would find them very useful...
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:18:33
Hate to say that you are a copy-cat. [This guy]( was the first one to put old ASIC  USB miners to good use - as a keychain.

@_date: 2014-05-28 20:39:05
Can I ask you, what is your profession. Because, whatever it is, I would like to do it to if you are getting paid 30BTC on a single prokect :-)
I know I am not really helping you out, but I wish you luck.
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:41:47
1Đ =  1Đ. Bitcoin equivalent is: "To the moon." I guess...
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:35:06
Yeah. This is not a google search. It's Google Trend. Not the same.

You're saying that 1kg of silver is only $660.
Edit: Checked out the prices. Wow, I thought it was like 10 times higher price :D

We are living the future - today.
Better said.

2%. But considering to make a purchase, so after this it would be 40%.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:30:59
I don't think that's the case here. Because the kind of captcha repeats itself and it is not even complicated to solve. Therefore, i think it is there only to prevent bots from demanding those 33 satoshis :D
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:08:29
Rule N°1 I learned on this sub: "Bitcoin users don't trust banks, not even the safety vaults!"
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:23:10
Watch out! We have a Reddit spelling bot over here.
P.S. Just kidding. It's **definitely** good that you've pointed it out.
@_date: 2014-08-12 09:29:08
You've gone to far this time.
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:34:51
Damn finals. I had to be sleeping, since I had been writing my final exams earlier today. Time difference between USA and Europe really sucks!
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:10:00
I clicked on perferences in 1 second after seeing this. Then I came and read the comments :D
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:33:39
Woow. To be honest i didn't expect any tip, since this is my very first link post on reddit :D Turns out that redditors are very generous :D So, now i don't have to solve Captchas any more :D

In Slovenia (next to Italy) I think the upper limit is 400 €. One cannot pay a bill over this sum in cash.
But still. I think mafia doesn't give out receipts and stuff :D

Also would appreciate a short description or link, to a site that describes how to check the passphrase and private key compatibility for the paper wallet, as I'm a complete noob regarding the paper wallets :D
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:04:26
I don't really know how to check the password, BUT.
I think I might know the answer.
Try: CLINTEASTWOOD or CLinteastwood
You had your Caps Lock on, that's why you wrote "CL" besides as a clue.
It might not be it, but it's worth a try.

I'm fairly new myself, but I know two things:
- It's never to late to join the Bitcoin bandwagon! Each time I tell myself "I won't buy now, since the price is high now" and each time I regret it, since it goes even higher after that.
- 2nd message: Don't invest more than you are prepared to lose. It's a high risk investment.
- Oh and third: Secure your wallet and store your private keys (otherwise your drive breaks down and you can say bye bye to your Bitcoins!)

TIL there is one Bitcoin adress that has aproximatly 180059 BTC.
"There are 1 addresses with more than 180059 bitcoins, totalling 180059 bitcoins, 1.30% of all bitcoins."
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:33:57
Anyone else getting site unreachable error on Kraken when prices of BTC change drastically? I mean I've lost quite a few euros because of this. I don't like Kraken that much any more!
