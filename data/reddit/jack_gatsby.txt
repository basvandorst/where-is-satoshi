People have been killing BTC since forever. The golden rule is to never invest what you can’t afford to lose. Those who do are the panic sellers. I’d still be in the Hodl Mode even if BTC went back to $300 - 400 range which I can’t see happening.

If the price of BTC goes up then you just have to pay less BTC for the same amount next time you go to buy the diapers.

End game is to let BTC reach its full potential. We are only just going mainstream, I think there are much better days ahead &amp; selling at 20k would be a mistake like selling at 2k was for many many I know who were hodling since $300/- you bet they’re kicking themselves.

BS i would never ever do that, Ukranians have already got A LOT of funding from the exiled Olegarchs of Russia. West is in bed with these oligharchs who are hell bent at removing any pro-Russian government in the country. Orange revolution was the brain child of Boris Berezovsky once the king maker of Russia and at the time was living in the UK. He recently hung himself. West wants their man in power so that they could squeeze Russia. Imagine what we would do if Russia was trying to install a pro-Russian government in Mexico or Canada?

Had we not bailed out the banks the whole financial system would've crashed. Millions would've lost homes/jobs, funding to your local school would've been cut it might have even closed leaving millions of children out of school. Insurance companies would've gone bust with the banks and then no medical insurance for anyone. How is it a good idea to let every major bank fail which holds everyone's money what about those people? That would include all of us.

We don't want what our government does with banksters, bailing them out so they could live to fuck us another day!

I either use paypal to withdraw or PM
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:19:01
MT Gox was in trouble long before this blunder, people had trouble withdrawing USD from Gox for a while  and Gox claimed Fed investigations etc for the delays but very recently on 7th (I think) they announced now users couldn't even withdraw BTC bcz of BS they have made up. They are just stalling users, they haven't even bothered showing they even have the BTC in question by doing an internal transaction between two of their wallets whcih everyone could then verify from the blockchain. All this has sent panic waves around the world so the panic sell and the sharp price drop.
Gox is finished and most likely all those with account there are going to lose big time. 
These are tuff times but hold on to ur pants no one said ride to da moOoOn will be flawless. It will recover dont worry :)

@_date: 2014-02-25 10:33:18
This is a good thing, there should be no doubt that BTC/LTC will recover because its just one company going bust it would've been a disaster if there was something wrong with btc itself but thats not the case. Gox is dead we will be over it in a few weeks then I see a bright future as the system would've shown the world its much more resilient hence gaining trust from big financial institutions which could ultimately put BTC $2500 &amp; LTC $150-200 by the end of this year! 
Plankton is so cheap these days ;)
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:05:18
We are not trying to manipulate the markets, just opening people's eyes to what is obvious that Gox IS insolvent. Everything they have done so far points to it. People don't wanna believe it and still feel that everything will be alright. It won't be I can guarantee you, I wont give anyone false hope by pretending otherwise.
Gox could've shown us they still have the BTC in question by transferring them internally between two wallets and we could all have confirmed it on the block chain, well how hard is that? They did it before then why not now!? Because there is nothing left and now their twitter is dead if you still think that everything will be alright then I can only laught at you and others like you. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:34:49
That’s just dumb! Greed is never good, remember all the greedy ones went to Gox because it was $100 higher than any other exchange. To someone with a brain that in itself was a MASSIVE red flag. I gotta better idea for your $100…… flush it down the toilet at least it won’t go to Gox
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:50:42

You are hopless! You STILL believe in them!? Its people like you who get ripped off and then cry on forums. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:11:25
BS! Since 2013 there was a problem withdrawing USD and you had to be absolutely brain dead not to realise Gox was a sinking ship but still no people stuck with them and now they are moaning about it on forums. Use your brain people its there for a reason! 
You won't get a single dime from Gox.

**"Federal agents concluded that Bitcoin would likely continue to attract cyber criminals needing to launder money and fund illicit organizations-such as terrorist groups"**
Only If terrorists had broadband in their caves and a brain to use BTC/LTC

Mix of BTC &amp; LTC.... now would be a good time to get some bits. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:58:08
3 weeks BTC $890-950 and LTC $50i can write it down on the fucking blockchain we are going up!

Gox is dragging everything with it, there is so much good news which is being drowned by Gox e.g Second Market will launch US exchange for big companies to trade bitcoins in summer. Had it not been for Gox this news was enough to take us back to $1000/BTC. Gox should die asap!

U r right. Expensive but imo worth it. I bought macbook in 05 (my first mac) for £1000 and to date there hasn't been any problem. Not even a single reinstall of OSX in all those years!
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:59:13
Yeah… cool story bro

Join btc-e I switch from gox to a while back when I noticed the lag in USD withdrawal. Didn't sell but moved my coins.

Pause for a second and think would you buy a company which just went bust taking with it millions of dollars and trust of hundreds of thousands? would you? unless your brain dead you wouldn’t and therre is your answer. Even if IF IF &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I F&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; (no chance) it does come back who would trade on it? would you? again you have your answer. Who the hell told you to put your coins in an online exchange? it goes against everything btc stands for i mean you don’t need a bank for it you can have it with you on paper wallet if your lazy atleast on your pc, if you are dumbass then an online exchange. stop dreaming your and everyone else who lost coins there coins are GONE and this is a lesson for us all that never EVER EVER EVER trust online exchanges or online storage keep it safe keep it with you!

Just contemplating that makes you a retard

You guys are still under Gox spell?  The house is on fire and you can see it but in your mind you won't accept it. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:51:42
Oh God! Those transactions won't be confirmed and will disappear from your wallet.
