There are a lot of different answers to this, but theoretically if a company is regulated you have a lower risk as a consumer.  For example, they have consumer protection regulations to adhere to so their products have to be well explained, they have to have customer service to help you, things like that. Also if they go under your assets are better protected. They also would have to have strong AML and KYC controls so the assets they have have a better chance of being lawful and “clean”. From a philosophical view point, I believe regulated crypto is a good thing and helps the industry, so I’d support that by joining a company that is making the effort to adhere to regulation, and even more importantly these days, pressing governments to make regulation so entities have something to adhere to, which is vital. Gemini is at the core of the work being done to legitimize the industry.

I’ll also add that coinbase and binance are not against regulation. It’s not like companies are on two sides of this. Everyone wants sound and smart regs. What they fight against is regulatory authorities who don’t understand the tech. So when relevant and good crypto regulation is created in the jurisdictions they’re in, they will adhere. NY state is one of the only jurisdictions that have crypto reg and Gemini is based there. NY also has done a fairly good job of creating good regulation for the industry so working with the government there is a sound strategy. Other companies just make different strategy choices.
