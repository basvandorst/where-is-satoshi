Man, with this logic, redditors have successfully done a lot of things.  Way to go, Reddit!

He's saying in the short term, he sees the price dropping back below $100, but maybe in 5 years it'll be over $1000.

Wow, you really like spamming this board even though you get downvoted pretty hard every time. Are people actually falling for this?  You have the biggest house edge I've seen since [Homonym!](
Seriously, you pay out at lower rates than the odds would dictate AND ties are auto-wins for the house?  At least have the courtesy to buy a guy dinner before you try and fuck him in the ass.

People for whom the reality of money now is more valuable than the possibility of more money in the future. I'm one of those people. Is there a degree of "if I would have waited another month or two, I could have REALLY made some money?" Yeah, I won't lie that is floating in the back of my head.
But the truth is, I now have a few more months rent because I sold a thing I wasn't using at the moment.  The fact that I could now have twice as many free months of rent is a bit of a downer, but I don't regret what I've done too much.  Bitcoins hit a price at which I was more willing to have the money than to have the coins.  The price keeps rising because there are more people who would rather have the coins than the money.  I don't feel particularly foolish, just like a person who seems to value bitcoins a bit less than what most people now seem to value them.
