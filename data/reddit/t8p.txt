Is that feedback on the idea of headers being sent before the transaction data? All miners will be at the same disadvantage. They can choose to mine on the first header assuming it will be accepted (have blocks transmitted in time). If they want to take a bet on a later header being accepted (seems a bad bet), they could do that. All miners are in the same position so it shouldn't be an issue.

You are referring to a banking service of lending out money and providing interest. Such a service could operate over bitcoin or anything. There could be transaction fees because off-chain or they could be subsidized through the lending operation. The cost of the bitcoin network vs the network used for paym is of interest.

@_date: 2014-06-24 00:04:28
That isn't a bug. But yes, a 51% attack is something that will shake confidence. Backups (alt coins) are desirable. The 1MB limit seems like it could be vastly alleviated through off-chain transactions to unload a lot of the work on the blockchain for just major transactions. I also had an idea (see my post history) of block headers being sent prior to the bulk of the block data so that there was only competition for the header as opposed to the entire block being received. That would encourage miners to use as big a blocks as permitted by the protocol.

@_date: 2014-07-25 22:56:54
Make it a 2MB limit and increase as needed by doubling. There shouldn't be a disadvantage for miners producing larger blocks compared to those producing smaller blocks. The header portion of the block should be circulated before the rest of the block, allowing nodes to accept the first correct header first (small amount of data). Alternatives can be queued and accepted if the first block is not valid.

A protocol for transaction of value using peer to peer networking of which the unit is bitcoin that can be broken down into sub-units called satoshi and as such, these transactions are stored in a block chain, which is a database that is distributed throughout the bitcoin network that accumulates a new block approximately every 10 minutes through solving a mathematical algorithm by a mining device of which the power of the network to solve the mathematical algorithm will influence the difficulty of the next block to be solved such that an approximately 10 minute rate of block creation shall be maintained and such blocks will contain a reward for the miner by providing a balance of bitcoin and that balance will half for later blocks after certain extended periods of time to reduce the rate of bitcoin creation towards a limit of 21 million and such blocks contain transactions and as such, they are a public ledger and moon-bound.

Bitcoin is far too simple to consider as autonomic computing and not wide enough for me to consider anything remotely like (weak) artificial intelligence. Adapting a difficulty is just a variable in the algorithm following an equation. The algorithm itself doesn't adapt. The usefulness of a utility doesn't magically give it artificial intelligence. By your logic, most software is weak artificial intelligence.

A node can verify the parts of the header except for the hash of the entire block. So it can verify it has a solution for the difficulty of the network. The block isn't accepted until the complete block is confirmed, so it isn't used for payment confirmation until that happens. By prioritizing receipt of the header rather than a complete block (and queuing older block headers + associated block data), then there is no incentive for smaller blocks. A smaller block might be received sooner, but if a header for a bigger one was received first, then it gets accepted.

Actually, that is no different to sending random crap for a block over and over again with the existing protocol implementation. If you spam from an IP address, then that can be recognized and rejected.

Withhold the necessary information from the block for miners to start working on the next block until the entire block had been transmitted (block hash?). Miners keep working on present block until solution accepted and propagated in time. If miner withholds data, then that block is discarded and the next received solution can be used. Each miner with a solution has incentive to send complete solutions in case a miner ahead of it has connectivity issues. The miner cannot work on the next block anyway without knowing the accepted block hash of the previous block.

Don't convert to binary after each throw. Generate a base 6 number of several digits and then convert to the needed base. That it won't be a factor of 2 only leads to a bias for the last significant digit of base 6, which is tiny. This small bias can be solved by reading the dice on the last one it two throws as base 3 or base 2 by making certain faces have equivalent values.
Edit: I'm wrong. Simply keep throwing the dice and treat as base 6. Roll enough times to encompass maximum number needed. If the amount exceeds the maximum amount you want, then discard the first dice roll and throw another one. Repeat until the amount is within the range needed.

I didn't think there was just one solution. I thought the solution was a hash in itself and there was another hash of the entire block so the header could be recognized to be valid beforehand. What about micropayments needed for the acceptance of a block to prevent spam? E.g broadcast transaction first that had information to indicate that the following block header is legitimate? It could just be burning coins. What about the idea of a double solution? A hash of the block header that meets the difficulty and then a hash of the entire block that meets the difficulty? Is like solving two blocks, but one is really just the hash for the header and another is for everything. Not practical to keep creating valid headers for spam.

Running a node is executing software on a network connected device. NAS run server software and are internet connected.
A USB-stick, assuming you mean a USB flash drive, isn't powered up 24/7, isn't network connected, and doesn't have a powerful processor + RAM that NAS has. WD My Cloud (NAS) has a dual core 650MHz micro with &gt;512MB (1GB?) RAM.  Any processing a USB flash drive would have would just be to support the USB protocol.

Correct on the first point. It just forces miners to wait to determine which block won.

Decentralized doesn't mean autonomous. Autonomous describes independence and freedom. With bitcoin, you only have the freedom to use our not use an algorithm written by others. A centralized service could be autonomous.

Bitcoin has been incredibly successful, making litecoin redundant so far. But litecoin isn't a joke.

Why does the scheme give incentive for small blocks? The block header should be propagated before a complete block. Nodes could accept the first valid received block header (pending successful receipt of the rest of the block). If the block isn't downloaded in time, then the next header candidate is given a chance.
