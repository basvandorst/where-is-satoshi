So you recognize the irony in raging against a meme when Bitcoin itself is a meme?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:15:40
A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. The term was first coined by Richard Dawkins in his groundbreaking book, *The Selfish Gene.* Bitcoin the *protocol* is a decentralised distributed ledger. Bitcoin as *money*, like all money, is a idea that spreads from person to person within a culture: i.e. a meme. Anything can be used as money (shells, metal, ria stones, tabacco, paper, digital bank balances etc.) including distributed decentralized distributed ledgers. Monetization of an object requires shared belief among holders. The current explosive growth in bitcoin price reflects the spreading belief among a growing community of holders that bitcoin is money.

99.9% of Altcoins are pure scams and the other 0.1% will likely fail due to bitcoins overwhelming network effect. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:53:30
Except the coins aren't fungible, and their every movement is announced on Reddit. I love Bitcoin, but I wouldn't trade fiat for those dirty coins. 
For a proper exit scam, check out the Oasis darknet market. They dumped thousands and thousands of coins onto exchanges immediately after the hack with zero friction.

I care about things I can influence. The traditional cultural values of a nation of 1 billion people doesn't fit that criteria.
The GDP per capita of India is less than my daily income. Their housewives may like gold, but my nation is winning the productivity contest by a landslide. They should emulate us, not the other way around as suggest by the post I replied to.

High upside, low downside. It's how events get priced in, and the reason for the current bull run.
I just bought some more as well, but have a large amount of cash in reserve sitting on the exchange in case of a sale. Don't want to be waiting on a wire if there is a juicy dip!

Navigate to bitfinex. Click "signup". Now you've heard of this.
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:57:50
Not your keys, not your coins. You just found out the hard way. 
Bitfinex has been playing this crypto hostage game for a while now. They'll give you a song and dance to justify their actions, but I've long suspected this is an extortion scheme hoping a percentage of users are too intimidated to come forward, and they keep the funds. They need a source of liquidity so they don't get exposed QuadrigaCX style.

You need to click a checkbox "I understand" to the above statement as the *very first step* of signing up to bitfinex.

Western Union is a money transmitting business so not analogous to a Bitcoin exchange. In Bitcoin, transmission is handled by the network. Coinbase has no idea where my money goes once it leaves their exchange.

Thank you for this excellent guide. There may be many reasons to do this, but cost savings isn't one. If you can't afford a hardware wallet, you don't have enough Bitcoin to worry about.

Approval of an ETF is not a probabilistic event, and can't be qualified in this way.
@_date: 2017-01-15 16:52:11
Your logic is ad hominem absurdum.  All events in the universe are probabilistic in the quantum sense, but assigning a number value to this event is the same as claiming to know the future. Rediculous.
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:24:40
Agree. They know the coins were sent to a shapeshift wallet. I'm OK with that. That is the last piece of information they ever have about my spending. Until it becomes prohibited to shapeshift coins, I will have an excellent relationship with coinbase.
I'm not worried, because if it ever does become prohibited to simply exchange coins, Bitcoin is dead - destroyed by lack of fungibility.

You seriously think you get money from your bank's ATM for free? They have a lot of overhead you are paying for, and it's built into the price of your relationship with them.  Their marketing decision to offer you "free ATM" withdrawals clearly worked.

Well that escalated to ad hominem attacks pretty quickly. Which is ironic given your specific complaints. You're spewing a lot of vitriol in a subreddit for a topic you clearly have grievances with.

If there's one thing I learned from the block size debate, it's that Bitcoin is nimble and will easily adopt the feature set of altcoins.

Paying for a privacy premium and then giving up your privacy is an intelligence test. Go through KYC to use an ATM and you failed.

I understand your position. Bitcoin is far from a safe haven: example Mt. Gox. It could happen again. Exchanges could be hacked, Centralized miners could be corrupted, Whales could cash out, Satoshi could reappear, Crippling legislation could be passed, etc.

I remember when people used to post about being in the 1 million club. Now they keep quiet for safety. It will be the same here, and the internet doesn't forget. Hardware wallets don't protect against $5 wrenches.

Completely false. Ethereum has insane monitary policy, has much worse scaling, massive attack surface, premined distribution, non-existant privacy, a mutable ledger, and severe centralization. 
Ether is terrible money. It is an absolute shit store of value, and no  better as a medium of exchange.
Where Ethereum sines are are massive amounts of hype, it's the platform of choice for launching ponzis, and someday there might be a useful DApp. Maybe.

Assuming this is dumb is equally ignorant. 
If he is about to retire, I agree, this is the dumbest thing you can do, but there are situations where this would be the rational option. 
A young person with secure employment and no debt could target a longterm allocation of 5% but front load the most undervalued assets. This would lead to a temporary 100% allocation. 
DCAing into the everything bubble with 95% of your capital and trickling only 5% into Bitcoin given a thorough understanding of the current fundamentals and global macro picture would literally be the dumbest thing you can do.
