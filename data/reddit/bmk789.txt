My concern isn't the hardware requirements, it's the resulting topology of the network. If average users are start using the lightning network when they go to make a transaction, won't mostly everyone just have one open channel with the first bank or retailer they transact with? How would lightning network handle a nefarious hub or a centralized hub that decides to drop off the network? Nobody with a channel to that hub has low transaction fees until they find a new entity to channel back onto the network correct? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:32:43
Holy shit dude how is that spreading negativity? I haven't even taken a side on the issue. I'm just trying to gain a better understanding of lightning network theory and operation because this issue is being extremely over-politicized and both sides are blowing the cons of the other side way out of proportion.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:33:46
Who do you open a channel with if you don't know who you'll be transacting with yet?
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:08:38
Interesting, but what incentives are in play to prevent centralization of lightning nodes? Why should I believe this solution will be more centralization-resistant than big blocks?

Bullshit. It doesn't take a huge mining operation to be profitable. I've had 3 antminer s1s for almost 5months now and they're still profitable at stock clock speed with $0.12/kWh power. They finally paid themselves off last week and I can still underclock them and mine profitably for months more. Honestly, I think part of the cause of mining centralization is all the FUD spread around here. Yes, in some cases you won't quite break even, so what? Let my people mine.

It makes it easier for people new to bitcoin to dive in and use it more.  It becomes more practical to adapt for the masses.  Then as consumers and merchants see more people using bitcoin, they can decide to cut out the fees and just use straight bitcoin.  I'm not saying it will be the savior of bitcoin, or that it's even the ideal way to use bitcoin, but I think it does have potential to become popular and useful during the transition toward mass bitcoin adoption

I think the answer lies in how you distribute hash rates. In theory it could make everyone send slightly more power to smaller pools until many pools are about equal in power.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:55:51

Yes and no. Yes, anyone into bitcoin should (IMO) run a miner to help decentralize the hashrate. But no, you can't expect to see a profit unless you're buying a lot of the latest hardware.  If you do your research, you should be able to get a cheaper (&lt;$300) miner and almost break even.  200 bits

@_date: 2014-06-20 20:45:42
P2pool doesn't work that way. Because it is decentralized, even if someone had 90% of p2pools hash rate, they don't control what the other p2pool nodes mine. Someone can probably explain better than I can but my understanding is that even having one entity make up the majority of p2pool would still be safe for the network, even if p2pool had &gt;50% of total hash power.
Edit: apparently I'm not entirely right

I have a p2pool node and point my 3 antminer s1s at it occasionally but going days on end without a single payout really worries me because I need my miners to pay themselves off.  Hopefully petamine will be switching to p2pool which would make a huge difference in variance.  If variance on p2pool goes down or my miners break even I'll immediately switch to p2pool from BTCguild because I really want to help the network more, but until then I need to know I'm making progress toward paying off my miners. I'm sure tons of other miners are in the same boat.
