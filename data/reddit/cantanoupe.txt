WTF does theoretical physics have to do with understading how to use a computer and a website?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:01:49
Wonder why they use a .gov url?  I thought they're a private institution?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:04:11
Which is... in your opinion?  As I see it, the gov is coming, and will take away our gravey train.  I'm legit worried --and pissed-- about this.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:17:08
Slow down.  Go to their Slack channel.  They have active support on there 24/7.  Have your support ticket # ready.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:34:01
Same.  Today was the first day it seemed possible we'll see 10K+.  Unless gov steps in and fucks up the party.  The assholes.

What does the FED do, then?

My technology doesn't work for me, instantly.  Must be a scam.  I'll warn everyone!  Shut up.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:00:29
Where does that tax go, by the way?  Fucking fed reserve?  Is that right?  IIRC, the fed is not even a government agency?  Who the fuck are thes private assholes taking 35% of our smart $?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:18:33
Thanks.  So it's income tax (not cap gains tax) that goes to FED Reserve?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:43:48
But the fact that the conversation, so to speak, has started, worries me.  These fuckers wont let us run with the bulls for ever.  I'm legit worried the honeymoon is nearing an end.  The fuckers are greedy control freaks.

\  Just rebuy what you spend
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:33:08
If you were in debt, how did you afford enough BTC to grow out of debt?  You're gambling.  Not the best way to approach the responsibilities of protecting/raising/sustaining a family.
Furthermore, the long-term play would have been to make your money make money for you, now, not to spend the majority of it.  Think passive income.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:32:54
Check out alts, too.  Not just Bitcoin.  Those are where BTC was when you wished you would have not been too lazy to jump in.

I smell B.S.  Bored posting on the weekend.  Wishful thinking.

What was your reasoning at that time?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:34:05
And OP gave no substantive reason(s) for doing so, just virtue signaling in an echo chamber for a pat on the back.  All that's missing is for OP to gild herself.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:52:58
Sure, doesn't mean it will get into a pool/confirmation, though.  Why accept small fee tx when there's a back log of large fee tx.

I bet you sold more than you're letting on.  And then there's the tax.  Cool story if tru, tho.

That's a smart (crypto) conversation for 2011!  Kudos to you and your thoughtful friend.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:28:49
Why all the references to bitcoin.org?
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:12:25
Not that your story is true, but pretending it is for the sake of making a point...  Wait till the BTCGold crash (when everyone hoarding BTC for "free gold" sells post-fork, crashing the BTC price) then ask yourself if consta-hodling was the right play.
Nothing wrong with taking profits.
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:48:27


Except the cost of inflation.

This sounds like a Roald Dahl book!
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:59:09
does it matter how soon somone discovers cause for alarm?  maybe he/she was in a submarine for the last 11 months.  Doesn't change the fact that the gov is moving toward this outcome, regardless of their speed in doing so.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:52:27
This must be why the accelerator feature said I didn't have enough BTC available to use it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:16:32
IIUC... you're so frugal with your BTC you don't sell for profit, yet you make the decision to live somewhere expensive, where BTC mooning would help pay for such a lifestyle?
Doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:36:22
That's why I recommend both methods.  Dollar cost average until a dip, then buy a bunch.  Repeat.  Lambos by 2020!


How much did you pay per BTC at the time?  I bet someone using DCA approach long enough has you beat for a better cost/value.


What's a good formula, or source, on this?
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:41:27
Sell signal!

My concern --the part that applies to many of us and our privacy practices-- is how did they know he was doing this to begin with?  If I understand the article correctly, law enforcement put together an undercover opperation to entrap this guy by exchanging cash for Bitcoin, while "representing" the cash was obtained via "unlawful activity".
@_date: 2017-06-24 06:47:30
Whatever you do, don't forget your password and need help from their support.  As a gray-haired, old man, I remember requesting such help back when my hair was young, flowing and black.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:36:05
Why is it important to you someone, ayone, "remembers your words", though?  Do you have a need to be believed?  Validated?
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:58:25
Some people rake their profits until they've paid back their initial investment, then keep the rest ("the house's money") in the account to appreciate.  Free risk!
Also, I like to look at the 2019+ chart projections.  40K-100,00K, baby!
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:31:13


Don't leave in suspense of your wordly wisdom, o great one...  Why?

Same guy who overbought Facebook at its IPO, then sold his position at a loss, then the stock grew past its IPO price.  I dislike this dude and his take on new trends.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:02:54
Mostly the former, in my opinion.  If you spend $200 worth of BTC today, next year that same amount is worth $400.  That will make anyone resentful toward their new futon, or whatever they bought.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:00:42
You want to, or you started already?
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:41:29
For a while the naysayers would cry "not intrinsic".  Now they cry "tulips".  Next they will just cry, becaue the **functionality** and value of cryptos continues to improves and generate value.

If yes.  Do not invest it all.
If no, fucking go for it, bru!
You might be better off doing dollar cost average buying (i.e. same amount each week or month) and waiting for dips to buy extra.  Also consider diversifying the amount of investment eggs in your basket, in case one breaks, the others will still keep you fed.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:49:04
Best place to start is with the search feature, here, to read all the previpus answers to this question.
You will get to read tons more responses than you will with a repost.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:13:20
Than how about providing complete and supportive information when you do so?  Instead of "I feel like" and "trust me" shit posts?
If the price tanks to 1400, I bet you'll have an "I told you so, should have listened to me" post.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:45:52
Not even £10 a month?  £ cost average!
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:18:10
True.  I'm used to depreciation, though.  Not used to depreciation combined with the value paid for said depreciated item increasing over time.

My very first thought was "is this a gambling website?"
For the hats, do they adjust to fit on back, or are they elastic?  I like the Ripple one, especially on the sale price.
Best luck with the shop.
