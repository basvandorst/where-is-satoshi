Over 100,000 back log confirmations right now with core

That’s you guys trying to escape, I know, I was one of you. Time to wise up and protect your money, you are playing music aboard the titanic.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:17:37
Ouch, sorry buddy, maybe you can ride an upswing some time, some where.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:06:10
Well stated. About merchant costs.

I’ll happily take your b-trash ��

Our clogged toilet is going to fuck up your whole house.

High fees and slow confirmation time, the whales are flipping over
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:50:01
I can agree with that, but you can’t argue that money and vice go hand in hand.

George is btc holders trying to get the fuck out

You guys really have a hate on for Roger, you make him sound like Harvey Weinstein.  Is it warranted?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:34:37
Good luck I hope you did your research. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:19:38
Haha, sorry buddy, I won’t rub salt in your wounds today.

Different currency lower fees

So much hostility, dude get some weed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:47:17
Fees at this rate are really bad.  I can’t even give my buddy twenty bucks to get him curious about it all.  Seriously, I was going to do Christmas bonuses in crypto this year.  Not on this chain, that’s for sure.

Weed still would benefit you, just saying.  You’ll probably be able to buy it with bch as it will have more utility than btc, with lower fees and faster transactions ��

Lower fees faster transactions, the whole world can play. You can capture the third world. You can capture the Cam girls. Can capture the charities. Can capture the gambling. Smaller fees opens up the world.
