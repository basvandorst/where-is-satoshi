Hey, I need to change my mind too. Although I think with 50$ I won't be able to change my mind. 500$ sounds fair. PM me for wallet address

Yea sure, just like many other assets, it is easy to say that after you know the results

I think some people here need a little more risk management before they get burned
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:56:42
Yes, that is true, but not what OP was implying. Deposits are with as a negative interest due to the low-risk nature of it. If people wanted to "store" their cash in something more risky, there are plenty of options other than bitcoin. Bitcoin is probably one of the most risky investments out there
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:34:23
Right, that is only if the only way bitcoin could only go up on the long term, although it is a very interesting technology you can't possibly know the future, specially in such "new asset"

Where? Bitcoin? With all the volatility, do you really think it is a good place to store cash? Don't get blind guys
