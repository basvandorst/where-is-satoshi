 those numbers sound massively inflated, last i checked they were both wayyyyy lower than that.

Remember when you asked 'what shake down'? hehe

Pretty sure there is a ledger for the values they have picked for the months and it's 10.8k USD on average, Ie below current price... Not trying to spread FUD but I saw an infographic earlier, will try to dig it up.

definitely. 24 hours at a guess? TA says this is final wave 5 of C correction. 9500ish

Who knows today! May scream up towards christmas, but Bithumb gets it's shakedown in a fortnight, I've pulled quite a % at the ATH last night (My Time) - we'll see what happens, worst case scenario I only quadrupled my money in 6 weeks :')

Guys below are aggressive, I thought the same thing... Dick move to assume your mother wants to waste her money (bitcoin) on an ipad and a giftcard just because she used to have 1... total dick move...

Probably a poor way of writing it. 
Basically i meant them auditing under agers and foreigners to stop them trading. Regardless it's dropped 8k AUD since i sold so i feel i made the right decision regardless, will come back in the new year.

Plenty of other reddit forums dude! I follow a couple and check in on MANY others, always good to see what is happening out there! I've recently pulled my BTC investment back because it was too scary and have invested into quite a few alts now that are just moving (obviously only genuine ones) - we'll see where this space ends up, one day my remaining 1 btc may be the future, it may be nothing! Hopefully the rest will be enough to cover my back!

Have my upvote!

At a guess it'll be under 10 for ~2 hours? but it could also be 5 minutes, it's hard to call that particular scenario! just ladder buy under 10.5 and you'll be set.

Saw an ad for Ocean's 8 today?!

seems fair enough to me, can't use 0?! seems like a serious design flaw...
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:19:51
why'd I get downvoted?! hehe :)

I have the exact same figure. roughly 23-24 hours from now. 9500 on the knocker. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:01:20
more likely a drunken pump ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:48:32
Just realizing? TA says 9.5k, a day or so from now. i bought the last drop, sold at 14, will rebuy ladder 10.5 - 9.5.
