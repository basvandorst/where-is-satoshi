Why are people mad at Coinbase? Aren't they the ones who were threatened with lawsuits for not supporting BCH?

This is just how stop vs limit works in general: 
Most of my buys / sells are limit orders: I only want to buy if the price is at or below $X, or sell if the price is at or above $X.
Stops will also execute a trade at a given price, but going in the opposite direction. They're frequently used to limit losses of negative trends: Let's say you own something that's worth $10 currently. You can set a stop order for $9 to auto-sell the item if it goes too low... that way, you sell before it hits $8 or lower.

But who cares? They should be able to add support for currencies on their exchange as they please.

So I followed their advice and moved my BTC to an external wallet, because Coinbase was making it seem like I'd *never* be able to get my Bitcoin Cash if I didn't do that.
How do I take the BTC I hastily moved to an external wallet, and "claim" my Bitcoin cash from that?
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:26:00
Thanks. I'm having trouble syncing my BTC wallet I had just moved everything into so that I could do this. Even restored my Multibit wallet into Electrum, and it seems to be stuck on "Synchronizing..."
This is making me a little nervous...
EDIT: Restarting Electrum fixed. No longer in panic mode.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:44:43
So how do I go from say... My Multibit wallet that is Bitcoin, to a wallet that is Bitcoin cash, without losing my Bitcoin or accidentally resetting anything?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:45:47
Considering adding BTC Cash support is probably going to take some effort on their part, I doubt this is the case.
My guess is they had ample time *previously* to devote resources to this and they decided not to do that.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:46:16
Realistically, in what practical way could BCC *go away*?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:15
Okay, you need to check out this: 
And this: 
BTC may be overpriced if it was a stock. As a currency, it's doing pretty well. High trade volume ($BILLIONS per day). $175 BIL market cap.
BTC has no choice but to become more valuable since it's already 3/4 of the way through its theoretical maximum supply.
A Satoshi is still worth under a penny, making Bitcoin fractions feasible for any kind of transaction, not just banking and investment transactions: 
I think there is a big bubble from the standpoint of your average consumer. I am waiting to see how serious investors react to BTC's price. The problem with seeing BTC as a bubble, even though I think it *should* be a bubble, is there is no reason to sell it.
But you can. It's pretty easy to. Plenty of people have made $100k's+ converting their BTC to USD. I have held a good number of BTC in the past, and I am telling you from experience, when you actually own it for a while as opposed to just looking at the hype charts, you just aren't super convinced by the need to convert to USD.
I sold out of necessity. I needed the cash and my portfolio was small. If I had a larger portfolio, it's possible I may have gotten a car, a house or hired services with BTC at this point... but really, like many others, I would just hold.
If you invested in BTC even earlier this year, you'd be up so significantly that even a major, major crash in BTC's value would still most likely leave you up a significant amount. That's the scary part, though... Most people buying BTC are gambling, not investing. So there is a bubble. However, there's no telling if it will ever pop.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:35:45
Personally, I think BTC has no choice to but to go up for a while. I'm still not touching it because that's a very low-confidence assessment...
But BTC is 3/4 through its maximum capacity. A Satoshi is still only worth 1/100 of a penny. Market cap and trading volume are high. It is a really good place to hold buckets of money in a national currency-agnostic way.
It created a new market people didn't think was needed because the USD already exists, but it turns out crypto is fulfilling a lot of peoples' needs and desires.
That being said, crypto itself has a weird function. Lots and lots of electricity being burned by miners. Transaction fees are already high: 
I think once BTC crosses the 1 Satoshi &gt;= $0.01 threshold, you lose utility. This is BOUND to happen since supply is controlled, unless the spec is changed... but who controls that vote? Miners and investment firms already have a lot on the line. BTC can be forked, but I think money will ultimately control the spec. Fully decentralized my ass :)

Why? Wasn't 18k, 17k, 16k ,15k, 14k, 13k, 12k, 11k, 10k, and 9k?
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:57:53
Uhm, these are really weird speculative statements. If BTC resolves some of its core issues, demand can definitely increase again. I think it's overpriced currently, but that's not *necessarily* a permanent problem.
Although, I would dump BTC for some of the newer alt-coins, personally.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:34:44
Yeah, this kind of thing works until it doesn't. I'm saying this as someone who thought BTC would peak at $20k USD for now. I could have been wrong, though. It could have gone higher.
There's no "prediction". There's just performing your personal risk analysis.
You can't "predict" assets based off of "patterns" or charts. You do not control them, and the factors that go into them are incredibly complex, making them chaotic.
That being said, sell high is never a bad idea. You might run into the fear of missing out (FOMO), but at least you profit. The folks saying the S&amp;P 500 is going to crash any day now will at least leave the market having made money, even if they won't be the guy from who made $500k from $30k in call options on SPY.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:49:24
While this is true, you need to look beyond the 24-hour basis. If you look at the 7-day to 1-month cycles, there are a few top cryptos that have been outperforming or matching BTC.
I don't know how significant it is right now. I may be delusional in thinking people are reinvesting their BTC into more useful alt coins.
But even if this is happening, the process will likely take months... maybe even up to a couple years. So I would either back away from crypto for now, or hold for another 2 - 3 years.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:47:41
Yup... I would say the riskier an investment is, the sooner you should take profits when you see them. Most people close out option contracts at 50% profits, for example.
Take the volatility of an asset, and use that as the basis for your profit margin pulls. Crypto is extremely high volatility. One of the few places where you can close out at 2x or 3x profit before recouping your initial investment and still have money left for future gains.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:09:50
Not if it solves some of its current fundamental problems.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:37:07
ETH is close enough. That being said, I think for now you are right. However, market prices are largely affected by the price in BTC due to reliant technologies and exchanges pairing to BTC.
When I see an overall market crash like this, I speculate it's due to people pulling out of BTC and redistributing into other cryptos.
This down-up-down-up-down-up cycle has been happening like clockwork almost daily for the past month. A handful of other cryptos are overall stable in price, while BTC continues to edge downward. Something is going on.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:30:06
Soooo the dollar is somehow exempt from risk and devaluation?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:16:40
Sooo like dollars?
Comparative value here matters. If he wanted to take some BTC out and transfer it to USD because it's easier to spend, fine. But the overall account value is still higher and grows faster than if it had been left in BTC or even most US markets.
Those 10 BTC can purchase far more goods now than they could have before, so there's your "black magic".
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:14:26
If it solves some of its current fundamental problems, why wouldn't anyone go back? If Bitcoin ends up superior to other tech in some way due to improvements + pre-existing investment base, why would you stick with an inferior tech?
Also, lost its lead my ass. Still 2x the market cap of ETH, which is technologically superior at this point.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:16:36
Yup.  It's going to go down a bit, but it should be back up in a short period of time.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:04:49
Yes.  Exactly this.  People are so concerned about the short-term price of BTC rather than its realistic long-term value.  BTC value has been increasing steadily at 1000%+ a year, which is unheard of.
Everyone keeps saying that's a bubble, but if you look at BTC value charts, "bubbles" only "pop" when people try and make growth super-exponential.
BTC is mathematically reliable, secure, safe, easy to trade - BTC will have occasional walls because market caps can't go beyond a certain point without increased support by merchants - but it is no where near even reasonably pessimistic values yet.
Even the current price hikes are normal for BTC.  This is exponential, not super-exponential growth.  My prediction:  The bubble won't pop unless there's a panic.  The price may drop super-short-term, but will bounce back if it does.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:14:27
This is the kind of article I like, because it has the potential to garner reputable interest and increase market capitalization rather than just increase BTC price arbitrarily :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:03:25
Funny thing is that I purchased 1.5 BTC at $200 from Coinbase two weeks ago!  I wonder if they matched me up with your exact transaction :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:52:49
That sounds like fun!
The same thing is happening to me now.  My friend at work studied economics in school and he simply won't invest in BTC.  My employer made fun of me when I mentioned BTC, bringing up the "government investigation" (cough, if you want to call it that, cough) being done this month.
I bought a couple right before prices shot up.  I'm glad to have an investment I feel like I can both hold onto in the long-run, and won't have to price-check all of the time to see if a better deal is around the corner :)
*A small aside:  I've been re-investing the BTC I have in an effort to make it grow.  That's taken a little time away from the girlfriend.  You figure she'd be happy, but as cool as she is, she doesn't care about the money at all!  She just complains about how I don't spend time with her.*
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:58:24
Smaller financial companies, rogue investors and anyone who's ever wanted to authorize payments but didn't want to compete with PayPal, Ebay, Amazon, Fidelity/Authorize.net, etc. should be in dreamland right now.
I would be tempted to write BTC transaction software myself if I wasn't so worried about taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:18:18
Price changes motivated by increased demand due to increase circulation/usage.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:11:22
I agree entirely :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:01:38
Like the last one, and then bounce back up to its old price?  Bitcoin has had stable 1000% growth a year.  Panics are caused by people who only care about its short-term price and panic when anything changes it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:50:28
Haven't learned what lesson?  I started investing when I saw that BTC's value has increased 1000%+ a year for the past couple years.  It is doing so consistently.
The ONLY time the "bubble" has popped is when people try and make growth super-exponential.  That just doesn't work in any market.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:38:28
Yes, if you're willing to long BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:17:49
Hah, yeah, a resounding "Duh!" there, but that's my point.
BTC price fluctuates due to short-term psychological panic.  In the long-term, it has grown steadily regardless of this.  IMO, now is not the time to buy unless you are willing to let that money hang out by itself for a while.
And if you aren't, you are gambling, not investing.
@_date: 2013-11-04 11:42:34
Confirmed.  I bought Bitcoin at $200 USD as soon as I saw the recent media posts and finally decided the growth trend was consistent enough to be worth purchasing.  I've already seen 10% growth.
Why I didn't purchase before?  Anxiety over legitimate purchasing/storing of BTC, systematic fears (online banks/wallets/exchanges going down), ignorance over the integrity of BTC.
Since Silk Road has been taken down, I feel more comfortable about market stability and BTC as a legitimate currency.  Bitcoin exchanges seem pretty solid these days and using Multibit (as opposed to needing Bitcoin-qt) makes things easy.
The things I am less confident about include the ability to time the market going forward now that so many perceived problems with BTC (systematically, not theoretically) have proven to be non-issues.  I don't expect a massive drop in BTC to happen any time soon, which makes short-term opportunistic investing a little difficult.  On the plus side, that means BTC is fairly stable and that long-term investments will pay off big in the long-run.
