Great post! Send it. When they begin to accept Bitcoin, post it and we will instantly make a purchase using you as the referral....Good Luck!

Porn and Gambling was the backbone for early Internet financial success. Bitcoin gaming will be even bigger. Better odds, instant payouts and legal within the digital world!

Will Banking institutions begin to 'absorb' or buy out the front line Venture start ups? It seems like Building up a user base with the worlds population that banks do not give access to would be safer from 'Bank Absorption'.

As long as it stays within the 'digital realm' the only regulation that will occur is competition between other gambling sites. The government/corporate regulation that you refer to only occurs when you convert your 'digital' currency back into a 'fiat currency'.

Absolutely, the big boys like Bodog were 'playing' in the wrong 'stadium..U.S' and lit up the federal radar. Not that it can't happen, but the day the US seizes a domain of a gaming site using only digital currencies,we are SCREWED!

Very good point. I'll have them reduce it ASAP, Regards, Rick

"The elephant in the room"
Your points are truly valid. As a big supporter of Bitcoin I see two issues that could turn it around.
1. We 'front loaded' the technology. Like you point out these services have been designed to compete with the banking system.
2. There are 2.5 billion people that do not have access to banking services.  Lets 'bottom up' develop it and the rest will fall into place.

Notice how banks have been 'sitting back' letting the Bitcoin industry run its course? Napster was unprepared and was destroyed. Uber anticipated its challenge and succeeded. What is the state of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:25:53
Looks like writer may have taken a look at my blog comparing Napster/Uber to Bitcoin.     I took the same criticism on reddit/bitcoin 2 weeks ago. I'm glad He took a bigger 'hit' from publishing on Coindisk. He deserves it!

"Bitcoin should always be prepared to take the brunt of an attack against the industry, even though those attacks will ultimately prove futile."             When Bitcoin is attacked, it will be from one of the most powerful dynasties on the planet------The Banking Industry! And it will come....

Recently wrote an article looking at Napster/UBER vs Bitcoin:   Three weeks later Coindesk publishes a very similar article with graphs and charts. Not enough to go after them, but 'uncomfortably' similar idea. Absolutely-Lazy Journalism.

There are about 20 Int'l currencies that you could convert out of Bitcoin to with minimal tax liability. Your problem is that little box on the US Federal Tax return asking about any 'foreign income?'
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:54:52
Look at the transportation industry worldwide. It's a micro-version of the banking industry. In big transport towns like Orlando they are attacking Uber aggressively. Point being if Wall Street can't control Bitcoin they will try and destroy it.

All in one month, Outlaw Bitcoin, counter with an 'archaic Electronic Currency, and make it a crime to oppose their current banking system. A political Trifecta coup to stop Bitcoin.

It's a joke to see how the media spins Bitcoin and Money Laundering. 'Small bits' maybe, but the Big Boys won't touch it!

That was David Caruthers. He wasn't extradited but was taking a flight from London to Costa Rica. Unfortunately he tried to change planes in Dallas TX. You are right though...if you 'light' up the radar of any of these big countries...they can find a way to screw you!

Just finished Matt Taibbi's Griftopia book. He shows how Goldman was the instigator in nearly every catastrophic financial bubble since the 1920's. They have brought the U.S. down to their financial knees!

Very good advice. The risk to the player is an 'account hold'. With banks, it is generally within the North American 'code' boundary'. The pattern over the last ten years is.....A large gambling site 'triggers' or 'lights up' the Federal radar...the gambling site is shut down and money frozen. Off shore in 99% of the rest of the world......It is all Legal!

Just noticed that there was a reddit post a month ago how Coindesk deletes comments regarding article integrity. With the bitdados article (above) I left a polite comment how 'great minds must think alike!' Deleted.....Not cool!

Government or banks/ Probably the same difference. But when either one sees Bitcoin start to take away their authority or dominance, they will attack Bitcoin.

Pass this article along to those who are just starting to show an interest in Bitcoins.

A great opportunity exists for Bitcoin to service the world's Unbanked. Banks can not compete with Bitcoins low transmittal and service rates. But the banks will compete, buy, absorb and attack the 'Bank Centric' Bitcoin start ups. It's the long hard road, (Sorry speculators!) but it is the best foundation to build on.

A big segment of Bitcoin VC development is exactly for that Bangladeshi mother. She'll receive a Bitcoin transfer to her cheap cellphone, walk into her village market, scan the QR logo at the register....and done! And this is not futuristic but being rolled out now. Kenya, Uganda, rural China and the rest of the developing world. slvbtc is right on track for the promotion of Bitcoin....keep it up!
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:50:40
Two points here: The worlds unbanked especially as it relates to micro loan opportunities do not care about any specific currency. The extremely low 'user rates' of Bitcoin can't be matched by fiat banks. Two: the speculative rate fluctuation is a problem. A 50 cent bag of potato chips might cost 85  cents a day later. This could be a 'deal breaker' for the unbanked.
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:48:05
I see two 'fronts' of battle here.
'Bank Centric' Ventures: Companies like BitPay, CoinBase and Circle who offer banking like features at a fraction of the cost. This will be a long bloody battle. Feudal banks will not give up this market share easily.
'Worlds Unbanked': 800 million people who have cellphones and the Feudal banks have no interest in building market share. This will be a slower, longer process but by building up a market of 400 million unbanked Bitcoin users the Feudal banks will virtually disappear. If you are a 'speculator'......prepare for a long haul!
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:12:31
Your correct. They don't give a shit. They just want some type of 'vehicle' that is easy, simple and virtually cost free. The merchants will still have their product 'mark up' and increase their sales. The 'Bankers' don't want them because there is 'nothing in it' for them.

Maybe CHINA can learn. If the Centralized Bank shuts down Bitcoin, its backup is the Neatherlands!

1. Front end venture development is structured around competing with the banking industry. It also promotes 'quick profit' speculation.
2. 2.5 billion people do not have access to banking services. When venture development grabs, lets say, 500 million of those people. Everyone will do just fine!
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:02:53
'Failure due to lack of needed infrastructure"
2.5 billion unbanked. 800 of them with cellphones. Millions of these people only care about obtaining seedlings, hatchlings and maybe a shovel. They could care less about converting to fiat. Provide incentives to the merchant to keep these transactions in bitcoin. 
Obviously Crypto currency development will be a long process of empiracal testing/failure/analysis and re testing. And if it 'leap frogs' this technology...so be it. Either way will be better than the existing banking system.

Yes....thanks for the edit.

It's always good to hear about potential dangers to Bitcoin development. Goldman may be one of the biggest threats.

I hear they found Butch Cassidy's grave in Bolivia. There was no body in the coffin when they opened it....But it was filled with Bitcoins!
