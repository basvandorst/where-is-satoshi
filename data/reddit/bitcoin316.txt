It's one of the few ways you can make bitcoins from your bitcoins that isn't straight gambling.  But you can also lose bitcoins from your bitcoins...

That chart is outdated.  The top marginal bracket is 39.6% now, Cali state tax marginal is 11.3% over 300k, 12.3% over 500k.  Nearly all of the bitcoin income will (hopefully) be on top of other income that is already at the 39.6% level. So yes, &gt; 50% tax.
Don't get me wrong, I plan to claim as much of the gains as I can as long term cap gains, though that is only possibly relevant for coins I purchased and its no guarantee the IRS will accept that theory of taxation.  They may look at it as a 'collectable' (28%), or as foreign exchange (god no! ordinary income marked to market at end of year).
Gonna get a CPA, provide them with a tax theory framework and let them go to work. It also seems likely that since FinCEN issued guidance, that the IRS will also issue guidance by year end for tax purposes.

Which is taxed at ordinary income rates for short term options.

There are limitations on charitable deductions now.  But yes I will be exploring legal ways to reduce the burden. Typically we donate to the world food program, which has [minimal overhead, excellent transparency]( and saves more lives per dollar (or bitcoin) than anything else I can think of.

The call is valued in bitcoins and the value at exercise is = 
(24hr BTCUSD price - strike price) / 24hr BTCUSD price.
Great way to double up if you get the timing right, or get your face ripped off by a reversal.

I certainly support the ideals of bitcoin and do what I can to promote it, but I'm fundamentally a speculator and profiteer.
I bought in with $2,000 back at $2.50/BTC and another $1000 at $12.  I did some trading and seals with clubs, lost 150BTC there (seemed like a lot at the time, little did I know).  Then some GLBSE investments, got out with most of it intact.  Avoided all obvious scams (of which there are many).  Then invested in S.DICE and some other stocks on MPEX. Doubled up my coins. At that point I was up ~$70k. Then shit got crazy last month, bought a ton of way out of the money calls on BTCUSD price over the weekend that cyprus got looted by gov, and bitcoin prices exploded. The calls made me over 1000 coin profit off of 500 invested. Now I'm up over $300,000 from $3000. 
Much of these earnings are not from price rise, but from options that made me more bitcoins, so they should be taxed as ordinary income.  So now I gotta pay over 50% in federal and state taxes on the gains.  Sheeit.
I've cashed out $130k.  Holding on to the other ~2000 coins till ~$190/btc, when I'll sell another $100k.  I've got more calls for this month too, hopefully we will hit $200 and they will make me more coins :)
$150k after taxes is a lot of money, but not life changing relative to where I already was financially. Still doing the same job, though I sometimes think of switching to do a bitcoin startup, because there are just so many crappy ones out there right now that could be done much better. I guess it gives me the confidence that even if my career path does not go as planned, I'll still find success in something.  That comfort is worth a lot.
In the day to day, all thats changed is that people at work think I am possibly an investing genius (I told many many people to get in at $2.50, a few did, most did not), and also some people probably think I'm more of an asshole than they used do. I pay way too much attention to price moves.  And I just can't help talking about the profits (I KNOW I shouldn't), nor can I wipe the smirk off my face when I see anyone I tried to turn on to bitcoin who didn't take the plunge. I also managed to make my friends about $100,000 with my advice. Honestly, it feels fucking great.
**Some advice :**
*TRUST NO ONE.*  The coins aren't yours until they are in your cold wallet on a USB stick or piece of paper.  Be utterly paranoid while taking calculated risks if the payoff is potentially high. Minimize exposure to online wallets or accounts.
*NEVER LOAN COINS.* If people are so capital poor they need to hit up BTCjam or the bitcoin forums for a loan, they are either a scammer, or soon to become one due to their financial incompetence.  Don't subsidize their lifestyle.  Be smart.  Be safe.
*ONLY INVEST IN PROVEN COMPANIES.*  Most investment offerings will fail.  If there isn't a fantastic business plan and proven competence in management (great example is Satoshi Dice, they basically print btc at near zero cost and are well run) stay away.  I personally wouldn't touch anything outside of S.DICE, S.MPOE, S.BBET and ASICMINER.

CoinBR is great.  I got into mpex when the fee was 20BTC and the BTCUSD price was much much lower.
