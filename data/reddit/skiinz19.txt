Humble brag

Everyone has a price. For those who don't, they are the major exception, nothing close to the norm. The 'moon' is different for everyone. Most who scream "hodl" started out with $32 and now have $4000, but can't put a down payment on their new house until it hits $100k per bitcoin. Others need to buy a car. Some just need next month's rent. It's collective disharmony.

There was a great comment about how gut feelings should only be trusted when you are an expert in something. A pilot has a gut feeling about mechanical error. A chef has a gut feeling about spice allocation. An accountant has a gut feeling about a double count error.
If you are an expert in investing or finance, by all means trust your gut. But if all it is is a feeling based on what you read, see, and hear, then err on the side of caution when it comes to trusting your gut.

Which is a weird argument to make. 
Bitcoin hinges on world wide adoption.
Worldwide adoption hinges on banks adopting it (for the most part).
Banks suffer greatly in financial crises.
Banks consolidate their assets during that time, not wanting to do risky things which cost money.
Switching to bitcoin would be one such risk.
Not switching to bitcoin doesn't give it the worldwide exposure bitcoin needs to 'take off.'
So in summation, financial crises does not lead to bitcoin increasing for the better if we follow my logic. I think bitcoin benefits from stability in the financial marketplace giving banks ample time to take risks and look to adopting alt-coins.
There is entirely possible a situation where traditional financial institutions collapse and smaller distributors of online currencies emerge. How much of a market share they have will remain to be seen.

Go all in now, it will climb back to $5000 by end of October

Didn't mean to say you were making any statement. 
Just the argument about bitcoin going up due to a financial crisis is weird to me in general.

Why? Because people think differently than me and have unique ideas. Some people bought in because of Brexit, some after Greece, some after Trump, and some would've after Clinton.
Some people think global apocalypse will lead to bitcoin increasing, which is honestly baffling.

My buddy met him at a Bitcoin conference in Miami. Ended up getting dinner too. McAfee is a smart guy, big picture kind of dude, very paranoid and can be crass. Takes his bodyguard with him everywhere.
