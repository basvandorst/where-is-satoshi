No and No!  I'm clean!

I figured I'd get downvotes, not too worried about it really.  This is kind of what I was seeing the issue of.  Right now, it's a stop-gap.  Hopefully with wider adoption, this will be mitigated more, and provide a more stable platform for cryptocurrency.

I'll be happy when that day comes.  I'd like to be able to know I can spend my bitcoin with a company, rather than hope they adopt it.

I spun up my own node a week or two ago, just to help the network.  Haven't played around much with BTC, but I have the spare resources, so why not!

I... Guess so? I guess that's where I'm not sure. This is the first I saw of that company so I guess it comes down to legitimacy. I'm quite aware of the possibility of issues with bitcoin in the future, and willing to accept the risk of the US saying no (which in my not so humble opinion, won't happen) but I don't want end up giving out free money to some random company and see them run off.

Hi slumberland! I'm gonna have to throw you some btc soon!

Shapeways is an awesome company.  With as DIY as the bitcoin community is, I'd love to see more of the smaller companies do this (hell, even the bigger ones!). 
I bought a CNC from inventables, using bitcoins would have been nice.

Edit: trying to tip with no balance is a fail.... Sending from main wallet!

Oh I recall the days of $22, and $2, and $.20, and wish I had bought every time.  I have a very limited amount in bitcoin now, and was looking for a way to move it some into bitcoin, without the tax fees associated with an early withdraw.  I can only hope in the future, that some sort of fund comes around, that is more accessible in the market.

I have a laser engraver coming,  and this was on the top of my list of offering to people. Guess it's not an original idea anymore ;-)

Thank you for this. I can't figure out how to reset my language from redreader on Android, and now I'm stuck in non English :-\

How many words does it put in?  How hard would brute force be if the wordlist is known?  I know it's not "easy", but in the grand scheme of private keys, this would seem to be an easier method.

Oh I completely agree, don't get me wrong.  Was more looking to see if anything existed "today", that was a fund based on bitcoin.  Wouldn't make any decision without a financial advisor!

I looked through my crashplan backups because I thought I had done some mining, and found my wallet from early 2011. I also looked through my email, and it was the same day source forge said that bitcoin was project of the month (I think). Unfortunately, I loaded up the wallet and one address, zero coins. I was/am a very impatient person, I'm betting I didn't even let the block chain sync, before I closed it, since it wasn't mining :-(. Not completely related, but sorta similarish

One thing I'm not sure why we've not seen on this, is a GUID, or similar, to ensure the holographic sticker is in fact the one that should be there.  Perhaps something where it can be confirmed that the sticker on the bill, is in fact the original sticker.  If everyone can get them, great, but if it doesn't have a certain serial number on the sticker, it's easily understood it's no longer the original.
Some method of incorporating it into the private key would help with this, but that is above my head, so I can't even guess how that would work.

Boo, ok.  Was just a thought :)  I figured it'd be some ridiculous number (and couldn't remember the proper math to figure it out)
