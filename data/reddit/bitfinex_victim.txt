To be exact, my liquidation price at Bitfinex is 8225.9. Expect a long rise after Bitfinex KO me at that price.

I am pretty sure bitfinex is leading the crash and somehow I am the target, with my liquidation price around 8k, and despite 3rd time dodging the liquidation by selling off part of my long, I am running out of move now and pretty sure wouldn't be able to dodge the 4th time now in 2 long days... let's see, and i got myself a video just in case to prove my case. Any believer please buy in bulk around 8000. Bitfinexed....

We must understand that china players are promoting BCH as they are the ones holding most interest in BCH and Bitfinex is very much influenced by the chinese, infact Bitfinex operates in HongKong, China. I wonder if it was a planned strategy to eventually crashed BTC (this can be done as Bitfinex still manage to drag the price down or pump it up at will now where most major exchanges would followsuit). And prolonged downfall of BTC will surely chase away investor and BCH will be the successor. Something to think about

I wonder if it was a planned strategy to eventually crashed BTC (this can be done as Bitfinex still manage to drag the price down or pump it up at will now where most major exchanges would followsuit). And for sure Bitfinex profited alot from crashing the BTC by liquidation of their client's margin buy. And prolonged downfall of BTC will surely chase away investor and BCH will be the successor.
