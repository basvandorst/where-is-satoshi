Not sure if this service is still running? Ive added a GC about 3 days ago and sent multiple messages but received no response or update!

If they have a solid link with one of the UK banks and are allowed to continue business there for the foreseeable future, this exchange will be HUGE!

Currently studying Business in Uni but debating dropping out and seeking more interesting BTC based work, just don't quite know what yet!

Thanks for the advice!
Also is there any other wallet that I can input the electrum seed into that will recognise it?

What is the process to store the BTC on electrum but offline via a brain wallet?
I've got the 12 word seed but can't figure out the safest option to store them. I want to be able to log in on any machine and recover the wallet but also be offline and 100% safe

Ive memorised the seed no problem, my worries are that the wallet is still susceptible to hackers even though i delete the client from my pc. Is this not the case?
Ive been contemplating buying a trezor but the idea of a brain wallet is much more appealing as long as there is no risk i can loose my coins. I've read many horror stories of hackers being able to locate the .dat wallet file and some how steal the contents.

It should be classed as gambling rather than an investment as it relies on others depositing to receive your funds!

The food hates us, we eat it. If it was upto the food it would go off as quick as possible, fridges are our friends they help keep the food cool and fresh

The fridge needs to keep the food cool all the time to stop it from going off!

Can anyone tell me how to change the settings on btcwisdom to clearly see the order book?
