My loan and a lot of people when the run specials (which in the auto industry is any minor holiday) is at a 0.9% APR. Over 5 yrs I am going to pay $450 in interest. Meanwhile I have more cash to put into investments making 10% per year rather than putting my money into a depreciating asset that is a car. 
Don’t be all high and mighty thinking paying cash for a car is the right decision. Most times it is not.

I think you are on the wrong sub if you want risk free investments. 
A $2,000 car will need plenty unforeseen repairs. 
Or I can drive my $25,000 new car (that is much safer than a cheap 15 year old car to put my child in)..That has a warranty for 100k miles. That only cost me $500 in interest to finance and with the $10k I put down will never be upside down on the loan. Meanwhile I have put the $15k I didn’t spend in down payment and have made 10% per year. The stock market may have ups and downs but it has always shown to give positive returns in the long run. 
If only I put that $15k into bitcoin...

You are missing the point. Also a Honda Accord isn’t a luxury item. A car that is safe and reliable for me to commute 50 miles round trip each day is a necessity. 
But maybe we should take Finance advice from our European buddy. Solid economy you guys have had for years...

You should check your math. I may have put closer to $8K down but that doesn't really change the main message. 
0.9% * $15000 = $135 * 5 yrs = $675. 
Very basic rough math but gets you in the ball park. I should really take about half that number anyway since there is less interest at the end of the loan since the principal balance is lower.

Incorrect. I’ve made more on investments than I would of paid in interest. I also put about 40% down at purchase so the asset is worth more than what I owe. So even if I lost everything I could sell the car and not have outstanding liability. If you are smart with debt it is beneficial.

No, it’s just that 80% of reddit is teenagers and 20 something’s that haven’t worked a day in their life but think they know everything about everything.
