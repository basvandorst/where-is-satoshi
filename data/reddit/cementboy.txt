I sold at at 13900 when it was dipping to 12k, I had weak hands. I didn't lose any money, but I could of gained a lot more if I just hodl'd a little longer ... let this be a lesson.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:38:28
Well considering bank accounts are fundamentally more common than crypto wallets, I have no doubt its "way more" than bitcoin wallets Lmao, that doesn't change the issue here. But I will whole heartily admit to you making your point valid. That doesn't change the fact that you argue like a child Lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:07:09
Social reject internet warrior has entered the chat Lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:16:55
Lol christ, what a loser
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:42:38
The hearing was full of very ignorant responses. But there were truth bombs thrown in there, and thats what most important. Its a step forward.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:02:05
Oh buddy, if you make the assumption that my intent was to belittle anyone or sound like an "expert" as you guess is whats going on in my mind, id hate to have to live with your teenage level social skills Lmao
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:01:19
Except that so called shitty attitude and statement was in no way objectively wrong Lol, and if in the case it was wrong, I can assure you I would of already been corrected. Are we here to talk about facts or are we here to talk about feelings? Im sure you felt as if I was talking down to you and your insecurities/pride came in to defense mechanism mode. Thats fine it happens to best of us, no sarcasm.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:44:40
The hacking that im referring to involves a process that goes through phone service providers, emails, and keys being found in those emails. Its not a process that you could be specific about just by looking at a unidentified public wallet, and deciding thats the wallet you want access to.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:36:44
Yeah no worries, its hard to take anyone on the bitcoin reddit seriously when most of them are only really interested in making money Lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:14:37
My bitcoin position is fairly decent, after all, I love bitcoin lol. I value the things going on in my life too much to put value in shit post responses that use grammar come backs in 2019 Lmao, have fun patrolling reddit like a mall cop! Im fuckin dead Lmao
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:04:20
\&gt;Teenage level socials btw Lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:32:42
The hell are you on about lol, im almost positive i said your perspective had some validation to it. You were just acting like an asshole so i was making that clear. Is reddit that toxic that you'd get that defensive so quickly just because someone disagrees with you?
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:09:35
Thanks for that fact!
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:07:42
Lol I am in fact not trolling you, and I don't delve into political commentary
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:47:44
\*Insert only bullish news so that we can make money here\*
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:40:08
i'd be glad to read something, however you seem to think just because this is the internet, that talking like an asshole will somehow allow people to respect or even give your comments the time of day Lml &amp; again this is a comment im sure you have no argument against, but because you're still upset about my last comment, im sure it would be a no brainer backing up anyone who doesn't like my comment Lmao, keyboard warriors are funny af. If you been countering this shit for years id recommend taking a vacation from reddit pal
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:29:39
Its very easy to ridicule a statement without having any sort of counter argument in an attempt to make yourself look superior, without actually saying anything of value Lol
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:30:04
It makes sense as a store of value. But if you think about the fact that individual wallets can be hacked its not as a secure store of value as people think is it not?
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:10:22
So essentially if bitcoin never stabilizes, it will never be a viable currency. Meaning something else using its code will come in to try and fill that position. So what you're telling me is bitcoin is a digital novelty simply because its the first Cryptocurrency. Wow.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:33:55
Being introspective is a great way to formulate your opinions, i'd recommend it sometime
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:42:52
especially for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:31:38
I'll make this very simple for those who don't understand. As it is now, bitcoin is not a viable currency. Its only use case as of now is primarily wealth preservation backed by the faith people have in its security (aka a store of value). Understand where your assets stand before investing in it.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:13:39
Yes im sure you value proper grammar when shit posting Lmao, unfortunately I don't hold the same standard for a conversation thats only purpose is to entertain me, sorry
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:48:39
I don't find anything about my comment disrespectful. In fact I was in the same position of ignorance not too long ago also. If trying to educated people on here is being disrespectful then i'd gladly do so. I wish people on here would of told me this when I was first introduced to bitcoin myself. So I don't relate to your sentiment. This post is obviously not for you if you're implying you know this already.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:46:53
Yeah I agree with you there
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:14:19
Id respect this reply more if you actually responded to OP Lmao, even though I agree this is an ignorant shit statement by OP, just like with me you contribute very little to this argument. Instead you're arguing with someone who replied to your reply over something that has nothing to do with OP's dumb statement Lmao christ.
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:08:45
Same to you, I don't know why you chose this life style
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:49:39
Slowly rising, can we finally break through?
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:22:15
I don't even know who Jerome Powell and Steve Menuchin are Lmao, which is precisely why people who don't understand this should hear it or be reminded. If it doesn't apply to you don't respond to it. These down votes are not here because people disagree with the statement, they are there for the simple fact that people are insecure about their investments in bitcoin. Everyone wants to make money and no one wants to discuss the Fud Lol.
Also you're dodging the point of why Bitcoin isn't a viable currency. Although you may understand people reading this will feel bullish about bitcoin as a currency again. The main issue is volatility and taxing. Not only is the price unstable af, but you can bet your ass the IRS is treating bitcoin as an asset and not a currency. Every transaction made with bitcoin has to be taxed. Although I too think thats bull shit, theres not much we can do about it unless bitcoins price magically becomes stable.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:39:54
If you watched the whole thing, i'd argue that through out this hearing there was a ton of knowledge and education being gained from all of this. It was even stated at the end that because of Facebooks out of no where Libra coin, that they will in fact be taking this seriously and devoting time to understanding better.
At the end of the day this was a good thing for Crypto as a whole
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:29:28
If it averages at around 14k again after that dip ill be impressed
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:51:59
Im still new to this, but I would imagine the price is dropping because tomorrow is Christmas eve
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:24:36
Might not be wise to trust your gut feeling 
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:55:38
It may not make you worry, but there are plenty of people who would do this and not think twice about it. As far we know someone who would do this probably believes their emails are 100% secure. Im sure that could apply to plenty of people if not me or you.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:28:21
Exactly my point lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:42:00
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:21:01
Sorry for what
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:41:31
Still waiting for the dip
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:51:18
BIIIIGGGGGG Yaaaawn. Lol im just being petty right now, cause iv tried to come to the same resolve, but it only suits you when you decide its enough ig Lol

this is a 14k coaster ride rn

Technology wise, how much is Bitcoin really worth to all of you?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:10:45

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:03:15
geez dude. Relax
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:58:27

Best comment all night
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:07:16
Someone hodl me
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:05:24
I think I know plenty about blockchain, and I know where bitcoins values sit. My issue is bitcoin as of now is nothing but a preservation of wealth behind security despite its original goal. We can talk and compare building blocks of other projects of the past that did see the light of day until were blue in the face. My point is people seem comfortable were bitcoin is right now as a store of value when its the only real example of a truly decentralized asset.
Also you're wrong about the wallet comments. There have been reports to very specific hacks that involved getting access to peoples emails and finding their keys through that process. No trickery involved. This is a lot deeper than that of something as simple as a scam or con artist.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:32:27
Either he spammed my comments with down votes, or people are that stupid Lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:27:27
Some say its slowly bleeding out, but all I see is an endless cycle of 13 to 14k, limbo
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:27:38
Your comment is ridiculous and serves no value of an argument to what iv said, the same applies to your last response on my last comment Lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:12:18
How big of a dip are we expecting?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:58:36
No I was here, but what happened to BTC dipping to $8000 like people were saying?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:20:38
Here comes the second dip ... Hodl me 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:53:06
I wouldn't say its over, but its withstanding the dips pretty well so far
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:22:17
Currency is a system of money, so at the end of the day .... its still not either.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:58:40
Merry Christmas Eve
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:03:05
How right you are my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:28:50
Bitcoin dropping to 10k isn't necessarily a bad thing is it
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:42:04
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:44:00
Anyone know the cause of this dip?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:09:51
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:48:19
Yeah I believe that
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:33:09

I bought at a pretty high price too, fortunately it wasn't much and i bought more during the last big dip. HODL

you make 0 sense

TA isn't about looking into a crystal ball.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:49:51
Is everyone on this reddit just a complete amateur? I'v only started learning about crypto TA when the crash happened but I could tell you right now this bear break out was seen coming, and its best for the market right now.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:39:22
Dude, don't take my reddit posts seriously Lmao, I fuck around a lot on these threads cause no one knows what they're talking about. i know enough to understand we were still in a downtrend and the probability for breaking out bearish was high.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:41:55
whales taking profit, this is why I only buy bitcoin for the long term
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:36:31
Yeeeesss. Let it fall fall fall
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:37:34
so is crypto dead
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:42:54
Not sure if I should buy more now, or wait for some correction. Hmm.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:19:05
Besides that, your reddit history tells me you're a little too pretentious in the face of logic or progression. But hey, not like reddit posts can be an accurate representation of character can it Lol. Good luck to you as well 
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:40:09
"Bitcoin is dead, get out while you can"
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:30
Are you asking this cause the dip scared you lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:41:04
Strap in, imagine this but a whole year of it
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:53:18
Can people stop buying already, were not going any higher
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:12:13
What can be done to give bitcoin a less volatile value?
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:21:52
ofc i am, theres no point buying with this small volume. Were not gonna get a strong enough bull run to break through 9k until we dip lower.
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:57:52
Part of it is people memeing, and the other half are just trying to push the price up. its hard to tell the difference but in general this sub is toxic either way.
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:24:15
the bulls are putting up a fight
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:54:30
hang boys, we might be going to 5k
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:14:08
Even though it was mainly selling at least we have more volume right now
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:00:23
So ...... is it finally safe to say bitcoin is dead?
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:29:25
Why does everyone get excited over any bull run that happens. Celebrate when we have a strong run through 9k. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:49:42
how is reaching the market cap going to help
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:49:20
If theres not enough buyers to pump just let it fall.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:17:07
I expect 0.00001 bitcoin by the end of the month
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:07:05
id say were close to the anger stage
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:46:51
come on guys, keep an upwards trend going here
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:11:48
Guys, what was it like? To be in the bullish market? I got in at the start of the bears. What does happiness feel like?
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:19:20
 If we wanted a centralized currency controlled by a company we would just stick with normal fiat. Even if USDC does succeed in mass adoption, it doesn't mean its success will hurt bitcoin. They have two different purposes and goals. There are other stable coins that have been out before USDC so its not like its anything new. Bitcoin and other cryptocurenccies have room to improve, but more importantly it is possible for it to improve.
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:47:59
We could see a bull run up to 9000 again in the position were in, but we still need to break through that to change things up. Bought in but still holding on some cash just in case this goes south.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:45:06
While everyone else is in fud im gonna be buying the bottom
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:19:17
im saying there were a lot of people who were introduced to bitcoin during Decembers bull run and need incentive to buy in during a serious dip
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:56:06
Everyones starting to get into the anger phase, make sure to catch the bounce
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:10:20
I dont understand why people keep buying these tiny dips. Save your money so it can fall further and we can look for the bull run we need.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:54:13

@_date: 2018-03-24 18:34:28
I get it guys, were all waiting to make money. But shouldn't we talk about ways to help crptocurrencies become actual viable currencies?
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:19:44
Why tf can't we break through 9k?
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:02:28
For anyone in this sub who's still serious about this, we're continuing to follow the wall street cheat sheet, look it up
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:24:46
doesn't matter if we go up or down, but we need to go somewhere. This moving sideways trend is killing volume since all we seem to be doing is slowly bleeding out.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:24:32
im calling it: 30k in 3 days
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:38:05
All this thread has is blind faith and unfunny memes trying to mask poor investment decisions 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:55:14
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:37:08
are all the weak hands gone?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:39:30
Look at this, somebody come look this
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:26:29
Is this is a trap?
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:05:57
I'd say its more likely to see continued support around 9k considering the past areas of support behind it, it can go either way though at 9k
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:43:31
At the end of the day its a matter of investing because you believe the technology is valuable, not because you're looking to make a quick buck. We're seeing everyone who got involved with cryptocurrency just to cash out jump ship now, leaving only those who are actually invested in the tech and those who dont have weak hands. Buying at moments like these are the moments others will look back on and wish they bought during our current dilemma 
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:08:59
Nows the time to break through 9k guys, lets get this shit done
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:35:12
Whats pathetic is having blind faith
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:39:47
When I say technology im not just referring to blockchain, but the concept of cryptocurrency in general. Blockchain technology is not tied to the price and its also not even tied exclusively to cryptocurrency as a whole
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:48:00
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:45:38
What gives Crypto value besides its market 
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:01:24
is bitcoin officially dead yet
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:48:30
This kind of drop is normal, it only seems more grand because of the price range were at now
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:45:49
So basically what you're telling me is that you're statement is based off of an assumption, alright
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:18:00
Last chance to sell before 5k
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:10:45
you said this already
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:16:43
Down to 5k we go
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:07:36
how many dips are we gonna have to go through before we get a real bull run
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:15:51
Lol so many hurt individuals, im just here to keep the balance towards the flood of naive optimism 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:32:34
Majority of the gains from these recent bull runs were just whales manipulating the market, they're slowly taking their profits from everyone who took the bait, not enough buyer demand to sustain the buy wall thats being torn down by whales
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:08:54
Either that or its the whales raking in their profits
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:29:12
Can we just accept that this was a dead cat bounce
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:33:27
5k here we come
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:03:04
I don't think that matters. The lack of sell volume will help develop the buy volume, giving people more incentive to keep the bull run going
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:42:57
I don't care for threads, just a bunch of baseless opinions
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:51:21
Its called probability 
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:58:21
Stop acting like a child, you're responding with emotion. The recent bull run that we had went up 1k in 30 minutes. It was not a natural bull run.
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:48:47
Peoples caution and paranoia to not lose their money is whats really holding back the market right now, will see if the mind set behind this changes anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:11:31
Told you guys to get out while you can, gonna be buying around 5k
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:14:13
Actually I lean towards probability and evidence to support that probability
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:34:30
How low can you go
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:55:49
So who here fell for the obvious bull trap?
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:32:38
I dont know why everyone is so excited. We've slowly seen a lack of BOTH resistance and support. The volume is being compressed which will cause a break out that can take us on a short bull run, or a devastating bear run. Considering we still have a lot more correcting to do from the reckless support of 2017 its most likely gonna break out following the down trend.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:46:21
Im sure there will be easier ways for common users to secure their btc a lot more effectively. If it hasn't been made, then it will be made.
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:33:57
I would gladly use bitcoin if it was an option on big named sites like amazon or ebay. There are only so many places that accept it though.
