Don't take it too personally, you are probably going to see alot of negative reactions because alot of people lost literally tons of money.

At 500-to-1 I would through up a Franklin just for the long shot. So we are pretty much talking goxcoins for a dollar. Thats just me though, I got my coins(what little I had there) out of gox after the first fork and havent      looked back since.

Don't beat yourself up man, its just money and it happens to the best of us. I made quite a bit of money between the ages of 20-25 years old but did not know anything about saving, investing, or making your money work for you. Now I am trying to do it different this time around. Just take it as a life lesson and learn from it.

It actually has the potential to make it go either way, just depends on what happens.

 Man if this doesn't remind me of all the posts of "look at the new tesla that I just bought with my bitcoin", and this was in 2013 and I was kicking myself for waiting so long to find out about it at the time because I had cards and had been into folding before crypto and I just keep remember seeing these stupid little advertisements on pirate bay at the bottom of the screen begging for money where it has a btc and a ltc address for donations, and I just kept thinking to myself for over a year, "who places an advertisement asking for donations?". I felt oh so stupid when I finally figured it out because I would have literally been a millionaire had I kept up on technology, but hey I could have been one of the folks who left it all on Mt. Gox too, but I doubt it because I have been into 2FA since I found out about it.
