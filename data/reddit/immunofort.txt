I think you're misunderstanding how inflation is calculated. Inflation is the rise in prices adjusted for changes in real values. Your argument is for why there is/should be a continued real output. 
It's the difference between Nominal GDP and real GDP. As more goods are produced, the real GDP increases. Nominal GDP will be higher than real GDP by the amount of inflation.

A few things first though, from what I've read they didn't knowingly do it. Correct me if I'm wrong. The money laundering in this case was more due to lax control. One article I read stated that they had a backlog of 17,000 potentially  suspicious transactions to review. [article](
Have you actually read up on what happened or are you going by what is general rhetoric?


But before you do that you should actually investigate what happened yourself. No offence but it seems like you haven't an idea what really happened. Or maybe you just see a lax in compliance as equivalent to active laundering. But I certainly think they are quite different and that active laundering, knowing that what you are doing is outright legal, is much worse than simply being a blind idiot.


So they weren't doing it knowingly. Well I suppose it might be a case of turning a blind eye, but I find that hard to believe considering they must have known the potential fines.
Let's say they thought that the fine would only have been 100m. I think that's quite a believable potential fine. The next question is, how much are they making from each transaction? They probably charge a commission, even if they were to charge 1%, which I think is quite high, they would have to launder over $10 billion. Going by the figures on that page, the sum of all the shady transactions comes nowhere close to that.


If we stick to what seems to be the case, that is lax compliance rather than full on laundering, then they wouldn't have charged a hefty fee.

Obviously you've never done economics past a basic level. Once you get into the higher level courses you actually do some fairly intensive calculations. At the very least you need an understanding of basic calculus. Certainly not that advanced, but I think understanding the basics of calculus puts you well above "poor background in maths" and into "A well grounded background in maths"


They're taught much more than just the federal reserve system. Another indication you've never done more than the basics. Neo-classical growth model, exchange rate mechanisms, types of markets; monopolies, monopsonies, perfect competition, monopolistic competition, production functions. Do I really need to go on?


I doubt it to be honest. Finance majors are actually taught a lot about risk and diversification. I think if anything finance majors would stay out of it, they have much more exposure about the types of risk there are in any investment. I'm a finance major myself and I think it's intriguing, but the inherent instability, even though it currently is upwards, keeps me away. 
Also, day traders wouldn't have any effect on the inter-day price. They close their transactions by end of the day. Each purchase is also associated with a sale, they do not produce a net demand.

When there is a lot of volatility, speculators come into the market thinking they can time the market. People who actually want to use it as a currency don't because of the uncertainty involved.
If volatility did scare away nervous speculators, you would see "speculators" putting their money into well diversified funds which is obviously contrary to the real world.

You need to take a class in basic logic.

Again, it might be obvious but you still have to back it up or you're just guessing. And even it if does seem obvious, it might not be so. Human intuition can be pretty stupid sometimes.

This is far far outweighed by the downside IMO. The downside of the no chargebacks is, *no chargebacks*. What if you don't receive the good or service, with paypal you can get your money back. It increases the safety for buyers and buyers are the ones who hold the power because for most goods and services there are many choices. Monopsonys might prefer Bitcoin due to the increased certainty of payments but lacking that situation, buyers will use the method that gives them increased certainty of goods and service which is paypal.
Lower transactions costs might sway them into using Bitcoins, however on it's own the fact that there are no chargebacks is a negative for the future of Bitcoin.

Irrelevant, it doesn't add anything by itself or to an argument which adds or takes away from anything I said.

Wow. Dogma? I was making a statement of fact. Money laundering only covers proceeds from illicit activities. Regardless of whether you see what is define as illegal as fair or not is irrelevant. We are arguing with regards to the law which is pretty clear in its definitions.

Advocates of bitcoin are claiming that it is the better model. To say that "Well you don't have any better ideas!" is a pretty poor argument. The onus is on advocates of Bitcoin. You should be trying to convince the skeptics. To simply tell the skeptics that "You don't have any better ideas" is pretty damaging to the idea of bitcoin to others. If you can't present an a good argument yourself, why should anybody else believe your conclusion?&gt;
We shouldn't expect it to be perfect from day one, but volatility is volatility. It might become less volatile, but it might not as well. You're assuming that it will decrease in volatility, or maybe even just that the possibility exists, and it might be the case but until the arguing on "let's see what happens in the future" can go both ways and therefore doesn't add anything to the argument. You can only look at what is happening now.

TBH that speaks more to financial illiteracy than any flaw in the currency. It's a currency, one of it's function is as a store of value, but you should not be using it as a store of value over the long term. It's arguably a good thing. One of the criticisms of bitcoin is that there is a lesser incentive to spend if when it's appreciating.


It very well could afford it depending on the state of the economy. You have to remember one of the more important metrics than simply looking at the amount of debt, is the growth of debt relative to the growth of income, or rather GDP in this case. If GDP growth rate is higher than the interest rate, and if they paid just the interest on the debt, then the principal amount would start diminishing.

Did I ever make that argument? I said that in order for it to be a successful currency, it has to be spend. That is a fact, there is no way to deny that.

I did answer your question. I was somewhat agreeing with you. I'm going to modify your question a bit first before I answer it a bit more explicitly because it's obviously a loaded question.


They shouldn't care. Which is what I'm saying. If your money is not proceeds from illicit activities, they will not care. You could do with your money exactly what money launderers do. They should not, and will not care.
If your proceeds are from illegal activities, then obviously they'll care because of the illegal activities themselves and because the illicit proceeds enable/motivate even more engagement in the illegal acitivity. Note I am not making an argument as to whether those illicit activities deserve to be illegal or not. 
And this time try not to respond with insults OK? I'm trying to have a civil discussion, if you resort to insults then I'll do so in kind and we'll both be worse off.

Armored vehicles is only an overhead with regards to physical cash.
If bitcoin were to have a physical component then I'm sure it would also need armored vehicles. That overhead is irrelevant when comparing bitcoins to traditional money because it concerns an advantage that bitcoin doesn't have.


Well that's pretty vague. Can you be more specific?


That would still exist with bitcoin, it would probably just be a lot more distributed, and if it doesn't exist, then it's going to be due to the difficulty in clawing money back. Sort of similar with the first example in that it is a cost, but only with regards to the advantages that you do have with traditional money.
Let's compare the two situations. Somebody gains access to your bank account or steals your credit card information. The bank will look into the issue, and if they find that what you are saying is true, assuming you are free of fault they'll likely give you a near full refund. I think with credit cards you're only liable for $50 max. As you said there is a cost of human labour, but you also have benefits such as protection from fraud.
Now with bitcoins, someone gains access to your wallet and transfers all their money to their own wallet, or someone scams you, promises a good but never sends it. What recourse do you have? Absolutely none. At most you can tell people about how this certain user is a scammer. Will that bring your money back? No it won't.


Once again, it concerns the physical currency which bitcoin does not have. If you're going to point towards some of it's costs, you're also going to have to accept that it has it's upsides. Bitcoin is useless without connectivity. How are you going to pay someone if the power goes?
@_date: 2013-06-07 04:50:19
I think you're assuming that people are being too rational. Let's take an extreme example of someone that runs around with said gun with 1 live, and 5 blanks, and starts shooting it randomly at people. If a cop were around, he can prevent a possible death beforehand by stopping him before he gets to 6 shots at which point near certain death would occur. Though I think these extreme examples hide the subtleties. Let's try something a little more subtle. Food safety. The goal of food safety laws is to reduce the chances of food causing illness or deaths. It's pretty similar to the gun case in which case there is a pretty good chance of things going perfectly fine, but a small chance of resulting in death. Let's say all food safety laws were removed. You were only charged on the basis of if your product causes deaths. 
The first thing is consistency in charges. Two companies might produce chicken eggs. Both companies might follow the exact same procedures but, one might have salmonella free eggs whilst the other has contaminated eggs. How do you go about prosecuting the company that sold the salmonella contaminated eggs? If the company that was salmonella free did nothing wrong, then the company that sold the contaminated eggs also did nothing wrong. The only difference was luck. Or the flipside might be that both companies do everything to the highest of standards but somehow some salmonella laden eggs might slip, after all not every single egg is individually checked. As you might prosecute some companies for having bad policies and producing bad products, you would also have to prosecute companies that do everything right, and just happen to be unlucky. Essentially you're punishing them for bad luck.
The second point is that, punishment isn't going to bring back a dead person. A fine or time in prison is less preferable to simply having that person alive again. So on a basis of public policy, having the rules is also better. There is a cost of having regulation so I will say that too much regulation can be a bad thing, but that is not an argument as to why there should be none which is essentially what you are arguing for.

Hostile much? You're not convincing anyone by calling me an old fuck. No idea where that came from. 


No, I explicitly agree with that kind of statement in my post when I said "We shouldn't expect it to be perfect from day one" 
Can you predict the future? Do you know with absolute certainty how bitcoin will be in the future? No you can't. Nobody can say for sure how it will turn out whether good or bad. It is an unknown therefore you can't rely on the line of argument of "Give it time" because given time it could well turn against you. If I lost half my money in a game of 50/50 odds, it would be stupid of me to argue "Give it time, I'll win my money back". 


No you haven't proved that. All you've given is evidence that " Just look at the bad news about Mtgox et all. The price didn't fall this time, it only goes up." So a decrease in volatility for the past few months relative to a few specific events means that it's become more resilient?


Again, that's really just a stupid argument. You don't have to offer an alternative in order to criticise someone or something. But in this case I impliedly have. Traditional fiat currency since that is really the base we argue from when we discuss "What makes bitcoin better"

The argument is that deflation would **dampen spending, not entirely eliminate it**. So using your computer example actually proves this point to an extent. People do hold off from buying some tech goods if they anticipate that something new will come out in the near future. Some people did hold off from buying, say an iPhone 4S when they heard the iPhone 5 was shortly being released. Did announcing the iPhone 5 coming out in a few months completely eliminate sales of the 4S? No it didn't. Did it push some people away from buying the 4S and instead make them wait for the 5? It probably did.

I don't know where on earth you got that idea from but most people will not lose money on investments. If they did then the average expected return on investments would be negative, and therefore it would mean that index funds are losers. They're not. If you put money into an index fund you'll gain around 8% a year in the long run.
What you probably meant to say that most people will lose money when gambling. Gambling =/= investing

Would you be OK with me loading 1 live round and 5 blanks into a revolver and firing it a couple of times while point it at your face?

Inflation means there is a decrease of demand for the currency
Only in a situation where the currency has a fixed amount available. Inflation in the USD certainly doesn't mean there is a decrease in demand for it, it simply means that the purchasing power of it has decreased.


No a currencies like that fails when the issuers start printing shitloads of it. 
Your arguments are misplaced, Please read my argument and really look at what I am arguing, don't just spout off what you typically would against similar sounding arguments. I never stated that Bitcoin would experience a catastrophic failure. It doesn't need to to fail, the conditions which might occur to dampen spending might be the cause of it's failure. You don't need to crash your car into a tree in order for it to break down do you? It could happen over the course of 10 years.
The emphasis I placed was on it being a successful **currency**. If you want it to become a successful currency it has to be spend, otherwise it just becomes a commodity.

You're seriously asking this on Pretty obvious you're just looking for a circle jerk. I think if you actually want a decent comprehensive answer rather than a circle jerk go ask this question on or You'll notice that basically every response is "Because big money" type answers. Even if it's true those answers show a complete lack of due diligence with regards to knowing the exact issue at hand.

MV = PY, equation for the money supply/demand
My argument is basically that V would decrease

210BTC is only about $22,000. You will definitely not be retiring in a few years with that amount. You won't even be retiring in a few years with 2100BTC which is only ~$220,000. You'll need at least 3-4 times that generally speaking.

Yeah... no we don't. As stupid as they might be sometimes, they still are useful to society. You don't need to be a genius to be able to do a repetitive task.
I also like how you're extremely vague in all your examples. Can't point out anything specific can you?
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:29:26
I think the problem with your analysis is that you look at it from the POV of Bitcoin already being successful, and then comparing it to traditional fiat currencies. 
Moderate deflation is not a problem for bitcoin - if it is a widely used currency. The argument I think that is being made by most people with regards to why deflation is bad, is that it is a hindrance to Bitcoin becoming widely used in the first place. In order for Bitcoin to become successful currency, it requires people to spend it and really use it, and if it's deflationary, then it will dampen spending somewhat and therefore decreases the chances of Bitcoin becoming a successful currency.

You do realise that this subreddit itself is pretty much also giant circlejerk right?

Income &amp; sales =/= profit. There's a massive difference between the two.
