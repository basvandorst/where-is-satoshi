Of course not, comrade. It's not terrorism when committed by the state and funded by the approved currency!
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:39:26
It's also irresponsible to tell a new driver not to be careful when operating a vehicle. Similarly, telling new users that they shouldn't concern themselves with the security implications of not controlling their private keys potentially sets them up for failure (e.g. loss of coins) down the road. I'd rather say things that are correct than mislead people.

It's important to remember this is the internet, and people often feel empowered to act like assholes, trolls, or whatever terminology you prefer to use. Some people are also stupid and feel compelled to share an opinion no matter how unfounded it is. That alone probably accounts for the vast majority of such comments.

Yeah that's not even remotely what I was saying. Thanks for the deep analysis of what I actually think and believe based on your own colored lens, though.
I'm not crying about needing regulations. I don't expect any government to take action whenever an exchange runs away with coins or someone otherwise fails to secure what is theirs. But that doesn't mean I need to believe it's permissible to steal; only that it doesn't surprise me when it happens.

Speaking of apples and oranges, coinbase isn't a bank.
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:28:07
I'd presume that they'd keep default bitcoind ports open, but only allow https/http connections after authentication/payment. A company I used to work for did something similar for guest wifi, but only allowing http/https connections to a specific destination (which allowed content on a disclaimer page to load) until accepting the terms of said disclaimer, after which they'd be temporarily authenticated and given additional access.

Merry Christmas and a happy new moon!
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:05:18
It's mostly an example to illustrate the point. The operator could probably whitelist a handful of websites for web based wallets and have a few other ports open for people using other clients (e.g. Electrum, phone apps, etc.). They'd allow some of the more common methods, but they'd probably have to draw a line somewhere. The 'what if' scenarios when you fall outside the line drawn would be similar to what happens if you have an AMEX card but a store has no merchant agreement to process AMEX... you won't be able to purchase unless you can figure out another method that is accepted.

So do exchanges and dice sites. I can have a friend hold money for me, would that make him a banker? If I bury money in my lawn, is that a bank? Just because something or someone is holding money for you doesn't make it a bank.
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:37:06
I don't know about the implementation, but a few questions come to my mind. Who decides if the leak is worthy of the reward? How extensively would the information be vetted for accuracy? What if multiple people come forward in a short time period?
I'd also worry that having a well known figure transmit the funds could result in negative consequences for the figure, legal or otherwise.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:11:11
You just enjoy arguing don't you?
I wasn't calling people assholes for pointing out the lack of regulation. I'm pointing out that there is an abundance of such behavior online. I never said that's the only possible motivation, just that it would probably account for the majority of the noise. Perhaps I'm guilty of my own condemnation of expressing an unfounded opinion there, but I can admit that and move on. I still don't see what's so controversial about suggesting that at least some of this comes back to that.


I never disputed that point. Show me where I argued otherwise. Hence my statement that I don't need to believe it's permissible to steal. Legality/Technicality doesn't inherently equate to morality. Can they do it under the TOS? Of course. Does that mean I find it permissible? No. Am I calling for regulation or legal action? No. Obviously we're using a different criteria and definition of permissible. You don't need to explain that which I've already stated agreement with.
Here's a link to the [reddiquette]( by the way. You're free to use your downvote as you wish, but I don't think you're using it properly.

@_date: 2014-02-13 16:38:39
Can anyone explain why so many people are doing this? It's not like throwing a bitcoin logo or a qr code onto your credit card enables you to transact in BTC when you swipe your card. To me it screams "Bitcoin is awesome but look I'm still beholden to the banking institutions! Look how useful this is... on my credit card... crap."
Perhaps someone can enlighten my perspective? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:49:21
Indeed. I for one am subscribed to both.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:51:40

If I'm understanding what you're proposing correctly, I don't see how this solves anything. Most users aren't going to be watching the hashrate distribution among pools closely enough to make this setting once, much less at intervals or before each transaction. Who gets to be the "default" pool? That's where the miners will rush.

Lol. "A paper" was linked on a facebook page at some point in the last few weeks, eh? That's still kind of vague, and definitely not worth trudging through a bunch of crappy memes in the hopes of possibly finding the post you're referring to.

Maybe as a gift-card, (e.g. here's 20 bucks, give me 20 WalMart Coins) but there will still be a standard, accepted form of payment outside of that. People aren't generally going to bother with converting their money to each store's seperate coin/currency.

Not subbed, but I took a look and that was a pretty substantial portion of what I saw posted. No need to get butthurt about it. I'd also add that you're the one citing conclusions from said paper, it's not unreasonable to expect you to link to it, not pull the equivalent of throwing a deck of cards in the air and saying "go fetch me the 8 of clubs".

Trade disputes can also generate conflict. Bitcoin doesn't change that.
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:29:53
Right, but that was a massively requested change - for a while it was either  or  on the community wishlist and they shot it down. If that would fail it's unsurprising that they wouldn't go for Bitcoin transactions, either. The work is already done, all the people wanted was Linux ports in cases where they exist to be made available.

I don't think there's much you can do but wait and hope for them to come back online once they resolve the issue with their bank accounts. I see they make reference to doing a withdrawal, but I'm not sure of the process on this, you'll probably need to submit a support ticket if you haven't already. This would be a good example of what can happen when you leave your BTC in a wallet/service you don't control, unfortunately.
