This. While I'm curious whether they'll settle on a big blockchain like ETH or BTC, the prospect laid out on their page sounds like a pretty cool idea. I'd like to see more well-known companies experiment with blockchains like this as it brings legitimacy to the whole space and will illustrate the benefits of the technology to average Joes and Janes.

I'm aware of that, but they should have announced the specific day that it would launch. If a company says, "we're going to do x in 2018," you would think they'd give some further updates on it. It's like telling your friend you're going to come over tomorrow and just showing up at his door at 2am.

This has nothing to do with my investment decisions. I've had BCH since the fork and never stored it on Coinbase. My frustration comes from Coinbase's lack of clarity and likely manipulation of the market at the expense of new users. I'm not really sure what your angle is here. Do you work for Coinbase? Do you hate Core and only support BCH? It's pretty apparent that a lot of other people agree with me on this, so I'm trying to figure out why you're so upset that I'm upset.

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:20
Bro, you have no evidence that I would be butt hurt and mad at Coinbase no matter what they did with BCH.
You're absolutely right that all of those things *could* have caused the rise. However, Occam's Razor suggests that it's extremely likely that if there was profit to be made by front-running the launch, people would take advantage of it. Coinbase shot themselves in the foot by providing barely any advance notice of their intent to launch BCH support early. Had they given even 24 hours notice, people could have prepared and traded accordingly, but when only a few hours notice is given for something that clearly will impact the market (e.g. when they listed Litecoin it pumped), there was bound to be chaos.
Will I? Sounds like pure speculation to me.

When I used the word upset, I meant it in the sense that I'm disappointed. When you expect transparency from a prominent company you transact with and they fail to give that to you, it's reasonable to be disappointed with them. You keep harping back to this four months thing, but I already stated my case on that. There's no other metaphor I can give you that explains the logic behind this better than the showing up at your friends door at 2am after saying you're coming over tomorrow.

Silver has many industrial uses, and demand for it is increasing for use in photovoltaic cells, electronics, etc.  It's very undervalued at the moment due to the massive paper short positions that institutions have placed on it.  Despite this, JP Morgan (and presumably other large financial entities) are purchasing large quantities of *physical* silver.
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:32:33
I still see them as being contradictory, but I'm not going to downvote you.  You said *the market* has priced in all scenarios.  I view the market as a separate entity from a bunch of individual traders and their personal feelings regarding the risks they're taking.  As soon as some of them either realize their predictions were wrong or they become uncomfortable with the risks they've taken, they will change their positions, resulting in a new price for the market.  I agree that the market is due for a large correction due to the illusory influence of the Fed and the mania that has come over all the young traders who've never seen a bear market, but I don't think everything has been priced in, otherwise we wouldn't get that correction.

I see what you're trying to get at with your idea, but thinking about it, it sounds absolutely horrible.  What happens if someone is too poor to hold 0.1 BTC? It might not seem like a lot to you or me, but for someone who lives in a less developed country or someone who struggles to get by and lives paycheck to paycheck it could be very difficult.  I don't think the rich or well off should be privileged in their voting abilities--that's one of the biggest things wrong with American society as it is right now, corporations and the rich can lobby ("vote") for things that benefit their own self interests.  I'm not down-voting you or anything; I just disagree.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big believer in Bitcoin and blockchain tech, but is this a joke? Are you actually being serious right now, because this is one of the dumbest things I've ever read on this subreddit.  A free market for drugs is one thing, and I think it's an admirable pursuit.

Yeah I read some people's questioning of that as well.  The fact that the devs have to remain accountable at all is a plus compared to some other crowdsales.  I think the project has the potential to blow up and introduce a lot of new people to crypto once it's freely available. Fingers crossed!

Maybe linking up to a social network or something to verify a user's identity would be less problematic.  Some people might have a privacy concern doing that of course, but as long as it was just a verification method, I think most people would be ok with it.

It appears bitcoins are going to start acting as a commodity due to their inherent usefulness.  They just as easily can coexist as a currency as well.  If companies want to use them in ways like the NASDAQ plans to, they will have to own actual bitcoins to do so.

Have 1000 bits to get you started. You can always try hitting up a faucet, or using sites like BTCclicks to make a little bit more.  I'm doing *ok* but not great financially and have some debt, but I figure I might as well save a little bit of money in BTC on the off chance it goes to the moon again.  Maybe you can do the same.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:06:34
The chips aren't mining chips like an ASIC is; they securely hash and, if I understand correctly, cloud connect to a massive ASIC farm under the control of 21.  Also, the last fraction of a bitcoin will never be mined.  It's an exponential curve which will never reach zero.  Granted, in or before 2140, we'll have to increase divisibility beyond the 8 decimals we're currently at, but by then if Bitcoin is successful, we'll have already done that much sooner since a satoshi will likely be of too high a value for micro transactions.

I've never bought from Changetip before.  That fee is a bit ridiculous for buying such a small amount though.  Coinbase's 1% or Circle's "no fee" (really it's closer to like 0.5-0.75%) is a much better deal.
My account on Capital One got verified today, so I was able to get the link.  [Here is is]( The person who referred me said that you need to complete 3 P2P (Person2Person) payments within 50 days after you open your account for the referral bonus to go through, so just make sure you do that.  You can probably send it right to your prepaid Visa.

Although I agree it's not really worth *my* time, some people who have nothing better to do or just want a few thousand satoshis to mess around with or tip people with might find them useful.  That said, just to be devil's advocate, I'd argue it's less idiotic since you don't have to pay for the energy use required for GPU mining.

The main appeal for me before realizing how many hoops I'd have to jump through was to be able to store USD balances in the same way I would store a BTC balance rather than trusting them to a bank or centralized online service.
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:35:58
I was unaware of the withdrawal minimum.  Also, that's everything I had in my Changetip account.  Why don't you send him the difference so he can withdraw it rather than laughing at my tip.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:41:38
No problem :) Technically you can store it with Changetip, but I wouldn't recommend it.
The absolute best way to store it would be locally in either a paper wallet, hardware wallet, or encrypted wallet on Electrum/Armory/Bitcoin Core.  The easiest way is to create a web wallet on [Coinbase (that's my referral link; we both get $5 if you sign up and get verified]( [Circle]( or [Blockchain.info](  Coinbase and Circle both insure their users' funds against theft, etc.  Since you aren't storing tons of money and are new to everything, I would go with one of the web wallets.  The beauty of Bitcoin is that you have a ton of options and different levels of security that you can choose from.

I was hoping something would pop up since Chiliphone is no longer working.  I like the ability to save the call as an mp3; nice touch.  One suggestion: on Chiliphone, you sent money to a wallet on the site, made your call, then had the option to be immediately reimbursed your remaining balance or to leave it there and have it automatically refunded to the sending address in 30 days.  I like that option much more than having to pre-determine how long my call is going to last.  If you could do something like this in addition to finding lower rates, that would be awesome!
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:04:25
Who knows, this may actually be a viable strategy in the future ;)  In 2013 it cost 9.4 cents to mint a nickel.  Once the dollar devalues a little more and the mint starts mixing cheaper metals into nickels, they very well could become similar to junk silver and be worth more than face value.

Basically, yes.  They're talking about using a colored coin which is a bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin that has other information attached to it.
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:07:59
Unfortunately, Coinbase doesn't work with prepaid cards.  Definitely give the "other banks" option a shot when you have access to your routing and account number if you want to get verified and buy/sell through them, but you should be able to use them solely as a web wallet for BTC without connecting your bank.  I think to get the $5 referral bonus you need to link a bank too.  I'm not sure why your login info wasn't working though.  Is it only for your prepaid Visa or is it part of a bank account too?
As a side note, if you need a checking account without having a credit check run, I can send you a referral for Capital One where we both get $50 once you sign up.  No worries if you're not interested; I just figured I'd let you know.

I'd been meaning to try out Celery for a while.  I signed up under your referral and bought a little bit.  The process was very quick and easy.  I think I prefer Buttercoin's UI and their couple extra features, but they're also more expensive for small transactions and have been having technical issues with their referral program which has dissuaded me from using them.
It's interesting that Celery's referral bonus is applied as a credit for a future buy rather than a deposit into your account.  Haven't seen that yet. I also like the "packages" you can buy.  That's a nice idea for newcomers to bitcoin.  Anyways, if anyone wants to get a little referral train going for the site, [here's mine.](

The service they offer right now is that of a broker.  As an exchange, you should be able to trade between currencies in real time rather than waiting for bank transfers and set your own price with limit orders.

Wow, absolutely incredible talk. I've always kind of had a bias against Apple due to their closed ecosystems, but listening to this gave me a whole new perspective on the man behind the company's initial vision. I'm even strongly considering buying an iPhone instead of an Android device for my next phone.
The parallels to modern society and the concerns we're facing today are wild.  I'm in my mid 20s so my experience and understanding of the world is just coming into focus. Some of the questions the audience asks are still relevant today, albeit with a new perspective on technology. The question about central databases really stood out to me and the non-nonchalance of Jobs in regards to how powerful the individuals holding the keys to this data have become. Still, his genius is undeniable, especially considering I'm listening to this speech on a "book-sized" device on a network of computers that could hardly be conceived by the general populace at the time.
Bitcoin and blockchain are a layer of abstraction higher than computers in terms of replacing inefficient, legacy systems, but the inevitability and potential of programmable money still can't be dismissed. When I first got into Bitcoin, I expected the changes to happen much quicker, but now that I have a greater understanding of it, I'm content waiting another few years to see how it reshapes our world. I really hope Bitcoin is *The One Blockchain* to rule them all, but even if it's not, I'll be glad to have been a part of the beginnings of this incredible industry with you all.

There was already an 85% decline from the peak to the low in BTC. A lot of alts even saw 95%+ declines. This is pretty consistent with past bubbles. Right now we're climbing the wall of worry towards the next rally, probably starting later next year around the election and after the halving effects have settled in a bit. Could go lower short term, but the multi year outlook is pretty damn positive.

yeah must be on their end

For me, if I'm going to spend cash already, and I can get a discount for paying with Bitcoin, I'll pay with it and re-buy what I spent immediately or soon after.  That way I can save 20% at Starbucks, get cash prices on my precious metals, or save X% on Amazon and still be a long term holder invested in the tech.

Interesting. I hadn't read about that. I'm assuming you mean they support Bitcoin Cash? Are they actively buying nodes to help support it or doing anything else?
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:24:52
Absolutely, I agree that it most likely won't be efficient barring that they have a better ASIC chip, but that won't impact consumers of these devices at all.  If the average consumer is getting the device for free/at the same cost they'd normally pay for it, they're still going to be making at the very least a few cents of Bitcoin income per month which might get them more interested in the protocol.
21 might have to start making a profit from selling devices to supplement the amount they'll make from the 75% mining revenue share in the future, but I'd imagine that wouldn't be that difficult and wouldn't noticeably raise the price of the devices for consumers.  Their profit margins will likely be very thin, but I'm sure they'll still be able to make *something*.

Everyone commenting so far seems so disappointed, and I don't understand why.  Yes this is a really odd business plan, however, I can't wait to see what the results are.  Not only will this decentralize the network incredibly due to the potential for tons of new nodes (unless of course, the chips in the IoT devices simply communicate with a large mining farm owned by 21), it will help people who may not give a rat's ass about Bitcoin to get involved.
Even if I weren't interested in Bitcoin in the slightest, I'd still be more than happy to get a free external battery/router/whatever.  The pennies of revenue I'd make would simply be a bonus that might get me interested in Bitcoin as a whole and perhaps purchase more.  Who cares if 21 fails? At least they'll try, and the upside if they're successful is immense.

I was having that issue too. For some reason it only worked once I had 0.002 in the wallet.

Excellent news! This combined with the ChangeTip/Disqus integration has made today a pretty positive news day.

Hey, I have no problem with languages that don't need articles, but if there's an article written in English, there needs to be one there IMO.

Yes! 1000 bits

Nah, that's not why it bothers me.

Well my hope is that will pass that tip along next time he/she feels the need to ask someone else to send a tip.  People are probably a lot less likely to tip a bot though; at least I know I am.

Ahh good point.  I guess it just seems too early to eliminate the "technology" after it or the article before, but maybe I'm just a jaded English grad.

Very cool! It's exciting to see such an established and security-focused exchange growing amidst this crypto winter.
