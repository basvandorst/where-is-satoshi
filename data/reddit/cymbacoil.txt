Two questions.
1. Do you think we'll see 20k by the end of the day before it corrects?
2. What price do you expect the correction to go to?

What is the limit as bitcoin approaches infinity?

What other coins are good right now?

What about trading BTC for ETH.  No tax needed right, because there's no profit?

Even if it drops with all the people hodling, and buying on the dips, if we went back to like 8k, would that be so bad? In the short run yes, but BTC  should be a long run thought process

BTC has been gaining a lot of media attention ever since it hit 10k.  The masses may be buying in due to FOMO?

So basically you have to sell for 25% or more of what you last bought it for to break even?

My question for people hodling with no end in site...
Do you expect this to become useable as a currency, and the price to eventually steady out at an equalibrium?

How do taxes come into play with day trading?

Only if you've sold or traded bitcoin.  If you've just bought and hodl then you owe nothing

I bought in at 10.2k, sadly it dropped to like 9.4k about 2 hours after I bought.   In the long run it's not that big of deal and thinking of what I could have had instead of what I do have is unhealthy.  Im really looking forward to investing monthly, and with extra money I get from family for holidays.

Like me saying I shouldn't have bought my house last year, put my down payment into BTC, and lived with my parents poorinf all my money earned into BTC.
Looking back on it now, that would be the best investment, but at the time it's obvious why I didn't do it.  That would seem foolish

If these people put so much money in that a "burst" would ruin them, then they didn't follow the sticky thread.  Don't invest recklessly

What exchanger do you use?  I just got into cryptocurrecy and so I'm trying to so my research.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:26:43
Thank you, I'll look into it :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:26
Sure that would be bad but it would bounce back up a little from everyone buying on the drops

As someone who's only recently been interested in btc, is it too late to get in on it?
