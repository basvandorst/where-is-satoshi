I bought more during the crash.

I own both Trezor and Ledger. I like the Ledger better since it's easier to carry in my wallet. You may want to try that too.
But hey, I think you made a smart decision. Marry Christmas!

You can set up your Trezor with multiple pass phrases. You can just explain to them it's a BitCoin wallet and show them how you stored 0.1BTC in it. While you real wallet passphrase may have 100x or 1000x the amount of BitCoins.

How are you going to store and look up the trade and user account data?
Ignoring the DDoS attacks.. It seems to me the bottleneck of something like MtGox is not really which programming language, but rather how you're going to manage the large amount of user accounts and trade data. Just earlier in this subreddit I believe there's someone pointing out BitCoin-24's admin is using MySQL to store trades, and he's asking about how to do transactions in StackOverflow- and that's totally horrifying. Even ignoring that admin's incompetence in terms of basic database knowledge - there aren't a lot of methods to scale MySQL out for fast and large volume of writes (the usual replication tricks can only scale out reads, not writes) - and that is the reason why companies like Facebook would use other methods like Cassandra for messaging storage, and not SQL.
Also.. would totally appreciate it if you guys could make a reliable WebSocket or Socket.IO API.

But a trading bot induced into selling in the point indicated by your screenshot could have made off with some profits, OTOH..

It's not exactly zero, it's 0.00000012 (1.2 x 10^-7) BitCoins per trade. It shouldn't be allowed though.

No, I'm not saying it's MtGox doing something new - but rather the design of their exchange infrastructure is unsound in general. Transactions going dramatically slower despite expensive server configs and light load (as of this morning) is often caused by bad database infrastructure design. If they don't know how to design their backend architecture, throwing $1 billion worth of servers at the problem is useless.

There's not a lot of trade volume this morning. If I have to guess... it's not DDoS or HFT crashing MtGox - there're very few trades going on right now and the MtGox www server is responsive. But rather, I think it's MtGox's own technical infrastructure that is breaking down. They might be doing something stupid like storing all the trade records in one single MySQL database, and the table index has grown bigger than the available RAM, for example.

Yes.. that could get trading bots looking at order books to panic sell. Didn't seem to work so far though.
@_date: 2013-05-01 07:10:23
Yup... my trading bot is showing tons of "trades" at 1.2e-7 BitCoins. That's 0.000000012 BitCoins per trade. On Clark Moody's site those are showing as 0.0000 trades since they don't have so many decimals.
I have no idea how that's allowed though.

Btw.. in case you're confused, I'm NOT the guy responsible for this. My bot is only collecting data for testing at the moment.
