Yea, if you can't ahndle that might drop a little after you buy, just don't even bother getting in.  Just DCA your way in and you are set.

its not my only holding, but its strengths are undeniable. all alts definitely do have serious weaknesses. in most cases a centralized dev team sitting on a shit ton of their scamcoins just waiting to unload

i am not saying it will never happen, but all the current alts have massive problems for some reason. it will be created in 2 to 6 years when someone makes a true crypto breakhrough. none of this copycat + some gimmick shit

Perfectly acceptable way to DCA.  Many people would view that more as a trading strategy to get a good execution price though.

No, whether FIFO or LIFO, it is much better to hold for a year so your sale qualifies as a capital gain.

you would have to contact them individually to inquire. would be easy to find emails on their websites. if not, just convert to fiat and then buy them
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:56:03
when a site says an alt is worth $100 dollars. the site first gets the price for the alt in BTC and then converts to USD. Most alts are not traded directly for fiat. 
so like when you sell an alt for USD, you have to sell for BTC and then sell for USD. 
that is why for most alts, they are very reliant on BTC. if BTC falls, it will take down many of the alts as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:57:15

Very much agree.  But there is nothing wrong with selling a bit to diversify though if it will cause you great emotional stress.  Think about it.  If Bitcoin falls significantly, are you really going to be totally fine with that?  Are you sure you wouldn't wish you had cashed some out?

Superior tech doesn't gurantee successs. Cryptos are attempting to be a medium of exchange, so teh user base is very importnat . Bitcoin has the strongest network, users, and hodlers.  
Bitcoin is open source so we can let the other, new cryptos test out new features.  If features work really well and improve blockchains, we can easily bring them into Bitcoin.

Hodling has literally embarrassed numerous economic "experts" because they did not predict such people would believe so ardently in Bitcoin. It is an important meme &amp; philosophy in this sub.  It helps prevent newbies from losing too much money attempting to day trade.

Am just pointing out that, that someone who is holding and plans to spend their bitcoins doesn't need to worry about what price point that they will sell. Saying that someone bought back in 2013 but also now in 2017 doesn't mean:

This isn't random though. Bitcoiners have spent years and years building awareness for Bitcoin. Many bitcoiners care about the project, not just profits.  Their passion comes through in their discussions.  Many other coins have existed almost as long.  They don't sepnd time promoting their coins and building awareness. 
They focus on hijacking people brought into the space by Bitcoin evangelists. They just want to take advantage of the hardwork   that Bitcoiners have put in and fool the next "wave." They know most experienced bitconers won't fall for this FUD so they focus on spreading FUD to new bitcoiners.

Welcome! Just be aware its not always rainbows and unicorns.  There a lot of entrenched players with a lot to lose if Bitcoin succeeds.  People are going to continue to attack Bitcoin with very effective tactics.  When they do, it can be tough to hang on and hold to your core beliefs.
I just say as I warning because holding actually works if you don't panic during the dips.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:12:42


Bitcoin core's approach is to go slow and be careful.  They do not want to trade network security for short term benefits. They use the testnet before deploying major changes. If that is "not okay" with you, you should divest.  There is a reason that Bitcoin has the highest value and has the largest market cap.  It is the security of the network.  Other blockchains like ethereum and others like to go fast, and they spend a lot of time rolling back the chain and dealing with unintended errors.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:00:04

@_date: 2017-11-27 16:59:20
One big difference between now and prior bubbles, is that trading volume is spread across many more exchanges.
Historically it was primarily on 1 or 2 exchanges.  So if a large whale initiated a big dump, it incited panic amongst the get-rich-quick crowd. 
Now we have many, many more exchanges and the volume is much more spread out.  For this reason, I don't think the fear-based dips will be as bad.  We have accumulated a ton of idiots in the most recent run-up though, so correction could still be bad when they see their first dip.

No, of course not. The value of adding alpha from active trading has never been higher due to the popularity of passive funds.

Yes, that is what we originally thought.  Mainly was very amicable between both sides for a while.  Then they came up with this “death spiral” idea and started to very intentionally and deliberately try to make the network unusable. 
It was a very well coordinated with multiple avenues of attack.  Including: hacking bitcoin reddit accounts to shill, spamming the blockchain, spreading FUD and panic, PMing users about bitcoin's imminent death.
So now they go back to saying they just want to co-exist?  No, we can't be fooled again. They want to destroy Bitcoin and their actions show that.  They are no different than any other scammers promoting alt-coins at this point.

If you want to willfully ignore the evidence that's up to you.  But they have been publicly talking about and planning the "death spiral" for some time.  The confluence of all those actions occurring over the weekend was certainly planned and coordinated. You don't seem genuine if you don't admit that.  
Just spent 30 seconds googling and here is them discussing the "death spiral" plans 2 months ago:

The biggest difference is there used to be 1 primary exchange.  So someone  initiating a huge mark sell order could incite panic.  Now that there are so many different exchanges  and volume is way more spread out, its way tougher to create the "panic" needed to get the weak hands to panic en masse.

Disagree.  So many new users that have never bought are now entering the space and more than making up in the lost demand by the "dip waiters."

No, most current valuation models for Bitcoin completely suck.
I developed my own that we are using to trade, but i am sure as shit not sharing.
You seem to like commanding people.  This is bitcoin.  Associations are voluntary.  Don' t expect people to respond to demands like.  Thanks for the downvote even though I gave you a genuine response.

Yea, just to be clear not saying  you are a bcash shill, just that it appears to be their new tactics.  They knew there are a lot doe-eyed newbies and they are trying to take advantage.
I didn't downvote just FYI. Its just enough newbiews have already lost enough to these scammers. We don't need to enable them further.

I would also recc reading about the glacier protocol.  Hardware wallets are great, but they are not the only solution.  Knowing more about how to use offline computers, etc. will benefit you in the long run.

That is a very good policy.

Please show the Satoshi quote where he says that Bitcoin will supplant all fiat currencies.

Your post in "Bitcoin needs to die for the greater good of the cryptoverse" clearly shows where your financial interests are.  You are not concerned about Bitcoin, why bother with the act?  This is just a post intended to spread FUD.  You know it and I know it.  
Go ahead and continue your charade though.

Well, bcash supporters know they can no longer get to the front of But they are doing nothing to bring in new people into Bitcoin, so they know they need to poach our newbies that we worked to attract.
Just by mentioning them, it encourages newbies to check them out and get trapped by their lies / misdirection.

Dang, we only up 20% over the past 7 days.  What a failure!!!

Mining is a very tough game.  Tons of research required and just generally a pain.  You also have no control over teh rate at which other miners are turned on.
Definitely would not recc getting into mining unless you have a significant comparative advantage.

Everyone knows bitcoin is highly volatile during the price discovery stage.
Everyone knows that there will be big run-ups and corrections.
Everyone knows that fiat is far more stable right now and traders will use it.  It is not "contradictory" at all. Your entire post is a strawman.
Yes, eventually Bitcoin will be saver than fiat.  Yes, that is the future.  We all know we have a long way to go.
