Govt employees like him get paid to come up with ideas, whether the ideas are worthwhile or not.  I'm not meaning to bash him or govt but that's the reality.  Their measured contribution to society is almost non-existent.  This is why people publicly protest outside of buildings otherwise govt employees ignore modest protest like feedback online or letters written to them.

That's because that person doesn't understand bitcoin.  It's just a tool to transfer "money" to other people.  The status is that there aren't too many people that accept it as money yet.  But some people do.  I bought lunch with bitcoin the other day.  I traded bitcoin for a cheeseburger.  They can trade those bitcoins for computer parts.  That is what money is. 
Sometimes money increases in value (you can buy more with less money).  That is why some people are investing hoping they can buy more later.
Bitcoin is just money that not too many people are using yet.  Infrastructure is already built for other currencies so it's a relatively slow adoption.

Incentive to use bitcoin, willingness to spend bitcoin, and a businesses willingness to collect business are all necessary.  But honestly the average person in the world doesn't care about bitcoin unless they have to care about it.  Having worked in technical support, the average person barely knows how to use email.  Sure, there's a lot of people here that know the basics of bitcoin but if the average person has their wallet stolen because their password was "12345" then they've become disincentivized to use bitcoin.
I believe in bitcoin but it won't take off for a while.  And honestly online transactions are where it's going to be.

Licenses are usually a way to take away freedom or opportunity to specific license holders.  So rather than ban something entirely or allow it entirely, a license usually grants authority to a representative of the executive branch of govt to determine whether individuals or groups should be allowed to continue doing whatever they're licensed to do.
Money can be an incentive but it's hardly a motivation for the policy makers.  Policy makers don't directly see cash like that (sometimes, not always....or its very indirect).  We'd all like to think policy makers are motivated by this but it's largely to control, not collect.  Although, post policy, collection greed is certainly a motivation for those issuing the licenses.

I got all excited last year and started using bitcoin.  I believed that in order for bitcoin to take off that I ought to be on the forefront and start using it.  I've found Most buisnesses don't know how to use bitcoin.  For them, it's mostly novelty.
Anyways now I really dont care about using it in person.  I'd love for bitcoin to explode online as options like paypal need to be a thing of the past. But cash/card transactions are way easier.

To be fair, govt monopolies and socialist policies will eventually set us back 50 years.  What's actually true is economic policies are the best features of libertarianism.

Who pays police currently? The rich dude in town when no one else can afford security?  Does that actually sound how things do or should work?
Poor people are still required to pay for security under govt mandate. Those police may or may not return service.
Poor people can choose how much security and how much they can afford.  Rich people can donate services.  If poor are not receiving service they don't have to pay.  More than likely communities would still have communal security services. Except with a different scope of responsibility.

Also selling the debt to China.  Cuz that will never backfire right?
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:01:05
That's a good question.  The real answer is no one knows for sure which I'll explain.
The "market" decides the price based on services rendered.  Think about all of the things police (are supposed to) provide.  In reality, police have discretion to actually follow through with their enforcement.  E.g. police giving warning instead of ticket - or not charging fellow officer with crime.  The amount of time spent investigating charges would vary greatly. Police currently may or may not spend the zealous time they need to solve crime.  Prosecutors also have discretion on which crimes they'll prosecute.  I'd say those security packages would likely be bundled, probably on what you're willing to pay.  Yes, the wealthy would be greater served just like they always will. 
Looking at police with this kind of paradigm shift would totally change what kind of laws would be enforced.  Weed, other drug crimes and warrant searches wouldn't be fought on the highways.  Roadway rules would be served by private security staffed by high schoolers, because honestly enforcing road rules doesn't require armed, trained career folk to make sure people use their turn signals.  
Police currently contract out certain actions like serving papers or searching for fugitives.  Certain jobs would likely be contracted out.  Prices would also likely take into account risk assessments much like insurance companies currently do.  Age, area, disabilities, and education would be big factors.  As is currently, certain regions or cities account for more crimes than others.  In my state most violent crime occurs in two specific suburbs. It would probably cost more for security in that part of town.  In another part of my state has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.  Security would cost much less.  This isn't much different than those police departments are currently funded.  The prime difference is how it's allocated and collected. 
Also, depending on the business and socioeconomic status of regions, security would be applied much differently than others.   that's a more exciting example of how crime can be deterred in certain neighborhoods using clever tactics.

Libertarianism does...some of what you're saying probably depending on what you think libertarianism actually is.  I think there's a sufficient amount discrediting somalia as an example and I think you've sufficiently observed as much. 
As for the claim against monopolies...you should know that a very basic claim libertarianism makes is that govt *is* a monopoly. The solution is allowing competition. Not forcing participation. The way people are forced to any rule that democracy (or republic) decides.  Think, exitarianism.  Which is what some libertarians support and really nothing more.  Also recognizes that monopolies are not as evil as claimed.  Nothing forced us into paying for comcast or using facebook/YouTube other than perhaps social pressure or self imposed desires.  These problems are usually temporary anyway.  Is this an acceptable solution?  It's a paradigm shift.  Libertarianism doesn't directly solve this market problem.  
Environmental issues or disregard for public safety are either: a) still combated through court and retroactive enforcement which is at least as good/better as govt courts offer today and b) still imperfect and unpreventable by govt today, in which I'd refer back to point A.
For your other mentions, there isn't too much specific.  But something most libertarians have grappled with is the reality that govt *introduces* problems not accounted for in the absence or decrease of govt.  It's logically dishonest to compare western govt in its idealist form with the highest critiques of libertarianism.

The analogy would be better compared against credit card companies than banks - though they are closely compared.  Parcels will always be around.  Emails are also a different way to communicate. Banks will always be around.  Bitcoin will also be used along side it.

It's a paradigm shift, yes.  Those aren't quite the right questions. But are understandable questions.   Remember people and society is imperfect. Example:
If some issue is global, what exactly does any system have to offer other than mandated one world order?  I mean Hitler might have resolved climate change through total force and population control.  That technically would solve that problem.  But no individual freedom. Therefore unpreferable.
Nationalist views wouldn't exist the same way.  We wouldn't have a nation of states *probably*.  B
Some might choose it.  More than likely an equilibrium would occur where many states are there own nation.  More Iceland-sized nations.
As for paying attention to laws.  Laws wouldn't be the same.  Rather, I and my family could define a rule or law in my own territory but no one outside it would have to follow it.  Then again, if my sandwich shop chose not to subject itself to some kind of safety/health regulation, no one would trust eating there. Regulation would exist.  Think of the jewish/kosher stamps of approval you see on all sorts of food products.

Keep in mind they've had a policy in the past of straight up banning merchants for selling something that broke their rules.  That might sounds serious, but I'm talking about really minor stuff like improperly categorizing.  Merchants who spend hundreds of hours building their stores would simply be shut off.  On top of that, ebay felt it necessary to ban their IP address and their names, so that anyone in their households or even family members could no longer be ebay sellers.  
They've since tried to fix some of this, as far as I know.  But that kind of business practice absolutely deserves to suffer.

The concept of a "govt of the people" doesnt exist if that govt has more power, privacy, and control of your life than the yourself.  If your govt let's you keep your money, property, and privacy then it might actually exist as an institution to serve your interests.  If your govt doesn't really trust your privacy and property, then you are it's subject and you work for them.

The idea is once they're more concentrated in a democratic district they could slowly change that.  In theory, these people will be an active voting populace.  There's also a matter of other current residents who would also be interested in a more free state but the social norm is to vote with mainstream ideas.  A large exodus of new viters really changes predicting how voting will play out throughout New Hampshire.  Who knows, this could repel current residents who feel like they want to move away.  Of course, this project is an experiment.  We'll see what comes about.  But my point is this is a new way to eventually do away with taxation.  Sure they all pay taxes now but the objective is to peacefully put an end to that.

I'd have to think about that more.  That's in different territory. I'd argue, in this context, that the poor experience a form of positive externalities.  A more precise argument might be to say the takers of taxes benefit most and the makers, or higher tax payers, are the biggest losers.  The poor are simply losing less (as a percentage).

Inflation and deflation are objectively neutral observations.  However, as related to the comparisons represented in the post, inflation *is* bad.  Monetary inflation has absolutely devalued the value of the USD, which is what the USD was meant to be tied to gold. 
Bitcoin resolved that specific problem among currencies. It has other problems, perhaps, but it answers the monetary inflation problem.  If you didn't know that, and are trying to refute that point in a bitcoin sub then you're not going to fair well.
@_date: 2019-01-19 03:50:48
Monetary inflation is absolutely a problem when it benefits one segment of society over another.  Just because there are mitigating efforts like exchanging the dollar for ownership or other currencies ( like bitcoin), it doesn't render USD inflation virtuous. Monetary inflation is still a problem.

I can take out my plastic card, swipe a machine and I'm done.  Maybe a fake signature is all that's needed but that's it.  Honestly, what does it take for the average person to pay in bitcoin?  We need the ditsy blonde girl to pay in bitcoin at the salon before she wants out to her pink vw beetle.  
How I'm hesitant to say this in a bitcoin community because of the bias of it's users.  But in order for bitcoin adoption to take place, it needs to be as easy as a existing payment systems.  Which can make security more problematic, obviously.  
I'm tempted to offer my own ideas, but that would just interfer with designing a great adoption standard for bitcoin.  Having worked tech support and dealing with ~~dumb~~ all kinds of people, if bitcoin is to be common currency it needs to be simple.  It needs to be more simple than email (which people forget their passwords to all the time).  
IMO, people need help and need a bank-type system or company to help them and take care of them.  Not a bank to screw them, but one to take care of them.  I realize that's not very popular here.  There are many people capable of maintaining their finances themselves here.  But if we want widespread adoption, we have to think beyond ourselves.  This means implementing the design process.  Reach out and survey those who don't know what bitcoin is.  Find out what *they* want.  The bitcoin community as it exists in this thread largely understands how to get what they want form bitcoin.  Not completely, but in contrast to the rest of the population they do.  Don't get me wrong here, there is incredible value in the fact that bitcoin doesn't require a third-part bank system for it's operation.  But that doesn't dismiss the value of a bank, for the average person.
Other responses here are fine.  But the *biggest* problem has to do with not enough people using it.  Which means you need to be asking them.  You'll probably get more useful info to help change the world.

Basically starting something like Silk Road and having a defense like "Well all that evidence was just planted" with no evidence that it was planted doesn't really do much to change the expectations you're mentioning.

I have friends who were interested in bitcoin that same time period.  I told every one of them "You're going to lose money.  It's going to go down.  If you buy, you need to expect that it will go down.  That isn't your fault nor bitcoin's fault.  If you buy this and expect to make money, hold on to it for the long term."  If someone wasn't given this kind of expectation during that period, they would be disappointed.

imo many participants need to drop the sub and join a sub.  They're quite interested in progressing the centralist system.  Debt is ok and big government is hardly bad.  The idea of an electronic currency which is difficult to monitor transactions from the big monopoly is a threat to the status quo.  This is what is cool about bitcoin.  This is also what's so threatening to the people who disagree with bitcoin.
