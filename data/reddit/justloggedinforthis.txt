What's a "cd"?

Well, there is the **10 Steps to Fascism** by Naomi Wolf:
1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy
2. Create a gulag
3. Develop a thug caste
4. Set up an internal surveillance system
5. Harass citizens' groups
6. Engage in arbitrary detention and release
7. Target key individuals
8. Control the press
9. Dissent equals treason
10. Suspend the rule of law
It [can be argued]( that most of these have been fulfilled.
There is also [a serie of videos]( for those who wants to dig deeper.

Which one? I am going to guess you didn't read anything from the article...
edit: Examples:
1) Used to be "Communists", now it's "Terrorists".
2) Guantánamo Bay
3) a)Department of Homeland Security hired and deployed hundreds of armed private security guards in New Orleans. The investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill interviewed one unnamed guard who reported having fired on unarmed civilians in the city.
b) Groups of angry young Republican men, dressed in identical shirts and trousers, menaced poll workers counting the votes in Florida in 2000.
4) After Snowdens revelations about NSAs illegal practices, everyboy should be aware of this.
5) Many examples here, but one is  the American Civil Liberties Union reporting that thousands of ordinary American anti-war, environmental and other groups have been infiltrated by agents.
6) In 2004, America's Transportation Security Administration confirmed that it had a list of passengers who were targeted for security searches or worse if they tried to fly. Participating in peace protest might be enough to be put on the list, with no warning or information given.
7) a) Derailed the career of military lawyer who spoke up for fair trials for detainees 
b) Administration purged eight US attorneys for what looks like insufficient political loyalty
8) White House directing a stream of false information, in a fascist system, it's not the lies that count but the muddying.
9) Cast dissent as "treason" and criticism as "espionage'. Military Commissions Act of 2006 - the president has the power to call any US citizen an "enemy combatant". Removal of democratic principle [Habeas Corpus](
a) Keller case: Republicans in Congress called for Keller to be charged with treason, and rightwing commentators and news outlets kept up the "treason" drumbeat. 
b) Snowden?
10) The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 gave the president new powers over the national guard. This means that in a national emergency - which the president now has enhanced powers to declare - he can send Michigan's militia to enforce a state of emergency that he has declared in Oregon, over the objections of the state's governor and its citizens.

If he invests half in asicminer, and the other half in coinlenders, how will he pay for the BTCs?
