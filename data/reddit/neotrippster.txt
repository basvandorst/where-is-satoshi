That is absolutely not what I'm asking about. What I'm asking is that if one were to use **only** BTC and absolutely zero USD for a year how would they even pay taxes? The IRS does not accept BTC and this person would not have access to an exchange market if they dealt with only BTC, therefore no bank account.

After reading all this, all I got was "paying taxes on bitcoins is too hard so just don't worry about it".

Good point. I guess it just *seems* valueless because of the big numbers. I just posted to trying to get a better handle on the Doge concept.
You have changed my perspective a bit.

I think it's pretty easy to *not* buy a lambo.^just sayin

My rent is not that much, 650/mo. As for utilities, walk in local office, hand them cash, get a receipt. I pay my phone bill in walmart, and mail a money order to my insurance company every 6 mos. How is this so hard to understand? Banks are not a requirement (as much as they'd like to be), just a social norm.

It's beneficial in that it has exposed a lot of people to cryptocurrency that otherwise wouldn't have been. It's basically monopoly money of the internet in that 100,000,000,000 will be created giving them very little value. They are rather fun to throw around on the internet though.

Even if they did charge their 9% fee, it would be better than most localbitcoin offers. I would pay it. Hell, I'd change out a bill for quarters for it as I don't have (and don't want) a bank account.

I know my landlord well and have never had an issue handing them an envelope of cash. I don't walk though because it's much more convenient to drive. Have you really never heard of a landlord accepting legal tender for payment? It surprises me that any wouldn't. I give them cash, they give me a receipt, boom.

 Think it's an amazing idea. Doesn't mean there won't be opposition  Rarely does a great idea go unopposed.

I feel like you should include in the wording why it would be good for the company. I would say that it would attract many people who want bitcoins that would not otherwise consider using their services.

26 and cash for everything. I'd like to change it to bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:26:19
Yeah, Im just gonna go with that. Come and get me taxman.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:24:21
EZ. Give cash to my landlord.

That only affirms their tactics, but does not address the fact that they can't squeeze water from a stone. They do not accept BTC as payment, and this theoretical person does not have access to USD.

If I understand your question correctly, an exchange rate over market value when making a purchase is a good thing. It means you are spending less for the product.
Example- BTC-e says $800=1btc.  Site for purchase says $820=1btc
Not sure if this is what you meant.
Edit: If you are talking the other way around, none. None is acceptable.

Sean's outpost is run by bitcoin donation's and the satoshi forest is being paid for with bitcoins. We had a bitcoin meetup Saturday and all the guys behind the project were there. If you are interested in meeting local bitcoiners, you should pm me.

Wow. This is perfect. Thanks for that.

I personally am very close to someone who has lived off of cash exclusively and not paid a dime of income tax for over 20 years now. It is very possible. US.

I like this guy. This seems like the perfect mentality for a "true" bitcoiner. One who believes in the principles of bitcoin, not just as a get rich quick scheme like too many do. I am appalled at the number of people in the community chomping at the bit to work out the kinks of *paying* taxes on their btc. We should be trying to escape the deathgrip of the fed and central banking (which income tax is in the middle of). 
I applaud you sir.

For a one time fee, YES. For a recurring payment, NO.
