When I heard "Mr Soandso, economist" I immediately know that person doesn't know what they're talking about and should be disregarded.
Economists are basically just peddlers of pseudoscience used to prop up the current Federal Reserve usury scam.

Slowing down Libra benefits anyone who might have bought it, since it's a Facebook scam.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:22:05
Aye I agree with that too, though at this point there are so few Austrian economists in any sort of mainstream setting that they don't ever get mentioned outside of places like here, which is why I just said "economists". 
Keynesian economists are indeed part of a dogmatic cult.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:47:37
LOL no. Why would you want to buy a shitcoin that is controlled by a company known to blackmail people, spy and commit fraud? 
Libra and Faceberg are a fucking joke, and anyone who uses Libra is setting themselves up to have their identity and financial information stolen by the shady black market clients that Faceberg sells user information to, as they've been caught doing multiple times.

You could probably argue that hashing power which prevents double spends is "backing" it but even that's a bit nebulous.
As you say, utility and scarcity are the main reasons it has value, not backing.

I agree that's technically true, though at this point the "save during upturns" thing is just some cute thing they *pretend* exists for the benefit of the people they are stealing from, while actually doing the opposite.

Wages have not kept up with inflation for the last 50 years, so not really.
In an imaginary fantasy land, I'm sure wages keep up with inflation, but that's just not reality.

No, no you couldn't, since every single staple required for that life has increased in price by thousands of percent.
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:46:03
Pretty smart to disallow Libra. Facebook has been known to sell financial and identity information on the black market. Anyone who signed up to buy Libra would be at huge risk of identity theft.
It's also pretty much a confidence scam considering they would be riding the coattails of Bitcoin, pretending Libra has the same properties while failing to mention that they can steal your Libra at any time without repercussions, "legally".

Seeds, basic equipment, even 1920s versions, are all vastly more expensive.
As are property taxes and assorted fees and permits.


Sure, *as well*, but it would still cost thousands of percent more initial start up money, because every single thing required to do it is thousands of times more expensive than it was in 1920s.


I get your point but even if you did everything the same it would still cost thousands of times more to do it, because there are vastly more fees, fines, permits, and taxes than existed in 1920 *and* every single thing required to start doing that costs thousands of times more than it did then. 
Simply returning to 1920s safety standards or whatever would not change any of that and would represent a minor cost reduction over doing it the modern way.
Real estate is also thousands of times more expensive as well.

I keep telling my gf, no, these houses that are 300sq ft in a gang-ridden neighborhood are not worth $1.5million. The dollar is just losing value at an extreme rate.
The real inflation rate is more likely about 10-20%. USD is fucked and that loaf of bread will be $10, $20, $30 in a  5-10 years.

The comparison was to banks not other cryptos, which also aren't secure and could be trivially attacked if even small portions of the miners on another chain decided to do so.

Yeah because the  Fed is deliberately trying to sabotage the organic economic recovery because it would make their little puppet Obama look bad since had the Fed's rates on his side the entire time and still couldn't meaningfully recover the economy.

It's less environmentally wasteful than fiat paper money printing and shipping, period. 
People that pretend to care about the environment need to go after the people *actually polluting it*: India and China.

Hyperbitcoinization will not be the same as hyperinflation *precisely* because people will have a currency to flee to.
Most hyperinflation scenarios are nightmares because there is no unit of account in circulation to replace whatever fiat shitcoin started going hyper, but in the case of USD, Bitcoin will be there and life will largely go on as normal for anyone willing to transact in it.
Bitcoin means people have a way to flee a hyperinflating currency before the value of their money is totally gone.
