So do you already have the raspberry pi and everything? It is pretty complex right now if you aren't comfortable with Linux. It's up to you if you want to go with option 2 but I say if you have the resources already then at least try option 1. 
If you go to the lightning network sub there are plenty of people able to help you out. Of course, there is this guide:  but you will likely need to modify a few things and it requires knowing the basics.
If you don't already have a raspberry pi consider the fact that you will have to purchase:
1. Raspberry Pi: $35,
2. HDD ~$50-60
3. SD card ~$10
4. Power supply capable of powering the pi and HDD ~$15 (you can run into issues if it isn't powerful enough.
5. LAN cable ~$5 
6. Case for the pi: $5-15
You already have a cost of around $130 without anything being set up for you. You will spend hours working on it and you'll likely not get it right the first time.
I use Linux every day and it took me a full day to get it up and running (not counting the transfer times for the blockchain). I also had an extra raspberry pi and all the accessories. I only purchased a screen and a case that held the screen for $20. It was really fun and rewarding.
I think the pre-built solution comes with software to use it as well. This can be a huge plus because right now you are very limited with wallets that can talk to your own node.
Up to you though, $300 is pretty steep to enter the LN arena and I don't think I would pay that much. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:14:00
Thanks, friend.

I do think it's important that this team has a QA process to catch these things. Even now I can show double my balance on iOS if I send some funds to my Blue Wallet LN address.

We are still in the baby stages with LN too. I wonder what a year from now will look like now that it is easier to setup and has more support. 
If you setup your own LN node you are still one of ~3000 people to do so. At least publicly in the network. Kinda crazy once you think about it.

For sure there are benefits and it’s really convenient. People will use bitcoin when they have to, not when they want to. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:32:22
If you are just starting out I’d download a reputable wallet for your smartphone. Make sure this wallet lets you right down your own paper key.
I use cash app to purchase bitcoin and send to my wallet. It’s a super easy to use app. 
Once you buy, send the bitcoin to your wallet and now you have bitcoin that only you could ever access. 
The next step is finding somewhere to spend it. I payed a friend in bitcoin yesterday for carpooling.  
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:59:31
No, check out this graph: 
If you click on any of the dots you will see which nodes they are connected to. If you click on one of the nodes they are connected to you will see nodes that are indirectly connected to the first node. This goes on and on. This is called a 'hop'. I believe each transaction can have a maximum of 20 hops.
The chances that you are connected indirectly to another node (another merchant) are very likely, especially if you have a few channels open to some well-connected nodes. 
This comes with some drawbacks though and you will want to choose who you want to connect to advantageously. For example:
Let's say you need to make a $20 payment over LN to a node that is not directly connected to you. With each hop your transaction takes you will need each node to have the capability to transfer $20. 
This is why it would be more advantageous to connect to well-funded nodes. You can browse through this site to find well-connected and well-funded nodes: 
LN is still in beta and things can be a little complicated. There are features like auto-pilot that will open channels automatically so you don't have to worry too much about this. If you have to make a 'large' payment then it is best to open a channel directly with the person you are trying to transact with.
Sometimes it will be better to just transact on-chain, for one time purchases of a large amount. LN really shines with microtransactions. You can give someone less than a penny over LN without any fees. It's really fun and if you want to test it out then I suggest playing around on the test-net.
I'm gifting you 1,000 main-net satoshi to play around with. You can use the lntipbot to use these funds. If you go to:  you can actually use them using lntipbot's withdraw feature. Experiment with some smaller ammounts first and see how it works.

This isn’t a negative post about bitcoin, it’s a lost about coinbase and a kid who doesn’t understand bitcoin. Setting too low of a fee isn’t bitcoins fault. 
Post TX or gtfo 
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:41:17
I’d like to ask a related question as well. 
If I’m using the LN to make a transaction to pay for a comment on a website which charges a flat 20 satoshi, so I calculate taxes on that as well? I know 20 satoshi isn’t a lot or anything but I’m guessing it’d scale to higher values. 
I’m not really making any profit doing so. Is it more of a donation? It’s a flat 20 sat that has no relation to USD. Why would taxes be applied? 
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:55:19
I had just moved out and stumbled across bitcoin mining somewhere. I thought it was amazing that I could use my GPU to make money. I had just moved out and was strapped for cash so I seriously considered it. Never happened though and I never ended up purchasing it until mid-2017.
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:46:11
Jesus Christ don’t do this. Invest your own personal money if you want but don’t waste that money on something so risky. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:03:10
Ok cool. As it works right now with most LN wallets, you scan a node’s public key and allocate coins to open a channel with them. Once you have your node up and running you can do this with any online node you want to. Then you can send BTC across the network through that node or just transact with that node itself. 
So to buy something from the bitcoin froyo store down the street you would need to scan their public key and allocate funds for that channel. If you know you will spend around $100 over the next couple months on froyo then you can put $100 into that channel. Now you can do instant transactions with the froyo store. 
Let’s also say that you decided to diet and no longer wanted to buy froyo. You can still keep that channel open and use the remaining balance to buy things from other merchants that have a channel with that froyo store. Of course they don’t have to be directly connected, you can have many hops in between every node.  
Hope that clears some things up. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:34:14
Read this before you speak. You have an account with them. They generate a unique key to recover your LN bits if you need to but your coins are completely in their control.

Security wise, turning your WiFi off on your smartphone does nothing for security if you have connected it to WiFi before. A ledger has never touched a network, your smartphone has. That’s the point of a hardware wallet 
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:04:06
Did you take a look at this guide yet? 
The most important part is making sure the ports are open on your router and your IP is set to your public IP and not your local IP. Also if you have a firewall you have to make sure to open that up for the port as well. 
I’ve never had to wait that long. Usually instant. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:09:29
Yeah that’s smart. Good luck and have a good one 
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:48:29
Fees are a variable that is dependent on the state of the mempool.  You can’t be this ignorant. I told you, 20-30 would have gotten confirmed in the next block. Your transaction had a much lower rate so it took 6. Coinbase is in no rush and wants to save money so you suffer as a result. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:02:12
If a device has been connected to the internet you can never be sure that it is secure. Especially an android phone of all things. 
It’s not the same security at all, a ledger has never been connected but your phone has. So it’s not the same. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:37:45
You can only send through a channel as much you put in. 
So if I opened a channel with 1 BTC to you I’d be able to send you up to 1 BTC with that channel.

Sorry, no not exactly. 
It’s simply showing I have double my funds. I cannot spend it. 
You have to start with 0 funds and the first transaction, if you follow my steps, will lead to double the amount in your wallet. 
Idk if there is a way to send it, I don’t have time to experiment anymore tonight but the fact it is still showing double my funds is odd for sure.

How far off is it? Don't forget that some sat are allocated to closing the channel (which requires an on-chain transaction).


You would get back any BTC used to open the channel minus the satoshi that you have spent and the fees for the last on-chain transaction to close the channel.

I think I figured it out.
1. Have 0 funds in your LN Wallet.
2. Create an invoice for 10 sat. Do not leave this screen.
3. Pay the invoice with another wallet
4. Go back to BW, it will show as paid, press the top right x and pull down to refresh. You will see you have 20 sat.
They key part is step 2, don't leave the screen.

Bitcoin gives you a way to transfer funds between two parties online without anyone else having a say in the matter. MasterCard and visa can deny your transaction if they don’t like your political views, with bitcoin that isn’t a problem.

I agree, I shouldn't be making baseless claims. I did find some posts a little fishy.
1. User ncoelho is the co-founder: [proof](
2. This is a post he made without any disclaimer that he is the co-founder: [Proof](
3. He spreads misleading information about the wallet. [Proof]( They do have a withdraw button, it doesn't work. An error message used to pop-up saying that this feature is coming soon but they since changed it so that it links to zig-zag. Very fishy that he would lead people to think that you could settle on-chain in the app.
While obviously this isn't proof of an ad campaign, I do see the same comments over and over about it and will be keeping better notes about the users posting it.

If you are a beginner then I’d go with a mobile wallet. Your phone is likely your most secure device and it’s also really convenient since you can scan QR codes and use it on the go. 
Play around with it for a while and get used to receiving and sending bitcoin. 
The most important part is to write down your seed words and to never keep them in a digital format. Write them down on multiple pieces of paper and stick them away. This will allow you to recover your coins if your phone gets destroyed. Anyone with those words can access your coins so keep it safe. 
BRD wallet is nice on iOS, can’t speak for any others or android wallets.

@_date: 2019-01-21 23:14:37
I appreciate the message. 
The only issue I have is that whenever I bring up that it is custodial I get bombarded with hate and have seen others get the same. That paired with misinformation and the sinking feeling you get when you have funds on a wallet that doesn’t let you withdraw made me not recommend this app.
Unfortunately in its current state, it doesn’t matter if it is open source or not. The bitcoin is in your control and you don’t need an exploit in the code to take advantage of that. 
Bitcoin is about trust-less transactions and I only want to point that out to people. 
I do appreciate you building tools to benefit bitcoin but I think a proper withdraw feature should have been a day one implementation or at least put a large disclaimer when making the lightning wallet that you will not be able to bring funds back onchain through the app without a third party resource. 
I recommended your app to friends when I first learned about it, hadn’t yet tried the withdraw feature yet but since the button was there I thought surely it worked. Later the next day I wanted to see how withdrawing works and was greeted with a “feature coming soon” error code. 
If I belonged to a bank that let me put money in, spend it but not allow me to withdraw my funds that’d be a huge red flag. Pair that with this being some random team on the internet and I just cannot use it. 
I hope you don’t take these criticisms as a slight towards you.

Do you have a  remote satoshi balance? 
If you have only opened channels and never spent any satoshi then you need people to connect to you in order to receive funds. 
If you give me your Public key for your node I’ll open a channel to you and you can withdraw some funds. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:41:15

Coinbase wasn’t paying enough it fees. Simple as that. Nothing to do with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:46:26
My point is that no matter how many satoshi you have on this wallet, if you put them on the LN then you are not able to get them back via the wallet. They don’t allow you to settle and bring your coins on chain. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:44:42
It is a rewarding feeling getting it to work. I ended up buying the "I got lightning working" sticker from the blockstream store. It's about $5 after shipping and taxes so it was a pretty good lession for me on how to manage channels with good balance and capacity.
