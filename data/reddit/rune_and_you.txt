I also think it is time we start writing the price of USD in bits, rather than bitcoin in USD.
So price charts would have bits as their y axis and then trend down over time as 1 USD can buy fewer bits.
It would also make converting from USD to bitcoin easier, rather than having converting from bitcoin to USD being easy. Its pretty often you need to figure out how many bits e.g. 5 USD is, but its rare you need to calculate how many USD 3 bitcoins is. If you want to find out how much money you have in your wallet, most software usually have a converter and automatically displays the USD value. If you're buying something from a shop, the prices are usually listed in USD and you, again, need to convert from USD to bits.

This might sound absurd, but this ridiculously stupid scenario the OP created as an ultimate exaggeration, would actually not be that bad if it had mainstream bitcoin acceptance.
Without realizing it, every problem he wanted to pin on libertards in this story, are actually primarily a problem of how pain in the ass old currencies are to use.
Someone should rewrite the story in the post-bitcoin world. I'm not saying libertarianism is actually the best thing in the world (I don't agree with a lot of it), but I definitely don't think it is right to just always condescendingly dismiss any kind of libertarian-flavor belief.

I have written about this before, but I think there are emergency measures in place to have bitcoin relatively smoothly change to another mining algorithm if a single person suddenly controls 51% of mining power. It would be accomplished with a hard fork from the block before the first 51% attack, and would be distributed from bitcoin.org using the bitcoin core alert key.
Should this ever happen, bitcoin will be damaged, but will probably recover in the long run. Every bitcoin holder would still own the same amount of bitcoin, and only people who transacted during the 51% attack could potentially have lost coins. The biggest loser in this scenario would be the attacker though, as they would have lost millions of dollars in mining hardware.
If we ever get closer to a scenario where it could be possible for a single person to gain control of the network, these procedures should probably be formalized more openly, to disincentivize any attacks.

It also seems like coinbase is supporting bitlicense, even though they're about to expand to the UK and bitlicense would mean NY gets access even to UK files. In this case, silence does imply consent.
Even circle has come out against bitlicense so that really makes coinbase seem as the most extremist anti-bitcoin bitcoin company there is.
The day the whitecoin/blackcoin split comes about it wouldn't surprise me if coinbase leads the charge in the whitecoin camp, really bad when you consider that it has all the big retailers. But then again, I guess those companies wouldn't have accepted bitcoins if they hadn't received some sort of sign from the government that coinbase bitcoins were "approved".

I would reconsider making it completely free like this. If it going to get traction/not get banned, it will require more serious, business grade support. The problem with having developer fees pricing out poorer users, like some are accusing multibits implementation of doing, could be solved by having the fee be percentage-based, accumulate in the wallet, and only be broadcast when it has reached a certain level and there is enough left in the wallet for it. 
It will then be cheap for everybody, and the system could be made so the really needy can then just mess around with it to avoid paying fees if they feel their time is worth it. At long as it is not trivial to avoid paying fees, then 99,9% of users will just pay the fees if the percentage is low enough. It will then essentially be an entirely voluntary, but almost ubiquitous donation to fund development.
The majority of users would be happy to pay money to support proper development. Perhaps a long term business plan could even be some sort of self-insurance against new users losing money to bugs or something like that (Im sure there are some services that could substantially increase it's user friendliness on a platform such as facebook)

~~&gt;Unfortunately IBLT only works if all the participants are "honest" and run the algorithm as-is, rather than try to maximize revenue. The problem is still large miners: if I'm a big miner like GHash.IO, I can earn more revenue than my competitors by including transactions that they don't yet have, which pushes their orphan rate up much more than it does mine. The miner will take a hit on subsidy profit temporarily, but their competitors take a much bigger hit.(1) In the future if transaction fees dominate revenue even that won't be true: you'll earn more money outright because you get a higher % of the transactions.~~
~~This doesn't make sense to me. Using IBLT and running with transactions that others don't have means that your IBLT have to be larger and those "extra" transactions must have a higher tx fee to offset the orphan cost.~~
Edit: After reading again, it seems like I misunderstood the argument.
IBLT will also mean that distributing your tx to a lot of public nodes will make it costly for miners to ignore your transactions, unless the nodes also agree that your transaction shouldn't be included in a block. "guaranteed" confirmation can be achieved this way without a premium. Centralized pool services are dangerous, and this would remove potential future source of income for them.

It's quite funny to think of the price impact extra terrestrial mining will have on gold and other precious metals.

Yeah, I think the biggest security risk is the massive incentive to 51% attack a sidechain, since you can steal all the bitcoins on it by doing so. There probably isn't any remedy to this and the only solution is an upfront investment by the sidechain creator to act as a block subsidy in the beginning, and then higher fees later on.
As far as I understand merge mining though, the incentives to merge mine don't need to be that great since it is very cheap to do. The problem will rather be that it will be more valuable to merge-attack than to merge mine.

To be honest I think it is more faithful to the "real appearance" of a satoshi if you dont put anything there for scale. If you just make the satoshi's coin shaped, then people will probably assume the coins are normal sized.

There is no improvement in the protocol of darkcoin - so there is no "bitcoin remaining transparent" and "darkcoin being different". Darkcoin could just as well be dogecoin or any other coin, and yes, even bitcoin. All it does is to force everyone to use a copy of darkwallet, with decentralized coinjoin. Anyone who are thinking of switching to darkcoin can just download darkwallet and use that instead. They'll have the exact same anonymity features, but more price stability.

To me, the core of libertarianism seems to be the belief that the right to personal property trumps everything else.
Rather than having free markets being a tool used towards the betterment of humanity, many libertarians simply consider free markets as the final endpoint of human development, with no exceptions.
I think the fact that the most "statist" countries in the world (the northern european states) consistently score high on both "happiness" indices (who admittedly can be biased) and also have some of the highest GDP per capita in the world, is undeniable proof that a strong state apparatus can be a force for good.
This doesn't mean I support having big governments in all countries, but at least I think it is inconsistent with the view of governments as an "inherent evil" that most libertarians (and especially the famous, well-quoted libertarians), from my perspective, seems to believe.
Now you can say that "moderate" libertarianism exists and so on, but form my point of view that is just a "no true scotsman" argument, because the prominent thinkers all seem to agree on the hard line.

Bitcoin is the most awesome cyberpunk story/drama I'd never be able to imagine.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:44:56
Probably. Bitcoin only has one name, though, and it has only ever had one. And that's because the original creator gave it a good name.

As far as I understand, PT is concerned about something different from a 51% attack. More something like a "benevolent monopolist" attack, where a government "regulates" enough hashing power to do a block withholding attack, forcing all other miners out of business while continuing to validate all transactions (until they reach 100% hashing power)
I don't understand why he brings it up in the context of IBTL's, as I don't understand why IBTL's should decrease the requirements of doing a block withholding attack (IMO IBTL's should make it more expensive). Peter apparently thinks this is the case.
I also think there might be a more wide reaching dispute regarding whether there should be a hard fork, and when/why it should be done. Some, notably andreasma, have mentioned the hypothesis that we are fast approaching the last chance to ever do a hard fork of the bitcoin protocol (in fact it might already be too late). If we don't do one before this "critical mass" date, bitcoin will forever be locked in its current implementation as there will simply be too much network intertia to change it.
Using IBTL's themselves would not require a hard fork, but once they are implemented it would be very tempting to increase or remove the maximum blocksize ~~as the network would be able to scale linearly with transaction volume.~~ (this is apparently wrong)
Peter Todd and Genjix believes that a small blocksize is integral to bitcoins decentralization, and that microtransactions can be handled through the so-called "microtransaction channels" that are pseudo-offchain transactions using multisig and nLockTime to make free, trustless and decentralized micropayments.
I am of the opinion that IBTL's definitely should be implemented (unless they actually DO increase network vulnerability towards block withholding attacks), but that it would be very risky if the max blocksize was removed.

I think in the long run, the really useful bitcoin payment apps will be based on NFC. Perhaps a scenario like transfer a signed transaction to the shop, who will then verify it isn't being double spent, and then choose the tx fee he wants and broadcast it to the network.
Getting NFC deployed now just lays the infrastructure for bitcoin to be used everywhere. Currently there are only card terminals and people have to have a seperate tablet or some other device that is only useful for bitcoin transaction.
I think in the long run getting people to stop using cards and using their phones for payment, and having the associated infrastructure in place will massively boost bitcoin's adoption.

amazing. Just need to implement bitID tickets for this to go full circle. You see a QR code in the paper, you send money to the QR code. If the money isnt returned to you, it has been accepted and your transaction now becomes a "ticket" for the sending address. You arrive at the venue and log in with bitID to prove you have a valid "ticket".

I think it's quite funny that a subreddit will end up becoming the center of the new financial reality. In a couple of years we'll have goldman sachs execs making sure to post all their bitcoin related announcements here. ;)

This acquisition is great because it will inspire many new people to do the same thing in hopes of getting acquired. In the long run the only good block explorers will be open source any way, so the entire ecosystem will benefit.

Perhaps BTC doesn't care about the silly legacy bureaucracy? In the bitcoin economy, the users decide the rules, not governments or ISO, and that includes naming conventions.

"Enter an email or bitcoin address."
It would be beautiful if using the email address as a persons "bitcoin domain name" became a thing. I just hope it can be implemented in a decentralized and anonymous way.

**Headline: Public letter regarding "April 15" from BTC China to the bitcoin community**
Even though the "April 15" news have been nothing more than third party payment closures so far, the consequences for the bitcoin economy have still been violent. 
There are "scared" people, "calm" people, "fleeing" people, "resolute" people, "confused" people, "awake" people.
As the leading representative of the Chinese bitcoin community, we, **The BTC China Team**, are standing up and sending out an open letter, in our commitment to do business sincerely and fairly by informing the public of the following:
Up until now, we have still not received any notice regarding funding or withdrawing bitcoin directly from bank accounts. From the very second this rumour arose, we have with a sense of duty - and a dash of paranoia - been checking every possible construction of dystopian government bureaucracy and infrastructure that mankind could ever dream to invent. 
Searching everything from local branches to the central bank, the media's "information" channels as well as the peers in this newborn, yet unstoppable industry, we have with a loving zeal in our eyes been personally inquiring our fellow human beings.
If there had been anything to confirm, any status to update you on, our vocal chords would be speaking the last sentence as our eardrums heard the next.
Since the "April 15" rumor began, our local, global community have been united in our fear and annoyance of these uncertain times, the days scraping by as years.
In this time, however, it has not been the news itself that has scared us, but the primal human instinct that causes us to fear the unknown. As for us, we shall continue to use that other, *better* instinct that causes us to care for that which we know is precious, and continue to singled-mindedly keep up our guard, while stating the only significant fact about this situation:
**1. Do you truly think it would be possible for our governments to create or conceive a method with which they could hinder bitcoin in the long term?** Be honest.
Right. 
The intrinsic value of bitcoin, like any other thing that human society considers valuable, is not *what it does*, but rather *what it is*. And *what is bitcoin*? Bitcoin is the evolutionary frontier of the most revolutionary invention that the world has ever seen, perhaps since agriculture: yddif eert.
