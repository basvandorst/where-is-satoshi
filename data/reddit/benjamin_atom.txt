Bitcoin is not a currency but a store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:10:03
Please tell me which part is not the fact?
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:37:27
So you actually admit the core is centralized, that is a good start. So that twiiter is true at this point.
No one can confuse you if you have a real brain.  You only ask people to believe and forbidden them to ask any questions because you know you can't survive in the front of the facts.  We ask people to do their own research and make their own decision because we have the confident we are right.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:07:31
So the other is true, right?
Why Bitcoin core will mislead people?  Yes it is not common usage, but it doesn't mean that is misleading.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:13:16
Come on guys, you can do better, please to list the facts to defend BTC instead of attacking BCH with some blabla...., 
Except this twitter is state the fact to harm your feeling, then you can't blame the facts, do you?
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:41:23


You got be funny, i am pretty sure google or micro-soft also accept pull requests which is not make them decentralized.
ASFAIK, BTC is defined as digital gold for storing of value, it's not a digital currency any more. With more than $20 transaction fee, you definitely can not use it as currency, even western union has much low fee than BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:00:38
with your logic, the stack also can be currency, you win. BTW, it's just your definition. So you cant really say that twitter is wrong. 
The funny thing is no one actually can point anything wrong about that twitter, they just attack it. But the fact has more power than anything.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:26:45
All of this is just your imagination, none is the fact.
The fact is BCH will be supported by bitpay as default payment. 
Sure you can make the BTC your own real Bitcoin, but you can't decide other people's mind. 
And your attacking can't harm BCH at all. The fact is BCH move fast than every one expected, nothing can stop it.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:26:09
The real bitcoin is defined by the white paper which is p2p cash.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:05:29
Sure i can't define what exactly is the real decentralized development team, but i know bitcoin core is definitely centralized.  
Gold is not a currency any more, you can't buy staff using gold. Actually lots of people can't use gold as currency. And the fee of gold is surly low than BTC. Please name a currency which fee is more than BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:34:49
How much fee do you paid? BTW, you should not spend BTC for dinner as BTC is just for SOV. You should HOLD.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:52:04
You should fuck youself, you stupid liar.
Ar least I have provide the source to prove my word.
And you just blabla, a bunch of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:42:30
It's painful  for your guys to see the price of BCH up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:17
No. why these guys need a company if the have lots of bitcoin?
Actually they don't have lots of bitcoin which is the reason they build a company to promote sidechain to earn money.
You can't deny the fact that increasing the block size is totally contradict to their business model. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:17:31
If you really believe sathoshi, you should choose BCH. Sure if you believe theymos, then BTC is for you.
BTW, LN is not piont-to-point and BTC is only store of value not the cash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:14:22
If you don't own Bitcoin, then all your argument is bullshit. You don't even believe what youself say, how do you expect people believe the shit you talk.  
Yeah you are smarter than Satoshi who apparently suggest to increase the block size. 
BTW, I convert my BTC to BCH at about $300,  so do you really believe people as stupid as you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:51
You fuck shit, BTC is the most centralized coin now because it was controlled by BS core. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:04
LN is not point-to-point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:55:43
Are you seriously believe what you say?
Everybody knows that the 1M block size is temporary limited to resist spam. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:28:07
Decentralized is not the purpose of bitcoin, it is the result of bitcoin. 
The more people use bitcoin the more decentralization of the system. 
The high fee will result centralize not the big block size, as the high fee will exclude lots of people who earn less than $10/day which is a large groups in the world. That's why BCH will more decentralized than BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:45:08
I already told you that decentralization is not the reason, but the result. The mistake of your guys is you believe decentralization is the reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:46:53
You call more than $10 fee(maybe more in the future) is accessible?
With 10 more transactions, you can buy a 4T hard drive which can use more than 10 years for 8M block.
So which is more accessible? High fee or big block? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:36:02


You fuck shit, how dare you say Satoshi didn't suggest increasing the block size? I can't believe you fucking idiot lie about this.

@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:22
Sorry, Western Union is now cheaper than bitcoin.  My point is such fee is no longer accessible for lots of people, that is wrong and sucks.
Your guys so naive, do you really think the miner will agree to implement a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:01
 THE ENTIRE POINT of Bitcoin is point-to point cash, you stupid ass, read the title, you can get the idea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:01:03
Asic boost is irrelevant, the people who complain asic boost is as the one who use CPU/GPU mining complain other people use Asic miner. You can't complain other people have the more efficient way to mine bitcoin. I believe the more efficient way, the more secure the coin.
AFAIK, there were 5 core maintainer who has the commit right (Gavin Anderesen, Jeff Garzik, Wladimir J. van der Laan, gregory maxwell and pieter wullie). We all know Gavin Anderesen and Jeff Garzik suggest to increase the block size but result in the commit right be removed. And the other 2 of 3 are blockstream employee. All of this is truth which you can't deny it. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:06:20
Yeah, the simplest way to resolve the high fee problem is to increase the block size, you only need to change some parameters, not the complicated stupid segshit and LN.
That's the  Occam's razor.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:25:51


Because they work for blocksream,  Increasing the block size is totally contradict to their business model who promote sidechain to earn money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:55:31
The spiral death of BTC is waiting for you. You will pay for your stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:44:40
Decentralized is not the purpose of bitcoin, it is the result of bitcoin. The more people use bitcoin the more decentralization of the system. The high fee will result centralize not the big block size, as the high fee will exclude lots of people who earn less than $10/day which is a large groups in the world. That's why BCH will more decentralized than BTC. Node is irrelevant, if you don't mine then you can't do anything with your node. If you can't afford the transaction fee, i don't think you will run a node, right? You should read the white paper first. Bitcoin run perfect in the past 8 years until today because the limited block size.
