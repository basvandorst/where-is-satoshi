Reported for misleading view.
You don't know how Bitcoin works.
Kid, even if all Chinese miners move their hashrate to litecoin and be there for years to make Litecoin be longest chain, litecoin still can't become Bitcoin.
Actually, nearly all altcoins are a hard fork from Bitcoin, and they are much shorter than Bitcoin, but they still exist and will be there for long time.
I am shocked how stupid the ChinaminerBU supporters are about.
They don''t know much thing about Bitcoin, and they want to change Bitcoin to what they think should be.
It's so absurd.

Liar Roger Ver, is that you, again?

Liar Roger Ver is extremely selfish. He surely would like to destroy the world if he has an illusion that he has the ability. Not only Bitcoin.
Liar Roger Ver was born in the USA, and later became a criminal in a prison for harming people. Later, he renounced citizenship to avoid heavy tax and his criminal record. He has an extremely low bottom line. And he has a track record of telling lies super frequently. 
The only right thing Roger Ver did is that he purchased a bunch of bitcoins quite early. This makes Roger Ver very rich and gives him enough materials to show his evil soul thoroughly. 
Liar Roger Ver claimed r/bitcoin had banned him but that's a lie. Roger Ver banned me in his own forum because I told him to stop telling lies.

If you can design mining machines, it's easy to find partners in China to produce it. Then the cost will be same as THE BIG ONE.
But till now, there is nearly no one can compete with THE BIG ONE.

Because Roger is a liar

If Bitcoin Core chose to Hard Fork, then it's pretty sure Roger Ver &amp; Those Chinese Miners will control the original chain and call it "Bitcoin". Thus this community will be in much deeper trouble. This is an important reason why we shall avoid HF until it's the only choice.
If we compromised all the time, then Bitcoin would not have been invented.

I closed coinbase account because I no longer trust them. Maybe one day coinbase will hand our data over to China Communist Party.

This is real American!

Even in China, nobody can complete with them.
So this is not the most critical reason

Thank you. Coinbase is no longer safe &amp; trustable as before.
