I sold my bitcoin. Got tired of the uncertainty. Bought some nice subwoofers with my earnings.

Don't know if there will be one but I bought Christmas presents early so I can have a little extra money to buy the dip. If not I'll just buy it like normal.

Sell enough to regain your initial investment. The rest is free money.

I hope so I bought in at 8k and again at 11.5 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:47:37
This is good news. Prices will keep going up.

I'm making more money from Bitcoin today than at my job ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:22:20
What's with this crazy growth? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:58:27
Coinbase locks in your price. I bought in at 8k and it didn't clear until well after 10k

Putting all my spare money in bitcoin. Maybe next year if I'm rich off of this

Go buy a visa giftcard with cash and buy bitcoin that way. There's gotta be something that will work. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:22:21
So should I not start buying? I'm finally in a position where I have some extra money to invest but hearing things like this makes it confusing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:00:37
Good point. I don't so shit anyways lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:29
Good luck. Open a bank account the day you turn 18! You clearly are mature enough to handle a simple debit account just by showing enough foresight to want to invest your money rather than spend it foolishly.

Can someone explain to me in noobs terms how I should store my bitcoin? I'm buying through the coinbase app. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:25:43
Is there an app I can buy it through?
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:33:00
Wouldn’t it take a pretty big amount of solar panels to sustain this?
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:47:17
The US is scary man I wish there was something to protect us from the government doing things like this 
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:04:14
Yeah with our money but what about everything else? Our other freedoms?
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:18:08
This is what I was hinting at but I didn’t want to get downvoted.
