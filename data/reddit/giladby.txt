Before 2013 - not enough miners
Now - faster inter miner propagation time thanks to the [FIBRE network](
BTW, anyone wanting to start really understanding why (many) technical people are so vehemently against big blocks / BCH, understanding the [FIBRE network]( , why it exists and how it works, is a great place to start!

There is no such thing as priority in anything but your wallet GUI. What there is how much Satoshi you are willing to pay per byte of your transaction vs. how much other people are willing to pay.

It isn't inevitable. It is a possibility.
A widespread preference to pay in Fiat and receive Bitcoin (since the former is diminishing in value over time and the latter is increasing in value over time), means there is a high demand for Bitcoin, which means it's price will go up, which in turn generates more demand. It's a virtuous circle - a positive feedback loop.
When does this stop? Remember, volatility works both ways - the price of Bitcoin changing (up) is also the price of Fiat money changing (down). When the preference for Bitcoin over Fiat becomes so strong that people and institutions stop accepting Fiat and treat it as tax tokens, than Bitcoin will have become a currency. And than HODLers will start *paying* in Bitcoin, rather than *selling* Bitcoin.
Want to see a miniature version of this happening? check out Venezuela.  Will this happen globally? I don't know but we are about to find out. HODLers are betting that it will.

Most likely outcome is that your transaction will be confirmed after some more time when the mempool will drain a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:34:56
I already did (and by the way, the fee savings for using SegWit are 50% - 70%). But there is no rush - if you move coins only to get to a SegWit address, you can do it when the mepool is relatively empty and the fee is low, as it happens from time to time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:04:18
This is not an issue, it is a feature. 
As any engineer that has ever worked on any distributed system will tell you, the synchronization of the different participants is the bottleneck in the system. You really want to minimize the amount of data needed to be synced in order to have any chance of success.
Price is a signal. High fees are a signal for all the participants to minimize their use of data that needs to be synchronized to a bare minimum. 
This pushes us to make the data smaller (SegWit, batch transactions, Schnorr signatures) and to use as much off chain technology as we possibly can (OpenDIME, Lightning).
Putting a low price on data required for synchronization in a massively distributed system is a massive design fail.
We are successful, so on chain fees rise. As we get more successful, on-chain fees will rise even higher. That is a good thing. If they didn't Bitcoin would implode under it's own weight.

With pleasure. The word list is just a way to write down your seed in a way you can remember. The real seed is a number that fits in memory of sizes ranging from 128 bits (12 words seed) to 256 bits (24 words seed).
To figure how the real seed is converted to the word list which encoded it with a checksum you can read BIP 39: 
Assuming 24 words list or 256 bit sized seed, the number of possible seeds is 2^256, or slightly more than the 1.5 x 10 ^ 77 I claimed.
This does not take into account the password (aka 13 or 25 word) since while it adds entropy it does not increase the key space.
TL;DR forget the word list, it's just a cute way to write down a 256 bit number, so 2 ^ 256 possibilities.

Yes, it's a 3 input transaction, none of them are SegWit, into 2 outputs of 519 bytes but you only paid 19.923 Satoshi as miner fees per byte. 
That is way lower than other transactions so the miners prefer entering them before yours.

Yes, it is possible to change (add to) the fees, either via Replace-by-fee if you marked the original transaction so (probably didn't) or (which is what I recommend you to use) via Child pays for parent.
Basically, create another transaction with the still unconfirmed output of your transaction as input into another address of yours, with a proper fee (use  to figure out a proper fee).
The miners than can decide to put both transactions in the block (they can't put the 2nd one without the 1st).
See this youtube as an example: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:38:06
It looks like someone *tried* to double spend. One spend got confirmed, the other did not. Everything is working as intended.
By the way, they could BOTH have been confirmed (by different miners) and would still be fine. Only the transaction included in the block that ended in the longest chain survives, the other never happend.

The only ones that truly have the numbers to checks these assumptions are miners and you can imagine how forthcoming they would be about key numbers related to their business.

This is true but only half of the story. In the US at least, to get in on many investments pre-IPO requires one to be an "accredited investor", also known as "rich as fsck". This is done to protect the great unwashed crowed from risk and it does. Of course, It also "protects" them from the rewards of that risk.
Bitcoin allows millions of poor to be exposed to financial risk, for better and worse and it is very interesting to see how this unfolds: yes, we're suffering every downturn, scam (someone said ICO?) and glitch in the book and then some, and some people lose money, but on the whole, this does not stop people from investing in this dangerous asset and get a reward unmatched by anything Wall Street has to offer to Joe S.

In theory: 
a. the coin paid you could be double spent (by the seller sending a different Tx for the same coin) 
b. an alternative block could be mined that contains that alternate transaction.
c. said alternate block would get used by whoever mines the NEXT block, and the next, thus becoming the longer chain 
If a + b + c are true, your trezor balance would change, the coins disappearing into thin air.
The scenario becomes less and less possible with each additional confirmation. Common wisdom has 6 as the magic number of confirmations where this scenario becomes so improbable that it becomes negligible. However, for relatively small sums 2 confirmation are probably enough - that is the sum double probability of the loss is so small as to not matter.

In 5 years you would tap your BTC CC chip and it will sign a Lightning transaction in a few seconds. 
Unlike today, the store owner will not be forced to use a specific per card vendor (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) but will use an instant market place to choose the lowest fees to route the lightning transaction, so it will cheaper. 
Unlike credit cards, the bitcoin will transfer immediately, no the next day/week/month and there will be no danger of charge back. 
It will pretty much would look the same to you and the store owner, just the mechanism underneath will change

1. No. If anything, the opposite is true. Your ledger is the best place for your coin during a hard fork since it means YOU have control of the private keys for both chains.
2. No. Upgrade only if advised so by your wallet (Electrum or Ledger) provider and there is NO rush to do it now. It *may* be needed before your first transaction after the fork.
3. You will end up with both versions automatically since the same private keys control coins on both chains.
4. No. As long as you have your private keys (read: seed words in safe place) you are OK.
5. That would make sense, but in the end it is for users, wallet makers and exchange operators to decide on a case by case basis.
1. They will keep happening as long as they are profitable, or as long people think they are.
2. My 20 years experience with open source software tells me the chain with the most/best developers will be the one to survive, so I plan to sell the B2X coin and buy more Bitcoins, but there is no rush to do so if you don't feel confident as I am.

The Ledger Nano S contains inside a small chip known as a Secure Element. A Secure Element is basically the best commercially available way to keep secrets on a computer in a way that cannot be read. In the factory this secure Element is programmer with a unique secret key. When the Ledger software connects to the Ledger Nano S it asks it to prove it is is genuine by giving it a challenge it needs to sign with this secret key to prove it is genuine. While there are rheorircal ways and means for an attacker to overcome even this they are not simply replacing the Ledger Nano S with something that looks the same.
It is worth trying to buy from reputable sources, such as directly from ledger and not some unknown third party and while nothing is 100% safe, it is a pretty decent level of protection.

Beyond the true statement that bigger blocks require more resources to participate in the distributed network and therefore disincentives participating there is also another critical important point: no matter how many block size doubling we will do, the system as exists today will NEVER capacity needed to replace the VISA. Another scaling solution is required (such as lightning as an example). So not only there is a downside, there is no upside - you can't scale Bitcoin to where it needed to scale by doubling the block size. We will forced to do something else. As such, better do something else now.

"Loan" == the bank printing money subject to regulation by central bank. In Bitcoin we replace the banks with miners and the regulation by the consensus rules of the algorithm.

That is because you don't understand how loans (a mortgages simply being one type of loan) work today. We have this naive belief that a person A deposits money in the bank, whereas the bank loans out the same money to person B. Unfortunately, thanks to our fractional reserve system, this is no longer true. What really happens is that the bank ***creates out of thin air*** (90% of) the money being lent and gives it to person taking the loan. 
It is ***this*** kind of loan that will be replaced, with the age old meaning of a loan where in one person loans his money to another.

TL;DR: on chain scaling alone is a short range solution which is a long range dead end.
On chain scaling is not bad. It just doesn't work in the simplistic way that people that call for 2x seems to believe.
Let's do a little math: here is the web site for the SWIFT global network. The financial network that fiat banks use to transact internationally: [SWIFT]( Remember, this is the just the banking ***international***network. It does not include national or regional transaction within a country or an economic region such as the US or EU. For these there are other networks. It also does not include all the credit card transactions that occur on VISA, Mastercard etc.
According to its web site, the SWIFT network handled 27.65 million financial messages on October 3rd, 2017. Let's call each of these a "transaction" and assume they are comparable to a single transaction over the Bitcoin network. That may or may not be true, but this does not really matter as we are doing an order of magnitude kind of calculation.
So, with 27.65 million transactions on a single day, with 24 hour per day and 6 average blocks per hour (every 10 minutes), how many transactions per block would the Blockchain network to do per block to be on par? the answer is 27.65 x 1000000 / (24*6) or 192013.8889.
Well, how many transactions per block are we doing today? [Blockchain]( says the all time high was something around 2250 transactions per block. 
This means in order to facilitate ***on chain*** scaling to match ***only*** SWIFT transactions (remember, only international bank transactions, not including national, regional and certainly not VISA or Mastercard transactions) we would need to scale x85 than the current system throughput.
Now, some scaling does and will happen. SegWit gave us something around x2 - x4. I hear schnorr signatures may give as an extra 30%. That's all good, even  needed. ***But*** it's not going to get us to x85.
This is not a coincidence. Anyone who has ever spent time working on distributed systems knows that there is an engineering trade off involved.  The throughput, latency and coherency of a distributed system are balanced - pull one lever and the other two go up or down.
And that is perfectly fine. We can build on top of Bitcoin to create a global, distributed and free (and in free speech, not free beer) monetary. We just need to do it in the same way the Internet scales - in layers. We have copper or optics on layer 1. We have Ethernet (or TDM or some other stuff) on layer 2. We have IP on layer three. We have multiple solutions for layer 4 (TCP, UDO, SCTP etc etc.) and there is more stuff on top of that - up to and including the Bitcoin network itself!
We will do the same with Bitcoin. The current bitcoin network is just layer 2 or maybe 3. Lightning looks extremely promising as an example layer above.
All this does not mean that doubling the block size is, in itself, bad or wrong. It's just that it is a limited solution - a dead end, and it has costs. There is a perfectly sane reason that the top engineers involved in Bitcoin, a.k.a the Core team, more than doubled the block size with SegWit and want to wait before doing that again. They understand that on chain scaling, on it's own, simply does not work.
I for one don't think the 2Xers are evil. I don't think they are stupid, either. I do think they are focused on the short range - which is why many business interest focused people are pushing for that, since businesses are often more short range focused than the techies. It's alright, we need both types for this to succeed. 
***BUT***, if you forgo the name calling on both sides, this is a battle between the short range and the long range views. May the long range view win for the benefit of all.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:08:52
Again, you think of "loan" as borrowing someones else money. In today system it simply isn't. A "loan" is (mostly) printing of new money. Bitcoin will replace loans because what we call a "loan" today is printing money. I know it is absurd. it is also true.
