"Why do people need $BCC?"
Because there's people who realize the enormous problems with SegWit and had to fork the chain to avoid being forced into it.

San Fran may be the home of large bitcoin companies of the world for a while, but I think Shanghai will eventually be the world's financial center.  History shows us debtor nations eventually lose their power and that power transfers to creditor nations.  I think the future financial power will be in Asia, specifically China.  I see Shanghai as the most likely candidate within China.

I come from the Austrian School of Economics and our definition of inflation is an increase in the supply of money. As long as the total number of bitcoins is growing, I'd call it inflationary.  With that said, that doesn't necessarily mean there will be price inflation. If demand outpaces supply, there will be price deflation.  To avoid confusion, here I'm making a distinction between monetary inflation and price inflation.

Neither Bitcoin nor any other currencies have any value if there's nothing to buy.

I realize it's a matter of definition, but I would call it an inflationary currency because the bitcoin money supply is increasing every day.

If they do, I think it will be a tiny 25 basis point increase.  However, I don't think they can and I don't think they will.  But if they do raise rates, watch the panic ensue...

I've only made name your discount purchases, but this was not an order I placed.

Items fulfilled by Amazon are never touched by a 3rd party seller.

I'd agree, those things are true, but I'm not talking short term.  They certainly have their issues, but trends are changing in China, and they're building their financial infrastructure.  I expect Shanghai evolve into the world's financial hub within the next decade.

Back in the early days of Paypal, they gave $10 to every person who signed up.  It helped them grow their customer base immensely.  Edit: I see someone else already mentioned this

That couldn't be it, because it was shipped from an Amazon fulfillment center.

The US government created ISIS, so what will they be sentenced to?  Oh that's right, reelection.
