What’s the play here fellas. Enlighten me. Buy or just wait?

Let’s break it down even deeper! My good friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:11:09
So just wait for it to keep getting lower and buy then? What price you think it will fall at ?

What is bitcoin? Explain to me in simple terms.

Current price is $4610. I am a newbie who has never invested in bitcoin but have been carefully watching the market for the past year. Personally I don’t believe it will go below $4000 but I would love to hear everyone’s opinion. I am not sure if it’s smart to buy now or wait for it to get lower. I just don’t want to wait and it turns out the $4610 will jump to $8000 by next week which is absolutely possible.

3000$ here we come. For those that said it won’t go below 4000$.. give it a few minutes ��.

Common just tell me. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:29:49
Don’t say that I don’t want it to go below 1000$. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:59:16
I love you 
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:52:25
Not sure about that. I doubt it would go that low. That fast.

The only thing I will choke on is your moms tits when I buy her with bitcoin.
