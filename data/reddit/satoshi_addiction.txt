Start telling friends that you're selling now that it's over 1000 and will buy again on an $800 dip. In you can still go on being interested and if it explodes you can always say that you never really bought again because you waited. Everyone's got an uncle that sold something right before it exploded lol. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:00:08
Just my two cents. If (when) bitcoin moons one day you may not want everyone to know that your a hodler. People will remember.

Any smart governments would have been buying for years. Governments have some of the smartest people working for them, I have no doubt that some own vast amounts of bitcoins.

What stops anyone from taking my trezor etc. And stealing my coins?

US also relies heavily on Israeli intelligence gathering in that region. This reason alone is why Israel is so dear to the US.

This is bad press for us.

I've heard this just brings more regulation and control of bitcoin by the sec. Any opinions?

You missed the boat my friend. Google $5 wrench attack. 
Fiat transactions can be revered and tracked unlike crypto. Most people don't even have access to all of their fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:35:04
IMO that would actually raise bah price, having a bitcoin without satoshi owning so many is actually appealing for many. I think I once saw a thread where they wanted to do a fork which cut off his coins lol.

This is why you should never tell anyone that you have more than .25btc!   You can still tell people to buy and enthusiastically discuss it but nobody needs to know you have a lot.

Not silicon Valley but I was talking to a guy who works for att in their cloud computing department  and he was clueless.

While it may have correlated that way on the last dip, I don't think there is enough previous history to say whether crypto would go down with the markets in a gfc yet.

They are actually very smart, they buy btc "in case of rasnsomware" but they are just buying it as an investment and they get to deduct the purchase.
