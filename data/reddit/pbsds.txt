The amount stored in a QR code does not say how much is currently stored on the address, it's merely a number the QR maker added to the QR code. It is used to convey the price. Like if you have a coffee machine with its own QR code, it can specify it wants $1 wort of bitcoin and the client atomatically sets the amount to transfer to this amount when you scan the address, saving you the time.

Nah, he's just the figure head, the real leader has yet to be revealed and is pulling the strings from afar.

Guys, the guy behind that channel love to listen to feedback. Write up a thorough and non-aggressive response explaining point for point, how and why what he is saying is wrong. Gladly also try further the discussion on the weak and strong points of bitcoin. If they realize they're wrong, they'll gladly put up a update/response video fixing their mistake, as they have done in the past.

This is amazing

This idea would never work on a large scheme because of Bitcoins nature.
How are you supposed to make sure they pay you back?

I ordered it before the price change. So it was about $160. I can't seem to finde the exact price, but i remember buying it with 4 bitcoin when it was at about 40$/BTC

i got the 4.5GH/s version, but it clocks in at 6

But then again, readability. Although the 1GB file can't exactly be opened in just about any editor.

It's the output of blockparser trimmed down with

It was a miscalculation on my part, updated the OP
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:25:29
Bingo! Then wrote a python script which trimmed it down

Pretty neat!

I read up on it just now, way more effective than what i wrote! (Mine hashes at 1000 addresses per second)

Oh, sorry! It's 405192 addresses which holds 1 satoshi. My bad

Wait, really? I must be pretty outdated then...

I'm angry i didn't get the Block Erupter Sapphire. I sold for 6 bucks a pop and could pull 333mh/s. for the same price i bought the jalapeno, i could have gotten 10gh/s and i could have mined while the difficulty was reasonable...

The exchange may use them quickly, but I don't think they move the funds from the deposit addresses to a central address. They probably just leave the coins in the deposit address until it has use for them.

I can't find out which addresses are from the same wallet, the only possible approach i can think of would be to see which IP addresses the transactions come from and group them together that way. I think i remember seeing this being done on blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com

Ufasoft Coin, but i'm not impressed by it yet. NMC on it has just given me errors so far...

i had 18,4BTC at some point, invested in a 5870 which i fried and a butterfly labs jalapeno, which arrived a week ago... I should just have gone with some Block Erupter Sapphires... I've been mining for a while now and only earned 0,1
