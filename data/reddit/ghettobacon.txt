How is it "loosely there" ? All the servers are facing the same direction so there is zero separation.

But not doing even the most basic shit like hot and cold aisles, even if there was no containment shows that they didn't put any thought into this

because he's one of the richest mans on this planet and got there through investing. He probably knows how businesses and markets work better than anybody else on this planet

Actually they plan to enter the mobile payments market.

But you aren't buying anything that has to do with the app. They would get commission for an in-app upgrade or whatever.
Amazon and ebay apps wouldnt exist in your scenario

Eh. Depends on what is running on the server. Search platform for a big tech company like Amazon? Payment processing at Visa? Each server is going to be using as much kW as it can. Servers running the corporate HR page? Not so much.

WTF do they not know anything about building a data center? This is so crude and very inefficient
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:17:28
Nah it's not nominal, I do data center design at a big payment processing company that you know.
Either way 2 MW is jack shit, there have to be way bigger operations than that
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:32:21
2.16 MegaWatts isn't really a lot of power in the data center world

np, it'll most likely be posted at @_date: 2014-04-21 02:33:48
Lol this guy isn't lying at all.
It's not clean at all, the wires are everywhere, this is no hot/cold aisle containment so the hot air from the back of the servers is mixing with the cold air intake which is VERY inefficient..I could go on and on

hey dumbass, just because you get paid in bitcoin, doesnt mean you can commit tax evasion

Not if you keep buying more.

Hold up hold up...PayPal's ToS said that you can't use it to sell Tobacco products. Even though there isn't any tobacco in eCig's, they probably went on your website FAQ where you write:


Most people are unfamiliar with e-cigs but when they saw that, your account got locked. I don't agree with PayPal's ToS about paying for Tobacco products but this one is on you.
