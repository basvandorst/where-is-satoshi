I am guessing Pamela Morgan based off this tweet:  Pamela Morgan‏

How did you get so brave, to quit a salaried job &amp; work in  ft? Because I believe success is measured by positive impact on humanity &amp; not on  $ or # of assets. I'm working for success, just a different measure than most.
And this:  Pamela Morgan

I'd like to recommend 
This is a bit different than submitting to a charity. kiva gives loans to people all over the world to help them with whatever they are trying to accomplish. You can track how well the person is doing and such. It would be a way to give out loans to people, watch them succeed and then get the loan back, then reinvest to another. It would be a bit of work, unlike just donating to a charity, but I find giving to people who want to work for it, appreciate it more.

This is far superior than to what you are providing. Take this information and turn it 3 dimensional and maybe you will have something. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:31:50
The only problem is you are showing just walls at that given time. How do you track what has happened 15 minutes ago, 1 hr, 4 hrs, etc? There is way more information on cryptowatch. The only real thing you have going for you is the real-time orders vs cryptowatch, but I can just go to my binance account and do that there. I really don't see a benefit to what you provided here.
Also, not being able to turn on an actual axis is annoying. You say you are trying to appeal to mobile gamers and such but what you are providing is like an ice age game.

Thanks for doing this. I have no clue how to solve it but reading through people's comments, it shows the effort all are putting in. Also, it made re-read the whitepaper( I haven't done that in a few years).

Not true. Someone could have 1,000,000 bitcoin and burn them. None of us actually know the true supply.

Exactly what I was going to post. Haha 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:47:01
1. Buy the hardware needed to mine
2. google how to get miners set-up and going
3. Mine away!

The better part of the article is when they list altcoins: 
Other cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as “altcoins,” have emerged as well, including ether, the token of the blockchain network ethereum ($32 billion in market cap), ripple ($9 billion), litecoin ($3.7 billion) and dash ($3.3 billion).
Notice a coin missing? bahahahaha

Although I understand the city's issue, they should have gone to the electric company and asked them to raise the cost on the mining companies.

I hold both. My issue is Roger Ver is blatantly misrepresenting Bitcoin (BTC) vs Bitcoin Cash (BCH). I have no issues with the fork. I have no issues with BCH moving on and doing whatever. i do have a problem with blatant misrepresentation.
bitcoin.org vs bitcoin.com
calling BTC as bitcoin core and BCH as Bitcoin
having the  at twitter 
I know some on say well if someone buys BCH instead of BTC that's their fault, while thinking they were getting BTC. No, it's not their fault. It is ours and the other communities fault. We are doing a disservice to all people trying to join into cryptocurrencies by confusing them. 
Their are some really good people who support BCH 100% and I get that. It is just plain wrong what Ver is doing and has done.
