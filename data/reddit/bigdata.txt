He says that like they're already taxing people based on how much money they *have*, which is not the case. Which points to a fact that really embodies/exemplifies a lot of the factors that push people towards things like BTC. If you have no income, you needn't file a tax return, even if you have a zillion dollars. You could theoretically pay nothing.
Obviously most rich people do at least invest, and theres taxes on capital gains, but thats not the point. The point is what i was just saying, what Thiel implied, that the amount of money you have is somehow a factor in how much youre taxed, SHOULD be the case. Im not saying i know how much it should be, or anything like that, but our current system is bizarre when you think of the facts i just mentioned. I don't have all the answers, but i do know that Thiel just sort of fucked up in that statement. Thats one of the reasons why BTC is attractive, because some people are rich and dont necessarily have to contribute a dime. So it makes people wonder why they should be footing the bill. Its not that they dont see the logic in taxation, its that it seems hard to justify the fact that a trillionaire could pay nothing, whilst someone making 100k pays 30% of what they make each year. Significantly slowing their progress towards having a trillion. To make matters worse, the trillionaire really doesnt NEED to work. Well.. its worth thinking about. 
Not to mention, the same exact thing can be said for gold. I could (theoretically) have a block of gold the size of an elephant and no one need ever know about it. And i could chip some off and trade it for a banana without necessarily leaving any documentation that such a transaction ever occurred.
TL;DR The current set up with fiat punishes those trying to build a fortune, but does nothing to those who already have one.

It is, but its not as cut and dry as was youre saying implies. Tax rates haven't always been the way they are now. 
In 1862, for example, the tax rate was simple 3% if you made above $6,000 and 5% if you made above $10,000. 
Income taxes were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1895. This decision stood until the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913.
In 1913 the highest bracket was $500,000, above which you paid only 7%.
In 1916 it was 15% if you made over 2 million. After that it shot up dramatically. But supposedly even when the highest bracket was listed as being supposed to pay 90%, for the most part no one paid over 50%. Another thing thats sort of separate but is still worth noting is that over the course of 27.5 years after you purchased land you would pay less and less taxes on it, at the end of that the government would consider it to be worth nothing. Yes. No taxes. 
So.. i dont think i need to really explain any further. Old money does exist, and while the history books do say that everyone paid their fair share on the way up (or that they were supposed to anyways), there were definitely some people who paid "fairer" prices than others.
And this isnt all to say that its fundamentally broken or that theirs zillions of dollars floating out there that we only got 5% of (though there might be). The point is just to say the system is wrought with problems. I dont think peoples money should trend towards zero, at least not at any remotely fast rate. 
(it could again be an exponential curve where it gets exponentially slower every year your wealth decreases). 
Even the idea that someone with a trillion dollars in the bank and only $10,000 in income would pay taxes in the highest bracket, while not bad, is still in my opinion not the solution we should be looking for. Since, the underlying problem is you have far less incentive to work with a trillion in the bank. Actually thats not the problem. The problem is you need to work when youre only making 100k and you dont have a trillion in the bank. And that trillion could last generations. 


Thats the only way if we assume we have to keep using tax brackets. We shouldnt be using tax brackets, there should just be a curve. The answer is in large part to do away with brackets and replace it with a formula of some kind. I dont think anyone should pay over 50%. Even 40% seems high, and as i said in another post, supposedly if we wanted to generate the amount of taxes that we currently are, with a flat tax, wed be paying ~25%. If this is what 25% of everyones money looks like, i think we're doing something wrong. Perhaps its like you said, benefits and stuff. I'm not sure. I believe there should be a curve or a flat tax. The way you keep it from going to 90% is you make it so the person with the highest income is always taxed a certain percent (ie 40), and a curve is drawn from there.
But yes, when faced with the fact that were currently effectively paying 25% of our nations income in taxes, coming up with a new system gets weird. I believe this all stems back to the assumption that the 25% were currently shelling out is necessary and/or is going to good use. What i can say with no qualms is that the brackets are a janky silly idea from the stone age when people couldnt do math and didnt have calculators.

Edit: Sorry for the essay, i know that for the most part i'm preaching to the choir here.
Really all i'm doing is pointing out that Pete implies (perhaps accidentally) that the amount of money we have is somehow a factor in how much we are taxed, when in reality its not. And then i just point out how, ironically, that basically sums up a lot of the appeal of BTC. 
Its not really one thing about btc that makes it appealing, its a culmination of things that you get with a decentralized (and effectively anonymous and finite) currency and most of them stir up feelings/ideas similar to the underlying emotions that the above.. "inequality" that i described, evokes. For example printing money. There seems to be some underlying logic behind it, it doesn't effect most peoples day to day lives, but a lot of people still don't like the notion, especially now that were off the gold standard, which, again, many people probably would've felt a lot better about if at least they got to vote on it. Its the underlying problem with storing your wealth in something that you have no control over- which wouldnt matter if no one had control over it (basically gold) (or maybe if everyone had equal control over it), but alas, that is not the case.
No one wants anarchy (which it seems safe to assume a no tax society would look like), but what we have now isn't exactly a dream of logic, fairness, and "order", where everything makes sense and has an irrefutable explanation. I understand that many people would say "life isn't fair" (even though i actually think a correlation between merit and monetary worth is a prime example of fairness), but i do think we should be able to say **more** definitively that our tax system is fair, if nothing else. 
I didn't say we should steal anything, i didnt even say people were in favor of taxation. I said we understand the logic behind it, then pointed towards the harder to justify aspects of our current system. 
I do believe most people are in favor of the idealistic view of a taxation system and agree with the general idea that everyone chipping in for some stuff is worth it in the grand scheme of things. Im just pointing out that, even if we assume that our current system mirrors perfectly the idealistic vision of how taxation should work, theres still some interesting aspects. I mean for one, why do the brackets stop at 400k? or rather, why are there even brackets, there should just be an equation of some kind, or a curve. Maybe even a flat tax (bet you're shocked to hear that), cause our current system just seems to draw the lines arbitrarily and in a way that inevitably doesn't account for everything. 
I do have a feeling we're not getting our moneys worth on a lot of things, i had a talk with someone the other day who told me that if we wanted to have a flat tax and still generate the same amount of cash as we currently are, the tax rate would be ~25%. If this is what 25% of everyones money looks like, i'm pretty sure were doing something wrong.

Not sure if you believe in what ver is saying, but what you're saying would only further proves that sometimes things just become valuable, while having no utility. Though i do believe gold was used as jewlery or at least thought to be pretty. Not exclusively used bc of its scarcity.
I'd say the biggest example is paper money. We've long since been off the gold standard, paper money has no utility, besides as a medium of exchange. And some places do exchange btc. And thats all there is to it really. BTC is no more a castle in the sky than the paper we exchange for goods and services day to day. Theres nothing stopping people from walking away and saying they dont see the value in it anymore. Thats just from my perspective, though.

You could have both? 
In the old days farmers probably traded grain for some of the things they wanted when it meant they could get a better deal on it, were grains artificial?
If you buy beanie babies, and pay taxes on the beanie babies when you sell them, are you breaking the law?
Bitcoin is only artificial if you make rules about what exactly bitcoin is supposed to be. Even then.. i think artificial may not be the word you're looking for.
Is gold artificial?
Edit: Also, just to get technical and be a pedant, while i do pay taxes, 
for *society* to function (as it currently does), the *majority of people* have to pay taxes. While i do understand the foolishness and shortsightedness of not paying taxes (though i believe theres some argument to be made for being suspicious as to where some of that money goes), "functioning in society" means different things to different people. 
A wheel was created with a purpose.. and has no sentience. But no one exists on purpose, and (technically) no one belongs anywhere.
Also, im sure many people agree that money became artificial to some extent when we got off the gold standard. USD became a little closer to monopoly money. Again, i see the flaw in not paying one's taxes. You couldnt've made your money if it werent for people paying taxes, etc. Paving the roads, paying the police and the army to keep us safe, and protect our way of life and our very means of generating the money in the first place. I am not against paying taxes, i'm just pointing out why its interesting to suggest that not being able to to pay taxes with, bananas, for example, makes bananas artificial. You can be a tax paying citizen and still have bananas. As long as the people who ultimately sell the bananas for USD pay taxes on that income, taxes have been paid. Or he eats the banana.

Eliminating cash MIGHT actually be bad, but this quite literally says "eliminating cash is bad because eliminating cash is bad".
Having said that, as far as i can tell, things are only valuable if they are perceived as valuable. If people no longer see the value in cash, it doesn't matter how much you have.

Chances are he only took a picture of it around the time he made the decision to call you out on it. But yes, this raises the possibility that some of the money in your account was ill gotten gains. And it also sort of tarnishes btc's reputation but not really (Especially given what else btc has been used for and all that (most of which USD has been used for for way longer)).
Either way i honestly hope chase does eventually give you some explanation for whats happening here. 
If you're in support of the truth, and bringing shady things, like chase closing your account without any explanation, to light, you have to be in support of letting the light shine on you too.

My feeling is that its the epitome of fairness, though. Odd as it seems, and true as what you said about 30% hitting some harder than others is, another case can be made for how, in another way, 30% still means something similar to everyone. If the two individuals, one rich, one poor, never got to see eachothers living situation, and each had been getting 100% tax free income for their whole lives, i think theyd experience similar levels of indignation when being told that 30% of their money had to go to taxes from now on. Not positive, but i think thats the case.
Edit: but yeah i'm sure you're right it probably will never happen.

can you explain in a really simple way why bitcoin needs to be changed? as far as i can tell its fine the way it is. The less changable it is, the more stable it is, the more we can change it, the more its like fiat, and the less its like gold. Meanwhile it used to seem like the better alternative to gold, bc we can find more gold in space, meanwhile theres a finite amount of btc.
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:57:04
I dont believe that you cant see the difference, you guys must be trolling me, but for anyone else reading this who actually doesnt get the difference, here it is: theres many universities, theres only one bitcoin. And bitcoin, unlike higher education, is a recent development. Baby boomers definitely wouldnt immediately refute the notion that there could be a btc ceo. To them, this is all very bizarre and the notion that something like this could have no "owner" or at least an institution that regulates it, is extremely alien. So a bitcoin CEO is something theyd latch on to as it would be a peg of familiarity, that would make them feel that they understood it better, and had encountered similar things before.
You might think thats better, and that that would bring them closer to investing in it, but i disagree, i think theyd actually say "yeah i know what it is, and im not interested". And i think that if theyd only had someone sit down and explain it more thoroughly and allowed them to ask questions, theyd be extremely taken with the idea of something finite and unregulated. Isnt that funny? the realization that theres a way you could reduce regulation and improve security? And no ones asking for their cut? And you dont have to count on some institution to not print too much money, or to not bail out gigantic corporations like its nothing, until, slowly (or not so slowly) but surely, the money becomes worth a fraction of what it was initially worth?
Well, as others have said, the only people who'll be misled are the ones who only read the headline and didnt read the article. Still, it wouldntve been very difficult to make a headline that was more accurate and but used the same number of words, just swap the word bitcoin for cryptocurrency, better yet, mtgox and wham, you just fit the whole story into the title (If youre already familiar with the "overarching" mtgox story, that is).
Again, im not coming from a place like the one OP's coming from (the title of this reddit post, "poor reporting from afp", i disagree with the message there.). I just have a love of accuracy and a.. morbid dark humor for statements that read as complete falsehoods, especially when theyre not buried in there, and somewhere towards the end of the article. When its on the surface like that is, if itd been a piece id written, id just smile and say "oh buddy" (and be thinking "well big-data.. thats one way to do it"). See people are saying if anyone read the article theyd know what happened, but theyd only read the article if they were interested. If you asked me, this just made the uninformed less informed (because they werent interested in the first place, and now there even less interested bc the big bad btc ceo just got out of jail and is going to shake things up), and perhaps even was sufficient enough of a catalyst to push some people who were on the fence to the point of completely writing it off.
I know if anyone did an ounce of research theyd see this wasnt true, but after coming across 2 or 3 headlines like this, a lot of people will conclude that theres no need to do any more research.
Having said all that, youre right. If anyones at fault here, its the person writing the headlines, and even they themselves probably didnt realize the misleading statement they were writing. 
Most of this is just the result of how hard it can be for me to see a word or two (or lack thereof) change a statement to truthful, to actually suggesting the existence of things that go completely against what the thing is all about. And you have to admit, this is a particularly bad one. Not ONLY does bitcoin now have a CEO, when the best thing about bitcoin has always been that the rules are set and you dont have to worry about the rug being pulled out from under you, or count on anyone else, not only is decentralized unregulated this now both centralized and regulated, but to make matters worse, the leader/proprietor/creator/boss has been in jail for a while and just got out. If the information that theres a guy you have to put your faith in wasnt good enough for you, then by the time youve learned hes just gotten out of jail youll surely be taking out your checkbook.
yeah sorry im going a little nuts. youre right, first sentence explains who he really is. Still, would it have been so much trouble to not say bitcoin CEO? again, youre right, 99% of the time you can get away with that. Autonomous vehicle CEO, very specific, yet definitely not implying that if you want to buy an autonomous vehicle you have to go through him. But what people are ignoring is that thats not what this is. The equivalent to that would be cryptocurrency CEO. very speicifc, but doesnt imply that they invented, or somehow own, or operate all crypto currency. The real example you want is if someone just bought and sold autonomous vehicles was reffered to as "Joe shmoe, tesla CEO" when in reality he just buys and sells autonomous vehicles. I just hate how something so small lead to sentence that reads so inaccurately. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 13:38:25
Terrible comparison. Because Silicon valley is a geographic location. Bitcoin is a technology that someone invented, so its not completely ridiculous to imagine someone concluding that it did in fact have a CEO, or something of that nature. Especially as all other currencies are centralized and do have some institutions "controlling" some aspects of them. This is not the case for bitcoin, and thats one of its main selling points, but this headline sort of sweeps that under the rug.

i think everyone posting here realizes that, but were worried about the perception of bitcoin. And were just pointing out how it would've been a bit more prudent to at least have said "a bitcoin ceo" or "top bitcoin ceo", anything that indicates that at least this guy is not the sole leader/creator of btc, as that could theoretically be the takeaway of a sizable portion of those who come across this headline.

@_date: 2016-07-16 03:19:03
by that logic hes still right, because you should be calling mark a tech ceo too. you dont call him the ceo of cars though. whether you sensationalize, or just neglect to do the research, it doesnt matter. in the end its everyone else who pays the price. 
Youre overlooking something very significant here. the operative word here is a. Elon musk is **a** tech CEO. But its still not the same. Even if you say elon musk, autonomous vehicle CEO, youre not misleading anyone. Because autonomous vehicles is a vague enough thing for that to be an ok classification. But the equivalent appropriate thing to call someone who had a big hand in a company that was involved in bitcoin would be "finance ceo" "cryptocurrency CEO". "guy who ran a cryptocurrency exchange". Even "bitcoin exchange ceo" might mislead a few people into believing that there is/was only one bitcoin exchange and that this guy ran it, but at least it has the possibility of being interpreted correctly.
I mean honestly you have to admit hes right. No one has ever been referred to as a "united states dollar ceo" or a "great british pound ceo" or "gold ceo", even giving someone the title "gun ceo" seems a bit bizarre. 
I'l grant that we make special cases for things that are on the rise in terms of popularity, but still, even you called elon musk a tech ceo. Not elon musk, autonomous vehicle ceo. Even when drugs like adderall and oxycodone were at their height of popularity, i still dont think anyone with more than 10 minutes to write their piece would opt for "oxycodone ceo" or "adderall ceo". Even if their company HAD invented it (and not just purchased it), youd probably still call them "big pharma ceo" or "pharma ceo". If you wanted to be more explicit youd say manufacturer/distributor/inventor of adderall/oxycodone. Yeah the best i can put it is that giving someone the title of bitcoin ceo, even if you meant it in the same vague way as tehc ceo, doenst work for the same reasons that you probably wouldnt call the guy at poland spring a "water ceo". Maybe youd call him a "hydro ceo" or something like that. but i know that even you see that thats suboptimal. Lets say mars invented twix (did they? i honestly dont know), you could get away with calling the guy over there the twix ceo. But even so im sure you see why its better to call him a candy ceo or soemthing like that, because, after all, mars was around for a long time before twix was. So calling him the twix ceo is one thing. But at least he invented twix. The situation were in now is we wrote a headline that said "mark, twix ceo, gets out of jail" And its not that he "owns" many candy bars, and that twix ceo is an oversimplification. No, its the only thing worse than that. Its that he didnt create twix, or any candy. He just had a popular store where he sold twix. Hes candy selling ceo, mark karpeles. maybe twix selling ceo mark karpeles. Not twix ceo mark karpeles. and all my fellow twix eaters are looking at the television thinking "dare you dirty the name of thine sacred caramel stick?". 
Next thing you know we'll be hearing about J. P. Morgan, USD CEO.
and yeah, like you said, it very well couldve been a result of poor judgement in terms of choice of words, and if it was i definitely am capable of figuring out the intended meaning, youre 100% right about that. But i do disagree with the notion that this is something we as a society should have to tolerate. Someone wrote a misleading headline. Maybe for sensationalism, maybe they have a short position open, or maybe, like i said, its just the result of their negligence, but regardless of what caused it, the rest of society are the ones who pay the price because someone else took it upon them self to write a statement that when read at a glance appears to be telling a very different story than what actually happened. Intent doesnt matter so much, especially as one can never be sure of another's intent.
p.s. bitcoin is also worse because most people understand so little about btc that it doesnt occur to them that there could be many people who operate businesses that are very bitcoin centered. Its one thing to imagine a business that accepts bitcoin. But its a bigger leap to expect people to assume or immediately realize that there could be an couple people making money from bitcoin exchanges. Or for them to even wrap their head around that. In a place like the US its been a while since someone running an exchange was in teh news. I wouldnt be too shocked to hear an infant wonder aloud whether banks had always existed, because in a way it definitely seems that way. So when you say bitcoin CEO, i have to say im pretty sure most people dont conclude that youre refferring to a of one the slew of bitcoin exchanges to have been created in the last couple years. It totally shouts "this guy invented/owns/has a big say in what happens wiht bitcoin." You cant expect people to immediately realize that bitcoin ceo means he operates a bitcoin exchange. elon doesnt operate an autonomous vehicle exchange. And again, autonomous vehicle is more like the field. id say what tesla is to autonomous vehicles, bitcoin is to cryptocurrency. Which is not to say that i think tesla is good/bad, just that the most appropriate title for elon IS telsa ceo. because he made tesla. you could also call him an autonomous vehicle CEO though and you wouldnt be lying. And you could refer to mark as "cryptocurrency ceo" and you wouldnt be lying. But calling him bitcoin ceo is a little like calling someone who owned a tesla dealership "tesla ceo". It sort of implies ownership or that he had something to do with its creation/origins. At least investment, if not ingenuity/time. And if he didnt invest in it or create it, at least now he owns it. but even thats not true. Yeah normally youd be right but btc is such an unusual thing for society that btc ceo sounds like youre effectively saying that btc has a leader of some kind, and one of the main selling points for btc has always been this minimization of the possibility of the negative effects of human error/greed. If nothing else, the thought that if everything does go to shit, it will be the system, or theory, that's fucked us, not some guy we elected/put our trust in.

Is the idea that the lessening of the debt will lead to steady growth? or are those two separate things?
When i think about it like "If you already have money you can keep it, and people with large debts can catch a break.", it sounds too good to be true, and when you think about it it doesnt seem to be. But still, 2% a year? That means that every 35 years the number of dollars in the world doubles. Im not saying that means each one is worth half as much, but it definitely doesnt stay the same.
And isnt 3% a year the best deal you can even get from most banks nowadays? seems like a bit more harm that good. and why should all of society have to pick up the slack for the people who took on debt and couldnt pay it back? isnt that the risk you take? It can work out wonderfully or terribly, but you make your own judgement on whether it makes sense to borrow money and if youre right you make money and if youre wrong you learn a lesson and you and everyone who values your.. ideas, will become that much more knowledgeable about how those things can go, and what types of situations do and dont merit taking out loans. Also the debts dont stay stagnant either. i know theyre not really comparable things, since i dont think theres any payments we can make to avoid the 2% a year, but still, im sure that if you werent making your payments your debt would definitely wind up significantly larger 35 years down the road even accounting for inflation. 
Having said all that nonsense, thats the first time ive heard a pretty logical explanation of how inflation could, in principle, actually serve a relatively useful purpose. And a downright ingenious way to mitigate the effects of gigantic amounts of debt without turning everyones money to complete shit (at least not overnight). And i say "why should we have to pick up the slack" but im really not being fair. Id think 2% a year definitely effects the time frame minimally enough that no harm will come of it. Like whatever good OR bad was going to come of being in debt, its not gonna change much when you add in 2%. Itll have changed them forever either way. i should mention that im basically assuming that it takes them 35~ years to pay off the debt in question.
Still, i think the real solution is more of a middle ground, instead of putting all the blame for losing a lot of money on the one who takes out the loan, more of it should be on the peolpe who give out the loan. It shouldnt just be the person who takes out the loan who picks up the slack, the people who lend money to others when theres obviously a pretty good chance they wont be able to pay it back should have to deal with some of the consequences of that. And i know thats easier said than done, i mean otherwise what incentive do they have to pay you back? But yeah. It shouldnt all be on the guy taking out the loan, because when you take out a loan, you MIGHT profit. But the bank will almost definitely profit, and even if they dont ever see a dime of your money, theyll make it back on other loans and if you ever do get a job theyll take your money out of your paycheck. Its.. a sad situation to say the least. I dont really blame the bank that much, i just wish they had to "get their hands a bit more dirty" and/or take on more risk. Instead of the current situation where it seems like theyre giving themselves pretty good odds considering theyre taking almost no risk. ah well. wow i really went on for a while going off topic there. 
thanks for the inflation explanation.

theres no ambiguity there, because that one says "**top** silver ceo" which implies that he is not the only ceo, which leads you to revert back to what you probably though before reading it, that there is no leader/creator/owner of silver, this is just someone who owns a business that is somehow centered around silver. I know full well that theres no CEO of bitcoin, but it bothers me because that thats the picture it paints for other people at a glance.
Youre right, that article is bad reporting. And this reddit post wouldve never come in to existence had they written "**top** bitcoin CEO" or even "**a** bitcoin CEO".

Bitcoin is different, bitcoin was invented. oil is a natural resource. Everyone knows there cant really be a CEO of oil. But because of the nature of bitcoin, the fact that its essentially a technology that was invented, not everyone knows that there cant be a CEO of bitcoin. Bitcoin is different, because it definitely does have a creator and from the perspective of someone new to bitcoin definitely seems like something that could theoretically have an owner/proprietor. So when you say bitcoin CEO, youre either being sensationalist or careless. A better comparison would be "USD CEO". Its also a lot like referring to someone who buys and sells teslas (operates an exchange for teslas) as "Tesla CEO". You can do it with oil, because everyone knows oil wasnt invented by anyone, so no ones being led astray. Tesla on the other hand.. most people are well aware that its a new technology but are not aware of much else. SO its easy to see how someone could be mislead into believing that BTC did in fact have a CEO.

theres no ambiguity there, because that one says "**top** silver ceo" which implies that he is not the only ceo, which leads you to revert back to what you probably though before reading it, that there is no leader/creator/owner of silver, this is just someone who owns a business that is somehow centered around silver. I know full well that theres no CEO of bitcoin, but it bothers me because that thats the picture it paints for other people at a glance.
