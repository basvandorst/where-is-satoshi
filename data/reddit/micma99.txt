You need to visit all your 2fa enabled websites and login with 2fa with your old phone and disable 2fa then reenable 2fa using your new phone.

What did they use before crypto? Fiat? Anybody making a study on that?
What about our Gov. reps. using fiscal paradises to avoid taxes?

Happened to me, like the computer does not recognize that something was plugged in the USB port. No USB music when plugging the Ledger, 3 different computers 3 different sync cables including the original ledger cable, the manager just sat there and said to plug the ledger and unlock it. Funny thig is the Ledger was turning on with a working screen.
I returned the ledger for refund. The thing is I got BTG in a segwit wallet on it and nothing can recover it at the moment. I also had BTC in a segwit wallet which I recovered using the seed in electrum.

Don't listen to any of these shills, first off you gotta be 18 to be on an exchange. Second, do not upload any "fake ID", you'll get caught and lose it all.
Lastly, get a parent or a legal guardian to help you. 4k is a large sum, don't screw it up!
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:10:14
Check bitcoin ticker on ios and android, (I think they have android)
I use the IOS one, even has my exchange.

you can divide into satoshis 0.00000001 which would convert to 210,000,000,000,000 all-time maximum satoshi's.

I got both :)}
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:55
there's just nodes, they support segwit but not in the GUI. Just download bitcoin core and run it. Don't forget it'll download a copy of the chain which is at around 150GB
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:52
and only ~5000 bch/cad on QCX

Unfounded, if at any point you went to a financial institution for any kind of borrowing, equifax has your info already.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:28:45
Look at Equifax, they receive your info from different loan providers when you ask for credit (bank, visa, mortgage loans) Equifax holds your credit history and builds a credit score for you for the different institutions to lookup. Did you provide your private credentials to Equifax? No, the different institutions you deal with did. And Equifax got hacked!
Now you decide if you want to get on board an exchange or not and be responsible for your decision and stop looking for a reason to or not!

The tamper proof seal has been removed by the manufacturer and they comment it on their website. Instead has internal tamper proof checks to make sure it's authentic.

Localbitcoins, sell them on the street, better yet, sell them to a friend.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:24
GDAX and Coinbase are Roger Ver approved, so avoid!

I don't usually buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin.
But, when I do, I pay the 25$ fee!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:47:52
shoulda sold them through Localbitcoins! Now you have to pay fees to move them, fees to sell them, fees to move fiat back home. Coinbase is a fees provider!

Have you tried a bitcoin transaction accelerator?
This one is free provided you are within 100 demands from the top of the hour.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:19:39
Love QuadrigaCX, I can send for free.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:55
Yes you can because you hold the magic private key.
But first move the btc to a different address, then claim bcash from that paper key. This is to make sure there's no replay.

Does the same app exist on both? Like BRD?
What if installing the same app on the new phone with the same seed from the old phone. Wouldn't that sync up to the same wallet?

If I would, after the fork, send my 1 BTC on the Bitcoin chain in address A to address B that I control, then send my 1 S2X from same address A to wherever on the S2X chain would I be safe from replay as that BTC A address is no coin left?

Christ when will people get it, LocalBitcoins, as in local, as in local with cash in hand! That's what it was designed for.
People offering PayPal transactions are just begging for a scam!
Do your research!

If you can't wait anymore you could try an accelerator. I tried these folks once and worked ok.

Doesn't matter if you took the money out, PayPal will take it back if the buyer disputes.

Must be the public address, unless you posted the private key on Facebook which in that case the coins are gone.

I use BRD (breadwallet) for IOS.
Created a wallet and converted to segwit, sent my BTC to it.
Remember to write down and safeguard your 12 word mnemonic.
Then, disassociate the wallet from BRD and delete the app.
Instant cold wallet!
Reinstall the app, load your backed up 12 word mnemonic whenever you need to move bitcoin.
Nothing to buy!

I think PayPal gives up to 45 days to make a dispute, so you're not out of the woods yet. PayPal can take the money out of your account if the buyer disputes.
Localbitcoins: cash in hand only!
