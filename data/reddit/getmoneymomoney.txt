Why ban it tho? It’s good conversation ? I didn’t know the answers below until I read this post...

Are you assuming you will be able to sell the S9s for $500??

How much is rent ?

I think it will be under 2 closer to 1 year. You definitely need to include the cost of your equipment in your P/L. I’d recommend a year long amortization based on how long machines seem to last before an upgrade comes out.

Doesn’t have rent cost... Have you factored in difficulty increase into the higher price points? 
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:17:24
Are you amortizing the cost of the machines in your monthly P/L projections?

You can ACH in for free to coinbase and transfer to GDAX to get into BTC which I think is .25% if I'm not mistaken. I'm not offended. Blindly throwing around terms can be fun but needs to be backed up by real data at some point.

Fear, uncertainty, future growth. Keep in mind it's not just that news, it's also the Jamie Dimon comment combined with (now) poor technicals.

I'm curious to see how much of the entire market being banned was priced in...

I'm shorting until a bottom forms then will reverse my position

Charts don't go straight up, or down for that matter, no one is missing out on "the moon" if they get rid of their position in a big time bear market. Anyone who continues to use "the moon" in their comments I don't take seriously.

Maybe no one in this sub. Unfortunately, there are lots of btc holders not in this sub.

You're not wrong but I'm a bear and think the 3k wall will be taken out pretty shortly

Do you know what dips looks like? It doesn't matter what side of the dip you buy on (down or up) it's still a dip.

I'm here for bitcoin info not b/c I want to throw terms like the moon out and rah rah without legitimate debate about the point and "value" of btc. Bitcoin was intended to be a currency not an investment per se. It can be both, but it and the people who may use it need to figure that out. Typically volatility does not mesh well with the terms above. It's actually the exact argument for why many people should want to be using BTC. 
You're wrong about the fees, the fees are minuscule compared to traditional FIAT or stock trading. The extreme volatility coupled with the extremely low trading fees make cryptos in general fantastic candidates for trading over traditional markets/fiat. Are you familiar with the volatility and fees associated with traditional markets?

Kraken has some serious serious issues. My wire took over 10 biz days. A fucking WIRE.

But no one knows that. My local bitcoin ATM is currently at $3000 for 1 BTC so no one would do that. And I just read a post on here from a guy who got scammed on localbitcoins.  Also, bitco is stupid.
