Let's put it this way. If I have $300,000,000 and I want to live a comfortable life, I'd say I would invest 95% or more of my worth... Now let's be more reasonable. If I make 100,000 per year and I want to live comfortably, I'd match the max for a 401k which is $18,500 per year, or about 18.5%

You saying hodlers are crazy?
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:21:09
Let me tell you a story.
There's a guy I know who's selling his house for a nice profit. He's planning to buy 21 BTC regardless of the price at the time. His house closes sometime around March 11... lol
He's been wondering if he should just buy the 21 now, and replace that fiat when he receives the money from his house, or whether he should wait it out and let the gods decide his fate.
 I think he's going to let the gods decide, unless the price dips below $1,000... Then he'll probably jump in ASAP
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:10:30
I'm living with my buddy for the next seven months. He's skeptical about Bitcoin, but I convinced him to accept 2 BTC for rent. I paid upfront... I've created a hodler.

I know someone who is removing all fiat debt. He'll be debt free next month, freeing up enough money for him to max out his 401k, Roth, and I don't know how much he's throwing into bitcoin each payday, but he's talked about halving his 401k, which would put him at ~$350 per paycheck.
I don't think the lump purchase is the best way to go. It's the riskiest. People bought $1,100 coins in 2013 and the price didn't come back until recently. Don't owe the bank, so you can pay yourself.
That's my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:51:07
That man probably isn't crazy. He's probably just doing this for the attention. However, he appears to be crazy. I like to imagine us hodlers as men, sitting comfortably in a leather chair, reading the news while grinning.

I got into bitcoin November 8th, 2016. The price was $714, I believe. I remember seeing it dip to ~$680, then shoot to +$900... My experience? Buy 21 to hodl until retirement, then buy every other week to use as a savings account.

The price will get to 957.48 in about 17 hours from me posting this. That's when you'll want to buy. It will take 23 days, 13 hours and 12 minutes before we hit 1,202. The price will only stay there for an hour, so sell quickly.

People recently got into bitcoin and don't quite understand it enough. They think it's a get rich quick thing. I think there will be pullbacks once the price goes to $1,350. People trying to get out of an investment they didn't fully understand. I don't think the price will dip into triple digits because there are plenty of people like me who buy when I see the price dropping.

I was thinking about this today. If there are a few hands, in comparison, using Bitcoin every transaction affects the price more than when you have the exponentially more hands making transactions using a fiat. I think this may be true because people are hodling btc instead of using it for everyday transactions, like the usd. Who saves usd? The percentage is probably a lot less in comparison, I'd think. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:03:47

I didn't know about Bitcoin until November 8th when I won an online bet I had placed a year before that Trump would be President. I cashed out in btc because it was cheaper to do so. Since then, I've been glad that I at least know about it. Been hoarding since. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:18:39
Because of the possibility of btc being used as a fiat someday. Reliance on btc instead of their current fiat would force the price past the moon. If you think about the price now, then look at the price a few years ago, we're already on the moon.

@_date: 2017-05-23 05:16:06
LTC ETH BTC. Not necessarily in that order.
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:51:01
You should be panic buying litecoin. ��
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:58:42
LTC will always be faster than BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:31:26
My ether and LTC been making me more money than your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:23:51
People won't stop talking about it because it's doing everything right.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:25:11
I like the decentralization of Bitcoin. I also like it for how fast and easy it is to transfer....
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:53:58
Do you even crypto, bro?
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:38:19
Seems like that's a job for LTC since BTC could never be as fast as LTC anyways
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:15:57
You're dumb not to diversify.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:24:14
Doesn't matter who did it first...
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:40:47
LTC, ETH, GNT, BTC. In that order.
@_date: 2017-05-06 07:08:42
Buy gnt and ltc
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:30:19
I disagree, but could be wrong. I sold all my BTC except one for ETH and LTC
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:34:30
I got some great profits from BTC. No Ragrets
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:16:19
Smart contracts. Large companies implimenting this for their own side chains. Big companies would have to pay gas. Lots of company monies added to the eth block chain.
If I'm wrong, someone elaborate please.
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:31:20
Yeah. Why would anyone want a cheap, instant transfer of money when you can wait an hour and pay a higher fee?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:13:56
You haven't been reading this sub lately? People can only transfer money if they release stupid high fees. People were waiting days for confirmations. Your miners fuck you.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:04:04
Scaling problems? No. The Bitcoin community thinks that they're the best, but BTC is the AOL of crypto. Shit was very relevant for a long time, but now it's just more convenient to use a different provider.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:12:01
Absolutely! This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:10:43
Don't worry. They'll start accepting litecoin soon enough.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:54:18
Because Bitcoin won't scale
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:55:58
Pretty sure you're wrong on this one.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:00:37
LMAO. If you were in it for the tech, you'd have more LTC than BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:04:28
If you're using it to transfer between currencies, who cares? You must be one of those people that holds Bitcoin because it has value in USD instead of practical uses.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:50:36
Except that it's easier to transfer than BTC...
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:43:52
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:48:51
A better version of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:51:12
Balsy move putting money somewhere because a redditor gives you advice.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:48:04
Literafts ��
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:32:03
Buy high, sell low
@_date: 2017-05-02 01:51:14
People been taking profits on exchanges. The safest place to do that is by selling for BTC. This creates a hype. This is only a small reason, but I think it's a reason, still.
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:04:06
Unless BTC can keep up with LTC, who will care?
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:20:02
Litecoin is doing well.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:16:19
1 BTC = $2008
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:34:27
It's not your profit until you've cashed out. Good luck though
@_date: 2017-07-06 04:07:55
It cracks me up that people who don't know the difference between 'too' and 'to' expect to get rich from their 20 BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:37:40
It isn't dead, but if you don't take advantage of a known dip, you is so dumb.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:05:26
BTC may be good long, but maybe not. Maybe it's gonna be taken over soon by a coin that can handle transactions. When you read that people are upset because their Bank transfers money faster than BTC, you know it's time to sell.
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:49:37
If the price starts to fall $10 per minute, at the current transfer times, you'd have $0!
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:36:25
Spelled Litecoins wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:08:50
Op: give me roller coaster man and stop the conversation!
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:54:11
You'd come in under 10 minutes, and she wouldn't even have a confirmation by then.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:17:17
You should think more critically. These crypto subs are full of fud
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:43:08
What are you going to buy with your $55?
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:21:14
John the club. Most people on this subreddit don't know. They just want muh moon
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:46:54
Hard to move gold. Hard to move Bitcoin. We did it! Bitcoin is officially as difficult and expensive to move as gold!
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:04:43
If OP does it, everyone else profits.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:31:09
Bull trap, maybe
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:07:19
Fitting that I bought 86 eth today
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:07:25
Ohh I did. But we've all got different profits. We can do different things dependant on that
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:40:47
I love this post for many reasons.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:37:05
Does the card not fit in your standard wallet? I mean, how big is this card?
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:32:03
Ehem. Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:02:24
You can buy at poloniex or liqui.io, or you can wait about 4-6 weeks and earn
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:40:34
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:06:31
I hope not, because I did the opposite weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:54:18
$50 for 100K of Bitcoin? If like to do that as well ��
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:57:48
America is not something for people to want in there coins. Slaves, wars, the confiscation of gold, government spending while our poverty and prisoner rates climb, a large population believing the world is 6,000 years old, worship of uneducated celebrities... I'm drifting off and scraping the bottom of this barrel, but the point is: FUCKING SEGWIT YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!!
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:38:15
And I made a few thousand dollars. Now I'm out for good. LTC and ETH are the good bets now.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:26:16
lol. i already bought a brand new jeep wrangler with some of them.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:49:31
I'm from Florida, yo.
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:21:32
My arm pits don't sweat anymore. It's pretty bad ass. No stains, no smell, no sweat, nothing. It's called MiraDry
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:54:51
Maybe I'm a fool then
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:15:40
The lightning network works, litecoin has no bugs with segwit, it just works. Trezor integration because of it. Segeit has allowed 2017 to be the year for many additions to Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:25:08
Front and rear bumpers + accessories for my Jeep, alpacka pack raft kayak, and a procedure where they zap away your arm pit sweat glands... I never have to wear deodorant or anti-persperant​ ever again! lmao
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:37:55
Just a friendly told ya so.
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:22:04
C'mon guys Bitcoin to beat fiat? That's ridiculous, what....are they gonna wait hours or days for a transaction to go through? Pay fees that are higher than their transfer amount?
There is no world where [the current state of] Bitcoin beats fiat. Lets sort this out...
SEGWIT, ya dumb cunts.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:13:11
Good on ya! They're not profits until you cash out. I got lucky and cashed out a bunch of eth at just under $400 cause I wanted to buy toys ��
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:17:57
Litecoin is what Bitcoin should be. Me thinks Bitcoin needs segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:44:27
I left BTC for LTC, ETH, and some others in January. Glad that I did, but I've recently put some profits back into BTC because of its resilience. I hope BTC will activate segwit and follow Litecoin'$ example now that Litecoin has made it extremely clear that segwit is the best thing since sliced bread.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:10:06
Even the most illegitimate coins don't follow this. Even complete shit-coins crash above their previous highs. This bubble will continue until the world understands how to comprehend blockchain integration. Remember when everyone wanted to make a webpage regardless of the contents? Remember when IBM created the world's first touch screen phone in 1994? 
The first is sometimes under-appreciated, but when everyone is getting on board, a bubble is about to be popping. And the ICOs are why I got out of Ether. However, Litecoin has what Bitcoin should have: SEGWIT. I'm afraid this touch screen that we all want is undervalued at the present. At any rate, I hope for the success of BTC and LTC.
And maybe I'll get back into ether again, just not right now.
