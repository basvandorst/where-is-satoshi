The made ad. Not the Western Union ad. They still own that property. Like I said before, Weird Al can't include the original tracks just because he's parodying them.

Western Union is outdated and most people who previously used it have already moved on to other things.
If I want to send money to a family member who lives abroad or something (where it's difficult to send a check) then I use a bank transfer for free, or shoot it through Chase quickpay for free, or have the bank mail the check for free, or any other totally effortless methods of sending money for free somewhere.

No, the parody is the right side. Their ad on the left is still their intellectual property.

The parody (right side) would fall under parody law. The original WU IP doesn't.
It would be like if Weird Al included a CD with all the original tracks he parodied with his CD.

Most people don't have unbanked family members who also use bitcoin. You're looking at a microscopic market.
Yes? You may not get wire transfer fees waived with a free checking account, but all of my various accounts offer free international wire transfers.
And if not? Paypal. 
Western Union and Bitcoin may have an niche where it's more convenient for a standard family gift, but it's just a niche. I don't have a single person who I would use either for before my bank, and I doubt I'm alone or unique in that.
Western Union had their worst year in the last 5 this past year, earning 119 million inflation adjusted dollars in income less than their previous low in 2009. Over a 10% drop.

Everyone who suggested it was got way downvoted. There seemed to be a general agreement that WU was totally wrong

True? I don't think I ever said anything to the contrary.
What I said was that Weird Al can't toss in a copy of the Original Works he parodied alongside his parodies. He can't distribute a CD that contains "Ode to a Spiderman" alongside "Piano Man" even though he is permitted to create and distribute "Ode to a Spiderman" without Billy Joel's involvement, he would require Billy Joel's permission to distribute "Piano Man".
All of these side-by-side ads are putting Western Union's "Piano Man" next to the user's "Ode to a Spiderman" and Western Union is reacting by having the IP that they own taken down.

No, people think that it does. It doesn't actually do anything.

No, what? What are you talking about? I don't know how many ways to explain the difference between distributing the original work and the parody.
[Here is a Western Union ad.]( Do they own that IP? Absolutely. Can you distribute or reproduce it without their permission? No. If you do, you can validly receive a take-down notice. It isn't your right to post their ads anywhere you want.
And that continues to be true, even when you put a parody *next to* it. That ad didn't stop being their IP just because there is [now a parody next to it here.]( And why would it be? The parody is fine, *no one* is saying the parody is a problem. The problem is reproducing, displaying, and distributing the *original ad* that I posted.
Weird Al produces and distributes parody songs but doesn't distribute the *original song* next to them. He sells copies of "Ode to a Spiderman" but doesn't put them side-by-side with "Piano Man" on the same CD.
THAT is what is triggering take-down notices from Western Union, repeatedly posting their ads.

Yes? That's the major part of creating a parody. But he doesn't distribute THE original work. These side-by-side "ads" have Western Union's ORIGINAL work on the left side. That's the copyright issue.
