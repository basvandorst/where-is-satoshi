A stock represents a real world holding in a company with protections against fraud and rights that are enforceable in court.  The US stock market is the most regulated and policed in the world, if not perfectly.  Cryptocurrency has zero protections against any kind of scams, fraud, or market manipulation, and has no inherent value.

We understand it all right.  It’s an overhyped scam that had a bubble and is rapidly becoming worthless, and that has spawned many even more worthless and fraudulent imitators.

It is usable in 0.00001% of the places that cash and credit cards are.  It’s only real uses are illegal - tax evasion, money laundering, or buying illegal products.

How are your altcoins and ICOs doing?

“My bank account got stolen for no good reason” -no one ever.
“Crypto isn’t regulated like the stock market” - and see what happens.

Bitcoin and other crypto are not actual assets.  Unlike stocks or bonds or real estate, you don’t own anything with any tangible value in the real world, or any income stream, and you don’t have any legal protections or rights that are enforceable in court.  Its only value comes from selling it to other investors.

The US inflation rate is about 2% per year, and Western Europe is comparable.  Japan has actually had deflation.

Because they’ve run out of suckers?

So obviously it has no non-criminal real world uses and is totally impractical as a currency.

What’s the last thing you actually bought using bitcoin?

Bitcoin has no inherent value, unlike a real stock or bond or other asset like real estate.  Its value is only what others pay for it, and could easily go to zero.
Bitcoin is useless for non-criminal real world transactions.  The “blockchain” can only handle 0.00001% of the transactions Master Card or Pay Pal do every day.
Bitcoin and other crypto prices are heavily manipulated by whales in ways that don’t occur in the real stock market.
Most “altcoins” and ICOs are totally worthless and many were outright scams from the start.
Crypto is like a Ponzi scheme in that crypto prices can only increase when real world money enters the crypto eco system.  For earlier investors to cash out requires large numbers of new buyers.  If people stop putting money in a crypto coin there won’t be buyers and there will be no way to cash it out for real money.
And it’s a (failed) solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, because inflation is actually very low in modern economies in the US, Europe, and Japan.
