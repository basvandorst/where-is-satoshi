Can you explain how signaling and forks relate to my idea?
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:23:04
Yeah, the purpose is to not pay miners who produce blocks not consistent with what I want.

It can be used by smaller miners to edge out larger ones too.  Being smaller doesn't mean better.  The purpose of this is to edge out miners that provide less value.
Discounted rates are great, which other miners would have to discount their rates too to compete.  That's a benefit

I don't think governments would care about playing the hash-power game.  They have something better, called the legal use of force.  I think bitcoin ultimately will be pushed underground by every major government.  I don't see any government allowing a significant competing currency to the national one, especially one they don't control.
It's not even the governments we have to worry about, but the future devs.  Eventually, the freedom lovers that invented and work on this thing will retire and be replaced by mainstream devs, and the userbase will become predominately ignorant of why it was created, and eager to take advantaged of it.  Unprincipled people will not respect the 21m cap, the ending of block rewards, the independence of bitcoin.  What's to stop them from doing what's in their immediate interest?
And when governments start to demand certain controls be implemented, or else, the devs will either happily or begrudgingly comply, and the userbase won't care, so why it is not just a matter of time?

I'm surprised no one has yet agreed with this.  I don't like BU either but I think this is a good point.
It wasn't the economic majority who built bitcoin as it is.  It was the passion, dedication, values, and skill of the capable.
If you think the economic majority should decide bitcoins direction, just wait until the majority of bitcoins is not held by but instead by the ignorant masses.  That's a scary thought to me
Please tell me how I am wrong?

Then they should be pushed out. I thought smaller miners join with a pool though and it's like a collective?

I just found out economic majority means the people who accept bitcoins for goods and services that share a majority opinion.  However, everyone seems to use it in different ways.
But my reply was only referencing people who own bitcoins, but the conclusion is the same.  I would not want the direction of bitcoin voted on by the people who accept bitcoins.  Is this what people are advocating for?

From the looks of it, ViaBTC is a mining pool.  I understand they can process a transaction for me.  They offer something called "Transaction Accelerator" but it has nothing to do with my idea.
I want to limit my transactions to being processed by miners I support.  If I want only Slushpool and my friend steve to process my transaction, because I like the software they run, etc.., then I should be able to enter their IDs into my client and have my transactions processed by them.
If 51% attacks are a real concern, this is a strong tool to combat them.

I think that would be effective enough to be worthwhile to do if done very thoroughly.  But we have to realize that users don't have the interest of the project as a whole in mind, only how it benefits them.  So a constitution is meaningless to them.
I think what would be more effective is a pact among the devs.  Anyone can submit code, but in order to have merging privileges, you have to agree to the pact.  Call it a Code of Ethics or something.  It has to be a signed agreement by every new member of the bitcoin org, or else it won't be taken serious.
Blockchains are trustless, but the specific implementation of the coins are not.  They are based on the trust of the devs.  If we want the things we value in bitcoin to be preserved, they have to be diligently instilled and enforced by the people with the power to change them.

He still has at least 82 BTC.  This is his wallet

Thank you for your hard work and keeping us updated!
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:30:33
Thank you core devs for not compromising your values that make Bitcoin valuable

Hi Erik, can you please take a look at the post I made yesterday regarding segwit2x consensus?  
Do you think I made any valid points there?
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:59:29
I am not opposed to 2mb blocks, but the NY "agreement" is insulting.  Provide an argument and not appeals to authority, please.

Bitcoin has to stay competitive to be valuable.  If another coin comes along that is more useful, people will use it instead.  Investing in any crypto-currency is in large part a bet on the developers to keep improving.
