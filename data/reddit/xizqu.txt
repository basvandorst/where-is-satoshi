I use zero block for a lot of news and the price is the first thing you see. I don't even notice it anymore. R/bitcoin FTW

Oh nothing really, you know just stuff like quantitative easing and debasement of our currency by greedy banksters. Just stuff no one cares about.

Oh no! A new and revolutionary innovation that solves world problems that we once thought were impossible still has some challenges to over come. Man why can't bitcoin be as cool as the Internet and pop into mainstream light right away. Oh wait, it took a few years? People didn't like the Internet at first even though it solved world problems? Wow! Sounds like history is repeating itself at the moment. Go to r/buttcoin, you'll have better conversations their (;

Do you know how yelp works? They do not delete a single review. Doesn't matter what it says, it clearly says in their terms they do not carry the right to take away a review unless the merchant can prove there was no purchase by that consumer. On an online market that would be easy to do. 
Secondly you spat out some bs that people will have incentive to leave negative reviews and not positive ones. Where is your evidence to support this? Yes negative reviews are louder than positive ones. But how come amazon can have a fine review system, ebay, even silk road people went and gave GOOD reviews more than others. 
So i end with, stop spitting nonsense. Stop attacking my informative Friend here will total bullshit. You act like the epitome of an American lazy ass. You truly don't know how OB works and how they have solved some really big problems. Yes they have some problems of their own to deal with but if you told me google was perfect in 1999 I'd laugh in your face. 
Try and remember that they are making something new and unheard of. Something you've probably never even thought about doing. Through your post of ad hominems and lack of any real information show me you don't digest knowledge, you just spit hate. Such a pity.
