Just the fact that bitcoin is the first crypto, anonymous, trusted and completely decentralized is enough. These alts have mother website mainly to enrich the founders which i don't really see their supernova technology but more as red flag toxic environment for the crypto community.

@_date: 2017-12-30 19:25:18
bro u think we know if the coin will crash or no?? We all think it will keep rising because of the utility of bitcoin in the future , there is only 21 million coins, crypto currency is a very important technology in our modern world. For me this dip just prove how healthy bitcoin is, hodl don't listen to the fud.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:21:14
take some chill pill.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:34:35
Yes but unfortunately Its better than bitcoin in term of scalling and on top of those bigger block size they could develop the so callled "Lightning Network" later on in the future and i guess still maintain low fee'S and fast confirmations on chain. But i really don'T want to support this fork... bitcoin is way better anonymously created and well decentralized, the normal people got in before the big players. Bitcoinash seem centralized by roger ver, his team , big compagny and fake satoshi lol they will dump it all on our ass and I hate it mostly because roger ver (criminal) and fake satoshi (craig white) support it.. these people can't be trusted.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:29:35
Nothing related with the original creator, its a fork from some corrupted criminal who support it, roger ver criminal/and made people loose billions with mt.gox scam, Craig white fake satoshi who claimed on media to be the original bitcoin creator.

@_date: 2018-03-24 22:58:01
It's not his bitcoins he is liquidating like a pure bastard destroying the market with panic sells. He should have enough fiat by now to repay users losses and refund the rest with bitcoin. Large sums that been confiscated like that should be sold in auctions, not in small exchange there is not enough liquidity.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:56:31
all over this sub, you don't see the ads? someone is promoting this shitcoin heavy
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:06:58
 Thats pretty much the bottom,  its being manipulated by the whales, they are shaking out all the weak-hands so y’all understand and learn to hodll next time. Not gonna lie, my first time when I heard about exchangee and these greenn volatiliity I invested in shitc0in they didn’t had t0kens at the time and I lost my BTC value. Unlike Bitcoin I never used or even withdrew these shitc0ins beside tradiing them on exchange. Alot of noobs joined the space lately and invest in shitc0in expecting they would be worth more than bitcoin This will never happen and this is one reason that impacted bitcoin to drop, so y’all can understand that **Bitcoin is the only true internet currency**, the rest is all shitcoin and will forever be Pomp and Domp to increase your bitcoin value. **Bitcoin 25K+ EOY**
Carefull about shitc0ins, mostly lately with ethareum platform its even more easy to create shitc0in, these **t0kens are all shit** and created within a minute, and its creators launch a fancy website and request funds only to enrich themself and y’all noobs easely fall for it. Ethereum t0kens are shit they Pomp and Domp you don’t wanna hodl this.

@_date: 2018-04-09 21:24:01
They probably panic sold after looking their wallet. Don't expect all bitcoin buyer being on Reddit, you'd be surprised to know how much people buy bitcoin without using or even knowing reddit
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:42:26
I said that because I been seeing a lot of post about bitcoin unconfirmed transaction etc lately. **FUD**, they are making a slick attack on the network to push their agenda because they feel the Bullrun is coming 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:27:26
by now I hope everyone know bch bcc aka bcash is nothing but a scam coin. Once the Bullrun hype start be ready to see the next artificial attack planned by Roger and Jihan on the bitcoin network to make his coin relevant again.
