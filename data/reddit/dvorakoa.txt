So businesses can accept Bitcoin instantly after 0 confirmations? That's really cool, I didn't know that. Are there cases of getting a product through 0 confirmations but then the BTC doesn't go through for some reason?

Can't Apple or Google just create their own altcoin and then start distributing it using their massive ecosystem of apps. They already reward you a few pennies here and there for questionnaires and updating their maps.

I really don't have an agenda. Bought a Trezor wallet a few months back and that was instant. Maybe paying while you're out and about is slower than just paying online. Do you know how the 0 confirmations thing works? A few people have mentioned it below.

But why wouldn't Google Coin (lets call it gcoin) survive? Surely the public would rather trust a global company than a group of anonymous individuals. You have to remember the public know about Bitcoin through Mt Gox and Silk Road while Google can just add a button on their homepage that says 'Download Your Google Wallet Today!' and rake in the users.

Pretty simple, I just scanned the QR code and typed the amount I would like to pay. Only hassle I found was getting the bitcoins in the first place, it's not as common here in the UK. 
Once the bitcoins were in my wallet/phone I felt much more comfortable.

Bitcoin has had a bad rap with consumers. Putting a brand most people will trust (Google, Amazon etc.) as the face of this new cryptocurrency will drive adoption. How many people around the world use Bitcoin? A few million perhaps. How many use the Play Store to purchase apps, songs etc. Hundreds of millions I would imagine.
Why would Google adopt bitcoin in the future when they can develop their own and control it?  Genuine question though, I'm not being facetious.

Could you ELI5 cold storage for me? If I buy a Trezor would I have to create a backup (is this just a file?) somewhere else just in case?

I think with Google being Google and having a lot of their higher ups in Pentagon / White House will help. They could create an altcoin on the Blockchain called GoogleCoin and ensure people use it or entangle it with their services. 
Again if I was Google this is something I'd do as I would have the knowledge, contacts and resources to do so.

Would BitGo / Mycelium be classed as 'cold storage'?
