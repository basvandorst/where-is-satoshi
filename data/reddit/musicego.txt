No doubt millions of dollars could be used in many different ways, and your ideas would greatly benefit the cause, but would take a lot more time and a greater amount of support just to get off the ground. I feel like we need to get the masses to at least start asking questions about bitcoin. What better way to try and intrigue a majority all at once, than to create a spectacular advert on the biggest day for advertising. A “shock and awe” campaign of sorts haha.

What about a coalition of exchanges? Or is that too much?

You’re right about the need to get government and merchants on board, but that’s only going to happen if there’s a demand for it. One of the best ways to create demand is to popularize it and get people talking about it. There needs to be a mainstream catalyst to get the ball rolling. A major ad campaign can help accomplish that. As for those who might “tune off”, that’s where the creativity of the ad has to grab the attention of its audience, but you make it sound as if that’s impossible. I think a well-placed interesting, creative ad will only help not hurt.

Sounds like a promising pitch to investors.

Great idea!

I agree, it would definitely need some attention and endorsement from people with big wallets. What other investors do you think would be interested?

They’ll demand it after having their minds blown from the commercial.

Thanks for the support. I was thinking an informative and entertaining theme would best suit the commercials content. Creativity would be key though.

Would love to. Just need more support.

That could be the fallback if the super bowl funding is short of its goal.

I agree, niche advertising would be the best bang for the buck, but trying to go viral could be difficult so I figured why not just go all out and try to maximize exposure all at once.
