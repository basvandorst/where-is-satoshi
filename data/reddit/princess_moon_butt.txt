Cash ruins the environment by taking organic fibers, binding them with plastic, and bleaching then re-dying them to be certain colors. What might have taken a couple years to degrade may now take decades, or longer.  
Coins are even worse; the materials are pulled out of the ground in huge quarries and mines, then it takes a huge amount of energy and pollution just to stamp them into pretty shapes so that people will ascribe value to them.
To move all this cash from one place to another, people often resort to powering large, pollution-spewing vehicles using fossil fuel, and spewing noxious gases into the environment.
Heck, entire skyscrapers have been built where forests and farms once stood, just for the sake of having a place to store it and deal with counting it.
But does anyone care?

He originally tried to get everyone to refer to his coin as simply "bitcoin", and the actual bitcoin "bitcoin core". Basically tried to take over the name, despite most of the community not backing his coin.
When that didn't work, he started getting really defensive of people calling it "Bcash" for short, instead of the full "bitcoin cash", because he considers it insulting.
Then he turned around and started referring to bitcoin as "shitcoin" on a regular basis.
He just doesn't strike me as level-headed nor as an entirely honest guy. It's not who I'd want as a figurehead on a project that has such far-reaching effects.

It's up to you, but I probably wouldn't advise it for that amount.  Most hardware wallets average around $50, and that doesn't seem worth it for storing about $350. If you plan to invest more, I'd suggest getting one by the time you accrue ~$1,000 worth.
You can always create a paper wallet; basically a printout with your codes and private keys that you can store.  Obviously these are more vulnerable to damage (fire, floods, etc), but they're just as resilient to attacks as hardware wallets, and by comparison they're pretty much free. I think it would be a good idea for your situation, both for storage away from digital exchanges and as practice so that you get an idea of how to use the private and public keys.

Oh that part I know.  I've just heard people use the dated number as an argument that the middle class has it fine.  "Well if money doesn't improve happiness beyond $50k and the average household income is currently at $50k, we must be doing okay, right?"  Not so much.
I view it more cynically, I guess. It pretty much proved that income security _can_ reduce stress and increase happiness up to a certain point. But that point is pretty far above the average income.  So the headline could easily be interpreted as "Study shows average worker not earning enough to live comfortably."  And that... just seems kind of sad, to me.

Depends on what's written in the invoice.
If you agreed to pay $50k by the end of the month, you have until the end of the month to give them $50k, regardless of what price bitcoin is at.
If you agreed to pay 1 BTC by the end of the month, doesn't matter if it's dropped or mooned, you still owe 1 BTC.
Generally you can negotiate, but either side has the ability to say "Nope, I'll take what we agreed on in the contract, and if you try to weasel around it I'll meet you in court."

If you cash out an investment within a year of putting money into if, any profit is just treated as normal income. So whatever tax bracket you fall into is the rate you'll pay. If you wait until after a year has passed, you'll only pay 'capital gains tax', which is either 10 or 15% (I can't remember which is more common).
In most instances you'll use the first-in, first-out method. So if you bought a full bitcoin every year for the last five years, then sold one today, they'd compare it to the first one you bought to figure out your profits. If you sold another tomorrow, they'd compare it to the second one you bought. And so on.

Money is _made_ by the government.  It isn't _backed_ by anything.  We've just collectively agreed that certain things are worth certain amounts of dollars, and that fluctuates wildly in a lot of cases.
Bitcoin is no different in that second aspect.  The only difference is that nobody can arbitrarily decide to flood the market by freely creating more bitcoin and devaluing the stuff that's currently out there.

Exactly.  If a correction like this is enough to shake people loose and scare them, then they probably weren't investing money like they should have been.
Bitcoin is crashing down to being worth ten times what it was last year? The horror!
Give it another rush of word-of-mouth over the holidays, just like Thanksgiving, along with people getting tax rebates and newly-clean investment folders for the year, and it'll go up again.  Then it'll 'crash' down again.  As it does.  Because we all bought in knowing that volatility was the name of the game.

If you're looking to buy for the long term (more than a year or so) the best time to buy is right now. Holding off is basically gambling.
If you're looking for quick-trading kind of scenarios, then there's no "good" time, as it's all speculative.
Basically if you want to buy for the long run, treat it like stock. Buy now and wait a long while for best results.

There are all sorts of platitudes and 'conventional wisdom' that are easy to apply in hindsight. The biggest thing is to do your research, know where you want to place your trust, and speak with your budget.

I don't entirely get why people are comparing it to stocks that rarely go above $1,000.
Stocks split when they go up.  You had a share at $1,500 each? Oh, that's too much; let's split the stock.  Now you have two shares at $750 each.
You still own the same amount of the company.  Parsing it out into manageable chunks isn't actually saying anything about the viability of the company/market as a whole, it's just easier to work with smaller values for shares.  But when you're dealing with cryptocurrency, it's not a big deal since your computer can just convert it for you.  So what's the big deal?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:29:58
It's both.
HODLers are keeping the scarcity up. Low supply means higher sale price.
But increased usability and security are also appealing to spenders.  It's why debit cards took so long to overtake checks; they're easier to use, and more secure, but until vendors actually start accepting them, they're useless.

Similarly, some say the largest drug transit system in the world is the U.S. Postal Service. In today's day and age, an electronic transfer and a postage stamp can connect a dealer to someone across the country. 
But not many people woukd argue that the Postal Service should be charged with drug trafficking. That's not their intent, they aren't aware of what products contain what, and implying that they _should_ screen their parcels would pave the way for _huge_ privacy violations.

This is where peace of mind comes in.  With a few specific exceptions, there's pretty much no guarantee that _any_ investment will be worth a dime tomorrow.  So if you're using a speculative investment to justify going into debt, you're inherently taking a risk.
Most debts right now are in dollars.  If you have stock, you don't have dollars. If you have gold, you don't have dollars.  If you have bitcoin, you don't have dollars, and there's no guarantee that you'll get any amount of dollars for your bitcoin by this time tomorrow.  It's an unlikely, but still _very_ present risk, and trying to gamble on it with money you don't have comes with even bigger risks.

Honestly, I wouldn't dabble with stop trades.  They're kind of the same idea, instigating a trade if the value of bitcoin reaches a certain price.  But they're kind of counter-intuitive.  They basically say "If bitcoin gets more expensive, buy me some.  If it goes down in value, sell."  They're basically to protect against _really_ volatile price fluctuations.


Sadly, no.  The money you're using to buy, or the bitcoin that you're selling, are taken from your account and put on hold once you place the offer.  You can always cancel them and get an instant refund, but you're not allowed to make an offer unless you have the resources to back it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:56:12
A market buy is basically "I want to buy bitcoin right now, at as close to the market rate as possible." Market sale is the same idea; these are the only instant transactions.
A limit buy is basically "The market price is $8,000; if the price drops down to $7,000 then I'll buy some at that discount."  
A limit sell is "The market price is $8,000; if the price goes up to $9,000 then I'll sell some and make a profit."
A stop buy (a.k.a. a 'stop loss' buy) is basically "The market price is $8,000.  If it suddenly goes through a huge spike, I want to get in on that, so if the market price goes up to $8,300 I'll buy some."  
A stop loss sale is basically "The market price is $8,000.  If the price starts plummeting, I want to abandon ship; so if it drops to $6,000 or less, try to sell."

At midnight, it fell from about $10,700 to $10,100.
Just now, it fell from about $11,300 to $10,500.
As I type, it's at about $10,800 again, and looks like it's level or climbing.
People are panicking over a 5 percent swing when this thing has quadrupled in value since six months ago.
Volatility means lots of swinging.  In both directions.  People need to learn this.  If it takes some panic and the price dipping back down a couple thousand for that to happen, it'll suck, but hopefully we'll get more level-headed buyers in the future as a result.

Stocks are pretty volatile day-to-day too, in a lot of cases.
In reality, BTC's currently sitting at $6,600; which is just about 7% down from where it was a week ago, at $7,100.  It jumped, then crashed, and looks like it's leveling out again, but yeah, currently it's down about 7% from a week ago.

This is the right mindset to have. Don't buy with the intent of selling it in six months, or once it hits X price. Just let it sit unless you hit a _real_ emergency (medical issues, lost your job, etc) and have no other option.
If you buy with the intent to sell at some specific point, you're eventually going to have to try to time the market, and that's a dangerous game to start playing.

If you'd go through some extreme financial hardship without this money, you might want to ask yourself if it's worth the risk.  It's on an explosive ride up right now, but there's technically nothing saying that you'll get any money for your bitcoin if you need to cash out this time next week.  It's unlikely, obviously, but the risk _is_ there; step one is making sure you're okay with that.
Step two is coming at it from the other direction.  If you _don't_ need that money, what else are you going to do with it?  Instead of doubling or anything like that, set a goal.  "When my bitcoin money is twice enough to buy a new gaming PC, I'll cash out enough to buy one." Stuff like that.
But whether it's bitcoin, stock, a savings account, whatever, why cash out money if you think the value is going to keep going up?
Just my two cents.  You could ask a hundred people on this sub and somehow end up with a hundred and ten answers as to what's considered a good idea.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:02:40
I think this is the idea:
Bob promises to buy a bitcoin at $10,000 in one year.
Sue can now get a loan for $10,000 and she uses it right away to buy 1.25 bitcoin.
If the price spikes to $16,000 by next December, Sue is still sitting on 1.25 bitcoin; so she's now at $20,000.  She pays out the $6,000 profit to Bob, pays back the $10,000 for her loan (plus a little bit for interest), and she's now sitting on $4,000 profit.
Bob takes the risk of losing money if Bitcoin's value goes down.  Sue takes the risk of Bob defaulting on his promise to buy.  But as long as bitcoin goes up by more than the interest payment on that loan, they both make money.

I bought in somewhere around 2012, just to test the waters.  For 65 cents.  That 65 cents is now worth something like $15.
I was stupid back then. Burning a couple hundred bucks a week on video games I no longer play, eating out instead of cooking at home, going out to bars multiple times a week. Just really wasteful stuff.   Had I been responsible, and actually committed any reasonable amount to it- even a few weeks' worth of fun money, let alone any of my savings- I'd probably have enough right now to buy a new car (assuming I didn't sell).

If any type of computer is able to brute force its way into guessing a 12-word phrase with any amount of regularity, that computer is also going to be strong enough to brute force its way into pretty much any other system in the world, and we'll have bigger problems than bitcoin.

Very ELI5 answer: There are two ways to get bitcoin.  You can mine it, or you can buy it.
Mining is... risky, and not always worth it.  You have to buy some expensive hardware, have access to cheap electricity, and keep it all running.  But keeping it simple, let's say Mike the Miner has put in $6,000 worth of electricity and now has one bitcoin.
If you're not a miner, you have to buy bitcoin.  There are all sorts of exchanges out there, but at the start, _someone_ has to buy that one bitcoin from the miner in order for things to work.  But, say three or four people want to buy it? Obviously Mike isn't going to let his bitcoin go for _less_ than $6k, that'd be losing money.  But if Terry the Trader offers to pay $7k instead, he's getting that bitcoin.
And now, bitcoin's "price" is $7k.  And suddenly people realize that they can make a thousand dollars by mining a bitcoin, so a bunch of people rush on.  But that means the difficulty goes up- sometimes _too_ much.  So maybe now, it costs $8k in electricity for Mike to mine a bitcoin.
Well now, anyone looking to buy wants to get the cheapest bitcoin.  Mike doesn't want to let his new bitcoin go for less than $8k, since that's what it cost him.  But Terry bought his for $7k; maybe he's willing to sell it for $7.5k, so he can make a quick profit off it.
So now the "price" is $7.5k; but that's not high enough to justify the $8k price tag. So a bunch of miners turn off their machines, which in turn, means the difficulty goes down.  So the few people still mining might only have to pay $7k per coin.
Rinse and repeat. Doesn't _have_ to trend upward every time, that just tends to happen when more people come in and compete for the same number of coins. It's that competition, when multiple people try to outbid each other for the same bitcoin, that drives up the price.
