It's like stealing the Red Crosses bank account right after a hurricane....   I thought criminals had some sort of honor... stealing from the faucet .. that's a new low.

Edited Saturday 2:30 EST
I have received 3 offers so far,  one for source code only and 2 others for complete sales.
The source code sales are so people can build their own bitcoin bank from scratch without having to build it from scratch.   Of course the complete sale would be to continue ongoing operations as it includes the clients, with all the responsibility of taking care of their existing accounts.
I'll be making a decision in the next day or two.
Edited: Saturday 4:10 EST  4 offers 2 for source code only (total 6)

Gypsy...  honestly there has been enough stealing of BTC over the past year..  I am trying my best to vet the buyers...   they have to prove (at least within reasonable doubt) that they are established in the community and have much to lose by doing something shady like that.

Honestly,  it leads more towards this regarding Bitcoin,  it is it's first industrial purpose.

I am happy to announce that James Gray is now the owner of Flexcoin.
I will NOT be sending him the keys to the site tonight however.
I believe that James will take care of Flexcoin with the same vigor that I have.   Though technically tonight he is the owner,  he will not have access to the site for a few days.. this was written into the contract for your protection, and it was his idea....  I believe that is a good confidence building measure.
We will be assisting him over the next few weeks in the transfer... so we will be helping him getting acquainted with the system.
For the record,  I am keeping my personal coins at Flexcoin...  I am doing this to both help him and let everyone know that I have faith in the Bitcoin Bank.

Search Engine Optimization.

The problem I have isn't with the question,  it's with the use of the term "hacker"  ..  the term "hacker"  was derived by someone that builds stuff for the sake of building them,  learning how things work, advancing technology and overall good for society.
What you are saying is "Thief's Dilemma"  because "Hacker's Dilemma" would be more like "How do I make a more secure wallet"

"However it’s generally made from minor fees on flexcoin to bitcoin transfers."
that doesn't make sense?
I'm hoping English is your second language?

It already exists.
 
it was *somewhat* modeled after paypal..

It's easy to know what the value input into the bitcoin economy.   You already know the total number of BTC in circulation (about 7.3 million) you already know the current price of each BTC (about 6 dollars) and you already know what the price of each BTC was last month (about 12 dollars).
I'll keep the price at today's value (6 dollars)
We printed "1.5 million worth of BTC" in the past month
We've lost 1/2 the value of each BTC between this and last month.
---&gt;  216,000 printed this month (1.5 million USD worth)
---&gt;  43.2 million market cap (today)
---&gt; 84.5 million market cap (last month)
We literally got halved in value,  AND printed a quarter million more bitcoins (1.5 million) ...  that's a NEGATIVE investment of what....  You do the math...   
@_date: 2011-10-18 16:47:22
keep printing bitcoins at just under 5 per minute....  seriously it's having no effect.  :(
@_date: 2011-09-27 18:47:09
You realize that flexcoin makes money from deposits...   so it's it's best interest to keep customers happy and grow it right? 
@_date: 2011-09-19 14:17:14
Killerstorm...  speculation doesn't change the fact that the coins enter the economy eventually (unless you freaking destroy them),  hence bringing it back to 1.5 million USD must enter the bitcoin economy each month at current value.
If the current value is 1 dollar per coin, then you are correct,  it goes to 216k per month that must enter the bitcoin economy.
Funny,  you say I am talking like an idiot,  but use the SAME unarguable formula to prove your point that it goes to 216k ...  
Thanks for the support... I love it... in your argument you validated it.
@_date: 2011-11-11 20:23:16
it wasn't down for 12 hours guys.. it was down for about 2 ... and it wasn't even the client page.   that is  .. it was up 100% ... the marketing page  was down for a few hours...  however no coins are there.. they are all at  and that's a differing server.    
All is fixed however,  thank you for your understanding.
@_date: 2011-09-07 19:51:20
We are in the middle of an imploding bubble.  However some mechanism for price stability would lead to a less disastrous level of ups and downs. 
I almost want to tie the amount printed per block by the current average daily price..
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:22:25
fiveawr .. there's a huge difference between the marketing blog for the bank.. and the actual bank.
@_date: 2011-09-16 15:35:28
well if they use flexcoin there is no transaction wait time so the place is guaranteed that they were paid.
@_date: 2011-09-28 16:17:59
Why not?   What do you think the other 499,999 people with bitcoins would be doing?   It's not like they are hiding.   In fact it's one of the only bitcoin companies that doesn't hide.
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:00:43
That's possible huanix ... but remember this thing is in Alpha right now..  invite only was due to any potential security and bugs being worked out (that's what Alpha stands for right :) )  
I normally don't submit to sites like Reddit or (now crappy) Digg because generally anything I post never goes anywhere..
Regardless after security testing is complete,  then we'll open it up to everyone rather than invite only. 
We're still trying to figure out the best way to generate the intrest for the shareholders.. .and despite what was mentioned above,  gambling with other people's money is not the only way to generate a return for an account holder.
1 - We are building mining rigs to mine for account holders.. it's our opinion that interest paid for a deflationary environment is VERY helpful for the account holders.
2 - charge a a very small transaction fee,  then use part of those very small fees on top of the mining to distribute back to the account holders...  the idea is that a bunch of bitcoins going back and forth would generate enough income to dispense to the account holders..  THIS IS NOT part of the plan now... but I am just throwing out ideas on how people could generate interest with a bitcoin bank like flexcoin
Regarding dpcucoreinfo question below.
Mining is the least costly way (in terms of transaction fees) to pay people that hold accounts with flexcoin.     It's a cost to the company,  not something that earns us money but allows for increased market share.    If that happens,  we're confident that companies that accept bitcoins would pay to sponsor the site.
To answer cloudedice's question:
You're correct...  in SOME cases,  sending a small amount with paying a transaction fee to lead up to 36 hours or longer for the transaction to go though...  if we take the transaction fee,  transactions go faster.  Again...  that's not the plan.. we're still forumlating a way to make sure the bank is sustainable...   Though Yooter can float it... ideally it would make it's own revenue.
@_date: 2011-09-28 00:13:32
the math was wrong..  it was addressed and fixed.  This represents a net loss of $173,949,065.65 from peak to this exact moment (updated in real time) of the entire bitcoin economy. 
So you were right,  and found a bug..  it's fixed now the figure wasn't 210 million but rather 173 million.
actually I own tribble and I own flexcoin ...  for full disclosure.  
@_date: 2011-09-07 18:35:34
I know it's controversial,  but the facts are the facts  and the fact is that we are printing too many bitcoins to support the current rate of growth.
@_date: 2011-06-29 11:40:26
I own Yooter interactive...  Flexcoin is my idea.    If you see our client list on Yooter,  you'll notice we build companies... not rip people off. 
Interest (as it stands now) will be from mining.... as we are in the process of building more rigs to do it,   dividends from the mining will be paid to the account holders.    This model is fluid however and we're exploring potential fees or donations to increase the interest rate, because as you know having a server room filled with GPU miners still doesn't generate as much as we would like to the account holders.
I can ensure you guys that it's 100% legitimate..  I am trying to build a real company.
@_date: 2011-10-27 16:39:36
it already exists,  flexcoin.com you can pay people by e-mail address, id, normal bitcoin address,  qr support.. etc...    
@_date: 2011-07-07 02:18:01
Yooter InterActive is building Flexcoin,  and I own Yooter.
Mining and ads are basically the model.  In order to get a decent amount of visitors,  we had to offer interest on their bitcoins.   So we call it "interest" but in reality it's closer to dividends. 
You're not going to get rich off the interest that we're paying, but it's better than zero.
One day we MIGHT charge priority fees,  but that's in the future.. not now... and most likely if anything is ever charged.. it will be tiny.
@_date: 2011-09-07 19:05:05
All the figures are in the document.  Did you read it all and the study as well as the calculator linked from it?  It's 100% referenced. 
$1.5 million is printed every month (based on $6 dollars per BTC).  However not $1.5 million is added to the BTC economy. Hence the extreme inflation rate.
The document is sourced and fact checked.  It's hard to argue the facts surrounding it otherwise the BTC price to Dollar would be multiples of where it is now.

Updated the FAQ to settle the matter.
@_date: 2011-10-07 15:28:06
people are funny....   omg someone is paying interest on bank account balances..  must be a pyramid scheme!  
Read the TOS on flexcoin and then you can see how it's done.
@_date: 2011-09-27 11:16:36
Are you sure you read it?
For more information read flexcoin.com, the bitcoin bank‘s TOS located under the FAQ menu. For information on how Flexcoin Generates discount payments, please read the Fee Schedule also located under the FAQ menu.
There it notes:
Discount Payout:
70% of the fees collected are disbursed to the account holders as discount payments on any fees already paid or any potential future fees, based on the following formula…
(your account balance / total balance of all flexcoin accounts) * ((all fees collected – miner fees) * 0.7)
It is important to note, as you can see in the formula listed above, MINER FEES WILL BE PAID ON ALL EXTERNAL TRANSFERS. Flexcoin will add appropriate bitcoin transaction fees whenever coins are transferred to an external bitcoin address.  Flexcoin-to-Flexcoin transfers are 100% FREE, and instantaneous.
@_date: 2011-10-06 17:17:50
It's based on daily average,  so technically people that had money in there earlier in the month will get a higher percentage.
@_date: 2011-09-27 21:05:46
Yes as the article pointed out:
If Bitcoins were stable at their peak of $35 on June 9, 2011 , the bitcoin economy would be worth $257,505,500.00 rather than $36,126,021.96 
@_date: 2011-09-27 01:33:46
You didn't read the article.  It outlines the payments and how they are earned
@_date: 2011-09-07 19:07:28
It's obvious for most people, but there is a LARGE minority of people that believe since the supply is limited "it has to go up" not factoring in the growth rate of printing that is currently astronomical.
@_date: 2011-09-16 16:17:01
I think I wasn't clear when I published it.   The bitcoin economy needs to grow at ~$1.5 million a month to keep stable.  This doesn't mean "selling all of them"  it just means that the economy has to grow that size via an input.  That could mean that additional physical locations start accepting bitcoins (and transactions take place),  or more ecommerce sites (and transactions take place), or more buyers.. the end result is that an equal sum to 1.5 million USD MUST enter the economy.   period.  It's not something that can be argued..  it's just a fact.
