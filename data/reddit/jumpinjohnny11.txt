lol, Blockchain is broken on a daily basis. Seriously, switch to the following:
Mobile: Mycellium
Desktop: Core, Multibit, other

It seems as though that was primarily a publicity stunt... which may have worked. They're listed at the top of Bitcoin.com

I like Quadriga's new express withdrawals. Withdrew $1000 this morning and got it in my bank an hour later.

Thats how Bitcoin works... it typically takes ages to download the full blockchain.

I can't imagine this will last too long.

I think you can use circle. Most places will be reluctant to accept any sort of Visa or Mastercard as its easy to reverse such forms of payment.

I would argue that your best bet would be working for a Bitcoin news company.

I guess in theory they can change their terms of service whenever they want. Not really surprising, Cavirtex has been screwing their users since day one.

Personally I don't really see how this has any relation to Bitcoin whatsoever. Aren't we way past the point of Bitcoin only being used by Cryptoanarchists?

Is this some weird attempt to beg for a coin?

I don't understand how they're a scam. I have used them before to sell Bitcoin and received the Paypal payment promptly. Just because they don't share your views on the blockchain debate doesn't mean that they are a scam.

Michael, is there any way I can retrieve the coins that Coinbase stole from me? My account was frozen for no reason and when I try to talk to customer support they automatically end the convo. I would really like to access my funds and am incredibly concerned with the fact that Coinbase thinks that they can steal with me and then ignore me.
