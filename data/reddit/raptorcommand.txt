because for certain applications gold is the best option. Maybe I could not quote any price but it would be limited by the following:
1) as high as it would cost to mine new gold 
2) as high as the profit allowed from whatever application it was being used in. 
3) as high as it could be before using an alternative metal became preferable.
i don't know how accurate those numbers are but it seams to be popular to throw around "only 1% of gold is in use" without any actual figures.
And bitcoin would absolutely be worth 0 in my example.
your ancient egypt example is some logical fallacy but I'm not sure which one. Maybe this 
Digital Age? I'm rather more concerned with food production, the environment, climate change, human rights. 
Facebook? lol.

if I own all the gold I can quote any price.
If i own all the bitcoin I would have to give it away for free.
gold: demand implies market
bitcoin: market implies demand
definitely the same /s

the idea of "storing value" is bad for society. It is better that people are encouraged to use their value to innovate, increase efficiency and solve problems which lead to a better quality of life for everyone. Hoarding "value" on a hard drive isn't valuable to anyone.
Value to society is the only important metric of value. Bitcoin is currently very wasteful for transfers due to the complexity in signing transactions. It isn't "cheaper" if the side effects are wasting energy. 
If bitcoin does become mainstream (like everyone has some bitcoin) FRB is inevitable, ran offchain it is fine, LN is offchain, recreating banks basically. The inflationary pressure on USD will erode savings, cause more poverty. This type of inflation would be bad inflation.
All I hear is the same old greedy ideas. "Its a store of value" - This is a bad thing!!!
To reiterate my original point - the price of gold and bitcoin are not correlated as much as people think.
Bitcoin: Transaction fees, hype, forks, tech changes, market participants (more is better), scarcity
Gold: Physical demand, market participants (less is better, probably there is an inverted bell curve here), scarcity

the buy walls keep moving lower. There was a buy wall at 12k up to 3000 coins, it is gone now. A trick from some big players to make you think it would not collapse.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:27
i bet some smart rich guys created a network of trading bots that artificially raised the price at particular moments to encourage a rapid rise. Wouldnt suprise me at all.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:49:46
"I want them to take over". that is pure greed. you want to be in at the beginning so you will be rich and others will be poor. How is this going to help society? How is lending going to work for the average person? Will all mortgages be provided by the super rich? How can a government adopt an existing cryptocurrency without spiking the price? Is FRB inevitable? What about the criminals that will become very rich. This is not an exaustive list.
Technology good. Bitcoin bad.
You might see a small government create a new crypto, hold the price steady and exchange local currency for crypto but only with residents. Bitcoin isnt in a position to do this.
Though there is chance you can make some quick $$$ if you hodl

futures are down. (and its a bubble)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:54
think about this: if you had 5 million in bitcoin now - what do you have? 
A long term potention upside of 3x if you are lucky that some other crypto currency doesnt take over and a risk of losing it all. This is getting dumped but they are doing slowly to maintain price.
Alt currencies make the 21m limit meaningless.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:25:09
this is what happens when something has 0 value and there are alternatives. If you need to put gold into a computer you cant substitute silver. Thus there will always be people willing to hoard gold to control the supply.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:09
those crashes happened for different reasons, right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:25
well done all hodlers. now you will get more $$$ for your bitcoin, you know, the stuff you actually need to buy stuff &amp; pay taxes.

i think maybe people are selling so they can buy their xmas gifts. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:03:10
That is why I am asking. Though it is not the discussion of the day is it? Where is this discussion happening? Please elaborate and please explain how Bitcoin can be the "one" when its price will spike massively with wider adoption leaving vast amounts of wealth in the hands of a few. I am for blockchain generally but I don't see how bitcoin can be mainstream without massive gains for the rich.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:44
it has all the tellings of a prototype. A good poc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:11
it just bounced
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:08:51
bs. When it went from 8-&gt;12 the news reported it like it was some major incident but when it goes from 19-&gt;16, this is a "dip" and no one cares. There is no intrinsic value (despite your beleif that there is). Down is the same as up. 
If this was a real currency pair you would buy either side with a balanced view. You wouldn't stick to 1 as it slid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:47
I wonder how much big money is left to be sold?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:49:47
i'm pretty successful thanks though i wont resort to pinching money off people through garbage like bc.
No one has an answer to these questions. Until a see some answers to this question Ill consider anyone speculating on bitcoin a greedy hypocrit.
Farmers, doctors and teachers are making the world go around, not day traders, HFT or bitcoin enthusiasts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:13:43
please explain why they are not doing so right now?
I have a theory, a lot of nerds got in low and are amazed at how much money they have made, they are selling in the drop to get their $$$ and will never be back.
Plus the big boys who are doing a gradual sell off before it collapses completely.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:53
just as long as you sell before the crash
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:21
pretty good outlet. Its hard to find brexiteers or trump supporters to rag on. I dont usually do this but the whole concept rubs me the wrong way. I wish people would put there efforts into real value. I promise i will get bored soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:47:15
Amen to that!
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:40:32
you are absolutely spot on.
Also, think about lending without FRB. Lending would be extremely sought after and very profitable. With smart contracts defaults would be rare and those that cant pay could never borrow again.
Lending would be a rich mans's game. Without a collective agreement to enable all account holders a sane level of liquidity the poor would have no way to lend meaningful amounts of money.
All mortgages would be controlled by the super rich.
Add to the fact that the early adopters would control 99% of the value from the start.
Thankfully governments will not let you pay your taxes in bitcoin so I think we are safe, bitcoin will remain a wet dream for the rich for quite some time.
For a comparison look a the housing market - it is rather limited - buy it up and rent it out, with every generation it becomes harder to buy land. 
Example: If i have 1/2 of all bitcoins in the world. 
If society becomes very productive and creates lots of new ideas &amp; automation but I do nothing my life standard are still improving and i still own 1/2 of all wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:24
was that america waking up?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:52
if you had sold at 19k you would have made 4k on this "dip" (assuming it goes back up which isnt a guarantee).
Up is down. 99% of people in this market couldnt care less about what bitcoin means for the future, they just want to outsmart the general public at speculation.
Now the big boys are selling and you fools are buying it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:20
it probably isn't. Probably people are trying to delay the rise so they can get out of Bitcoin first and buy some. Both currencies are as useless as each other.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:00
so it all about the early few getting rich?
How does bitcoin encourage innovation / increases in efficiency better than FRB?
The value in currency is in its ability to motivate its population to do work (by this metric bitcoin is still on 0) - the fruits of that work are the value/wealth.
Nobody is saying anything about the practicalities of bitcoin, how it can actually improve society or add value to the daily lives of everyone. You have to include the tendency of human greed in your assumptions. It doesnt work unless you have FRB which is 1) inevitable and 2) gives the impression that there is more currency than actually exists
Governments will pick a system that adds value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:26:51
the technologies are the same, bitcoin cash has a slightly different configuration. This configuration makes it slightly easier to trade bitcoin cash in a hurry.

big players cancel their sells. Its a con. A false safety net to make the small fish bite. There was 3000 coins at 12k, just vanished earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:39:24
if you look at the order book the sells are much larger than the buys. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:10
probably not wall street but somebody has a lot of weight in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:20
i said exactly this 2 days ago and i someone said i didn't understand bitcoin. 
There are sellers along the entire spectrum. Those that bought at 15k sold at 17k. Those that bought at 5k will sell at 10k. And hodlers are crumbling 1 at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:04
that would be like a high street shop never been able to change their prices. It would make thing easier tho.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:48
i find the complaints here about the exchanges are very similar to people complaining about video game releases and online multiplayer. 
Another piece of anecdotal evidence that cryptocurrencies are a frenzied pile of bs. 
This is competitive online gambling at its finest.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:43
aye, a valuable concept that will separate the rich/poor by an even greater margin. Superb.
Dollars have intrinsic value, you can buy anything with them and pay your taxes with them. 
The reality of human behaviour dictates that people will use any method to accumulate wealth at the expense of the masses. They do this with fiat and they will do this with bitcoin. However, with bitcoin there is no one to stop you. You are doing this right now. You hope that bitcoin takes off in a big way so you can be one of the rich few and never contribute to society again.
Schools are a valuable concept.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:02:08
the big sells are moving lower and lower. Big players gradually selling the lot. 200-300 coins every hour pops up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:54:40
you guys dont have a clue.
This isnt like a stock that IPO's at $100. It started at 0, there were buyers all the way from 0-&gt;15000. There are sellers all the way from 15000-&gt;0. From 0-20000 it is more or less evenly distributed buy/sells. If it can go up 16k it can go down 16k. There is no moon in this game, just hype. You can't spend bitcoin and with this volatility its going to be a long time before it makes sense for average joe to leave his money sitting around in bitcoin.
to short bitcoin you buy dollars.
