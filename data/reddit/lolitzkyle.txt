Because people like to try and explain a decrease in bitcoins price with anything besides the fact that people might just be losing faith in it. Some examples you may have seen are attacks, scams, pump and dump, market manipulation and the craziest most recent one that people were cashing out to buy presents.

As far as I know I it is just CGT that you have to pay when you sell your bitcoin I don't think income tax applies

For weeks now anytime the price dips within an hour people say "relax it's still so high over the day" then it starts to dip for a day and people say "relax it's still up for the week" and now it's currently lower than it was last week and I'm starting to see people say "relax were still up for the month"
Yeah that's true and all but bitcoin has been in a downward trend for 4 days now there's only so much you can reassure yoirself by talking about long term return.

Why would people be cashing out due to taxes? By selling they're making themselves liable to taxing so it would be in their interest not to sell
