He's commented on BitCoin as a market phenomenon because there is a media frenzy and insane rush to buy it that's driven prices up fast. 
If you believe his comments are powerful as to affect BTCs actual value then you really shouldn't be investing in BitCoin to begin with.

You could also say it's like a decentralized startup that is still in it's product development and capital raising phase. 
The hysteria is bringing in so much money riding on the success of bitcoin that there is now financial interest in ensuring that it works and finishing the product. 
Sort of like a startup that's sucking in cash for an idea and a rough beta version only to deliver a product later after investors have bought in at big bucks. 
Now the bitcoin community  is working on updating the technology so it doesn't suck. Ironically a decentralized system still has its own stakeholders and interest groups.

For trading, sure. Volatility is awful for currency.

This save the world stuff raises big red flags. These are the people who are invested in bitcoin that are pushing their own product. The claims and hype have been so outlandish it makes anyone question how legitimate they are. 
People on this sub are either incredibly naive, or so invested into the dream of being rich from bitcoin that they just upvote anything to keep up the idea alive so more potential buyers come into the market. And of course downvote any very warranted skepticism to these claims.
The peace and economic revolution will most certainly not happen because there's now a fancy online token you can transact in. Especially when the token is less secure, slower, and higher price, and insanely volatile compared to other currencies.

There's people who'll buy it for 15k, therefore it's presently worth 15k.

He doesn't need to. Buffet has always been big on investing in something you understand yourself. 
Which is something a lot of bitcoin investors do not understand much about bitcoin, they've rode in on the speculation train generated by the media attention.

No, they're back pedaling because they're going to need to publically justify making their own company money investments into applications of block chain.

There's s possibility it goes back to 2k. It grew way too fast, for all the wrong reasons (hysteria). 
There's a possibility the price goes up to 20k too, if the frenzy re-starts again.

It's not bad. It's manageable, and somewhat predictable. 
People think inflation is bad, appreciation good. It doesn't work like that. Too much of either is bad.
In currency, VOLATILITY is bad. Stabilized value is good. Because currency is the backbone of transactions the more stable the value the easier (and less risk) there is for both the buyer and the seller.
In Venezuela levels of inflation, people who have money stored in the currency see it fade and prices increase, and spending power suffers. 
In bitcoins current levels of deflation, people who don't have money but need to borrow are the ones who get screwed. If you borrowed in bitcoin two years ago you'd be in poverty trying to pay that back today. 
Neither are good for an economy.

They're not going to fuck you. In reality this could help you long term. The volatility is great for speculators, but it only adds to the list of intrinsic value challenges for bitcoin. You could lose significant short term value but if your a hodler, why would you care?
With levels of extreme volatility and --- it doesn't make it an attractive currency for regular people and businesses to actually want to use on wide scale.  Its incredibly high risk. Value today could be gone tomorrow.
With the bitcoin futures, the prices can correct and stabilize--- and then if it stabilizes, its got the potential for intrinsic and long term value to develop.

This seems ironic that the winklevoss bros are creating a coin based on a FIAT value?
Or am I missing something 
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:07:25
Between the BTC nuts that claim it’ll replace banks and fiat and worth billions and the skeptics who think it’ll be worth pennies and die out, the most likely outcome is its price eventually stabilized and it does make it as a niche payment platform and is not worth billions, but not completely devoid of value either.

The dumb money are the people who don’t understand the slightest about investing and economics (or the tech behind BTC) but bought bitcoin because somebody told them it would be rich. Once those people are burned and laughed at, they’re not coming back to prop up the market price.
Those dumb money buyers plus large pump and dump buyers are what drove the price up to that level.
There’s no rational reason for bitcoin to be worth 20k right now. With a bear market looming in equity btc will in all likelihood follow any negative sentiment on Wall Street.

The dip will keep coming is my take.
A lot has changed in the year with BTC, the word is out, the dumb money has bought in and lost, the equity markets are becoming more bearish—and Wall Street / futures are in bitcoin now and the chances of seeing that surge to quick 20k again are beyond slim anytime soon.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:47:18
This is pretty normal if you compare to the behavior of stocks. There’s often a lift after a rough drop off. It seems good but the net value is still way down. 
Doesn’t really mean much though. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:44:47
The market more than overreacted last year too when people bought into BTC. The price is still correcting. 
Bitcoin can be growing but that doesn’t mean it justifies insane valuations forever. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:08:24
The two have nothing in common. People dropping buzzwords like “digital gold” does not make gold anywhere near a comparable market cap. 
20k for BTC is an insanely inflated price. You could mine it yourself for far cheaper.

We’re in the anxiety phase, and don’t expect a rebound to 10k levels
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:22:08
what's this forecast based on? It went up last year so it keeps going up forever? 
Why would the market pay 50k to own 1 BTC when for that value they could spend 10k on high end equipment and mine that coin themselves? Where are the economics that could justify 50k (not mentioning the frenzy/hysteria last year that pumped up prices)
It's not worth 50k, and it won't be worth that this year either. Because somebody can shell out money on mining rigs and then sell it at a respectable profit for say 15k (example).  
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:02:47
Lots of theories on what affects the price, many are correct.
But also BTC is something you can mine from your own home. That controls the costs because it's easy to enter the market as a miner.
And the prices will be affected by this. 
Why would a market pay 50k value on bitcoin when for 50k You can beat the market and buy multiple mining rigs and mining it yourself for less?
You'd either need to have an immediate short term need to use the coin which doesn't seem to exist in any meaningful level yet, or be a fool as for the same value you can generate the coin plus more yourself at a better price.

If you hold your money in USD in a US bank you get that money guaranteed and insured by the federal government. 
I’d much rather take manageable inflation and FDIC insurance than a Bitcoin that can easily be lost forever and you have no guarantees.

Growth rates always look amazing when you start at small values.  Nothing goes up at these rates forever simply because as values grow % value of growth diminishes.
We are talking about 40k increase on value. In 12 months. Etherums value went up less than 1k.
Those growth rates were fueled. By media and a mass market of buyers that came in. That can only last so long as there's a finite number of people that will buy this stuff, which triggers price corrections.
