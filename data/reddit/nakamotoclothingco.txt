This is actually a petty legit idea, we might add a variation for this. Thanks!

Nice. The stock market is never manipulated, there is never any insider trading and the baddies always get caught and justice prevails for all. /s

Thanks for the input, we were divided on using his design honestly, hence this post. We're hoping to create conversions about Bitcoin (and sell merch'), using such a recognizable symbol might spark those conversations.

We are working towards a design that incorporates a larger logo with "Bitcoin" on the back and the  (Think hockey jersey). Thank you again for the feedback!

Nice! I'm putting you down at $5133.

For sure. It's bit more fun than most of the Bitcoin gear out there.

Thanks for the feedback! Much appreciated. Do you prefer the classic 'B' or the newer logo that has the B within the circle? We're working with designs for both, would welcome your feedback.
