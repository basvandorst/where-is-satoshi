Yes, you can exchange this for fiat/usd (subject to capital gains tax). If you want to avoid tax I would recommend purchasing goods like gold, cars or even a holiday. 
Think of it kind of like today's modern piggy bank. Most people are now realizing they can store their wealth there, transfer it anywhere across the world or p2p without bank interference. Mark Cuban, Sir Richard Branson and many more billionaires (with wallstreet coming up) are getting invested.
The value of this will most likely increase after a short dip, so if you want to make more money off of it, just cash out a small portion of it. The price of Bitcoin may double before Q2 2018 so it's up to you how much profits you want to take.
As mentioned, look into obtaining the coins safely and storing them securely like in a hardware wallet or paper wallet.

You sound like an old Hag. 
So the fact that Mike Novogratz, Mark Cuban, Sir Richard Branson who have billions of dollars have a portion of their portfolio in cryptocurrency are falling for a malware scam? 
Wallstreet are about to jump into this with CME futures opening on December 8th. 
I've already made 6x my initial investment and spent it on holidays and a new car. Enjoy staying poor idiot.

Yes well done! Make sure you read how to cash it out properly or keep it safe in your wallets. You can be hacked if you don't take proper precautions.

Mcdonalds you say?

Yes it can be traded back to fiat at anytime. Of course subject to capital gains tax.

You don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin. You can buy mBTC like cents in a dollar.

Not a bad choice. ETH made better gains than BTC in the past 12 months, x45 versus x12.

Just like Amazon and Apple in the 90's right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:23:51
Yes 
You can also convert your btc back into fiat.

Yes, possible. Healthy growth generally requires a few dips to establish support. How far down is uncertain it could be 20-50% drop.

This is actually quite bad for Australians. 


The entire point of crypto is for anonymous and decentralized use of currency. I had a feeling goverment regulations will push people towards other alternatives. All the more reason why a crypto like Zencash will become more popular (for criminals or anyone wanting to remain anonymous).

I agree that Bitcoin is king, it's not going to go away anytime soon. 
Doesn't seem like you're aware that Zencash is the only crypto with secure nodes and shielded transactions. It is the only viable alternative for people wanting to avoid government regulations. It has complete privacy and secure nodes will enable fully encrypted communications and network obfuscation so end-user activity is protected.
The government can't ban something they can't see.
