Also Australia (7 AM - 9 AM) and South Korea (~8 AM) are waking up. I hope they go on a bull run.

Happy holidays everyone. Can anyone tell me what the wait time is for transferring BTC from personal wallet to GDAX or Bitstamp "wallet"? and also the wait time for transferring BTC from these exchanges back to a personal wallet? Finally could anyone answer the same questions for LTC?
Re-wording same question: Does it take longer to have crypto leave and enter the "wallets" within the exchanges compared to a transaction between personal wallet and personal wallet? In other words, is there an added amount of "processing time" when crypto moves in/out exchanges, and if so a rough average?
