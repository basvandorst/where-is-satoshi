Sweet child. The Mt. gox trading bot didn't drive Bitcoin from $1200 - $200. It drove price UP. Please try to keep up.

I disagree. They are very much aware of the core issues (pun) that their audience want to hear their opinion on. If they have a clear vision and path, it would be almost zero effort to just put out a statement on a few points and clear up months of confusion and muddled opinions. 
The practice of instead having individual developers bicker and post personal opinions on Reddit and Twitter seems unnecessarily convoluted and counter intuitive. 
I'd like to add that I obviously can't "demand" anything. I'm just tired of there being so much unnecessary debate and mud slinging, almost exclusively based on people not knowing what core stand for, what their plan is, their vision etc.

The amount of people in this thread that don't understand how bitcoin or mining works is absolutely astounding.
@_date: 2016-11-11 18:56:01
What an informative and well substantiated post. Where can I read more of your quality writing?
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:17:08
Yes. But it's almost irrelevant since if any government or large corporate entity really wanted to destroy Bitcoin there is literally nothing the community can do. 
Even at $500 million+ in hardware backing in a single large datacenter of say 10 nm ASIC could fork Bitcoin, and you can bet your ass a government agency if they really wanted to could destroy it just as easily decentralized or not. 
This obsession with geographical decentralization is just childish. Bitcoin lives as an innovation, not because it's somehow a network that is impossible to take down but because it is a grand experiment with a possibly bright future. 
If the U.S. Government wanted to take down the internet in 1995 they could have and easily. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:53:33
If you want to be conspiratorial enough that a government somehow unbeknownst to anyone would control hash power just to implement clandestine measures to weaken Bitcoin there is literally nothing that can save it. 
It's so much easier for a state to simply impose rules and regulations that make usage precarious enough that it dies on its own.

And I'm fine with that standpoint if he would be honest and just say that's the reason. Instead he keeps claiming that any block size increase is "the death of Bitcoin" and that 1 MB is already too big "just because. Decentralization and stuff".

Phew, as long as we haven't seen any examples of defensive patents being a bad idea.
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:24:16
I disagree. The reason we now have a split in the community is due to initial and persistent refusal of core, and parts of the community to even entertain the idea of a hard fork for on chain scaling. 
No "alternative" to core was ever outlined with a roadmap of causing a contested hard fork. (No serious alternative). 
I am happy that you see soft fork consensus the same way though. At least it's consistent. 
I still don't understand your opinion on block size in the face of consistently lower storage costs and increase in bandwidth availability but I guess that's something where we can agree to disagree. 
Mostly I am worried that people don't seem to realize that lightning (in my opinion) poses a real risk of siphoning enough fees from the block chain on chain transactions that mining becomes unprofitable over an extended period of time. 
Especially with the current (and SegWit) block size limit. It seems like at least a discussion worth having. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:04:47

@_date: 2016-11-11 20:47:04
If the discussions result in an algorithm changes to force out miners that are single handedly carrying the ecosystem on the back of massive investments in hardware it doesn't matter. With them, Bitcoin as we know it will die. It's really that simple. Whatever fork splits to a new algorithm will be an altcoin and essentially worthless.

The power statement is B.S. most Chinese miners have lower cost than US or European but the difference is far from as big as you think. Most miners I know feel that they compete pretty even with the Chinese mining in Washington or Iceland.

@_date: 2016-11-11 17:59:02
But there is absolutely zero evidence that that's the alternative. Look at the trend in Ethereum etc. Large mining operations are here to stay. Just because there are a few miners at home as well at this point doesn't mean GPU mining won't be as centralized as ASIC in the next few years. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:53:15
All good points. I just don't understand why, since it would take very little effort core doesn't simply write up their roadmap even if it's just a single page "this is what we would like to see for the next 3 months" or so and publish it. 
Why is it so hard to communicate outside of IRC logs, random tweets and Reddit comments? 
It's like they are hell bent on choosing the worst venue of information in the worst possible way. 
I also find it pretty naive and dismissive to claim that all other alternative are scams. You could very easily say the same about core, that don't follow satoshi vision in any respect better than unlimited.
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:50:23
So we shouldn't listen to core because the most active developers are also founders or employees of Blockstream? Gotcha. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:28:56
I do not disagree that it would be troublesome if a government somehow seized 50%+ of bitcoin hash power. I do not however think that it's a credible threat. 
If a foreign or domestic government wanted to 'shut down' bitcoin to the extent that they were willing to actually physically seize hash power, then there are far smarter way of killing bitcoin.
I personally think the threat of 'centralization' as it pertains to a state power as a bad actor is overblown. 
We have reached a stage where Bitcoin is one (albeit the largest by far) of many crypto currencies and I don't see any government having in interest in 'messing' with Bitcoin just to see another currency take it's place.

You are new here right?
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:00:04
Agreed. However the tone here and from core is that block size increase is just not even a thing. Hell LukrJr wants block size decrease based on some far flung theory that apparently storage and bandwidth are the same now as in 2010. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:21:27

If you have to dig for communication channels to receive any information at all on the development and vision of the reference client for a $11 billion USD project. They are not communicating like the leaders if development for the reference client of a $11 billion USD project. 
And no. I don't think core is the illuminati or CIA. I just think they suck at communication.. for now
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:19:37
It's really depressing to talk to Core purists about bitcoin. Just a bunch of daft kids that are so dumb that they think all clients except for core just 'can't possibly function'. 
Oh well, I guess we'll see how it plays out with SegWit not activating and a few years til the next attempt of scaling.
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:52:28
They do, they just aren't allowed to discuss any alternatives to Core. So it's a really productive discussion just like it should be in a decentalized open source project. /s
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:53:38
As fascinating and creepy as that is. Yuck. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:21:01
Weak argument. If you want your code to be accepted into a reference installation of a massive financial system you have a responsibility to communicate with your audience.
It's mind blowing that with a clear and large group of people being very confused, apprehensive and downright suspicious if their actions they still make almost zero effort of communicating with the people they expect to implement their code. 
I have never seen an open source project of this magnitude communicate in a less open manner. Period. 
Apparently the only form of communication most core members have time for is bashing any alternative client on twitter. And that's just pathetic. 
It would take almost no time to simply put out a roadmap, a stance on possible hard fork for larger blocks etc. 
The fact that they don't proves that they don't want to. And that's just childish and stupid. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 12:01:43




I have discussed this with other core devs and none of them thought it was 'FUD' can you explain how I am wrong in that widespread usage of Lightning over on chain transactions will lead to less fees for miners?
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:45:59
Yep. And if that was the case it would be up to miners to decide to mine or not. It also wouldn't drastically do anything since price fluctuates far more than that in an average 14 day period. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 11:23:16
You mean it doesn't fit your narrative. Cause the Bitcoin market cap is very close to $11 billion in case you missed it. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:52:01
Well, that it a reasonable explanation. But then people also should probably disregard your opinion. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 17:39:04
Decentralization isn't the same as security. $500 million in hardware with a single purpose represent far more security than $500 million that can turn away and do something else. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 17:11:49
LukeJr for all the talent he may have is choosing to ignore usability for decentralization purist views. I have never personally understood why, but it's one of his many quirks. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 17:09:12
There is no 'benefit' to a certain method of mining over another. If anything the Bitcoin network is more secure thanks to ASIC. How are people not understanding this?

The idea was never 1 CPU = 1 vote. Satoshi even in the white paper and further discussions in 2009-2010 was fully aware of and even anticipated ASIC as a natural progression of the network. 
The 'ASIC is bad' narrative is carried by people that don't understand network effect or security by captial.

None of that is true at all. There are maybe 2-3 of 20+ active core developers that are even willing to say anything. And out of them 1-2 will simply not even answer anything about vision, future, big blocks, etc. Just regurgitate the same SegWit taglines.

@_date: 2016-11-11 21:06:47
Obviously what I mean is that if the community at a large (nodes and miners) don't want the latest update, there is nothing (should be nothing) that developers can do about it. They can commit all the code they want, but to no use.
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:55:20
So just like Lightning? Since it siphons off fees from miners and decrease the security of the network.

Well it wasn't but that's not an interesting argument. The second is one. And yes, obviously changing algorithm wouldn't do anything to the long term trend of centralization based on engagement and investment. 
You can just look at Ethereum, where the exact same thing is happening in GPU mining where Chinese farms are taking over at the same if not faster pace than in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:56:18
You do realize that lightning decreases the security of the network by siphoning transaction fees from miners? Or are you selectively dumb as a rock?

Stop acting like 'Bitcoin' is incompatible with 'X'. Core is not 'Bitcoin'. Bitcoin is whatever client runs the longest chain.
@_date: 2016-11-11 17:40:29
I'm not saying it's good. I'm just pointing out that the fact that investment is happening in a single region isn't a "problem with Bitcoin" it's a ecosystem issue and the solution is more hash power elsewhere, not some half assed idea that would be massively detrimental to Bitcoin. 
No one even mentioned the idea of messing with algorithm or pow when the U.S had 90% of all hash rate or even when a single pool in the U.S. Had 55%. Hipocracy at its finest. Bitcoin isn't "American" it's a global system. If the Chinese value it higher, and invest more so be it.

You describe "hard fork without consensus" like it's something that is bound to happen. Last time I checked this has never been something that any of the alternatives strive for. 
I assume if that's your definition, there should be no attempts at any point to allow segwit to activate I'd it doesn't reach 95% within the set time period right? Since it would per the set parameters be without consensus.
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:51:16
You do realize that core is leaderless right?
@_date: 2016-11-12 12:00:32
Lightning per definition is a system that is designed to lift transactions from the main chain to facilitate more transaction bandwidth. Saying that it won't siphon transaction fees from miners is pointless because if it doesn't it's useless as a scaling model.
So, if it scales the network miners lose money, and if it doesn't there is no effective scaling.
@_date: 2016-11-12 11:55:20
Agreed. But it's the only algorith that current ASIC is useful for.
@_date: 2016-11-13 18:22:50

That's why I mentioned that he later expanded in bitcointalk etc. on this fully expecting mining farms and ASIC. But OK, in the white paper it is described this way. Though no one took it literal at the time since even in 2009 many people have 'more than one CPU' so ASIC is simply an extrapolation of this.

Also: Since the network relies on nodes, equity and mining hardware as voting mechanism. That means that it's defacto agreed upon. Period.

I realize they are not a "company" but there are many core deva that draw salary for the development and it really shouldn't be this hard. 
People also shouldn't have to rely on this party sources for information. That's how things get "fucky" in the first place. Look at the Hong Kong accord mess and LukrJr off hand remarks that "block size increase is dead and buried" just months after they communicate that it was on the roadmap.

@_date: 2016-11-11 20:12:44
True, but the centralization isn't pool it's hash power and the largest firms of GPU are located in China. That said, it doesn't matter where they are located just that they are "centralized" in this argument.

@_date: 2016-11-11 20:14:43

@_date: 2016-11-11 21:31:46
I was going to point out that Bitmain doesn't own the data center, or that they have no intent on even using their small part of it for exclusively bitcoin mining, but since you think that 'anyone with significant hash rate should be destroyed' while not contributing to the decentralization on any scale yourself I think I'll just stick to calling you an idiot. Since that's what you are if you think we should just keep changing the protocol until some magic point where there are no large miners and still have a functional and secure bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:35:03
Fuck us? There is no 'US' there is only the bitcoin network. Where does this odd nationalized idea come from? Ghash.io had 55% of the network just 2 years ago, where was this half assed 'rescue plan' then?
"Oh the Chinese hold trillions in U.S. debt. Let's discuss changing currency so we don't have to pay them back"
It's very simple. If you want to de-centralize bitcoin, invest in Mining hardware. If you don't want to or can't, you don't have a vote. This is how Bitcoin was intended to work and you don't change that because a group that consider themselves 'the bitcoin ecosystem' are unhappy with the development.

@_date: 2016-11-11 18:57:11
4MB blocks. Well that's never gonna happen since bitcoin isn't a democratic property anymore and just a sandbox controlled by Core. But by all means, lets discuss changing algorithm to punish the people that are actually investing in mining power instead. 
What the fuck is wrong with this community?

Sure. But the very function of ASIC being single purpose is the reason they uniquely secure the network. If something is dual purpose, per definition it's less of an investment in a specific purpose.

For the purpose of them being a security risk to the network that didn't matter. They spend several days if not weeks in a position to work the network had they wanted to. 
Miners also didn't 'move off' the pool. Ghash,io had to set a hard limit to discourage pool use since users didn't care enough, they just wanted the pool with the most consistent earnings.

If you define currently as a single point in time yes. If you define it as something useful, in a larger picture it looks slightly different not?

Where does this 'can't compete' idea come in? Chinese miners aren't magically mining with free hardware or power. Power in Iceland, Washington, and even some parts of the Midwest is almost on par with what Chinese data-centers pay.
I mine in the midwest at $0.05 USD/kw and have absolutely no problem reaching ROI, and in Washington and Iceland power is as low as $0.02 USD/kw
Chinese miners take huge risk and have been for years due to the 'great firewall', Political climate, general hostility towards Chinese miners etc. 
Sure there are some miners in China that steal power or have heavily subsidized contracts but most of them either pay a price close to what we do in the west, or build their own Hydroelectric powerplants. 
There is nothing about China or other parts of the world that makes them inherently profitable or impossible to compete with.

What possible improvements do you see to SHA256 that 1. Is compatible with existing ASIC 2. Contributes in any possible way to decentralization? 
As described right now, the discussion isn't about making a better mouse trap. It's about making sure mice from a specific part of the world starve to death. 
If this was a discussion on generally improving bitcoin it would be one things. It's not. It's a discussion about "what can we do to shut China out of mining without it costing western Bitcoin millionaires money".

Ok, lets change it to 'lately' then you daft bastard. Since it's completely irrelevant for the functionality of the network if I can send a transaction fast THIS MINUTE, but not in 3 hours. 
Or we can just table it alltogether and I can come in all high and mighty next time we have 90k mempool and sat that it's irrefutable proof that bitcoin is broken since 'currently' i can't get a transaction through. That way we can both be idiots.

Let's hope. For what it's worth I think Unlimited is a serious alternative and have sprung out of frustration with core. But that doesn't mean that I think core is evil or bad. They are both trying to solve the same problem with different solutions. I just wish there was less animosity and bickering between the two, and a middle ground could be found. 
I think there are plenty of core contributors that also see the need for bigger blocks in conjunction with SegWit, I just wished we we were given more information on the issue. 
Oh well, fingers crossed that all camps are in it for the best of Bitcoin at the end of the day.

Pretending that an implementation is "incompatible" because the goal of it is to fork to larger block size is some shit invented by core. 
There is no "Bitcoin standard" that has to be followed by all implementations. If there was, SegWit wouldn't make the cut.

IF the global community are so worried about centralization, they get to invest in mining capacity instead of sitting on their bitcoin. 
There are 100s of people that have been made multi-millionaires solely due to by chance and luck holding 10.000s of Bitcoin they were basically gifted in the early days. 
If they choose to sit on the sidelines and watch the Chinese or anyone else 'take over' the network that's entire on them.
Complaining that mining is centralized without risking your own money to correct it is absolutely pathetic. Almost as pathetic as proposing changes to the bitcoin core protocol to undermine those investments. 
Just 2-3 years ago Bitcoin mining was 90%+ centralized to the United States and seemingly no one had any issues with that, why would 50%+ in Asia somehow be an issue now?
One thing that I can say with 100% certainty is: If somehow a switch to a different POW or algorithm is made to 'stop the Chinese' (cause don't pretend that's not what this is about). Bitcoin WILL fork, and the new chain will be essentially worthless, while the old SHA256 POW chain carries virtually all value forward. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:00:06
If a change to the core principle of Bitcoin which is proof of work is made rendering hundreds of millions in capitsl invested in mining hardware obsolete it will create a fork and a new and possibly wireless Bitcoin. All while the current miners gain total control over the value carrying fork. 
This isn't even a question to me. And I would never support a "we hate China" fork of BTC. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 15:23:59
There is no change to how Bitcoin works just because of a geographical concentration of hash rate. There is only security incentive for other parties to invest enough to secure more of the hash rate elsewhere. The rules have been known for 7 years now, it's not "China's fault" that investors in that region support Bitcoin more than elsewhere. If that group use their hash power, nodes and Bitcoin to vote for changes to the network it's 100% as per how Bitcoin was intended to function. 
@_date: 2016-11-04 16:29:05
And here we go: 
@_date: 2016-11-12 18:40:04
To conversations? I'd personally rather Luke answer how this is FUD? It's a fact that lightning as a function of how it handles transactions causes less traffic on-chain and hence a smaller amount of transactions fees. 
The question is how high it's reasonable to expect fees to be on-chain to compensate. 
My point is that anything that siphons fees from on chain transactions, does weaken the network since it lowers the return on mining making it less attractive to secure it. 
Whether or not that poses a future issue is the question. I think it's very optimistic or foolish to just say 'well miners will just have to raise their fees'. Yeah to what level? 
@_date: 2016-11-11 14:32:17
So because one geographical location or nation has shown more interest in supporting the bitcoin ecosystem we should now change how it works?

Remind me again, what part of my statement was fud?
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:02:45
The only thing I have gotten from him so far on that is that it "would break Bitcoin" with no credible technical or theoretical explanation.
In his opinion 1 MB blocks are already "breaking Bitcoin" (no idea how this is even an opinion).
My theory is more and more that core and LukeJr don't care at all about scaling Bitcoin. They just want a decentralized block chain to sell their own transaction services on top of. 
That's why so many core members are investors in Blockstream. They give zero shits about Bitcoin, cause they only need space enough in the blocks to run their own side chain transactions layer.  
So why would they support on chain scaling?
And they call Ver obstructionist.
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:39:35
The problem with that suggestion is that there are only a few ways of achieving this and none of those paths has the advantage of the network somehow magically making mining using several algorithms profitable for all parties. 
For there to be any incentive to run a multi-algorithm the current algorithm HAS to become less profitable, something that would immediately weaken the system. Most likely even before it's even implemented as miners would move away from mining in anticipation of a sharp drop in profitability. 
As far as I am concerned, bitcoin was created with SHA256 as proof of work protocol for propagating transactions, earning the mining subsidy, and fees. 
Changing this is creating something that is no longer bitcoin. Which is fine if you want an altcoin. But not if you want it to be bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-13 08:41:09

There are not 1000s of active devs. There are less than 100 that have made any material contribution to core over the last few months. This also has nothing to do with the vision and roadmap of core since you point out that out of those 1000s (100s) only a very small group has rights to source and/or 'speak on the behalf of core' to put it bluntly. 
My point stands since 'consensus' doesn't commit code or implement changes, or release new versions. People do. And those people have opinions.

True, but that's irrelevant since its entirely disable to manufacture ASIC in the U.S. As well, or simply buy chips from China or Russia. It's not a question of the tiny margin edge that Chinese (or other countries) miners have, it's about wanting to invest. 
You can literally buy Bitmain S9 right now, ship them to a datacenter in Washington and mine at massive ROI all the way to $400 Bitcoin price if you invest a healthy about of money. 
That's how you help secure and decentralized the network. Not by trying to fuck over people that have taken massive financial risk to mine the last 2 years while Bitcoin was taking a beating.
