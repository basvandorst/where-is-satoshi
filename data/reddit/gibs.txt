I'm not sure you know how ifs work
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:35:09
I've thought of similar solutions, and the issue with computational problems like protein folding is that it doesn't meet the requirements of a cryptocurrency algorithm being expensive to compute and cheap to validate. It also introduces an element of centralisation -- someone has to decide which problem the network should work on next. I couldn't think of a useful application that meets those criteria, but if you can you'll have cracked a problem the community has been mulling over for years, and you'll have the basis for the next big altcoin.

That's not the reasoning I'm using here. I'll try to clarify:
Let's say you've committed to buying one dog and you're choosing between adopting a shelter dog or getting one from a breeder. There's going to be a population of dogs without a home regardless of which choice you go with. But only one of these options reduces the overall population of homeless dogs by reducing the demand for puppy mill / breeder dogs and consequently the number of them being bred.
On aggregate, the number of dogs being bred commercially will adjust to changes in demand. It may not seem like your choice to adopt has a tangible impact, which is a doubt that applies to a lot of our consumer choices. We tend to distrust that our contribution to a statistical effect is real or representative of our actual contribution, because the chain of causation is obscured and we aren't directly experiencing the payoff.
One way to intuitively understand this is to consider the consequences of 1000 people in your city choosing to adopt instead of buying from a breeder. The specific consequences for individual breeders will be that they reduce their production by x amount (because each unsold dog costs them money). Some might over-adjust and some might under-adjust. Some might go out of business. Zooming out to a wider perspective, the net effect once the market adjusts as a whole is that production will be reduced corresponding to the change in demand. So in this case, 1000 fewer dogs are bred, give or take. If you were one of those people who adopted, you contributed 1/1000th of that effect, or one doggo.
It's the same principle with any choice we face when participating in markets as consumers. The difference we personally make is represented by a fraction of the total effect on changes in market demand. The fraction we are responsible for ends up being essentially equivalent to the change we personally made, whether it's one doggo, one fewer meat meal a week, one more voice at a protest. At a micro level it's not always a perfectly neat correlation, because statistical effects have high variance with small sample sizes. But the sum of your choices over the course of your life -- or the fraction of one choice as part of the sum of everyone else making the same choice -- statistically converges towards change that's directly proportional to your contribution.
There's also the flow-on effects of people who are influenced when they see you making good choices. Which is harder to quantify, but still real and significant.

Thanks for that explanation, that is really helpful in clarifying the difficulties with this approach. It sounds like things I'd intuited might be fundamental barriers to an elegant implementation of "useful" proof of work. I think there are probably a limited set of computational problems that could do something useful with all that hashpower and be viable as a proof of work. Finding new primes, maybe. Is there already a coin that does that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:31:35
Basically because it drives demand. The more people get their pups from breeders, the more they breed and the fewer shelter pups find a home. That's putting aside the treatment of animals in the breeding / puppy mill industry, which is a good enough reason in itself to adopt.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:01:13
This reasoning never made sense to me. It's not like working on these problems are mutually exclusive endeavours. You can use the same logic to argue that it's not worth worrying about any given problem, if there are bigger problems out there. The energy footprint of bitcoin mining is massive so it's absolutely worth investing effort to coming up with alternative approaches.

I love the generosity, but can I make a suggestion? I think it'd be more meaningful to these people if you found something they really have been needing/wanting but haven't had the cash to pay for it.  For instance my Mum would be over the moon if I surprised her with a kitchen renovation. Bitcoin would most likely confuse and stress her out because she wouldn't know what to do with it, and she now has to worry about the price and the risks of a volatile investment. I think cryptos could be a great gift for certain people, but not everyone has the risk tolerance to enjoy the ride or the technical know-how to really appreciate it.

I don't think I was shaming anyone. There's a difference between laying out why I think it's better to adopt and saying, "you're a horrible person if you don't adopt".
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:45:17
That's a given -- the thing is, we're only in control of our own choices, not the choices of others. I think we can all agree that abandoning your pet is the shittiest of shitty things to do, but the question is about the effects of adoption vs buying from a breeder.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:23:23
You're conflating the question of blame / culpability for abandoned pets with the question of what's the better choice between adopting and buying. The common ground is that abandoning your pet is shitty and if you do that, the blame lies 100% with you. But that has no bearing on the moral question faced by someone who's looking for a pet.
The fuckups of the previous owner shouldn't be transferred to the welfare of the abandoned dog going forward, inasfar as their actions having some bearing on whether you decide to adopt or buy. If a dog at a shelter was abandoned, are you any more justified in opting to buy from a breeder than if the shelter dog was a stray? How are you proposing the actions of the abandoner factors into this question?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:43:49
Ok, I see what you're saying. I think right now it's not a barrier to entry because the issue isn't obvious to most newbies, and it doesn't necessarily outweigh the benefits for them. But I think this may change as adoption increases and these kinds of downsides are covered more by mainstream media. I guess I'm just saying that it's something that's worth trying to solve as soon as possible, not just when it starts becoming an issue to adoption.
I do agree though that it's not feasible to introduce such a fundamental change into the bitcoin ecosystem, at least in the near future. This kind of thing is better suited to the altcoin space, and potentially be incorporated into bitcoin once the tech matures and it's demonstrated its viability and value.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:02:03
Adopting a child when you're capable of having kids is a pretty amazing thing to do though, right? It's essentially making a personal sacrifice for the larger good. But that doesn't mean everyone *ought to* adopt (either kids or pets), people value different things after all. You listed some things you value in your pets, I have my own set of values and someone else might be different to both of us. So that equation is going to come out differently for everyone.

Looks like that's a one-page simplified summary, hardly a white paper. I'm just not sure why you assumed the dev went the non-anonymous route in his implementation. It seems to me like you already decided it wasn't anonymous, then made the necessary assumptions to support that belief.

I've asked the dev to clarify on this point in the bitcointalk thread, and he will get around to writing a whitepaper eventually, so hopefully that'll answer your question. He's definitely aiming for making the anonymity as strong as it can be, and it's not a vanilla coinjoin implementation. Sorry, I don't know enough of the technicals to give more detail.

Isn't the underlying question (which they probably don't have the technical understanding to ask) about whether they can mine *cryptocurrencies* with a GPU? In which case, your answer could have simply been "yes", and a few examples of gpu mineable altcoins.

To play devil's advocate here, this theory seems to assume the following:
- He knew antminer would gain a large enough share of hash power for this to be significant in the future
- He is ok with destabilising &amp; devaluing bitcoin should he try to use the feature for anything other than the stated purpose
- He'd be willing to sacrifice his reputation and presumably future sales to exercise that control
I think it's good to be skeptical of any individual's intentions -- bitcoin is meant to be a robust trustless system after all -- but I would want a stronger case before leaping to conspiracy.

Just to add to the information already given: Crates by themselves aren't worth anything. There's no strategy to opening them; you buy a key and get random loot. It's exactly the same principle as a slot machine, and it's designed to favour the house in the same way. Meaning the odds are against you coming out ahead, and the more you play, the more you guarantee yourself a net loss.
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:23:46
It's just convention, and that's what language is. Language isn't precise and well defined like mathematics, so it can be non-literal but not necessarily "wrong".
By convention:
- "x% faster" is literal.
- "x times faster" where x &lt; 2 is rarely used.
- "x times faster" where x &gt;= 2 means "x times as fast as"
It might be an inelegant convention but it's not an error, and it's not ambiguous if pretty much everyone uses it the same way. What you're doing here is like berating someone for their error when they say "I got on the plane", since in truth they got *in* the plane. Yes, your system makes more sense from a maths perspective, but usage that makes the most sense isn't inherently correct.
There is no universal correct usage of English, there's only convention, which evolves over time. Despite what a lot of people might think, dictionaries aren't the authority on correct usage of English, they merely document the conventions at the present time.

The reasoning is the same whether it's poker or sports betting or cryptos: A successful (or unsuccessful) outcome doesn't alter whether it was a smart bet at the time you made it. Winning after gambling against the odds doesn't make it a good decision in retrospect. That's the fallacy of results oriented thinking.
What makes a good bet is having sufficient understanding of the odds (or the fundamentals), the consequences, the risk and reward. If you have 10% chance of winning and the payoff is 11:1, that's a good bet. But if you can't afford the loss, it's a bad bet. 
With crypto trading we don't know the precise odds, so we bet on our understanding of the coin and the market being correct. We might have a poor understanding and get lucky, which would be a bad bet. Or we might have excellent understanding and get screwed by some unforeseen development, in which case it was still a good bet.
The outcome on its own tells us very little about whether we made the bet for the right reasons. Drawing meaningful inferences based on the outcome requires repeated trials under the same conditions, enough times to overcome variance. In trading as with poker, you can go on hot streaks for months and then lose everything because the variance is high. The true profitability of your decision process is only revealed after sufficient bets/trades to overcome the luck factor.
This is why it's unequivocally a bad move to bet your whole bankroll unless the profitability of your decision making process is tried and tested AND you can afford to lose it all. And the fact is, we don't know if either of these things is true for this guy who took out a loan on his house to buy bitcoin.

It will follow that trajectory about as often as it doesn't. Hindsight bias / confirmation bias just makes it seem more predictive than it really is. It's pretty easy to make a trend fit this pattern depending on the timescale you choose.

There is a meaningful distinction between intrinsic value and the tradeable value of a currency.
Intrinsic value in this context is a sort of imprecise way of saying that it has value other than as a medium of exchange. That could be pragmatic value, sentimental value, aesthetic value, cultural value, whatever. It's not really *intrinsic* since the value doesn't exist if there are no people around to value it. People say intrinsic as a cognitive or literary shortcut. But this kind of value is distinct from a currency's tradeable value.
The distinction is best illustrated by taking the commodity in question somewhere that doesn't recognise it as a medium of exchange. If people still want it, then it has "intrinsic" value.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:58:06
You weren't wrong thinking "bitcoin is different". It is radically different in many ways to traditional currencies.
Of course, it's also shackled to human fear &amp; greed.
My opinion is that for a currency in its infancy, not backed by any nation, it is holding its value remarkably well despite the uncertainty. It will only become more stable as more businesses start accepting it, and as the infrastructure matures.
**Crypto is not going anywhere.** Its advantages over centralised currencies far outstrip the fear over these teething issues during its "public launch" period.
All of this drama -- the DDOSes, the sudden influx of new users, the crashes -- are testing the weaknesses of cryptocurrencies. This is forcing the infrastructure to adapt and improve. The crash will not be as bad as many predicted; traders will be more wary but will have increased confidence that it can survive a crash. It's all good for crypto in the long run.

Expect a bit of circularity in definitions. Crypto markets are a weird business. The price is being "corrected" to its perceived value, which is largely derived from recent trends in its price.
