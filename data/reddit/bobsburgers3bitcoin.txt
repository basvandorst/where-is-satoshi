There is ultimately no such thing as 'spamming'. Even using the word 'spamming' implies that there are different categories of use or users. Miners can confirm whatever transactions they want.
What specific "rules that allow spamming of the blockchain" are you referring to? How do you define 'spam' and exclude it without imposing your arbitrary views upon others? Would there be any difference between somehow restricting what people can do on the blockchain and the way governments and banks restrict what people can do with fiat?
Also, how would 'spamming' weaken the network? These 'spam' transactions must compete with other transactions and would include fees that further incentivize miners to secure the network.

50%+x total hash power is required for a hard fork.
Setting a 75% threshold for a hard fork is a huge good-faith courtesy to ensure only a widely accepted hard fork is activated.

@_date: 2015-12-25 17:26:33


I agree, sort of. Having a max block size (at some limit, whatever it may be) prevents some jerk miner from making a truly huge block that could bog down the network, though I wonder if other miners would just ignore this block, especially if it was really big. What I don't understand is why this limit is still at 1 MB when, right now, 4 of the last 6 blocks are greater than 850 KB and there are 6100 unconfirmed transactions totaling 6.4 MB in size (pulled from blockchain.info). Granted, the *average* blocksize right now is around 600 or 700 KB, but [it's pretty clear]( that it's approaching 1 MB very quickly.




Agree completely. Nodes can set whatever limits they want.
 


You can't guarantee it, and I'm not advocating an *unlimited* max block size, though if there were to be one I suspect there would be an effective limit imposed by miners and other nodes.
So let's say someone wants to backup their 1 GB drive to the Bitcoin blockchain. Let's say for simplicity that they want to do it in 1 MB chunks and that a 1 MB chunk of this user's data corresponds to exactly 1 MB of data in the block chain. This user would have to outbid everyone else on the network for 1000 blocks. Current average total fees per block is about 0.2 bitcoin. Let's say this person can 'win' every block by submitting a 1 MB transaction with a 0.3 bitcoin fee, and that no one will begin to outbid him. It would cost this user 300 bitcoin to back up his 1 GB of data. I have no problem with anybody spending 300 bitcoin on the security of the network.
If people are concerned about being priced out of the network because of something like this, perhaps we should consider raising the max block size limit, at least just a little bit. Average fees might go down, but total fees will increase.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:21:59


Come on. Really?


XT is creating the potential for a hard fork only if 75% of the hash power supports it.
Serious question: Do you genuinely believe that requiring a 3-to-1 support ratio before activating a hard fork is 'dangerous'?

This is what they publicly acknowledged.
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:56:54














Correct, and I'm not arguing that. Maybe the fees are too high or maybe they're not, let the market decide, regardless of what the block size limit may be.
What I am disputing is the claim that "There are literally *zero* legitimate non-monetary applications of the Bitcoin blockchain, almost by definition". If a miner includes a transaction, it's legitimate. There's no check box that says "Is this a transaction that luke-jr does not approve of?"












I think it's an irrelevant point when there's no way to define or distinguish between a spammer and a regular user.

The blockchain, by definition, cannot and does not distinguish between transactions based on what they are used for. Anyone can use it for anything, and is free to include a fee on a transaction to encourage miners to include the transaction.

What definition of 'everyone' is being used here?
Clearly, you do not consider 75% to be everyone (nor do I, but I think it's good enough for a hard fork):


"No disagreements left"? So when "everyone" agrees? Do we define "everyone" as 95%? 99%? 99.9%? 99.99%? Someone will always disagree.
If the assertion is truly that 100% of all people must agree on a hard fork for it to activate, then the assertion is that there will be no hard forks ever.
I feel that 75% is pretty courteous when only 50%+x is required.

You're wrong! You go to hell and you die! ;)
But in all seriousness, I'm here for two reasons.
First, I've been drawn out of my usual state of lurking due to what I perceive to be out of control censorship in this subreddit.
Second, I enjoy having actual civilized debates with people about issues that affect Bitcoin (in addition to shenanigans and complaints about censorship).
I am not here for the sake of antagonizing anybody.
I've got a lot of non-sitting-on-Reddit stuff to do today, but if anyone has any input or questions I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:04:15
It's an arbitrary number that doesn't matter as long as there is enough divisibility (1 bitcoin=100,000,000 satoshis and there will be a total of 21 million bitcoins). If we ever need more divisibility a fork will arise that will allow it.
Regarding supply, I feel that a core tenet of Bitcoin is that it is ultimately deflationary. If an inflationary currency is desired, use Dogecoin, some other altcoin, or the vast majority of fiat. Or fork Bitcoin and try to get people to use the new fork.
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:46:06
Thank you for presenting reasonable arguments. I appreciate it very much and will absolutely keep these in mind in the future.
I would disagree that increasing the blocksize limit wouldn't increase miner revenue, but I certainly don't know for sure. Obviously, the only way to know for sure is if it was actually done. If going up to a 2 MB limit did actually decrease miner revenue, does that imply we should actually drop the limit to 0.5 MB to further increase miner revenue?
I think there's only so much coding and off-chain wizardry that can be done before we have to increase the blocksize limit (hell yeah for coding efficency, but I get deeply concerned about centralization/fungibility/capital controls with increasing off-chain solutions). I think doubling it to 2 MB is fairly reasonable and would give the community an actual example with valuable data on how the network reacts to a limit increase and a hard fork, and while 6-12 tps is still not that much, it would still be double current capacity.
I admit I need to do some more reading on the technical aspects of LN. But when a see a fairly large number of 'core' developers working for a venture capital backed company that seems to based around providing off-chain solutions, I'm concerned. Even if their insistence on not increasing the block size limit has nothing to do with the services provided by their company, it still seems like a pretty blatant conflict of interest, and I'm happy to see alternative bitcoin implementations pop up. The censorship here also really doesn't help alleviate the concerns about ulterior motives.
@_date: 2015-12-31 04:40:54


The problem here is that people can typically do a charge back on their credit card for 60 days after a transaction.
So if that does exist, good luck finding a service that won't charge you an insane amount of money.


If you want to be even remotely serious about security, don't use a web wallet. Nothing stops them from stealing or 'losing' what you believe to be 'your' bitcoins (as an aside, you might be very interested in multi-signature, but it's not something I'd recommend to a total newbie until they get more comfortable with bitcoin).


Backing up your wallet.dat file (or other respective wallet file depending on your client) is usually one of the easier ways, but there are other options too. Some wallets have deterministic wallets that allow you to generate all your private keys from a single seed (like a bunch of random characters or words). If you want your actual private key(s) you can also save just that. In the regular Bitcoin client, you can use the "dumpprivkey" command followed by the associated address to see your actual private key. (EDIT: You can do this by clicking "Help", "Debug window", and clicking on the "Console" tab. Some other wallets have a much easier process for getting your private keys.)


Yes, it is best practice to maintain your privacy by not reusing addresses.
There are an infinite number of private keys and bitcoin addresses (infinite in practicality, not actuality, other people please don't freak out here) so you might as well just generate a new address for every new transaction. This is made very easy by wallets that use a deterministic seed, as mentioned above.

That is not explicit, and implies subjective censorship of transactions.

You're talking about pruning the (currently) 50 GB or so blockchain down to a copy that only contains UTXOs? I think that's a pretty cool idea. How big would the set of just the UTXOs be? My understanding is that for someone do this, they still have to download and verify the whole blockchain, and then prune it. I'm not really arguing one way or another here, just trying to make sure I understand the concept.
 


So you're saying this is/could be bloating storage requirements for people running pruned nodes? I can understand that. But personally, as long as the miners are getting paid for the initial transaction I don't really care.

[Mining distribution]( certainly is not ideal, but I think that having the top 3 pools at about 20% each is reasonable. We have to remember that these are mostly pools and that individual miners can switch to other pools if they want.
GHash.IO hit 50% not that long ago and look at them now, only 1%.
About [nodes dropping off]( I'm not sure I have a perfect answer. I think the node count is going to continue dropping off no matter what. While it might take a long time for a new node to download the whole 50 GB blockchain, it can take an even longer (2-3 days or sometimes more) to verify a new copy of the blockchain because it is so CPU intensive. In short, it's a huge barrier to entry for any newcomers considering running a full node. When a long time node operator ends up shutting down, we've got no one to replace them. I'm not sure what to do about this, regardless of block size.
I do feel that if we're bumping up against the block size limit, it's an indication that the network is ready to handle more transactions. I mean, if 1 MB blocks are getting full, is going up to 2 MB blocks unreasonable? Miners would be able to collect greater total fees, further securing the network. I'm also not entirely sure, in absolute terms, what a 'safe' number of nodes would be considered, and how low would be too low before it endangers the network.
I've got no problem with SW, sidechains, or other ways of increasing throughput, and I look forward to them, but I find it puzzling that the 'core' devs are pretty much completely dismissing an extremely simple (coding wise) change in favor of much more complicated solutions.

First Seen Safe (FSS) RBF seems like an extremely reasonable alternative to Full RBF.
Basically, if you're transaction gets stuck, just rebroadcast the same transaction with a higher fee.
Full RBF allows you to spend the same UTXOs to a different address, effectively destroying zero-confirmation transactions (and, incidentally, making a Blockstream product seem much more attractive).

Perhaps a hard fork is what scares some people.
What scares me is what I perceive as Bitcoin being hijacked by a group of devs who stand to benefit financially from a Bitcoin protocol with limited throughput. Even if Blockstream is truly a bunch of saints, it's pretty hard to say that there is not a large conflict of interest.
But it does not matter what we think, it only matters what the miners think.
What I'm really taking issue with, though, is the list of scaling solutions without even a mention or hint of the block size limit, while using phrases like "If something like the Lightning Network comes to fruition, then I will go in even bigger", which seem a bit shilly. I do not mean this an an attack, but this is my perception of the post.

Speaking for myself, [this]( does not meet my definition of 'dead'.
Certainly, others may disagree.

Dude, not sure if you're being serious or not, but this already exists and is being actively developed. It's a Bitcoin client with Unlimited configuration options, but users of this subreddit are strongly discouraged from discussing it (and other software).

I would strongly disagree with the assertion that this is a really useless metric.

Prerequisites:  
1, core version 0.13.1 released in July, including the miners activated segwit (isolation witness) are available;  
2, classic releases new version is based on core 0.13.1 version, including for miners active segwit (isolation witness) and 2M hard bifurcation;  
3, core violation of the Hong Kong expansion consensus agreement, not in August 1, 2016 release includes new versions of 2M hard bifurcation.
Making process:  
1, over 75% of the mine pool owners and operators of power miners Optional Optional day expansion of convening the meeting;  
2, the meeting reached a consensus: all participants ore miners in pools or expansion route choice will work hand in hand;  
3, select a pool of mine as "Terminator";  
4, released "Terminator Plan" content.
Program content:  
1. Participating mineral pool, miners reach consensus on expansion: 90% or more operators to activate 2M force bifurcation hard to count more than 95% of the force activation segwit (isolation witness);  
2. Participating mineral pool, miners to achieve consensus on the expansion, will be unified planning, unified action, act in unison;  
3, select XX meeting mine pool to "Terminator";  
4, in addition to the "Terminator", the participants all mineral pools, within 30 days the miners core program switches to the latest version of the classic, complete 2M hard bifurcation, segwit (isolation witness) Operator support force;  
5, if and only if more than 75% of the operator support 2M hard on finalizing the diverging after "Terminator" complete support for 2M hard bifurcation as soon as possible to ensure that there are more than 90% of the force operator support 2M hard bifurcation;  
6, when the 2M hard fork is activated, the 28-day grace period, the pool of participants ore miners will do everything possible to inform all the miners, exchanges, wallet developer / company, core wallet users, other start-up companies and other completed core switching procedures to ensure the smooth progress of the bifurcation hard, to avoid unnecessary losses generated;  
7, activate segwit (isolation witness).
Description proposal:  
1. The proposed plan is valid only after three preconditions occur;  
2, which is a majority of the miners to mine the main pool of the proposal, there are different opinions may ignore this proposal, will be idle, bored when I was nonsense;  
3, expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, both parties after a long discussion over, except for a few extreme person, most people agree that the following points:  
(1) We need to 2M hard bifurcation, but requires enough force to support the operator to ensure that Bitcoin will not be split;  
(2) We need to isolate the witness, in order to achieve Bitcoin kernel better scalability and compatibility;  
(3) We need lightning network, in order to achieve Bitcoin-second transfer capability.  
4. Select the Always use classic classic does not mean that later, if the core in a subsequent compatible version adds support for the classic, the miners can then select the core;  
5, core and classic are open source projects, developers fate is freedom, when the miners selected classic, I believe there will be many core developers turn to classic provides code;  
6, the battle line expansion, isolation witness, 2M hard bifurcation debate lightning network has been trouble for too long, please do not argue with me here their advantages and disadvantages, and I do not want to waste time on these topics and the energy;  
7, one of the core design of bitcoin miner is considered the future direction of the force decided to Bitcoin, "talk harm the country", the expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, continue to argue it is empty. "Hard work and prosperous," better than a perfect plan executed powerful miners was time to act to end this dispute it!

Not disagreeing that satoshis or cents per byte would also be an insightful value, but I would strongly disagree with the absolute assertion that cost per transaction has no meaning, especially when compared to cost per transaction in the past.

Hah, talking about economics. That's rich.

Without that transaction, it works out to an average fee of 39 cents per transaction.
Using the Bitfinex price of $1,125.70 at that time according to 
That would remove 50 x $1,125.70 = $56,285.00 and 1 transaction from the calculation
This gives us:
* $793,614.5979 in transaction fees
* 2,025,636 transactions
* $793,614.5979 / 2,025,636 = $0.3917853937726225 per transaction.

 for anyone looking for the source.
Question: What is a good block explorer/source that has individual transactions, such that median fee per transaction can be fairly easily calculated?

RBF wallet support would help eliminate a lot of the "my transaction is stuck, what now?" posts, or at least people would flag future transactions for RBF after their first stuck transaction.
I would also like to see increased onchain transaction capacity to avoid the issue in the first place.

I am not sure what is being suggested here, can this be elaborated upon?
If user experience was improved via improvements in exchanges and wallets, wouldn't that draw in more users to Bitcoin, driving fees up further?
