thanks, that would be dope. But let's say bitcoin doesn't adopt segwit, is there any way for bitcoin to lower fees to near litecoin levels?

what are the chances of bitcoin adopting segwit? it's uncertain. So without segwit could bitcoin lower fees to litecoin levels?

Ah gotcha, wonder why I got that in my head. 
So will bitcoin forever take hours to confirm a transaction, or could this be reduced in the future?

Ty. I guess we'll see what happens august 1st. Out of interest what's your personal prediction? 
How long do you think it would take to see which coin survives if a split occurs?

it's actually at $0.12 so that argument = BTFO. you literally would be at over 6x return still selling now and can confirm that yourself. you would be at a 3x return on bitcoin.  
I don't give a shit about stellar btw, I used it as an example because that's literally what he said he bought in the other post. if he bought and sold bitcoin in the same time, he would have got 6x gains instead of 25x gains.  
It depends on your level of risk and how many multiples of returns you want. If you're happy gambling on bitcoin during the next run which is 100% fueled by hype still, you will most likely get less returns than if you choose another with solid fundamentals / hype factor around the top and sell at the right time. but I agree it's the safer gamble overall in most cases.

So segwit wouldn't increase the speed of transactions?

"I picked up on a few  names of other cryptocurrencies he mentioned (not  going to talk about them because this is a Bitcoin subreddit)."  
Remember, if you chose right in the last bull market you were looking at way higher gains than bitcoin. Stellar was $0.02 in July for example, even if he missed the top and sold at the first selloff at $0.50 he got 25x returns.
