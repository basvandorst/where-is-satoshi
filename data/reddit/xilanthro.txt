...started out as a 12oz pound, too. Is that how Sterling units work?

Nice try, [counter-counter-counter-intelligence officer co-co-co-worker](

Same here - it's really nice to have a comparatively unbiased search engine back. My only complaint is that, as Google, it's a single source and so vulnerable to similar poisoning in the end. Without something like a (not-corrupt) third party auditor the neutrality of search results and setting out some standards for what that means, DDG is a ton of relief right now, but could be subverted through profit-motive over time to be just like Google (&amp; Bing)

...or stop using a search engine that bubbles you, tracks you, and distorts results for money.

Which is healthcare investments dividends and higher worker insecurity resulting in lower wages: more tangible worth! It's almost as if Milton Friedman himself had invented soda.

OK - This makes perfect sense.
Thank you.
What I meant by not caring about the hardware is that I keep multiple redundant backups on pretty plain encrypted and detached storage devices, so a device failing is not an issue, as they are unlikely to all fail simultaneously, and they are all regularly checked...

Thanks, deepdot. The process is not too complicated. I got it. Unfortunately this does not address my arbitrage question, though.

Thanks for this explanation, ofirbeigel. One thing I really don't understand - looking at VirWoX on your recommendation, I notice that SLL is trading at ~310/315 EUR/SLL, and ~231/235 USD/SLL - unless the fraction is reversed (i.e. the numbers are actually SLL/EUR &amp; SLL/USD) it seems to me there's 'free' money in arbitrage there - i.e. I could just buy a bunch of SLL with my USD, immediately sell the SLL for EUR, and get back a tidy 87% profit (minus a bunch of transaction fees - let's say 7% x 3 = 21%, leaving 66%)
I know this sounds ridiculous. Could you please explain what I am missing in this picture?
