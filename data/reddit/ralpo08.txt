What do you think is the best way to manage your secret keys, from the perspective of a regular user (not familiar with cryptography in general)?

Some cryptographers have been working on it, take a look at Zerocoin

Ok, let's first define some terms. Anonymization is when you can't, at all, know to whom any given data belongs to. People confuse it a lot with Pseudonimization, which is when you can group information by owner, but you don't know exactly who this "data owner" is. For instance, Reddit isn't anonymous. Even though you don't know who I am, you can still trace all activity under my pseudonym and if you see me in another thread you'll know it's the same guy. 
As you know, Bitcoin is not anonymous, it works with pseudonyms, because each wallet is uniquely identified. And this is exactly the problem you're trying to solve.
The correct term for what you're proposing is, indeed, **[obfuscating]( as the Zerocoin guys call it, because you're just making it harder to obtain information.
I mean, it is *still possible* to know the senders and receivers of all transactions! That can happen either actively (e.g. an unreliable service tracking all transactions) or passively (e.g. some external attacker invades the "proxy wallet" system). Even worse, the middle service could even be coerced by the government to reveal information.
Anonymization (in its true sense) is only possible when you can't, by definition, trace the transactions. Zerocoin's proposal satisfies this criteria by using [zero-knowledge proof](
So, I'm sorry to say that anonymizing things in the way you're saying is impossible by definition, because of the way the Bitcoin protocol is defined. The "anonymizing services" you mention **do not** make anything anonymous. 
In this argument, I'm only taking into account the technical factors here. Bitcoin has proved that any cryptocurrency has the potential of widespread adoption, so I really don't see it as impossible that people could start using another (better) protocol. I'm sorry to say that what you're calling *"computer nerd's unnecessary sophistication"* is actually the right way to do it.
BTW, I don't wanna be the "I know more than you" jerk, it just happens that I'm working on my master's thesis on cryptography, so my daily routine is basically to study these things. I'll be more than glad to help you understand these concepts, so feel free to ask if I wasn't clear :)
Edit: grammar

What? Giving the key "for a few moments", what do you mean exactly?

Data collection was conducted in late 2013. From the paper: 
_"As a result, 22 363 users could be identified, and
altogether 1 797 IP addresses were assigned to them.
The imbalance is caused by three outstanding IP
addresses to which 20 680 users are assigned. These
IP addresses probably belong to Bitcoin wallet services,
which can be used for creating transactions on a
website without using a private computer."_

Indeed, the way the authors repeatedly say it is "anonymous" is rather misleading. Bitcoin is only pseudonymous, at best, and that's rather fragile, like some recent [news show](

This is cool. Tor should be a default feature IMO.

Thanks for your reply! I'm thinking is to use the autoinvest option, cool to hear that it works for you. For how long have you been doing this?
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:32:26
Sorry to hear that. May I ask how many investments you had made when that happened?
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:29:22
Do you wanna repost it on Or is it OK if I do it? 
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:33:10
Do you pick them manually or use the auto-invest option? I'm thinking of doing the latter, I'm not a fan of micro-management

"Lines of code" is a limited metric. By that graph, that Satoshi Nakamoto guy is a slob. But LOC is still better than "no metric", I'll give you that.

Click bait at its finest

Great one, thanks!
