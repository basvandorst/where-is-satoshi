Well then perhaps we can put humans not understanding stuff in 2 categories 
Those who fear and stay away from things that they don't understand regardless of whether it's harmless or even helpful. Like my dog with the vacuum cleaner. He doesn't understand that not only is it not dangerous, it's beneficial to him to help get shedding hair off when his double coat gets thick in the winter
And those who go towards things they don't understand because they have an imprecise list of pros and cons. Like moths flying towards a bug zapper. Thinking the pro is that it's warmer and the con of not going towards it is being colder. But not understanding the other, to them unknown, con which is if you touch the warm lamp you'll get electrocuted and die

And therein lies the current issue with bitcoin. The value growth in it currently  is based on speculation which in turn is due to the fact that people aren't treating it as a *currency* (which is the whole point) but as just a commodity, with speculators getting interested purely based on wanting to be able to buy low sell high. 
And now you've got companies that *did* accept it as currency, like steam, pulling out. 
I love the idea of a decentralized currency system and I especially love the idea of a decentralized currency completely outside of the realm of the nation-state to control and that protects the anonymity of its users 
But right now that's not what bitcoin is being used as. Right now it's like a Baudrillardian Hyperreality mirror image of financial products

No but it's undeniable that there absolutely is a bubble and that the bubble **will** burst at some point

History suggests that's a very silly thing to believe
