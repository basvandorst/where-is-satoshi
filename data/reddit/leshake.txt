It's untraceable money.

Don't put money in bitcoin that you wouldn't be comfortable putting on the casino table.  I would hesitate to call it an investment in general.

It's easy to analyze price movements after the fact, which is why it's easy to write articles about it, which is why it's probably correct, because it's easy to do.

You can expect it to surge when the Chinese government limits capital outflows again.  When that will happen again?  Nobody knows.  But in the next few years they will have to pop their real estate bubble and deal with the enormous amount of municipal and corporate debt that has been undertaken.  It's impossible to know precisely when this will happen.  I think it's most likely to happen in the next 4 years.

I read a lot of financial articles and literature.  The consensus appears to be that the rise in BTC is due to fear of capital controls in China and retirement of high denominated bills in India.

He doesn't want Bitcoin to become mainstream because then it will no longer be cool.

Price is not directly correlated to volume.  The price is simply what someone agrees to pay for it.

The psychology of markets?  People are impatient.  When it has stopped moving up and is stuck in a range for long enough, people are gonna sell.

While I agree with you that there will be some form of widely used digital currency, who knows whether BTC will continue to be the benchmark.

Not the same leadership.  They didn't keep most of the employees either.  So, not really.

JPM took the money and bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, effectively bailing them out.  They didn't fuck around with those shitty mortgages nearly as much as other banks.

If bitcoin was at 500k right now they would collectively be worth $15 trillion.  GDP of the U.S. is $17 trillion.
