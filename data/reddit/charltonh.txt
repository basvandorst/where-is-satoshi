I have noticed all these points too.  IMO the 'stagnation' is part of the natural process.

I think you should disconnect your machine and use another machine to dissect and try to figure out what the heck happened.  The system was obviously insecure, but it'd be nice if you posted back what it was (or at least think it was).

Yes, unfortunately I've discovered that manually creating transactions (for example, to sign offline) is quite difficult as there are no easy tools in existence to do so.  There used to be a couple, but they no longer work (or at least I couldn't figure out how to get them to).
I can see how it is quite easy to set one output for your transaction, and not realize that the rest of what's in the address will automatically go to the fee.

The USD is valuable precisely because of it's use in paying off debt.  The writer claiming 400% 'profits' indicates his fiat currency state of mind as a debt-slave.

Seems like, just with time-lock txns and CSV, you can dramatically increase bitcoin's capacity with a lightning-type layer *right now*.  If you think about it, a bitcoin txn is just inputs and outputs.  You can hold these txns and add as many inputs and outputs as you want, in the sequence they were done, and just create one large transaction rather than many small ones.  Bitcoin capacity is about to increase by an order of magnitude!

They don't know exactly.  But this is understandable.  90% of traders lose money, how is this even possible?  It's possible because those on the other side of the trade are the exchanges themselves, who are actually private corporations whose servers just move the market around to take everyone's money based on the position size, margin, and stop information they alone have access to.  Meanwhile supply/demand considerations are done on a separate set of books controlled by the PTB.

Think of that 10-cent fee as the settlement cost on an international decentralized network, like an international wire.

Temporary manipulation on crypto-exchanges by those with deep pockets who risk their capital in doing so is one thing.
Private exchanges posing as public whose computers merely move the price around to take everyone's money without regard to supply and demand (done on another set of books) is something else entirely and what makes up most of our financial system today.  Complete fraud.  And so technical (or fundamental) analysis no longer works in most mainstream markets, which is the reason for your bias against it (understandable, but people used to be able to trade for a living).

You bought your BTC at the price you bought at, presumably $774.  Delivery cannot happen until the ACH fully clears which takes usually 8-10 business days in my experience.  Until then, you supposedly own your BTC but you cannot withdraw it until the ACH fully clears.
Although technically an ACH takes only 1-3 days to process, the longer timeframe is because you are buying a cash/gold/harder currency you can walk away with so to cover their ass they must wait until the ACH can no longer be reversed.  Hence the 8-10 day wait.  But the deal was, you bought your BTC the day you clicked buy.
They don't say instant delivery for ACH, may be that applies to debit card txns.

How to set up a 'bitcoin account':

I think that before then there will be a real consensus on what the blocksize should be.  But even if it should stay at 1MB and the fees are that high, you'll still be able to run a lightning node and pass along those fees.  People might tend towards hubs with ample funds for many/large transactions but it won't be citibank that runs them, it'll be the bitcoin rich.

BCH definitely looking like a scam coin.  The name &amp; logo ripoff, also the obvious attempts at manipulating the price above bitcoin as a few low-volume trades were placed above USD$3000.  No deposits yet accepted anywhere even though the media is claiming that bcash sales "are exploding".  No functioning markets or even blockchain yet but price is supposedly climbing.  No withdrawals possible anywhere yet either.
I'm starting to believe this is an attack to confuse the bitcoin community in an attempt to break bitcoin.  I wouldn't be surprised if eventually banks or govts come in to manipulate the price of bcash above bitcoin with the media telling the world "this is the new bitcoin".  Which might not be so bad because it would at least allow me to cash out and allow me to buy more real bitcoin down the road.

I think it's quite possible lightning will become so popular so quickly that it may add significantly to the bitcoin traffic, not take away from it.

You are referring to the consequences of a deflationary collapse, but the bankers will never let that happen because it would completely kill the economy.  Even if you suppose the bankers might want to collapse the economy, a dollar would not have worth if it was hopelessly impossible to pay the debt that was used to create said dollar.  People will instead just default, and lose everything anyway.  Either way you are looking at a new economic paradigm that will have to replace the old one.  While that is happening I predict that QE will continue to happen to keep everything as normal as possible for as long as possible.  QE has nowhere ultimately to go except scarce resources, bitcoin being one of the most scarce I can think of, and perfectly suited to be used as money.

Exactly.  Once people start switching to lightning wallets for daily txn activity we might find that increasing the blocksize will be entirely unnecessary.   I'm not against 2x at some point, but we just need more time to give segwit a chance.
But the 2x thing is mostly about another hardfork to dilute bitcoin and try to take control.  2x can be done later in a softfork but when it is finally needed.

And I'm pretty sure 'they' did not predict or even anticipate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin back in 1988.

My understanding is that with segwit we'll see almost double the onchain txns/sec per existing 1MB block size, but now LN, tumblebit, sidechains, payment channels, etc. will be able to take that up an order of magnitude or so over the next year or so.  There are no exact numbers because it all depends on how many will use LN or other offchain solutions.  Onchain numbers will depend on actual avg txn size, which may be different now.
Visa is still ahead, but that can change with a few good lightning hubs.  We'll need the enabled wallets and people first, then there are bound to be a few bumps in the road as there are instances where LN can break if everyone tries to dispute/settle at the same time.  But those bridges can be crossed when we get to them.  Right now I just see blue sky.

According to the good folks at the main problem with segwit is that you can supposedly have coins stolen by miners should they chose to implement a 51% attack on lightning/segwit transactions.
I doubt this is true, but if a 51% attack is happening and you are spending lightning transactions, and if that person in turn spends those coins as well, the coins may never make it to its intended destinations.  Of course I believe the same is true with a 51% attack on the current network.  Still, I am reading through this thread of FUD to determine whether or not any of these concerns have merit.

Something these stories fail to mention is that the shortages (of food, etc.) are due to mispricing.  In other words food is not available at the local grocery because the price at which the store must list that item at  socialist price controls is too low.  If you have the funds, buying food on the black market at usual prices is easy.  Also, no one has the funds because they are all working for a broken socialist system.  If they got a job in the real economy (ie. internationally) they'd have plenty of money and an extremely low cost of living!  Until the revolution comes, Venezuelans need to either think outside the box (work/have clientele outside the country) or vote with their feet (leave the country).

It's been shown time &amp; again you cannot scale bitcoin by raising the blocksize limit and still keep it decentralized.
There's a coordinated effort to compromise and centralize bitcoin, and you are knowningly or unknowingly part of it.  Especially if you are arguing for a hardfork.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:32:10
Do you run a full node?  Do you want 2mb every 10 minutes, bandwidth and hard drive space, only to buy time on the scaling issue?  When bitcoin mainstreams we'll need something like 384mb blocks.  Only central nodes would be able to support that!  It's common sense.
I think we need another layer, with bitcoin acting as a decentralized settlement-like layer.  That's the only real solution.  Sure there are kinks to iron out when it arrives, but it's clearly the step we need forward.  Bitcoin as it is, even with 384mb blocks, will never be able to do micropayments or instantaneous transactions like an L2 solution can.
There **is** an effort going on right now to derail bitcoin right as segwit is about to come about.  From spam transactions to attacks on reddit.  It's so obvious and transparent.
@_date: 2016-12-01 04:32:37

The fee or making $20/month?
@_date: 2016-11-25 07:47:44
Even if 2MB is acceptable, and it probably is, it should not come about before segwit as a hardfork.  Hardforks are dangerous.  And there is no need for it once softfork infrastructure is in place.  Also, with L2 protocols such as lightning enabled by segwit, onchain traffic may very well take a cliff dive.  Or at least be diminished for a while.  We would need to live in that world for a while before being able to determine what the blocksize should be.  I think 1MB quite possibly may be enough even in a scenario where bitcoin takes over as the future world reserve currency.  If that's the case we'd be pretty stupid to have 2MB blocks going all that time.

You can estimate how long it'll take by checking  and calculating what fee you paid per byte in this chart.  Looks like you might be in trouble if you paid less than 100 satoshis per byte.  I haven't yet had a txn take longer than 3 days, but if it does it'll drop from the mempool and you'll have to reinitiate the transaction at a later date.  Your bitcoins should still be safe though.
Incidently, this scaling issue is the problem right now causing drama about segwit vs blocksize as the way forward to correct this.  I want instantaneous transactions one day, something impossible for BU to deliver, but segwit can.  Segwit can also deliver near-zero fee txns along with micropayments and a logarithmic scaling rather than just linear scaling.  Also will preserve the most important characteristic of bitcoin:  its decentralization.

Well the plain truth is, there aren't many cheaper ways to obtain bitcoin from USD, at least not that I'm aware of.  Perhaps if you are able to wire the funds you can get better rates somewhere, but then there's the wiring fees.
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:36:20
Another reason why we need another layer on top of bitcoin.  I want micropayments.  I want instantaneous transactions.  I want zero or near-zero fees.  Until then the problem of money isn't solved.  On the other hand there's segwit.

I've used Circle and Uphold, and although Circle has a slightly more expensive price premium, you get your coins  sooner.  I like Uphold, you pay less but you get the bitcoin in ~10 days instead of ~5.  You are going to pay a premium converting from USDs because simple fact is, the USD is less 'free' and less 'hard' than cold hard bitcoin.  You can always go from bitcoin to cash easily and quickly, but going from credit, bank transfer or even USD cash to bitcoin, it is harder because bitcoin is the 'harder' currency.  Transactions are irreversible and supply is less elastic.  It is proof the market values bitcoin over dollars.
Don't feel you've been ripped off.  You can always wait the 5 days or so and then convert the bitcoin back to dollars and get this premium back.  Circle will give you that higher rate going the other way too.  Also Bitcoin Magnet gives an even higher premium converting bitcoin-&gt;USD.

Could have to do with the achievement of consensus in China.

A while back Goldman Sachs called a temporary peak at $4827 before falling down to ~$2200.  Before GS's call, my own speculation was it could either peak at ~$4700, $9k, or $14k.  Regardless if it goes up to $9k from here there'll have to be a fake-out first.  So GS's prediction was certainly credible in my mind.  I sold 20% at the $4800 level just to feel better if it ended up being a peak.  But otherwise I'm a HODLer and will be buying back more at these levels or (hopefully) lower.  I surprised even myself lately when I started caring more about accumulating BTC than about what the price is in USD.  USD is no longer money in my mind anymore than the Mexican peso is.

Very good writeup.
Everyone seems to forget about one of the most important characteristics of bitcoin as money:  it cannot be frozen or confiscated (if properly handled).  I cannot think of any other asset class that has this characteristic, so why would anyone trust anything else?
Also, the implications of not being able to be counterfeited is huge.

I feared the BCH fork when it happened, not knowing what to expect.  But it turned into a good payday for me when I ultimately sold my BCH at a favorable time.  I still fear future forks though because a fork without replay protection can certainly be chaotic.  If people lose their money bitcoin will suffer, like when MtGox fell.  Forking may not always be a profitable event.

Satoshi said that a larger blocksize "can be phased in".  So what?
He's not saying this with respect to any context, let alone scaling worldwide.  How big should the blocksize be to scale to today's worldwide commerce in txns/sec?  Like 380MB every 10 minutes?
Please please please get over the 2MB blocksize trojan idea because that would have never permanently worked and could have ruined bitcoin.  What we have going on today (segwit + lightning) will be SO much more effective.  And a good blocksize can be more accurately computed once we have *real* scaling solutions in play.

Take Circle's sell rate per bitcoin vs mexbt's peso rate per bitcoin and you will come out slightly ahead of the exchange rate, that's all I meant.  Because of this, I think there's a slight chance Circle may close your account if you pump too much through them because they might be losing money on you (their rate is higher than market).   If that happens just use another exchange.  Since you are using the American account to just pay off credit cards I doubt there will be a problem there.
If you are in Mexico, I notice that 'casas de cambio' sometimes have a below-market rate on the dollar.  In other words it's sometimes cheaper buying cash dollars at the border than even the most perfect bank exchange rate.  How this happens I do not know.

Bitcoin is better than gold/silver in so many ways though.  It's harder to confiscate.  Easier to secure.

A fork in the bitcoin network cannot happen unless 1) hashing power follows that fork, or 2) POW is reworked.  This is because bitcoin is the longest chain.  So a "fork" may happen but will either not be bitcoin or quickly lose its place as the longest chain.  The problem is Jihan pulls a lot of hashing power, so this could still be an issue.  The question is, would it be an event that can be safely ignored?

It'll never get to 100% or even 50% I can assure you.

or...  you may find yourself quickly priced out of the market once we have segwit and bitcoin once again becomes the defacto standard for crypto payments.  The masses will come onboard when instantaneous near-zero fee payments become easy.  And it's already supported everywhere.
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:36:52
Yes.  You should move your coins off coinbase, and that has always been the case.  What's going on now is segwit being activated which is a huge upgrade.  There's a lot of drama and FUD but can mostly be ignored because it's already in-the-bag.  Some people are fearful of a split which like a very small chance of happening, but even if it does happen I'm pretty sure one chain will quickly become irrelevant and you could spend your coins on either chain, unless Coinbase doesn't support the chain you'd rather, that's why people are saying get your coins off the exchanges now.  I used to be worried too, but now I realize this is really not that big of a deal as the 'chiefs' are making it sound like.

A blocksize increase could be done in a soft fork.
But let's be careful.  I run a full node, and every ~10 minutes I'm going to download X MB blocks to keep up with a blockchain that's not suited for coffee-purchasing txns or micropayments.  Bitcoin is suited to be the settlement layer for something else.  It is quite possible we won't need a blocksize increase, although likely we will.  But I'd like to be comfortable with a size that I know is a necessary size.  We won't really know this until after some practice with the txn layer that everyone evolves into using.  If it takes too long to get there, I can see a blocksize increase in the meantime if there's consensus.  But we have other things, like segwit, buying that time right now without the need for a blocksize increase (and this is good for node runners).

I've been so looking forward to this technology being incorporated in governments.  Whoever is the first govt to do this will become, almost overnight, the most competitive economy in the world.  It will shine as an example for all other govts to function.
Govts, for example in Latin America but even in the U.S., are so wasteful I'd imagine it's something like 90+% of resources are wasted.  If these resources were suddenly available you'd see infrastructure, public services, etc. skyrocket in a place and will quickly be the place for everyone to emultate or move to.  All govts will *have* to follow just to continue being in the game.  We have all this to look forward to in the not-too-distant future!

No.  But let's give it some time.  No hard fork either, we'll use CSV for a soft fork (only recently became an option).  And let's wait and see what the network looks like after lightning, thunder, sidechains, and any other scaling solution that people want to try out.  At some point, it'll be clearer what to do, and what to change the blocksize to.
But a hard fork for an immediate blocksize increase would have been the wrong thing to do.  We know that because the bitcoin world didn't come to an end while we were waiting for CSV.

Worth acknowledging and looking at what could be the technical solutions before implementing lightning, so we can solve this another day.  The only problem I see is transactions tied up on the blockchain ('in court') for days, still better than current dispute management.
In the case of a channel timing out before the dispute can be made, this seems like a rather minor technical problem to be solved.  Dispute transactions could be given priority or adjustable sized blocks, or perhaps offchain dispute resolution.

But I needed cash so I liquidate a bitcoin I already had, but the bank servicing the exchange didn't get the order before the cutoff on Thursday so I'm cashless until Monday/Tuesday.  For that, I pay a hefty fee as well.  All the fees I've been paying, save the ten-cent bitcoin fee, have been to banks.  For that I am privileged to put up with this mess &amp; problems.

The idea that 2mb leads to centralization is because it leads to 4mb, then 8mb, etc. until something like 384mb block sizes.  Try running a node on your PC with 384mb downloading every 10 minutes!  Storage would be a problem too.  So that would imply nodes will be mostly in data centers and this bitcoin thing won't be grassroots anymore.
But I don't see a huge problem with 2mb block sizes, only that it might not be necessary for a good long while with segwit.  Also we must be careful with hardforks and who controls what. I have no doubt that corporate interests want to take over bitcoin, and I have no doubt that there are people who are trying to kill bitcoin as well.

This "financial crisis" will be a paradigm-shift away from fiat debt-based currencies to whatever system replaces it.

Anyone's guess as to when, but you can only go on driving a car for so long with a tire going flat before you have to pull over.
When the 'crisis' happens and shortages become apparent, it is really just a bridge time period between one systen and the next,  I for one hope it goes as smoothly and controlled as possible. Ideally, it would mean no one ever feels an actual 'crisis', but people will realize they do things differently than they did before.

They are not of course, they are centralized.  Might as well invest in Ripple.  Plus it seems they engineer ETH pricing to maximize investor funding.

The financial collapse needs to wait just a little bit longer until SegWit  has matured and activates, and lightning-enabled wallets with human-readable addressing become available.  I'd give this at least another year.

Singapore to Germany?  Try including a Latin American country in your loop and recalculate... $100+ easily.  And yes, delays, fund-freezing, and banking rules are always a real and lurking.
Still, these fees are not acceptable nor necessary.

The more money you have, the less empathy you have with others.  A "don't care" attitude.  This is a character flaw that you should try to overcome with or without money.

If I had $200k on the sidelines, I'd want an issue to cause the lowest price I could get.  If all it takes is one company to cause massive price decline, not a good sign.  It used to be that way, but I don't think it is anymore.

One question I've always had about the Trezor is, how is the private key stored exactly?  If it's in NAND memory won't it eventually entropy away like files on a USB drive after 10 years?  Or is it etched/burned into it somehow?  And if it is, how can it be secure from being physically opened and read?

Think about the things that matter the most to a Libertarian.  That no one else can freeze/seize your funds, including govt, is important but not listed here.  Also no one can arbitrarily inflate the money supply and it's always possible to know what that money supply is.  In 1929 people might have wished to know the money supply contracted before they continued holding onto their stocks.

I'm just saying in 5 years time bitcoin will be worth somewhere **between** zero and the_moon.  It'll never be zero because we pretty much know by now it's secure and we can see a bazillion orders in to buy bitcoin at $0.01.  The scarcity prevents it.  So it'll always be worth *something*.  And yeah it's already worth a lot, and as long as there are other forms of money out there it can always be worth more.

I suspect we'll see $10-14k before this bull run is over.  Emotionally prepare yourself because you may feel like buying back in after watching it continue to rise for so long, and THEN that'd be the wrong move.

It doesn't take that long.  I've got bits that go missing all the time on my car's USB stick that store my MP3s.  All I'm saying is it should be over-engineered to last at least 10 years.

About how long did it take?  I'm worried about being without cash and not being able to get cash for bitcoin for significant lengths of time while services are down.

For micropayments, even a 5 cent fee per txn might be unacceptable, depending on the circumstance.  For coffee purchases, a 10 minute confirmation time is generally unacceptable.  And of course the scalability problem, which cannot be solved by blocksize.  The answer is of course another payment-channel like layer, such as lightning, which solves all of these problems.  But it cannot work without a settlement layer such as the bitcoin blockchain remaining decentralized.


We just don't know that yet.  And more importantly we don't know what the new size should be set to without knowing 1) which architecture becomes the most widely adopted payment layer, and 2) if for example it is Lightning, how often in practice disputes or whatever will require blockchain interaction.

I would much rather see evolution and bug fixing happen in soft-forks than hard forks.

@_date: 2016-07-07 18:47:37
Why would someone short unless they knew something?  Maybe there's a fatal flaw in lightning that hasn't been considered yet?
Or maybe it's just people being stupid and think this market will look like other markets priced in USD, when BTC is finite and USD is infinite.  If we can be certain there is nothing to be known, we can almost be certain that there will be another super short squeeze in the near future.
