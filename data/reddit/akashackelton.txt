Thank you, I was just talking about this to someone else. It's a bubble, no other way to put it; however, it depends on what part of the bubble we are in, likely the early part.

Markets, all markets, tend to develop bubbles, because all markets involve some degree of speculation. If you want some good historical context read about Dutch Tulip Mania. Additionally, just because there is a price surge that is corresponding to news coverage (but oddly not volume of trading), doesn't mean the bubble will burst imminently. So my advice is don't freak out... We'll know over the course of the next week or so. In either case, don't buy hardware for mining unless it's ASIC (source: I'm a complete new at this, but had a little background in econ).

Gotcha, thank you. It's just driving me crazy that the ability of transactions to be processed is a such a major roadblock to the stability of the currency.

I know there are many many pluggins for torrent clients, like speedtest, glasnost, etc. If you have the time, would you mind explaining this more?

He's the largest name in political polling. In the last year, he basically embarrassed every polling  company in America. It was fucking awesome.

No I don't, and to my knowledge there are very few in existence at this point. Avalon-Asic has started shipping, but is no longer taking orders (no idea when they will start again). Butterfly has been taking orders for months, but has not shipped a single unit (as far as I know). I'm not aware of any other ASIC miners that are available to consumers.
My guess is that if these things are as efficient as they appear, everyone who mines will have to upgrade their equipment. The problem is that when everyone does this the difficulty will increase. So basically, if you are an early adopter you win, if you aren't you lose.

Maybe it's my paranoia, but I don't like keeping my wallet open if I'm not using it.

Have you been living in a cave in afghanistan? How do you not know who he is?
