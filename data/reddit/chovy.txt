@_date: 2019-07-31 04:13:51
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:40:46
This was back when it was $19k and my wallet didn’t tell the fee in usd.
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:02:57
Almost definite.
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:21:19
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:11:29
I like hotbit.io. They have a pwa. But rumor has it they fake their volume.
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:20:29
Don’t leave you coins on an exchange. And there’s nothing they can do but ban the fiat on ramps.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:51:06
I loaded up at $4
@_date: 2019-07-23 02:04:42
Don’t use banks lol
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:04:57
Exactly why I don’t claim my bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:26:18
I sent $1000 and it cost me $384. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:42:54
Very likely.
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:59:55
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:59:34
It was Jaxx
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:04:03
What’s bitcoin ? /s
I get paid directly by my customers in bitcoin. There is no kyc involved. If you buy and sell on Coinbase you bet your ass they will come after you.
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:31:46
If I had 19M I would cash out just enough to live on. 2500/week
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:52:33
Find someone to trade with you in person. Go to a local bitcoin meetup
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:56:10
Lol. What kind of stupid ass question is this?
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:25:03
Until tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:56:05
Shit just got real.
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:37:37
Oh. They all got stolen over a year ago anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:23:41
This is how you overthrow the government now.
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:50:25
Hmmmm. This guy must have been careless. If you go from Silk Road wallet directly to exchange your going to get busted.  He should have swapped them out little by little into some shitcoin first then converted back to ltc then back to btc then try to cash out in person with a reputable buyer. Idiot probably tried to use Coinbase or some other kyc compliant shithole.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:57:37
Nope. 38.4% fee lol

@_date: 2014-02-13 10:04:03
Thanks. I can now go back to panic buying. :)
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:36:52
wtf it goes from right/to/left depending on who's talking.

I know. crazy right? friend of mine bought some DOGE hoping it would hit $1000 one day. I just shook my head.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:54:54
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:44:15
Yes. actions mean more than words.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:39:36
google the title.
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:45:44
right. i should say "the link pointed to blockchain.info"
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:41:13
i saw just buy a few good domains like its 1994 and sit on them for 10 years.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:53:39
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:06:39
then don't put a card on file and just wait the 4 days. You get the price you were quoted when you buy it. Are you looking for a fast turn around for some reason?
@_date: 2014-01-04 21:41:08
What evidence do you have that $80 million has been stolen from BitPay customers?
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:08:34
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:26:20
It doesn't really matter what language you use. If I were to build one I'd use node.js. A few years ago I would have chosen PHP.
There's so much FUD around "PHP sucks" -- mostly from people who don't use it.

@_date: 2014-08-03 14:41:46
nice try tax man.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:53:11
seems like maybe they had some downtime? Look at volume:
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:04:04
So the way Aaron explained it to me was that BreadWallet was the only real bitcoin wallet on iPhone. All the other "wallets" are just thin clients for an API, the wallet is usually on a web server, not on the iPhone....the case with BreadWallet is the wallet and keys are stored on the iPhone. He isn't storing the blockchain on the iPhone I don't think just syncing (like multibit and electrum do).
I thought that was cool. Also, you can read through his code as its on github.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:47:16


@_date: 2014-11-28 06:45:23
most people don't want bitcoin, they want dollars. so they sell the bitcoin immediately after receiving it putting downward pressure on the price.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:40:08
sounds good. let me know how it works.
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:41:06
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:30:59
Yeah. I work on it in my spare time.
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:39:32
haha. good question.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:55:53
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:36:08

To the moon.
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:21:25
it is sorted, but based on my own priority field.
If you think there is an exchange that should be listed higher let me know. I try to base the priority on both volume and quality of exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:46:10
maybe that was their plan all along. release open source money, let population adopt it, take it back with super computer.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:04:38
Bitcoin can be an investment. Short or long. There's no denying that.
@_date: 2014-01-04 21:57:53
your full of it bro. stop spreading rumors. besides, that blockchain address has about 120k in it. not 80 million.
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:55:25
stop using windows for the love of god.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:50:53
or a regulator.
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:37:41
3 years ago. That was like 500 bucks wasn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-11 05:39:33
how did you generate the data for the chart?
I run  and find this sort of thing rather interesting. Maybe we can cross link when you have more to see there.
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:51:59
For what its worth I met the guy at a coffee shop who is developing Bread Wallet. He is not hiding his real name as you can see on his github account. Seems like a standup guy, but don't take my word for it. The only problem I have with these iPhone apps is you can't compile from source yourself. You have to trust the developer is not taking the open source version, then adding some nefarious code, and uploading to AppStore. Although as someone who is not hiding their identity I would suspect this would be a very bad way to be a criminal.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:24:22
if one guy has a super computer and the rest are mining in asic, what does that mean? Wouldn't it be easy to gain 51%?
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:03:39
didn't read the wall of text, but so true.
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:46:19
yeah. cause that's convenient.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:25:56
Because Satoshi obviously doesnt' believe in bailouts ya numknuts. :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:37:05
yeah. probably not downtime then. i don't know.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:22:33
heh. i was just joking.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:39:08
bitcoin is toast.

I won't take this personally, given your past:
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:04:56
tbh i could not figure out how to install bitcoin-qt. it just fires up my cpu fan after about 2 minutes (mac). So I gave up and went with electrum.
@_date: 2014-06-29 06:14:27
You make no sense.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:57:35
i don't know, but my understanding is holding 51% control of something basically means you have root access.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:22:01
i was half joking. but you're right. Open source is not something you can control.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:48:20
You obviously pose a clear and present danger if the DoD hijacked your phone.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:34:51

I usually start out by saying "Its unclear how it will be taxed, or even if it can be taxed...".
That usually grabs their attention. Then depending on how old (i have a 100 year old uncle), I say its like "email for money".

@_date: 2014-01-01 03:46:33
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:40:07
i'm in agreement with ya there.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:38:35
I had to reset my PIN once.
@_date: 2014-08-26 05:04:37
He does. even scarier.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:01:05
that's just crazy talk.

@_date: 2014-01-13 03:47:48
How do I know you're not going to abuse my API keys?
@_date: 2014-11-08 03:40:58
i would really prefer it if these Silk Road popups used semver.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:35:40
Checkout  -- I sent you an email just now as well.
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:54:45
Oh, hey charles. thanks again. Still having difficulties with bitcoin-qt. I decided to use electrum for now.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:33:53
can you add  
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:50:12
Better check your laws buddy, i'm sure you'll be breaking a few.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:25:13
Quit you're crying there are many uses of Bitcoin. Day trading is one of them.
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:18:21
I just got an email from blockchain.info about a blockchain.info wallet that says .00000001 BTC transaction failed.
I thought they were supposedly immune to this?
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:13:53
When it comes to open source....always go straight to the horses mouth:
@_date: 2014-08-26 05:03:32
use electrum or multibit
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:33:15
Bitcoin payment option is disabled for me. But beyond that it looks good.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:47:38

which gateway?
@_date: 2019-11-03 03:20:45
How difficult was it to integrate you store with your bitcoin gateway? I host a bitcoin gateway and am thinking of charging people a nominal fee to use it.
@_date: 2019-11-16 13:32:37

@_date: 2019-11-12 14:59:12
Well I can see you’re just reselling otherwise you wouldn’t have a bandwidth cap. So I’d rather go straight to your provider.
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:03:50
I agree. I’ve been cashing out lately. Before it tanks.

@_date: 2019-08-14 17:04:27
That’s easy. Just restore using the seed phrase you backed up.

I would if I could but I don't think you can recover it unless its a centralized wallet.

@_date: 2019-08-13 06:38:31
No i just used electrum.

Oh. First time for me
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:53:02
you can try at a local meetup. but don't expect someone to give you 20k cash.
@_date: 2019-08-01 05:40:59
HODL. The strategy is always HODL.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:40:17
Yes, it will be 7k tomorrow.

@_date: 2019-08-12 15:15:23
Yes yes no yes.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:53:16
So that was all bullshit?
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:32:35
I know. I was just kidding. It just reminds me of how this will likely lbe an interview question for a frontend developer.

its alright. It only cost me like $4k. I learned a valuable lesson. Cash out. lol
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:44:31
Sure just restore from the seedphrase paper hardcopy you made when you setup your wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:35:36
haha. someone memed my post

eventually you will when you decide to spend it or cash out.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:49:54
why did you not backup your seedphrase?

It only cost me about $4k. But yeah. Lol. I was going to cash out on the deepwebs and live off the grid for a few years.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:11:35
Me too.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:53:04
I'm not sure. I just stopped using them actually because they started requiing KYC. but for a business they were the easiest to implement with my api.

then 5k
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:14:32
i just saw it on r/news -- it has to be fake. It's a press release which anyone can write and publicize.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:51:39
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:55:16
Yes. Spending your money is a short term gain so you’ll pay about 55% taxes. Lol

i got hacked and lost $600k worth of bitocin
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:14:56
@_date: 2019-10-10 01:06:27
Haha. It’s funny how we seek approval of the very system we are trying to overthrow.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:54:01
what wallet did you use?
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:51:12
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:04:23
Still not that much. People have lost millions because they didn’t secure their wallet. I lost $600k
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:55:49
Tomorrow China ban bitcoin!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:22:35
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:47:02
Yes you did. You were told to make a copy when you created the wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:40:18
I don’t get what sats is.

Nimiq is goi g to solve all this nonsense.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:34:54

Nobody in real life is talking abut it.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:45:51

I just moved all my funds off binance yesterday. Looks like I dodged a Bullet.

Just one fiat?
@_date: 2019-10-12 04:19:38
I’ve been on this sub since bitcojnwas $4. You can’t take anfucking joke with adomain site and news site called   You got anger issues brother.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:13:54
I don’t know. I just sold so maybe that’s why. Jk

Too volatile.  But basically just our military is preventing it.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:32:37
About $600k worth.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:48:16
No. I got hacked and lost all my btc.
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:10:18
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:06:48
I don’t know the details. It was years ago.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:35:35
Here we go.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:54:41
Wallet I used didn’t allow for that. It just had a high low and reckmmmded setting. I had it set to low and it was still 384.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:36:56
All tome high noon is 12k
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:44:00
Did you find that photo online? It looks identical to one I took a few months ago.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:23:50
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:17:07
I don’t even own any btc
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:19:48
A hundred bazillion.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:10:10
They deserve a good ass fucking.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:25:38
I left my seedphrase on a file server that got hacked.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:13:22
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:28:15
I don’t get it.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:46:37
Damn it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:20:08
They require KYC now
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:18:17
Yeah. I bought at $4. Got stolen at $20k
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:25:23
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:21:23
Almost there.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:05:17
It got stolen.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:24:29
What is it?
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:46:29
yup basically. we took out all 8 countries without a central bank in the last 20 years with the exception of NK and Iran.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:25:38
Indeed it does
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:53:41
Maybe maybe not.

Same A’s anything else proprietary. Will be decent but not A’s good A’s open source.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:45:09
Exodus and jaxx.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:56:30
It’s not scalable. I paid a $324 fee to move $1000 when it was hitting the ATH.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:56:43
I don’t have that wallet anymore.
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:06:08
at what point is he being asked to provide KYC? I agrree that's bullshit. but I understand exodus handing him off to the exchange support team.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:36:11
Yeah. It sucks when fees are high.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:54:58
What happened in 2014?  I was here since it was $4
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:04:05
There’s a payroll service that will let your employees get paid in bitcoin. I forget the name of it but you’d have to convince your employer to signup for it.
@_date: 2019-12-11 03:27:48
Well now we definitely can’t afford Medicare for all. /s
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:42:33
To confuse me?
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:58:08
just use coinbase then and pay from there, but yeah you'll need to adjust for fluxations. Bitcoin is basically forex.
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:26:56
you literally have to highlight the address and amount yourself. lol
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:54:04
 All them in the morning. Did you file a ticket?
@_date: 2019-12-30 07:48:10
has to be custodial so it'll probably get shutdown or hacked sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:16:47
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:24:10
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:31:44
i read it again I still don't see the letters KYC anywhere in OPs post.
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:32:12
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:47:23
I think its no KYC to trade. but hey if you need to reverse a trade. lol
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:46:52
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:43:37
Is this real?
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:31:33
I paid $324 to move $1000. Back when it was hitting the ath
@_date: 2019-12-31 02:57:51
Too late buccarroos
@_date: 2019-12-28 13:36:14
Delete this newbie trash. Exodus isn't a scam anymore than your CPU is.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:39:57
did you file KYC?
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:36:55
It going to noon.
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:39:27
I use a light wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:36:41
Does anyone know why bitcoin crashed?
@_date: 2019-12-09 01:57:08
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:22:55
its fucking difficult to do on a mobile device.

i don't get it.
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:25:01
I clicked on the tweet. does that make me gay?
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:20:00
so he got the ban hammer for having a new account and yelling outo "SCAM" and he comes here and does it and you agree with him?
@_date: 2019-12-28 13:54:08
OP isn't being asked to provide KYC by Exodus. Exodus is simply telling them to talk to the exchange support team.
@_date: 2019-12-28 16:56:23
OP says its a scam. I don't think its a scam. He claimed his transaction failed and lost his money. If anyone is scamming here its probably OP. Of course they will ask for KYC.
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:30:07

nope. i got out of gox as soon as it started failing about 2 weeks before it closed.

@_date: 2019-12-28 14:56:14
well like you said. hasn't been updated in 3 months. it didn't work 10 years ago and it don't work now. why do you need a full node? I run a full node on my server but that's because i have a bitcoin payment gateway setup.

when you deposit money into a bank do you only deposit the exact amount for the item you'll be buying?

what is CME?
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:03:38
Because it doesn’t scale and it’s actually a terrible currency.
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:26:07
I'm still waiting for it to hit $4 so I can buy some more.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:42:44
A normal day.
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:50:36
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:46:34
It’ll hit $6500 soon.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:08:58
Those are explained by the Mariana Trench pattern
@_date: 2019-09-13 02:10:16
Except they can’t ban it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:00:54
If it hits $6 it’ll hit $4

I hope it happens one day soon. I’m moving to rural California because I can buy three houses for the cost of one in the Bay Area.

It's a start.

What app is he using where it doesn’t go to sleep after 20 seconds?
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:39:07
Reminds me of the guy on youtube who was asking people if they would rather have a gold coin (worth $1400) or $10. Everytime they took the $10.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:18:12
Coming soon to a wallet near you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:14:16
they are basically just discussing if we're all going to be considered terrorists or not.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:58:02
where do you get this image?
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:10:28
Both would be huge. But seeing as how Newegg runs on Windows architecture I'm guessing they will be the last to know.

yes. I even used a curse word.

in reality, i don't get service at mcdonalds. I swipe a card and am told a number.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:40:58
Exactly. Paywalls are a legitimate business model and aren't going away anytime soon. I'd rather click a button to get access then have to register and enter credit card.
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:58:37
I disabled it in iOS but it’s a distraction now while driving.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:30:24
google authenticator also had a bug that allowed people to empty your wallet. I don't trust 'em. never will.
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:13:15
lol check your network settings dude.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:29:59
Reddit can't be the only place to promote a bitcoin site.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:39:02
This is the best idea I've heard on this forum.
If casinos are legal, why not Bitcoin exchanges?
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:02:55
This is so old.
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:52:26
you are way too heavily invested in bitcoin to be having night terrors about it crashing. Pull out now while you still can.
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:54:58
I just built this little bookmarklet that lets you draw lines directly on the popular Bitcoin charts. No more screenshots and editing with Photoshop.
Feedback welcome...
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:52:07
Thanks...for some reason when I request it I get an error page although it loads fine in the browser.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:15:23
that's fine. got a link?
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:01:24


now its just a 'crazy crazy experiment'
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:29:54
who supports authy besides coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:42:28
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:24:20
it waits for 6 confirmations should be about 10 mins.
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:32:44
we all go there from time to time.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:55:33
That's a pretty big one. You can buy almost anything on Overstock. Its not Amazon, but pretty damn close.
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:12:02
Take a look at TradeList -- 
You can track your open positions in realtime.

I thought Indian Casinos were supposed to pull them out of poverty. I guess that didn't happen.
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:42:12
use a web wallet like strongcoin.com or cryptsy.com
sure they can get hacked, but you can also fuck up as well.

how come eTrade doesn't have an audit button?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:31:49
you would be right if the US government takes control of the Bitcoin development process.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:21:07
Please provide some feedback as I'm developing this app continuously and would like to gauge interest.
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:22:31
at this point you can only track one in realtime, you can open multiple tabs though. I'm working on adding the ability to save and track. But I can't say a definitive date yet.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:53:15
I doubt it.

Looks like US may redeem itself on Bitcoin compared to China and India.
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:30:13
is the bitcoin converted to whatever the exchange rate is for 2-300/week USD?
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:28:53
anyone else here think maybe Ron Paul should probably keep his mouth shut? The establishment hates this guy.

Right. if he wants to mine Bitcoin then yes, GPUs is useless. But he can mine any number of altcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:59:52
Does bitfinex support that? I know they do margin trading and shorts.

11 million, around $650-800 USD depending on the exchange.
There's no way to know how many lost coins there are.

that's not good.

You didn't use your bitcointalk.org password on btc-e did you? They got hacked (twice) recently.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:30:25
Hmm...it works fine for me on Chrome 26 on a mac. What version are you running? (bitcoinity.org is down at the moment, have you tried on clarkmoody?)
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:50:22
sure. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:44:26
Its starting to happen. Bloomberg conducting phone surveys about Bitcoin?! What will happen in the next year.
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:50:45
Whats the rate?
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:45:47
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:34:36
ok shamu.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:06:01
perhaps....but its open source and i doubt the US government would develop anything as open source. (ie: diebold voting machines).

You can pick a currency pair, for example BTC/USD at MtGox, and then enter an entry and exit point and see what your profit margin is.
If you check the "[x] follow last price"  box, it will update your profit/loss in realtime. This is handy if you made a buy, but not a sell yet, and want to track an active trade.

This is great but I'd like to see other crypto currency icons as well.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:27:11

switch to a credit union. corporate banks are the reason we have Bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:52:27
all the naysayers will be left in the dust. hop on board -- crazy train is departing in 3-2-1
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:00:10
Is that the only feed they provide? I'm looking for last trade price. Also is this documented anywhere?
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:29:32
I deleted my Bitcoin alert and setup altcoin alerts.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:39:06
Use multibit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:28:59
its closer than you think. unless you're 90
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:55:39
This is nothing new. Just a re-affirmation of what was already stated back on 11/22/2013.


@_date: 2013-12-14 08:31:18
i recommend you use lastpass and be done with passwords forever.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:33:54
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:31:38
how so? Maybe for bitcoin, but not scrypt based crypto currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:52:51
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:17:35
totally. where's tothemoonguy when you need him?
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:56:10
their api is misconfigured. i worked around it.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:35:42
i don't trust 2 factor auth. you loose your device, then what? 
@_date: 2013-05-02 08:26:03
nice work. i agree the color scheme should be dark.
I added it to ChartDraw nonetheless: 
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:53:42
I added a text tool as well.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:22:55
yeah. bitcoin is still pretty much a joke to the rest of the world.
