90% tethered. 
I dont like current market sentiment, everyone on YT is predicting bull market since February, institutional money is just abt to get in, etc trying to create fomo and then Goldman pulls out..now everyone is like Goldman is nothing..too many alts destroyed market
General population lost interest after epic crash

Most of them are finished, no use cases, its value is based on hype.
There is just no reason for their existence, money grab  at best.

Uncle Sam will sell you anything  for money. Tanks are obsolete, you can impress PKK rebels or smaller army but try to go to war with Russia or Israel  and your  tanks  will become coffins.

Venezuela  has land, oil that acts as collateral, same as when you cant pay off car loan or house they come take your belongings.
Default is not end of the world, Germany and Russia defaulted and now they are ok.

This is bad for crypto

This was short squeeze, many shorted btc and now they will be forced to buy back.
Think it will go back to 8, maybe 9 but it will crashing under 7

How is Bitcoin solve their problem when you cant spend it for small purchases? Its not  suitable for everyday transactions and if Venezuela adopted Bitcoin price would skyrocket and then it becomes completely unusable.

Price of stock doesnt need to go up, you have dividends payouts twice a year.
More regulation, you cant just buy white paper  and get listed on NYSE, you do own piece of company, voting rights.
By buying btc you are basically betting that in the future some sucker will buy it  from you at higher price.
It is shit as payment method and sucks as store of value due to volatility, they only use is speculation
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:37:32
Doesnt work that well if you bought this year at 15-20k, you could be under water for a while. Holding worked in the past but past performance isnt reliable predictor of future gains

You dont mess with Uncle Sam

Its backed by debt, promise to pay back and promise is backed by some kind of security such as house, car.

Where is Binance and Bitmex on the graph
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:09:13
You comparing real companies that employ people, have products, services, contracts, partnerships etc to bitcoin that can be forked millions of times? 
How many bitcoin flavours we have so far? Every new bitcoin forked takes away value of existing bitcoins such as btc,bch, btg ...
Now they say btcp, bitcoin private will skyrocket according to McAffee.  
Then you have other superior  cryptoscurrencies that are instant and cheap to transact.

Every single currency sucks as payment method due to inherent  instability
A few months back youtuber David Hay wanted to help Venezuela mass adopt crypto since local currency is losing value fast, inflation is through the roof, he though Nano will solve their misery. 
How stupid you have to be to think replacing unstable currency with even more unstable one is going to solve the problem? Nano is fastest crypto and its very cheap l,since he started Venezuela campaign price has gone from $15 to $2..90% loss.
In situations of hyperinflation country need something strong like USD or gold, silver.
Same applies to bitcoin, it cant be used as payment as its too expensive and slow. It also fails as a "store of value" as its proven to be extremely volatile.

What about insurance, you lose your key, somebody gets your private key and bitcoin is gone forever
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:08:20
Bitcoin is currency like usd, euro..its stupid to talk about market cap. Nobody talks about market cap of euro or peso
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:40:01
Dead cat keeps bouncing..btc goes to 5k
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:14:59
Except it sucks as a 'store of value', 80% loss in 6 months.
How about collectors item?

Why make life more complicated, buy with your master card and avoid all headaches.
There are some things money can't buy, for everything else there is master card:)

Lambos bruh

When you deposit usd on bitfinex you get usdt because  you cant trade usd on exchange. No point for them to print more unless you think they are printing and buying crypto themselves? Any evidence of this
People love conspiracy theories, things wont change even when every exchange starts using real fiat. They could still take money from people accounts and buy crypto for themselves

1% fee with mastercard.
 $100 for every $10 000

That's why its unusable as money, why would you spend it today if you think 2mrw it will be worth more ?  Why would merchant accept it if it can go down?
How would you feel if you bought a car with 4 btc and next week btc jumps to 15k ? If you waited it would cost you half that
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:36:34
Its funny how people think 6.5k is cheap and btc can only go up from here, Youtubers predicting bullmarket since February, giving shit advice to buy the dip for the past 5 months or so.  Bitcoin can easily go to 2-3k
After almost a decade in existence almost nobody uses it as a currency, whats value of bitcoin? Store of value...its bleeding value on a daily basis, people might just wake up and start dumping
Demand is  no there, all people I know stopped putting new money in since January crash,  so we end up having more people who are selling

Too much risk involved  for ordinary people to hold their own private keys on a piece of paper or hardware.
Its so much harder to use compared to swiping credit card.

ETF approval is our only saviour at this point in time, if its rejected by SEC then bear will continue.
It will mean no institutional money will go into the market for some time. 
Why wouldn't they approve ETFs, SEC gave green light to Bitcoin futures 
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:00:18
The world doesnt really need bitcoin, so many other ways to make transactions which are faster , cheaper and easier to use than BTC. 
The only reason why people hold bitcoin is because of speculation and  potential to make more FIAT when price increases. Would anyone care about BTC if it was a stable coin like AUD or Swiss Franc where goes up or down 2-5% a year?
'here for the tech' crowd are delusional and greedy bunch.
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:20:17
Not if you bought it at 15 or 20k. 
There is no way of knowing it will ever hit that again,
Things changed a lot, we saw Bitcoin cant scale, its expensive to tx,  slow, unable to make small purchases..and its proven to very bad store of value, 70% loss in 6 months isnt going to convince average Joe to invest.
November/December bull run exposed all Bitcoin's weaknesses, so i would say things did change a bit. 
bitcoin is much worse than what's currently available and it had 9 years to prove itself.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:59:30
Wolf of WS is right, nobody buys bitcoin to use it as money, buy coffee, beer, etc,  people buy it because they think it will moon so they can  dump on some other fool and buy lambo
