I can find one match for this in your binary only, can you point me to where I can find more instances of say, address UTXO lookups happening? There's only one visible function that does this, and it is hard coded to use Blockchain. 
        static {
            blockExplorers = new CharSequence[]{"Blocktrail", "Blockchain", "Blockr.io", "BlockCypher", "Blockexplorer.com", "SoChain"};
            blockExplorerUrls = new CharSequence[]{" " " " " "
            instance = null;
        }

It's not as ideal as that, decompiling java works surprisingly well but it does have some shortcomings. In this system it would be possible to fool a person into thinking that they have identical binaries even if they did not, the applications designed to do this are more art than science it seems. Different versions or forks give wildly different output.

Even if Blockchain doesn't want to give it up, Cloudflare has all the data in plaintext anyway.

That is literally what they are doing with the Blockchain Alliance. The group was created due to the companies involved getting annoyed with the amount of legal requests they have to rubber stamp. Internally the plan is to make a portal available for law enforcement to access their data at will without a warrant to bypass all of that pesky paperwork.

Calling what you have released privacy conscious is not acceptable.  


Chain.so is only linked to as a block explorer you can open a link in.


Addresses are still linked together, even if not to a specific identity.

I have your published APK, that's what I am quoting from. You can't claim that your application uses a feature which the "public alpha", the only version a user can possibly be exposed to, doesn't have it. My statement is correct, Samourai Wallet does not use any API endpoint other than Blockchain.

Ignore the first few stupid questions. A Bitfinex representative details exactly what they are doing, and their justifications, and why they are pushing for the alliance to exist. They are asked frankly what privacy they are leaving for their customers.
