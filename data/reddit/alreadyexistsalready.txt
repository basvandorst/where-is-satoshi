More details please!!! What did you envision? Share your insight!
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:43:04
now that i think about it... it is.

Can one of you refer me to some reading to understand why not spending from an address keeps it quantum safe? I am assuming it has something to do with unspent addresses having no hash key to break. but trying to get into cryptography here and would like some deeper reading to catch me up on threads like these. Thanks in advance

Come on Gooch! I need an answer! Where do I go for the REAL NEWS!~?~?~
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:21:34
Can you point me to a better source of real news than the NYTimes please and thank you, good sir!?
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:19:02
lol there ya go. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:03:23
yeah but we still have to wait for people like you who realize this to think you've finally been too optimistic and that this time it really is crashing for good for it to jump again.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:17:33
Thanks. It seems then that cell phone apps are more or less just for small transactions out on the go, but for holding coins long term an encrypted desktop wallet is the way to go. I think I'm going to South station tomorrow to by my first coins. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:18:03
we joke about this but for all we know bitcoin is a self regulating AI that manipulates it's own price based on public sentiment. We just need to express and express more! I think it hits 10k by tomorrow morning :D Have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:43:20
What wallet app do you use??? I'm trying to decide. I've looked at Blockchain
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:26:57
tip a tha hat to ya m'lady. May your brilliance continue to lead you to less toxic pastures.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:03:48
Thank you! My specialty. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:38:03
I'm walking around with it prolapsed dragging half way down the street and I'm STILL learning! No one's an expert here.
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:39:24
don't act like you know. it is inherently unpredictable. just because you found a pattern doesn't mean it will continue or be disrupted by others reacting to the same pattern you see in unpredictable ways. I think volume rates are an indicator of cooling and warming but i haven't quite put my finger on it yet.
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:40:25
this is what has been stabalizing the price 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:48:21
wouldn't it be cool if we could buy the rights to words and then use the blockchain to charge and pay micropayments everytime someone uses your word. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:00:21
it might be three years, it might be five, but your arrogance is so blatant that the shit storm will broadside you unexpected. I hope not, but that's how you seem, since you imply you can predict markets, and read people (I have purchased btc maybe 20 times in my life since 2013 and have sold or spent maybe 10 time : ) Enjoy the flip)
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:27:04
mind sharing why you think that?
@_date: 2019-02-14 18:47:02
that's how you generate a quantum address :)
@_date: 2019-02-19 05:43:42
TOO SAFE!!! LMAO
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:13:07
But where’s the lie?
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:32:15
Uh when you consider we are living in the information age and social media is THE source of social information you begin to understand. For many in the tech world this isn't a bubble but the very tip of the iceberg for the future we are creating. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:25:05
damn, comments like this make me think I should short bitcoin so hard. luckily, bitcoin is stronger than r/bitcoin (i hope!)
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:33:10
Hey troll, are you personally losing land or just raising the banner for your white brethren?
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:27:13
Ok, cause that's how a short works, right mate? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:24:26
Ok, this just proves the point I jokingly made. It is too complicated! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:36:57
Any predictions on when it will bottom out and how long to recover from there?
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:16:13
I think that may be his problem, yes. I heard him on a podcast talking about his "non-nation" plan. It was crazy and would in short only make sense if everyone participating was just like him, an idealist with martyrdom complex. His ideas are for an ideal world that doesn't consider human unpredictability. His claims and beliefs about his personal philosophy, and the way he expresses his goals don't seem to fully take into account reality, and he seems to run bcash with this same mentality. It's a dangerous combination and looks very much like a scam artist persona, i.e. a messiah type who believes his own b.s and wants to alter the world to fit his beliefs.  
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:24:54
I understand, I just think it's funny.
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:09:34
nope i was just trying to make a little joke for us bitcoin fans, but unfortunately I wasn't primed for the wall of weaponized autism you stash around the borders of r/bitcoin. Serious bizness here only! I see now, I won't make that mistake again,. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:10:24
But I bet he's great for generating random strings!
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:35:17
Hey how you doing? Made some good change in this drop I hope? Saw it coming? What’s next? Asking for a friend 
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:56:00
this reads like a guerilla marketing move by the sat company. the writing is too zeitgeisty 
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:10:43

Does bitcoin need anybody? Isn't it directly valued by what someone is willing to pay for it? I don't think it needs anyone, nor cares about anyone. It is us who care, who become attached to symbols and take sides against each other, because we care.
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:32:51
stripe wont work with anyone even tangentely affiliated with bitcoin. same thing happened to chris coney of cryptograph podcast. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:42:18
Thanks!? Personally, I think I'm still in it. But there are levels of depth in this rabbit tunnel so maybe I'm nearing the surface once more.
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:24:23
you failed the turing test, now get out of my shitpost. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:07:14
It relies on the hubris of others mostly. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:35:20
@_date: 2016-09-27 18:20:47
also whole concept of "software is eating the world". 1999 growth meant reaching more internet users, now it means moving into car industry, space industry, smart cities, etc.
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:26:26
wipe ram, it's just funny. can something be funny and accurate? I just want it to keep going... 'smash computer with hammer, throw out window, ...etc' 
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:41:01
thanks ;)
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:17:44
Hey!!! Someone who knows some history!!!  Thanks for the info. I feel better informed.
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:08:38
yes but trading dollars is a level above trading anything else because dollars are the measure of value. If I have $5 and I go to 'the market' with my value I can say I am selling $5 and shop around for the 'most valuable' item my $5 can buy. As the saying goes "...$5 is $5", to me and to the buyer. 'The market' is just a step away from the barter system, where trades can not be direct, but first must be made in exchange for a quantitative 'measure of value'. In an open market you could also sell the quantitative objects of currency, for anything really. Whatever the number of units you sell is the 'price' of the goods/services you receive.

also love this little gem found in tutorial for cold storage set-up;
"Shut down system and turn off computer. Before switching your computer on again, remove all power sources for about 1 minute. **Physically remove battery from laptop."**
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:11:32
Wow!!! I can't believe these trends! Completely unexpected outcome!
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:51:24
That's super helpful. hey thanks a lot! :D
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:03:17
There was talk of the first bitcoin ATM opening up there not long ago. (not sure if it happened) 
The Country's University is accepting Bitcoin as tution!
for such a small country these are two huge examples. I honestly didn't know Cyprus was a country until I started following bitcoin news.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:56:31
Thanks to both of you. Yes, I'm most concerned about identity theft so coinbase looks like the best option. I tried buying bc on localbitcoin before, but had trouble finding a reliable trader in New England to work with.  It looks like coinbase may give slightly better deals for the exchange than you can find on localbitcoin

Can you really scan a QR code off the tv? The mind boggles
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:05:34
