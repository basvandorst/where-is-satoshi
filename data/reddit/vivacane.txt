And yes the government have to much control on your money. You can actually don't say the money is yours. But with Bitcoins , no one but you can do whatever you want with them without having the government watching and controlling your money. You can send money with just paying nearly nothing in fee.

They gonna have fun plugging all the miners , but wouldn't they earn more than they gonna pay for electricity and such? But since the difficulty is going up by 25% they gonna earn much less.
