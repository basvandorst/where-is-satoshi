So Bitcoin's defining monetary policy feature (fixed supply) doesn't in fact inform the decision as to how much the price should be raised or lowered, subjecting one's **freedom** of spending to predicting the irrationality of the market\[1\]. I mean, you have the **freedom** to throw your money away on the lottery; you don't need Bitcoin for that kind of **freedom**. Of course, Bitcoin has more hype and ideology around it than the lotto, but then again, lots of people used to think they could develop a "system" to game the lotto.
That's probably why the article's\[2\] discussion is about whether cryptocurrencies are **liberatory**, not about whether they proffer a kind of freedom that people arguably already have.
If you mean "Bitcoin is freedom *from government*" I'd think most Venezuelans (who can't afford a smart phone) would disagree with you. Bitcoin is certainly freedom *for governments* that want to form their own mining cartels. 
But again, the question is whether Bitcoin is liberatory (because markets), not just that it's freedom. Most people think "freedom" implies liberation; i.e., financial prosperity, but Bitcoin's freedom is more like the freedom to play the lottery or become a Born-Again Christian.

Why? Because since Gödel, it has become fashionable to use the language of equality to promote "the violence of capital" being "the violence of the equality of inequality."
The article progresses, chiefly, by a series of questions. It is left to the reader to assess the most important implied one: are "crypto-anarchists" really just cyberneticians? Is "crypto-anarchy" part to a larger trend of semiotic alchemy (behaving more like a theologico-economic ideology)?
Is Bitcoin's success the success of a language game formed in "bureaucratic idealism"?

The productivity of open source developers is where the value is created. Volatility is enforced, by the relatively large bid-ask spread, to steal the value.

The Biblical story both suggests an authority and that what the authority acts upon is without value itself (its arbitrariness). Both points seem equally important. Did the verb "fiat" (make, produce, compose, appoint) and its Hebrew counterpart have use not in the context of authority? It would seem that people understood the verb irrespective to authority long before its usage in the context of authority. e.g., "I made a valuable thing, X, from things not possessing value individually" (sans authority context), but then again "I appoint you, Y, to oversee my sheep" (authority context).
Can we understand "fiat" without authority? Sure, so say the translations. It does go without saying that "fiat lux" does not literally mean "authority light" as opposed to "I make light (whatever I may be)".

Cherry-picking or not, what most people think doesn't make something true. There's a great number of things once thought true by the majority that have lost validity or existence in the history of science: phlogiston, ether, caloric, etc. 
But what is your argument? Are you saying we should oversimplify definitions? Even if you're educating them on BerkShares, for instance?


Bitcoin has *inherent characteristics* that, as a digital artifact, makes it valuable for different reasons from, say, a digital calculator, but that's utilitarian value or use-value. Just like a digital calculator: if you don't need to do, say, bookkeeping, it's not valuable to you.
"Intrinsic value" follows after someone adopts a fiction or a narrative or a model. What's more important here is that when people say "don't mindlessly pursue money, happiness is more important" they're implying that *despite government decree* what we should really understand is that fiat money has no intrinsic value. When people say "money can't buy happiness," and the host of other figures of speech prevalent in ordinary language, what they're highlighting is that money lacks intrinsic value *before* having anything to do with government (i.e., "you can put me in jail, but you cannot enslave my thoughts," etc.). So when people say "money," they typically mean "fiat money," and it's unreal predominantly because people most often think of their own happiness before they think of government decrees. The reality is that money first has no intrinsic value, which is what people understand before they reflect government decree or who's willing to accept it.
In most cases, the components of the definition are not broken up, but the way people behave typically involves them not giving a damn about government decree because they know that it's more important to understand that money has no intrinsic value.
And government decreed it because it is intrinsically valueless, as everybody knows, so to manage the economic system better (or so the story goes). So in this reality you speed of, ask these people "why did government decree it" and you'll land on the fact that it lacks intrinsic value (and given digitalization, the digital can be more easily managed than gold).

Most religious people know what "fiat lux" means: light created from nothing (using laws of nature). It's obvious that everyday people understood "fiat" as a word long before any king or emperor said it. So they understand "fiat money" as money created from nothing (using laws), and so they can understand Bitcoin as fiat money created from rules (i.e., laws are rules).

Definition: An intrinsic theory of value is any theory of value in economics which holds that the value of an object, good or service, is intrinsic or contained in the item itself.
1. *It transcends nations, politics, religions, cultures and regulations.* So its value depends on these things existing in certain ways. It's only valuable because it clashes with these institutions. If they didn't exist, it would transcend nothing. If you're an atheist, it transcends nothing. If regulations are not a problem for you, it transcends without value to you.
2. *It requires no trust.* It's trust-minimizing, not trustless. So it's only true depending on how broadly you define "trust."
3. *It can be transparent.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
4. *It can be programmable.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
5. *It can require multi-signatures.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
6. *It can be spent over the internet without a bank account, credit report, identification, and pre-permissions.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, etc.
7. *It can store irrevocable and time stamped records of transactions.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
8. *It allows you to keep your identity from being stolen.* Not after Quantum Supremacy, and depends on merchant adoption.
9. *It allows movement across borders.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
10. *The same wallet can be used anywhere in the world with a connection to the internet.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
11. *It can move independently of banking rules, laws, and restrictions.* Its value is defined in terms of existing institutions.
12. *It can be used to resist corruption.* Value defined in terms of existing institutions.
13. *It can be made to settle contracts without other parties.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
14. T*here are no age requirements.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
15. *It is more difficult to be used as surveillance*. Is it really more difficult for Bitcoin? Relative to what? Zcash requires a trusted setup.
16. *Bitcoin as money bandwidth.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
17. *It can be the basis of a new ecosystem.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
18. *It can upend centuries-old money monopolies.* Not without believers, and not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
19. *Democratization of money.* Not without markets.
20. *Gives the unbanked population access to banking features they might not otherwise enjoy.* Not without the internet, electricity companies, satellites, etc.
21. *It can be extremely hard to steal.* Depends on good coding practices, testing, etc.
22. *It represents economic freedom.* Depends on markets, but markets are inherently hierarchical, prone to crisis, and privilege-based.

I'm compelled to agree with the logical force of arguments.
Bitcoin's value is conditioned by the deceptive and misleading speech of Bitcoiners. Regardless of its status as a speculative investment, its political theory is garbage. Just like slavery's political theory was garbage. Bitcoin functions on the myth of meritocracy and solves no genuine problem because it gets human nature wrong. Bitcoin advocates don't understand inflation, and the core of their argument against traditional fiat is nothing more than a scare tactic and doomsaying.
Bitcoin is spookymoney.

Most people who understand the word understand the context in which its used: *that an arbitrary order is being made*. *That over* *which* the order is made is not understood to have value on its own, but because the *order* *is made*. We understand the counterfactual: if the order were made of something else, *that something else* would be of value.
I think we have to also respect the fact that neither of us has surveyed most people, and this discussion involves competing intuitions about what most people think. So context is king: people using BerkShares probably won't think "this is nation state money" because it's not.

He's an expert in developing aspects of an economic system that intersects with technology. Why do we accept economists' expertise when they develop opinionated economic models in social science? Some of Pieter Wuille's developments center on scalability, an economic problem unique to Bitcoin.


Sure. Since we're appealing to what common people think, it makes more sense to say that nothing has intrinsic value. "Intrinsic value" is a term of art used by economists and philosophers in opinionated models of the world. So saying "Bitcoin is fiat money" depends to be understand more so on identifying *who's using it* and less so *who decreed it.* We could say Bitcoin is merely a language game.

The other point is that Bitcoin's leadership itself cannot be forked, has no elections or an electoral system, so it's a de facto government in every way but name. It functions on the myth of meritocracy, and its political economy is grounded on vulgar Darwinism (i.e., myopic and mindless pursuit of wealth regardless of [the]( [consequences]( beyond the rules of the game).
"Let it be done" or "Fiat lux" fits perfectly: from inert, lifeless code flows value. "Let there be value," from an author we cannot empirically find (i.e., Satoshi is God-like).
The narratives align perfectly, being put in Biblical terms which would readily resonate with all the major religions.
Bob: You know the word "fiat"?  
Alice: What, like the car?  
Bob: No, like "let there be light."  
Alice: Oh, "fiat lux"!  
Bob: Bitcoin is like that: from rules we get value.  
Alice: Like God uses the laws of nature to create life!  
Bob: Yes, you get it!
If they say, "that's blasphemy," you can say that Satoshi was made in God's image, right? He's just created a money-like information commodity, not creating consciousness or a new species or anything like that. 
So surely "fiat lux" precedes any record given by the OED, since the Bible precedes the OED. It only strengthens the claim that the word "fiat" was likely used not by kings, but by regularly people acting in the name of God (i.e., their dreams or circumstances gave them authority). That's deduction for you.

That's just recorded history. It's inconclusive about what I'm saying. All that implies is that the word was used for arbitrary decrees, before it was used about money. By induction, we can infer that it was used by non-kings before it was used by kings to make arbitrary decrees about anything ("competent authority" doesn't necessarily mean "king"; it could mean "scientist" or "philosopher" or "father"). We can suppose that a king picked up the phrase from some father, who originally meant it regardless of the value of the object or goal to his child. It's more reasonable to assume the phrase started out that way, then eventually bubbled up into the popular usage, then became recorded by historians and linguists.

That's clearly not the logic. The argument is, by modus ponens:
1. If Bitcoin is fiat money, then Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. (Assumption)
2. Bitcoin is fiat money. (Assumption)
3. Therefore, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. (Conclusion)

When people talk about money in ordinary language, their figures of speech, thought-patterns, and behavior are such that they understand its arbitrariness more so than its being decreed. I'm not saying most people won't repeat definitions they've heard from others. But it's their *understanding* that is in question here: they understand that first it has no intrinsic value, and second it's "nation state currency." People treat it as having no intrinsic value before they treat it as a means to satisfy nation states, which means they commonly decouple the concepts "nation state" and "currency."
Someone using BerkShares would say, "You need to expand your definition of 'fiat,' because this is not a 'nation state currency'. Don't you know context is king?"
It's not just what people will say, it's what they show.

That's based on what we know from popular, recorded history. That doesn't tell us about the original usage (or its oral usage, and if the oral usage did or did not precede the written usage), which was probably by non-kings and non-dictators. We have to rely on our intuitions and theories to determine its likely original usage. "Let it be done" doesn't necessarily imply who the speaker is or has been.

You may think they're wrong, but that doesn't change that they think what they think. 
Did you survey all capitalists to learn that they don't think inflation is taking their wealth? How many capitalists are there? How many capitalists say "inflation isn't taking my wealth"?

What's more valuable is to have a hypothesis about how to discover the meanings of words, than to have a bunch of static recordings, and to be able to apply that hypothesis to new cases such that you can adapt to how the world actually is.

More importantly:


They're coerced to status-seeking, yes. Look at Zuckerberg. Look at Bill Gates. 
The old investors spend their energy and time advertising Bitcoin as the future of money, as if the time and talents of the developers were given (seeking the status of libertarian utopia). Just like the slave masters took their slaves as a given (seeking the status of emancipation).

Didn't Einstein say "imagination is more important than knowledge"?


And it's the kind of question that drives linguistics in general. Recorded history doesn't answer the question. The given evidence doesn't answer the perfectly plain, empirical question. 
In our case, we have existing examples where "fiat" doesn't mean "by nation state"; e.g., BerkShares. 
So now we have to *close* the history book and apply intuition to better explain a world that is manifestly more complex than rigid knowledge suggests.

Bitcoin indeed has no debtor or creditor and doesn't function as a debt per se, but being "a claim upon the whole ‘society’ of Bitcoin users," the value of the currency does rely on the anticipation of the overall increase of economic wealth ("promises [...] reciprocity").

I've already said *context is king.*
You're supposed to say "let it be done" implies "nation state currency" instead of "no intrinsic value."
"Let it be done" was probably said countless times outside of a monetary policy context before it was said about money. So it's more reasonable to assume it was used to emphasize an arbitrary order over something bearing no intrinsic value before it was ever used in the context of nation states' behavior. You're not giving the context of its original usage, and giving an interpretation that doesn't invalidate mine.
