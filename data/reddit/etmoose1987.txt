maybe not in the near term, but long term societal collapse eventually people start piecing back together a semblance of civilization. Gold and silver are a neutral trading medium at markets because although you may not have want the other person wants in goods you do have something they know they can use to spend on those things.

i was moving some from Coinbase to Exodus so i can convert some in EOS. never sent anything off coinbase before so i was unsure of how sending to addresses worked so i ate the transaction fee and sent a small test amount just to make sure it went through.
