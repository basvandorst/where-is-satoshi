The tech community is really growing and full of ambitious, educated, and collaborative people

Ah ok. The answer is yes, it is easy to do using Coinbase (via ACH or credit/debit). However, the fee is very high 3.9% per transaction. 
Imagine using your Schwab account and investing $100k only to have the broker take 3.9% each time you convert currencies rather than a $7 trade. That's a pretty significant fee.

What's the fee per transaction? Is it safe/secure?

Really, Schwab offers Bitcoin investing? How does the pricing work?

Yep -- but still incredibly high. 1.49%! of 100,000 is $1,499 in and out -- $3k.

Yes, and I should have bought Disney in 1976

What's the fee per transaction? If you were to purchase $100 and convert it into BTC then back to USD how much would you be charged? Thanks!

This is truly poetic populist garbage. The fact that so many upvoted this screams of lack of understanding of how this world operates if you think all wealth is ill-gotten.

You do understand that half of Davos has been taken over by Bitcoin folks? I am here in Davos Platz right now and I can't tell the difference between a greedy bitcoin billionaire or finance exec walking down the promenade. You are naive to think a digital coin will fix the world's problems, kid.
