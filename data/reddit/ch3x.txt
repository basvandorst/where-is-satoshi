Mycelium is a "wallet" and not an exchange.
The easiest thing for you to do would be to sell it to someone who wants bitcoin. If none of your friends are interested in any, check out  The recipient will give you an address to which to send your .06 bitcoin, and you use Mycelium to send the bitcoin to them. You figure out how they get the money to you: meet in person and they hand you cash, transfer to your bank account, Paypal or Venmo, Amazon.com card, etc. If you don't trust the other party you might think about how both of you can make sure the other doesn't scam them.
Another way to go would be to set up an account on an exchange such as GDAX, verify a bank account there, get a bitcoin address for your account, transfer your bitcoin to that address (this is the part that involves your Mycelium wallet), trade the bitcoin for USD, then withdraw the USD.

Well, if everyone knew it would peak at $40k everyone would try selling there and nobody would buy. But at the time the currency is hitting $40K, nobody knows yet whether it's on the way to $80K or about ready to drop way down to $1K. And if it does hit 80K, will it then go to $150K or will it correct to $50K? Or if it dives to $1K, will it languish there or correct back to 30K?
A trader can guess wrong. One who buys and holds will make a good profit whether they sell at $40K, $80K, $150K, or 50K.

BTC is not really fungible, no. One example: after the Cryptopia exchange was hacked earlier this year, Binance (one of the most significant crypto exchanges) "froze" some of the stolen BTC. How were they able to do this? By tracking the transactions of the hacked BTC. Source: 
Most schemes to make BTC practically fungible involve putting "distance" between suspect transactions and one's own.
Edit: I just checked and it wasn't BTC that Binance froze, it was ETH and ERC20 tokens. But I don't think it would have been different had someone moved hacked BTC to Binance.
Edit 2: Check out  There have been a few cases already of government fines or arrests after tracking BTC.

It sounds like your friend may have generously given you a paper wallet. It has the public key, which people may use to send you BTC, and the private key, which you need to send funds to others (or to another wallet you control). Guard that private key!

If they don't already have a Coinbase account, it's easy and free: from the Coinbase Dashboard, go to Accounts and click the Send button under the appropriate wallet. Then in the popup window, enter your friend's e-mail address, designate how much you want to send in currency or coin, and write them a note if you wish. (Edit: as a bonus, if they add at least $100 to their new Coinbase account, you and they will each receive $10 in coin from Coinbase.)
If you want to give them a paper wallet for free, generate and print out a paper wallet, set up an account in GDAX if you don't already have one, transfer from your Coinbase account to your GDAX account for free (they're sister companies), then withdraw from GDAX to the paper wallet (GDAX will absorb the fee). Just know they will have to pay a fee to get their coins out of the wallet, and right now BTC transfer fees are pretty steep.

**Why this is happening:** What with this month's BTC mania, so many people are trading BTC that they have to offer the miners high fees to make sure their transactions are chosen to go through.
**When it will get better:** Who knows? It's a supply-and-demand issue. Hopes are being placed on Segwit wallets and the Lightning Network, but there's no solid date for either. Or the current mania could die down and the Miners will start clearing the backlog.
**How to work around it:** Make an account on GDAX if you don't have one already; transfer your coins from Coinbase to GDAX for free (they're sister companies), then withdraw them from GDAX to your Ledger for free (GDAX will absorb the fee).
This is specifically a BTC issue right now.

I'm a noob too, but from what I gather the disdain (and it goes both ways and on multiple platforms, not just one subreddit) is over competing visions for bitcoin, what it is, what it was meant to be, what the real problems are, and how to address them. Those who agree strongly with one of the development teams often see the other fork's team as misguided and harmful to the reputation of bitcoin.
You're wise not to react to what people are saying here on Reddit, but do mine those comments for directions to pursue in your investigations. The signal to noise ratio is pretty bad.

After more than a year without identifying a single instance of a person associated with my gym publicly using bitcoin to solicit donations, the Busybody Foundation, which advises both public and private entities on matters relating to my gym, has identified four cases in less than a month.
The jump in instances of gym patrons fundraising with bitcoin began early last month, just as the price of bitcoin first passed the $10,000 milestone, according to new findings.
But while the actual amount being raised by the body-builders are still relatively tiny, the Foundation's director of weird Internet stuff analysis, sees the spike as part of a bigger-picture exploration of cryptocurrencies by gym patrons.

Well, if you're buying and holding, you'll gain control of your private key by transferring your coins to cold storage as soon as you acquire them. That's good.
If you're expecting to hold more than just a little (say $1,000) you might consider a hard wallet such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
Something that's also very secure but cheap is a paper wallet. Keep a printout in a very safe place or two, and copy the public key (bitcoin address) someplace where you can use it every time you buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:52:35
What is the value of your assets on Coinbase? Are you actively trading, or are you just buying-and-holding?
On the one hand, Coinbase insured, so if they're hacked or something you should be covered (eventually). On the other hand, they control the private keys and transaction fee rate, and people have been unhappy with their assets being "stuck" when they wanted to move fast.
If you do remove your assets from Coinbase, run your crypto through GDAX to avoid transfer fees to your wallet(s), especially for BTC.
A free paper wallet is a cheap and secure place to hold assets. Coinbase/GDAX is a convenient platform for buying, trading, and cashing out.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:07:28
I'm a real noob but here's what I understand: These fees are not generated by your exchange, they come from bitcoin block miners. Whenever a new bitcoin block is generated, information about bitcoin transactions is included with the block and the miner collects a fee for those transactions. There is limited space for this information, so the fee becomes a supply (miners) and demand (transactions) issue. Right now there are lots of transactions being made (perhaps because of the sudden popularity of BTC what with its' recent boom) and so people are offering increasingly high fees to get their transactions chosen by miners.
The miners don't actually set the fee, but they do get to pick which transactions to include in their block; so those who offer higher fees will get included faster than those offering little or nothing. Most actual wallets have the ability for you to set your own fee, in BTC per byte.
I hope that's pretty close.

Coinbase lets you buy crypto with a credit card.

Huh? How is that "backing?" The USD used to be backed by gold, meaning the amount of currency in circulation was based on the amount of gold held in reserve. One could turn in paper money to the government and get gold. Not anymore.

As far as the blockchain knows, the coins belong to whomever has the private keys to control them. When your coins are on an exchange, the exchange has the keys to control the coins. When you transfer the coins to your own wallet, you have the private keys.
There have been several cases where, through fraud or incompetence, people have lost their crypto kept on exchanges.
Edit: It's worth mentioning that on Coinbase your fiat assets are FDIC insured and they also have insurance on your crypto assets.

@_date: 2018-10-16 18:02:54
Segwit frees up room in a block transaction by bracketing out (moving to a different place) the signature data. So Segwit wallets use less space when making transactions, allowing for more transactions per block and lower transaction fees (which are based on bytes used).

When the government prints money, it is distributed through bankers (many banks that were "bailed out" after the 2008 crisis). The "private" banks profit, the general population does not--and may even be the ones paying the fees that generate that profit.
If that was all there was to it, then no harm done. 
However, by diluting the supply of money, it becomes less valuable. the $10,000 a person has managed to put into savings has the buying power of only $9,000 when the saver started the account. *There's the harm*. (The actual inflation since 2008 is over 16%.) That inflation crushes any interest that may have been earned.

NO MATTER WHAT, each and every "sell" is matched with a corresponding "buy." So it's not accurate to talk about "sell offs" (because those supposed to be selling off are matched one-for-9ne by those buying in) or "buying in" (because those supposed to be buying in are matched one-for-one by those selling off).
For a crypto asset to remain even, buyers just have to be happy paying the market price, and sellers just have to be happy taking the market price. "Market price" is simply the last price the crypto traded at, the most recent collision between what buyers want to pay (bid) and what sellers want to accept (ask).
For a crypto asset to start climbing in price, what's happening is sellers are setting their sell orders at a little above market, in order to get more in exchange, while buyers continue to pay market (ask) price. For a crypto asset to start dropping in price, what's happening is buyers are offering a little below market, in order to spend less, while sellers continue to pay market (bid) price.
Check out an exchange's order book, and you'll see that there are plenty of both buyers and sellers lined up wanting to trade at prices very close to market. Check out a depth chart, and you can see that at any given moment the balance of supply and demand within a given price range of market price may be heavier on one side or the other.
All of this is a very long-winded way of saying that some people are "waiting for the crash to finish," some are "buying the dip," some are "taking profits," some are just adding to their stack because they just got paid, some are selling so they can buy a new laptop, some are shifting over to a promising new alt coin, some are bailing out of a sham alt coin and getting back into bitcoin, some are consolidating, some are diversifying, some are reacting to this news or that, some are counterintuitively trading with those who are just reacting to news, etc.

I'd say quite safe, in that cash and crypto is all insured on Coinbase.
On the other hand, I've followed the advice of not leaving assets on exchanges, and am glad I did. In the short time I've been in crypto, I've already seen two exchanges go down. I've also observed--especially during big bull runs and crashes--exchanges go down for maintenance, struggle to process new accounts, freeze withdrawals, suspend trading, and have bugged trading.
As far as Coinbase goes in particular, while I've not had problems I've seen people have their assets ("safe" though they may be) trapped in customer service hell for literally months, incur spurious charges (no matter they may be reversed sometime later), and struggle to get any help at all from customer service or tech support.
