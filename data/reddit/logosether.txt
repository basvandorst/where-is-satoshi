Sure, no prob!

It comes from the people. It's only worth what people are willing to pay for it. The same is true for literally everything else (fiat money, water, anything).
Its value is in its decentralized, secure technology.

Are you using Coinbase pro? You should be able to buy coins with fiat. Have you sent your money in and waited a few days for it to arrive?

(I'm not the guy you responded to.)
Your comment about slot machines resonates with me because I've seen delusional people do that.
However, I think crypto is different and wouldn't call it gambling. I understand that it's a high-risk investment, which makes it seem similar to gambling. The difference is that gambling has no relation to technology, public sentiment, or any sort of logic. It's pure odds.
While crypto is very misunderstood and poor logic is rampant ("Chinese New Year", etc.), there is also smart logic behind it. Hedge funds trade crypto and know what they're doing. Or in my case, I believe crypto will be relevant technology in the future, so I got involved for the long-term.

Glad you're both having fun! Make sure your friends are only investing what they can afford.

Whenever people trash talk bitcoin crashes, I just send them this video with no other explanation:  [

Welcome! Sounds like you're doing a good job of only investing what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:52:27
Have you verified your identity with them?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:25:28
I have one. Was just genuinely trying to be helpful, oh well.
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:54:00
Dude you should do this now, just make a relatively small prize (0.001-0.01 BTC). This sounds awesome.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:18:49
What about it confuses you?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:27:31
Yep. And sure, it could certainly go lower.
In my experience, alts lag BTC, so I'm expecting them to rally in a little while. So that's just my strat.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:53:05
Try Coinbase pro, and yeah you need to deposit fiat money before you can buy crypto with it
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:55:50
Nah, LTC/BTC is currently at a low, it's the worst time to swap out. Alts will probably have a rally within a week or two, swap out once they come up.

When you hold funds in your Coinbase wallet, they are secured by Coinbase, you don't need to do anything else. But it's a centralized way to store them - you're trusting Coinbase to hold them for you.
If you don't want to trust Coinbase to hold them, then you can move them to a soft wallet on your computer or the web. Or if you're holding a lot of value, then I recommend cold storage and personally like the nano ledger s.

There's nothing wrong with earning 7.5% in a low-risk (relative to crypto) investment. I have always invested some money in crypto and some in traditional markets. Not everyone is the same. Some people don't understand crypto and just want to make sure they can feed their family for years to come. Nothing wrong with that.

I'm a big fan of Coinbase. They're not perfect, but keep in mind you're going to find negative reviews about everything, everywhere.
With Coinbase, unless you pay higher fees and buy instantly with a credit card, it's going to take a few days to get in. But that's alright. The pros are that it's easy to use, has some of the lowest fees (use limit orders, not market orders), and it's very secure. Also, the way I see it, if they somehow have a security breach, at least they're an established and solvent US company and I can sue them, haha
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:20:56
Perfect. Hopefully more newbies do it that way, haha.
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:22:28
Does anyone know what the community can do to combat this?
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:58:46
This is why you only invest what you can afford. If you can, just hold the .1 BTC and leave it alone for a few years. If you can't... Well then you probably should have invested less :(

I think the idea is that we WANT people to have to figure out how to pay you in bitcoin lol. That part is about adoption and education. The other aspect is that if you get paid in BTC directly then you avoid KYC, which your friends might be interested in.
