Indeed, great point.
i asume the primary factors have got to be the proliferation of alternative "light" and web wallets, combined with a wider (and less techincal) user base, right?

When people say be your own bank, it means that your store your bitcoins yourself, without involving a third party. More specifically, you are the only one who has access to the private keys of the addresses that contains your coins. The idea is to not store your coins in any wallet that you do not have sole control of, to avoid the risk of losing them due to third party fraud/error/incompetence.
It has nothing to do with buying or selling coins, you still need to use a third party for that.

This is a serious question and not in any way meant as sarcastic or a knock on coinbase- what is the advantage to this method over just storing the coins yourself?

Shitty.  There are at least 20 machines in my city and they all seem to work well.

I use them all the time. Takes five minutes the first time and one minute every additional time. You must be stupid or using a cappy machine.

That would be very smart if the operator's plan was to make $3 and then spend the rest of his life in federal prison.
