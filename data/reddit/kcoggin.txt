its not about the money, its about sending a message. Then 10-15 years from now we can look back on this "$2.50" Gum pack, and the kids in 2035 will ask what a dollar was.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:25:41
I personally like to compare it to saitama from one punch man. Super weak at the beginning, and in 3 years most powerful thing on the planet.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:01:08
I didn’t say I would need 300k for the down payment. I would need btc to be 300k for the down payment. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:40:49
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:17:39
Am bullish long term. Just hope we stay bullish longer than burn out again like we did.
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:08:44
I mean....try explaining fiat in 30 seconds. Then try explaining every fiat it different and try to tell them the difference between the two. And then when they get board and tell them get to the point say bitcoin could be just a single currency.
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:39:42
“This is a suckers rally.”
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:44:18
Fine I need a down payment for a house. So 300k would be good for me.
Edit:300k btc would be good for me,
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:29:22
I have a feeling that 2020 will be 100k not 1 million. 2021 however...after the half of btc maybe 1 million.

I don’t have to pay taxes on the information on my SSD, my HDD, my floppy, my external HDD, my cloud, or my thumb drive. Btc is just everyone’s information.
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:07:09
Did anyone see BCD early today? Shit was up 50% with 650 volume. Now it’s down 75%.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:12:32
All you need is one of those black mirror cookies. The ability to study never sleep and trade crypto all day? Sounds pretty nice.
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:21:19
Same thing happened this time last year. Wedge is still in play, let’s watch and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:49:30
Well, the best way to kill bitcoin would be to kill the internet. 3rd world war should do it. Have fun!
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:38:01
100M baby
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:19:34
Won’t be moving sideways in October. It will make a decision, either up or down.
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:18:49
I’d probably call it a satoshi personally 
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:20:02
I just have a aversion to spending any money. Not just bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:05:11
I mean, I can’t really blame people being burnt out. I would be too if I saw 70% disappear in the following months.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:21:28
Was impressed with the speed and mining fees compared to literally 3 months ago 
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:37:50
That’s also solid. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 11:20:48
I believe they are not actually returning the 141k btc (valued at $581M) but simply the 141K BTC at the time of the hack. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 11:26:52
If we repeat the former bear market 3,100 is close to the bottom. We will likely be there again but probably not for another 3-6months. After that we will wick below 3,100 likely to 3,000 and then probably not see another bear for a while.
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:41:06
Idk, I think 3.1k was the bottom. I don’t see us going lower than 3.5k any more. However that being said if we do break 3.5k then I would agree with your double bottom. Only reason I disagree currently is because the weekly is still pointing upwards and the daily has become undervalued.
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:05:03
Maybe I should buy 1 Monero...
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:50:52
I believe the majority are to bearish now.
@_date: 2019-03-01 02:10:20
Venezuela is going to end up an economic power house because of their necessity of acquiring bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:33:55
Well. I feel like my wording got mixed up there. I mean to say 10-15 years from now an entire new not currently existing generation, I.e kids born 2020 and beyond. Those kids will grow up in a world where btc and crypto in general is nothing new. Kinda how my understanding of the internet has always been there because I’ve never lived without it.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:22:34
I’ll guess $16,761 USD for one btc by 1/1/2020
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:28:01
And fiat is worthless.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:39:33
I apologize. I miss interpreted what you said. You’re correct.  My bad man.
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:44:46
Historically and seasonally bitcoin goes up during October.  What is your opinion for this time during this year?
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:17:08
The hells wrong with you? You forgot a 1 in your 2140.
@_date: 2018-10-27 02:34:04
Believe this was a magazine back in the 80’s or 90’s.  I feel like you also might think I’m joking when I said that first sentence, sadly I am not.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:26:14
I mean if you were to average the btc ratio equally to every human it’s 1 human for every 0.00276316 btc per person. But humans will keep growing where btc will not. So that number will shrink every day.
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:46:33
Cool, can’t wait. Still a long ways away but last December feels like ages ago now. And the price doesn’t really reflect that currently.
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:47:48
Ah schrodinger coin. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:24:37
I mean, have you ever used gold or silver for transactions? I’m sure people said the same thing about fiat when it was used.
@_date: 2018-10-28 13:55:01
I think we might see 7k in a week from now. Maybe 2. Lots of bullish news coming out and I just can’t see it moving sideways for much longer.
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:52:53
I’m not sure. If it becomes stable, which is very likely in my opinion, I’m sure it could work for larger sum payments. But I’m not sure bitcoin would be best for say buying coffee. I’m not saying you can’t buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin, I’m just saying there are better things to buy coffee with than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:24:26
“Safest” doesn’t mean 100% safe.

I mean, math is math. Obviously he’s just a troll. And I really doubt North Korea has 180,000 btc. That’s just crazy.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:49:24
I mean you can buy btc at 50k and be that hipster that bought 50k btc before it was cool.
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:28:22
I mean they are right there. Look at them never a Q4 without an increase.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:58:14
No no no. It works up until it doesn’t. That’s how it works.
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:09:19
I found bitgur the other day. Good bye coinmarket cap.
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:42:30
I don’t go about spouting when and how much I buy. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:18:38
Ah, one thing that doesn’t translate well is sarcasm. /s
No worries. But I’m not sure what the faith of fiat is.
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:30:00
I think any rapid transaction currency that takes less than 5 seconds would be suitable.
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:53:15
I mean, it doesn’t matter you and I won’t be alive to see it.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:07:40
Inflation is not mining.
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:23:44
i mean, 2014 was the hack.  
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:22:48
I remember the $10 fees. Felt like a bank atm.
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:10:13
Won’t be as long. To many things at play here. The halving is before then. The buyers are already gone it’s the people that really care for it now. We might have one last shake, but I’m optimistic that the historical seasonality marked with the end of this wedge will lead us towards an uptrend and at some point sooner than we think new highs.
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:17:46
I can’t wait for you to eat those words. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:33:11
I mean, honestly at this stage, if it goes up I win, if it goes down I win. Can’t lose at this point.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:01:14
Well in terms of internet start ups back in 1992, I would say we are in 1998-2000 right now. So another 10-15 years and we would be considered normal. Which makes sense given that an entire generation exists now which has never not known about btc.
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:55:44
You should see the % change for 6,3, and 1 month. I think it’s like a difference between plus or minus 1.5%
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:23:49
Then why are we still not using it?
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:12:22
...I don’t think you quite understand what you’re reading. I mean you’re right 1% of 21M is not 0.28. But instead 1% of the human population is 76 million. 21M/76M=0.28BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:18:37
Lolll, that’s assuming the last bitcoins are done mining before I die. The current market supply is like 17.5M
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:40:29
I’m feeling very bullish. Together the market moves sideways, until one of us is correct.
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:16:20
This is true
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:55:34
I guess I’m not as well informed as I used to be on bitcoin. My apologies my man.
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:03:25
This low volume, extremely low volatility is kinda nice. My btc to USD doesn’t move as much so it’s easier to build. This is likely an accumulation phase, but likely a short one because it’s almost November. If we get volume, the price will make higher highs and maybe by June or July we will be back beating 20k.
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:38:52
Confused cat I believe
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:38:09
If that were true it would have already happened. I have a secret time travel password. If you happen to guess what it is I will fully believe you’re a time traveler.
@_date: 2019-08-24 04:37:57
What’s the difference at that point? If I would like to buy an Apple from you for 10k sats I have paid for said Apple. 
If you a year or two later manage a down payment on a car from said Apple you have essentially paid for it with the same value an Apple was 2 years prior.
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:52:53
If they had 200 btc to offer for tables, they are likely doing pretty good.
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:21:04

Is toast and tea any good? I’m a silly American and wouldn’t know.
@_date: 2019-10-14 02:55:55
Or, let’s be real. Any transportation at all.
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:45:01
Having bought 50 BNB for $150 can agree parabolic is hard. But I have learned. Let the bulls go, don’t try and flip them.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:03:21
Yeah 20k to 3k over a period of 10 months.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:09:35
I feel the same way about 125k and 350k btc. So I completely understand the passion. Honestly as long as we keep above the 21W EMA we should keep climbing regardless of price action. But once we close below that we need to be less bullish and more bearish.
@_date: 2019-10-08 01:15:38
Dude, it was 90 degrees in New York last week. It’s flippin October dude. Also they might think the cost don’t justify the means, this doesn’t make them correct in assuming that.

Have you seen the fees now? It be like a few pennies now.
@_date: 2019-08-18 19:08:04
I wouldn’t say bitcoin is like Batman. Batman is already extremely rich. His super power comes from his history and wealth.
I would compare bitcoin closer to saitama from onepunch man. Doesn’t obsess over things he doesn’t find necessary for what he wants to do for fun. Worked really hard to get where he is and no one noticed. Once someone did notice though getting stronger was not really an option. He already became the strongest. What do you do then?
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:56:24
Radioactive gold could power its own self. I don’t see the problem here.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:46:29
I mean this is what people would classify as a “suckers rally.” 
I’m long right now, it’s absolutely paying off.
@_date: 2019-10-19 12:40:10
Yeah, in my opinion it’s the second (or maybe third if you count smart phones) modern marvel. The block chain is based on math, and math is a universal language. We will never forget the block chain unless we end up all dying. Even then...it might still survive on some computers around the world, it just won’t be running any more.

Does 8.7k count? Cause I doubt that’s what you want to hear.
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:15:33
I firmly believe the next top will be around the 450k ball park. The fact gold has gone up 4% tells me that even gold is worried about bitcoin catching up.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:56:33
Let me fill you in on something. People thought DASH was in a bubble at $62. It went all the way to like $400 I think. I can’t remember exactly. But I guess what I’m trying to say is since bitcoin came out bubbles have grown drastically. Probably because there is no fractional reserve lending. I wouldn’t think it impossible for bitcoin to close this year at 55k and 1M next year. I hate to say macafee is right...but I think he might be right.
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:31:20
I mean. I DCA and I feel like, in my opinion, probably doing better than a majority of the rest of the market.
Learned a lot over the last 2 years and I am changing careers to become an investor.
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:24:17
You joke but it’s better to buy something than hold that fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:40:22
Hey man, what do you want to know?
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:54:24

You went to the wrong site.  you get a 5% discount using lightning network too.

I’ll make my own exchange.
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:29:29
Ha, I was just moving out of high school. But damn wish I looked into bitcoin back then. My ideals wouldn’t have changed one bit.
@_date: 2019-10-19 12:44:19
The news is covering it, yes. But the news isn’t covering people going to setting up miners and nodes and wallets.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:23:01
Oh we are absolutely in those two stages because I’m both hopeful and in disbelief.
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:33:46
I’ll take you up on some pizza on a Saturday and pay you back sometime in btc.
@_date: 2019-10-18 01:39:49
So short litecoin long bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:38:44
Can’t be raiding house over extreme power consumption now.
@_date: 2019-02-15 02:05:35
@_date: 2019-12-07 23:13:59
Honestly I think it depends on if YOU value it. How much use do you have of  gold? Silver? Copper? Steel? Iron? Bitcoin? 
I don’t have any particular use for any of these things. But I believe bitcoin has a future use for me.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:48:13
I’ve tried for 2 years. It shouldn’t be my job to educate them anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:26:42
Nope. As long as blocks are made every 10 minutes it shouldn’t matter.
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:39:13
That’s my assumption as well, but honestly it doesn’t really matter.
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:51:51
Obviously I’m unable to articulate what I’m trying to say. You’re telling me how things actually are, I understand that nobody trips and falls and inseminates an egg.
I’m trying to say things could be different. That’s all I’m trying to say. I want the dad with two jobs to be able to stay home with his kids and be a father rather than a over worked worker.
I want the teachers who love to teach to be able to teach. You’re telling me that teachers can go find a new job and I’m telling you that teachers needing to find a new job is what I believe to be the problem.
@_date: 2019-12-17 01:44:11
Obviously everyone would have a different definition of what work is. But it should be up to the individual(s) to decide what they want to do with their life, and what responsibilities they as an individual desire.
I don’t desire working retail, it’s a mindless job. Maybe someone out there does but I don’t know them.
I guess what I’m trying to say is with bitcoin and a free society people could choose what they wanted to do and have more freedom in that choice.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:06:39
I would be willing to bet it goes one step further and transforms how we view work as a society.
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:03:53
I might have a lot of freedom, but what about everyone else?
What about the individuals working two jobs supporting 2-3 children? 
What about the teachers who are underpaid teaching the future generation? 
I’m not trying to talk about me, I was giving an example. I hated retail and left when it went no where. But how many jobs in the jobs report are just like that? Dead end, forever cycling in new workers.
Automation is coming, and pointless jobs will be removed, this shouldn’t be scary, it should be a good thing.
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:22:13
That’s what happens when you hit the largest support for the last 2 years.
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:34:38
It’s kinda funny that Hal Finney is on this list of 2000 people talking about cryptography and is also living in the same town and received the first bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:13:57
Well at some point we will value things more than the btc in our wallets.
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:47:39
It will tease you two more times and then you get bliss.

When everyone is a million trillion-air, no one is.
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:46:58
I mean it’s not even that. Bitcoin literally incentives green energy to the max. If you could afford a home that was 100% green, and could mine bitcoin for nothing, you would be getting paid for having an eco style home. Maybe that’s just me though?
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:38:54
Cool thanks pre programmed message that doesn’t even know what I just asked.
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:43:33
Maybe that’s why it’s so expensive now?
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:02:12
r/technology had an article saying that a single bitcoin transaction is close to $60. And I just don’t see how they came to that conclusion.
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:11:29
It’s also holiday weekend
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:39:24
Here’s how you have to look at it. At what price do you think more individuals are selling than buying? Would you buy bitcoin at 20k? 50k? 100k? 300k? 1M? Or would you sell at those prices. 
My personal opinion is the fact that once individuals understand bitcoin we as a society will determine the price of bitcoin. Mining sats will become a form of UBI and we will become financially free from all governments. Or I’m just thinking crazy thoughts. Who knows.
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:48:10
I’d wager a bottom of 3.5k
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:04:37
Give it 45 days
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:28:08
I believe your just trying to be difficult. While yes your still technically correct.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:27:05
Yeah, sure.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:28:04
A good year. 2018 not so much.
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:06:36
im not talking about right now. im talking maybe 15-20 years in the future. Our children will likely never have to work a day in their life to survive. Im not saying that work wont have to be done, but not all of us will have to work is what I am saying.
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:45:32
People acted the same way when the internet was becoming huge. Let the ignorant come in last.
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:03:22
I could afford one now at this point.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:44:15
I believe that’s your opinion. And while I don’t control nasa they already have stated a man mission to the polar caps of the moon for 2024. I thought it would be awesome for bitcoin to be the first planet to planet transaction,
@_date: 2018-11-11 04:11:03
Would be more than 72% to get to the dick like. The line would have to fall 72% to get where we are.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:35:30
I doubt we would see 1.9k probably 2.3 or 2.5. I realize the difference there is like $300-$600 but we also were like $600 away from 20k. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:56:06
I’m curious as to what Sunday will bring. Because that’s when last year btc mooned. But it won’t moon like that again, not this year. But after November, after December, and January into early February when btc went down from 20k to 6. I think it won’t be until Feb 6 we see some legit pumping. I’m not talking 2-7% I’m talking 26-40%. We are still in an accumulation phase, and likely will be for another 3-4 months.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:03:12
99% will be mined by 2040.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:05:10
It likely isn’t. I’d wager we have another 75 days before we start going back up again. Likely down to 1.9k and then huge volume back up.
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:01:41
I feel like Jim Craimer is right, and Thomas lee
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:10:51
Stocks are Monday through Friday. 9:30-4:00. That’s (not including lunch) 6.5 hours a day. That times 5 is 32.5 hours a week. There are 4 weeks a month and 36 months. So that is about...4,680 hours. Crypto is 24/7 non stop. So 10 months, thats 7,300 hours.  By this logic we should have started moving up around April/May. Oh wait we did!

Right but bitcoin is supposed to be a store of value right? If you put $350 into btc and it moved sideways for a month did it not serve a purpose? It’s supposed to be a bank no? What do banks do? They hold your store of value for you, somewhere safe and hidden from others.
But what do centralized banks do? They take your money and lend it out onto others that ask for it and don’t care about debts.
Bitcoin doesn’t have debt, it’s globally shared wealth, and it’s new, it’s different, it’s young. But those that understand it and believe in it will be well rewarded, not because of luck or career, but because we would have switched to a society that cared more about saving money and less about debt.

I think it’s the equivalent and opposite of how $1 would be considered a whole dollar, but with raising inflation the dollar losses a lot of value. It’s still a whole dollar but it’s pointless to value that. Where as bitcoin is pointless to try and collect 1 coin because it doesn’t act like traditional currency’s. Maybe that’s it? Idk the value of this is still up in the air we’ve been trying to make digital currencies and gold since 1998, when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

I’m not sure if we will have a lot of old fashioned things. I think we might hit a decentralized revolution soon, maybe within the next 20-50 years.

I don’t think you quite understand the security a sha-256 encryption provides. If we had a computer that could do that, we wouldn’t even need bitcoin.

So when I was younger I didn’t like the banks. I’m not sure exactly why, but something seemed off. Now that I’m older I really don’t like the banks, especially now that I’m working.
I would rather be in control personally of my own physical/digital equity than some random dude named bob.
I’m sure a lot of you feel the same way. But bitcoin and even other digital assets like ETH are the future of money, industry, and technology. As well as political and economic power.
@_date: 2019-09-06 01:15:17
Bitcoin hash rate.
1 kilo hash is 1000 hashes (or guesses) per second.
From what I can tell bitcoins lowest hash rate was 600kh/s back in 2009. 
This would be 6,000,000 guesses per second.
0.1ZH/s would be...a lot. 
Like a lot a lot.
Believe that’s in the realm of  the 100 quintillion’s of numbers. Typed out in all 0’s looks something like this. 
That’s a huge number.
Like so much in fact we are reaching the ceiling for names that we created back in 1995. So much in fact I think it wouldn’t be out of the question to come up with a name past the last category because at this rate bitcoin will reach the ceiling of our conceivable table of data categories, the Yottabytes.
I personally think we should mark this as an occasion for the first technology to surpass a yottabyte because that time will be here sooner rather than later.

I mean...how much more do I need to learn?
Do I need to learn more about the deflationary aspect of 50 BTC every block and halving every 210,000 blocks?
Do I need to learn more about the hash rate skyrocketing to 100 exa hashes?
Do I need to learn more about the sha-256 bit encryption?
Do I need to learn more about satoshi Nakamoto, and starting bitcoin after the housing market crash?
Do I need to learn more about how a decentralized ledger works?
Or do I need to learn how actual money needs to be exchanged for things people want and are willing to trade or else there’s no point in trading whatever the objects we are talking about, digital or physical.
I’m not saying bitcoin isn’t the future of money. What I’m trying to say is we are going into a future where we have to invent/invest things to spend this new found money on.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:22:46
It’s exactly like this. People are to busy to self educate themselves about new things. Then you try and help by teaching them, but they just say they are to busy or not interested.
I’m really not trying to sell you something. I’m just trying to get you to understand the way we live is still an ancient form of thinking. We are on the cusp of the future and you all are to busy doing useless things to see it.
Maybe one day it will click when people get angry and upset at the banks for doing x,y, or z again. And when there isn’t enough bitcoin to go around anymore it will be interesting to see what happens. Just hope everyone here has their 272k sats.

Two individuals don’t know each other. They are from two separate countries and speak two separate languages. The countries they come from are two separate currencies. They know nothing about each others currency. But both have and understand bitcoin. So they trade with that instead.
Everyone forgets it’s Peer to peer right now. As long as two individuals understand bitcoin will never die. And we are way past that point.

If a quantum computer is able to break bitcoin it has a lot of work to do. Like an absolutely crazy work to do. Let’s see how much guessing a quantum computer would need to do to steal a private wallet key.
Bitcoin uses sha-256 bit encryption so that’s 1^128 power. Typed out that.
This number is I believe like close to half of all existing atoms in the universe at 10^82
Basically what I’m saying is if google has a quantum computer that can break bitcoin, then we probably don’t even need bitcoin any more.
The computer would be used to collect all bitcoin and put them into a single wallet for a museum or something.
@_date: 2019-09-16 00:48:19
I guess what I’m trying to say is. There is no point in bitcoin by itself, the more technology progresses alongside with similar block chain technologies bitcoin will become more valuable. The whole point of money is to spend it. If no one uses bitcoin there’s no point. I’m not trying to say being a bitcoin Only person is bad, I just think have opinions in a free market is better than not.
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:04:25

@_date: 2018-04-01 11:47:00
I’ll probably be down voted for this but. I honestly think the bottom is near the 1800-2300range. My reasoning for this was the recent death cross. Last time this happened was around 2014 and after the big dip from its first 1k to I think $100. Took 2 years to recover from that, and I think this is like that except much higher value for btc.
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:01:11
That’s fair. Would be much less stressful for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:03:24
While yes things seem uncertain. What is certain is that historically right before the halving bitcoin goes up. This is likely because the people that understand bitcoin has gone up more than the amount available. Then when the amount available is more than the demand you see prices drop and a bear market. This thing is extremely cycle oriented.

@_date: 2019-05-10 19:28:45
So I came to a realization that I can be other people’s banks for them. Cause they don’t care for bitcoin like I do, and don’t see how it can be valuable.
So when my friend pays for dinner, I open a portion of btc for them. Then once they decide they want whatever usd value the BTC from dinner 3 years ago I can do that.

I know that we are not in the euphoria stage. And that it’s totally different right now. By from half way from October to December is when btc took off like a rocket. So ground can be recovered quickly. Especially since the market cap used to be 850B and is now 65B. So we need like what 14x?

@_date: 2018-12-24 12:55:40
I know you’re being funny but I’ve tried to explain bitcoin to my mom. She said she doesn’t understand it and says that he pocket lint was (to her) just as valuable.
To which I said sure! If you could manage to have a continuous supply of pocket lint that would be distributed up until the supply ran out while also simultaneously being able to send your pocket lint to anyone anywhere at any time while no one is able to intercept it. Then yes your pocket lint is very much like bitcoin.
