Well, this is *one* way to get a lot of new attention from the CIA/FBI :p

Economy does not add value -- since goods are typically priced relative to the USD/BTC exchange rate, it makes no difference to either buyer or seller if a 24 pack of beer costs 10 BTC at $1/BTC or 20 BTC at $0.50/BTC

Oh, so you're not getting 1.1Ghash with 2 5850s. Was confused for a sec.

No, FreeBSD is a particular implementation of MD5, not a different algorithm. The algorithm is the same - MD5. Cracking is not slowed down and I can prove it using my array of GPUs.

Considering it makes no difference whatsoever whether I buy a tshirt for 20 bitcoins at $1/bitcoin, or for 10 bitcoins at $2/bitcoin....
Yes. Quite.

Except MD5 is ridiculously easy to brute force (salts do not protect against this)

oh, apparently it is a different algorithm. I don't see the factor of 1000 in the benchmarks tho? Looks more like factor of 1.4?

Create a worker at the site first. You will enter a separate username and password, which you will use to connect to the pool.

The current price of bitcoins per USD seems to indicate sentiment to that effect

Maybe he intentionally promoted a scam site....
&lt;/tinfoil hat&gt;

Increase the clock speed for more mhash. 
it's not really that profitable unless you're getting free electricity.
