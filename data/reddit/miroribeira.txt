Ha! And burn out you shiny $350 wrist ornament 6 months earlier?
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:46:20


Seriously, what would you expect?
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:03:11
Fair point, but if the two people are standing by the roadside it's a public place, anyway, so the point is moot. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:15:11
I'd guess it encrypts anything not vital to displaying a "You got hacked, send me money" message.

[This]( would be my vote, I want one so bad. The gofundme was posted to /g/ the other day, and I've been filled with want ever since. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:43:25
Too far, man. No physical violence. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:12:15
You could, but it's going to require more in-depth control of the machine in question. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:52:23
I've been out of this for a while, what's this willybot that everyone mentions? Otherwise, I'm gonna have to invest in popcorn.  
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:09:59
While I agree with your sentiment, TrueCrypt is no longer maintained, I'd advise you to move to a different setup if you want regular security patches.

If OP was recording it, then he's the one party.

I don't really lose my faith in the authors credibility, because I'm prone to the same assumptions. Mostly because "I'm smart, I don't click suspicious stuff" and "I don't need an antivirus, I run Linux", which is just a different form of Mac superiority. A more esoteric and tech-savvy version, but still arrogance. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:16:52
Tech savvy users make frequent backups and don't click things that look suspicious. Therefore not losing money to these extortionists. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:05:45
That could get pricy, but I guess when you've got as much money as some people have it's nothing
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:38:51
But anonymous is literally a bunch of 14 year old edgelords who DDoS things they think are unethical.
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:56:22
More likely explanation to be honest.
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:10:16
Nope, but I know the prevailing attitude and reputation.
@_date: 2016-10-07 15:04:40
Sorry, I wasn't aware that the trial had concluded and that Backpage had been found beyond a reasonable doubt to be in the wrong, Mr. Fancy-pants lawyer.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:04:02
And the fanboy superiority complex manifests itself to prove my point. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 15:06:57
I have to admit, you're a damn good troll. 9/10 made me reply
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:49:46
I can see how you don't take it seriously, and neither do I. But it's a matter of respecting people's right to believe whatever the hell they want. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 04:18:14
The mention that Google gets your CC, but then inexplicably give Apple and Samsung higher ratings for doing the exact same thing. Samsung is just the next iteration of Apple in terms of consumer-screwing. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:47:46
Yeah, you seem to think that all Christians are represented by the loud ones. I'm done conversing here, as we have vastly different opinions that are unlikely to change. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:09:20
Great comment! You really added to the conversation. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:17:54
Ansibles when?
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:39:06
I'd expect you to realize that some people feel very strongly that you are wrong, and to not ridicule them for it. That's all I can ask of anybody. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:02:30
I like the way you said this, however, I can't do anything about assholes other than downvote, report if it's really bad, and move on. If I could blast every misogynist, misandrist, racist asshole off the internet I would, but I can't. People have been trying for years to block trolls, but anonymity and freedom of speech lead to people who aim to offend. Nothing Much that I can do about it, so I just downvote, report if it's really bad, and move on.
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:08:00
The suggestion of exaggerated use cases seems to be mostly sarcasm, from my perspective, which ridicules the stereotypes. I'd be fine doing that in mixed company. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:05:35
I don't want to nitpick, but the mention of pink paper wallets was an attempt to illustrate how "market to women" often comes off as sexist itself. At least, that's how I saw it. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:10:35
No, we have viruses because some people are bored and systems aren't flawless. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:42:43
I think nothing is 100% anything, but I really could not give less of a shit about who did anything. I'm more concerned about how well it's done, and I'd hope that most people agree with me. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:45:19
There's really no explaining this to you, is there. It doesn't matter if you singled any one out, you called it *all* nonsense. That's worse, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:50:14
Fun fact: People tend to take offense when you call them smelly neckbeards. Myself included. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:59:58
It's not thinking that that makes you a jerk, it's the way you said it. Calling people's beliefs nonsense is no way to have a polite conversation. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:14:04
Fuck off, you're the reason we have these kind of irrelevant posts in the first place. The more of a dick you become, the more people generalize you to represent the average bitcoiner. God damn this thread brings me some rage. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:53:52
My point is not to be a jerk about your criticism, which you were doing. I attempted to do this without resorting to calling you a jerk, but here we are, now. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:30:51
It's rather impolite to call people's beliefs "nonsense". It'd bother you if someone said Bitcoin is nonsense, wouldn't it?
