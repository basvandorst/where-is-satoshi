Here is the bet:
"We were speaking of Bitcoin and the devaluation of the peso, and I proposed a bet: if the peso would be valued more than Bitcoin, I would double my investment that I was making for the country. But if Bitcoin gained a higher rate than the peso, they would have to declare it as a national currency. That would be a perfect decision, as there's a lack of confidence in this coin.”

Good luck to you. However I think we are slowly approaching a bubble pop. Just don't sell when it dips and hodl for a few years. I am also all-in but have nothing to lose. Fortune favors the bold.

And that's why I'm all in too :)

Damn thats scary, do you have a link regarding her stance on bitcoin? Anyways a country banning bitcoin would lose competitive advantage to other countries so that would have been stupid

First time getting into bitcoin and I bought at 1300, sold at 900 when it dipped. And now its back at 1600+
Never again
I learned the lesson:  HODL!!!

Quite a jump but I'm confident we'll get there eventually :)

And what if someone steals the cryptosteel with the 12 word adress? 
Better encrypt the adress first
