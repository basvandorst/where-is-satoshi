It can but ripple multiplied many times in a few days without any major changes to the protocol/token/market, if that isn’t a pump, then what is? Bitcoin never made such jumps in that amount of time, and sure it is a long term pump possibly, but Ripple is the best example of a pump in a volatile market, ever...

What are you on a bout? I’ve been day trading plenty, it’s not that hard tbh, yeah you’ll lose out on Some profit if you are out at a bad time, but just like that I almost didn’t take a loss bigger than about 5% since the ATH

This is what’s ruining the adoption of bitcoin in the first place, people just turning it into a meme, wanting it to ‘moon’. Come on people, sure it would be nice to make some profit along the way, but do we really need to keep this simplistic mentality?

I sold it all at 17k USD because I didn’t have the time to trade, guess what, just bought me some at 6k USD when it was down a few days ago... almost tripled my ₿ balance. I do think another short term dip is coming, we can’t go straight to 20k from here...
