yeah it seems to be more expensive for me. converting using CAD prices.
perhaps related to the spike in $/BTC.

Yeah I prefer that bitcoin is actually used as currency, rather than an investment.
every new place that accepts bitcoin is a step in the right direction for the success.
people buying/selling for profit does very little to the economy, seems like false demand/value.
The only thing I dislike, is it is so unstable in price.  Sellers of products seem to be reliant on the relative cost of bitcoins to their preffered currency, and adjust their price(in BTC) of the product with the current exchange rate.  I think this may hurt the economy a little, but it still makes logical sense for short term trading.
ie. I owe someone $200, I buy 2.6 bitcoins, send it, and they may or may not cash it in right away.
I hope this makes sense, and as always(disclaimer) I am only expressing my opinion, and am still new to bitcoins.

The calculations with US population was possibly the main topic he was referring to.
It has little relevance to the currency.
