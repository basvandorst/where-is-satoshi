So unless you are part of their most "secure" customers everything is great. Except for losing 36% of your money and withdraws taking a day. Sounds amazing, where do I sign up?
@_date: 2016-08-16 11:54:33
Meanwhile the average fee is $0.30+

Sweep them NOW and worry about the consequences later. If you can find the owner, great. If not. 37 BTC for you.

Though it is easy to question how healthy it is for the ecosystem to have so many core developers and early adopters in a privately owned entity.

Any evidence that supports this ballpark? Just curious.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:29:56
So basically it seems like someone managed to compromise user private keys and circumvented the hot/cold wallets? Or simply a mass attack using stolen credentials?

Sold for BTC, withdrew and closing my account. I see no future in BFX tokens and refuse to trade with added risk of chapter 11 or liquidation. 
Couldn't care less about the price of them since I sold. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:25:50
Of course a lot is guesswork. But based on their trade volume, and precious discussions they should have cleared between $300-$600k a month for at least a year and a half. On top of that they have venture capital and bitcoin has appreciated heavily. 
Unless they have literally been wallpapering with money they should have at least $10 million on liquid assets. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:57:39
No. They just want their pay for play blockstream to become standard and an integral part of the Blockchain system. Cause money.

Damn there are a lot of glass half cunt people in this thread. Who cares if the volume is low. You realize that Venezuela is on the brink.of collapse right? Black market Bolivar to USD prices is at 150-1 over official exchange rate. Any trading is fantastic.

Sure. Just send me your private key. :)
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:48:28
My main argument isn't the current delay. It's the developer split and apathy thay has led to a block capacity increase somehow taking 3+ years from becoming an apparent issue. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:21:15
I am simply of the opinion that Bitfinex more than likely will be liquidated or file for chapter 11 bankruptcy and feel that counterweighting you optimism might be useful to keep others from possibly losing money. 
Not everything has to have personal greed as motivator. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:25:35
Like the fork "collapsed" Ethereum? I'm joking, but not really. ETH is still trading 1000℅ over price in Dec 2015.

Just looking at the loss, they are almost certainly using all company funds and assets. If they didn't we would be looking at easy 70%+ loss.

As someone who actually bothered to read the white paper. I advise you to do the same.
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:22:15
Are you implying that you know what made Satoshi leave the development team? And also that you now define the use case for Bitcoin outside of what is outlined in the white paper. Because if thats the case I can only assume you are co-author of the original white paper, personal friend of Satoshi and early core developer. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:49:54
So your logic is that 5℅ is a stronger motivator than 25℅ cause "who bothers"?
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:49:02
I lost a considerable sum, but value my fiscal privacy over getting involved. withdrew and not looking back. Requested my account closed this week.

You didn't actually think they were shares? They are "best case scenario dollars" with a theoretical highest value of $1- trading fee and tax. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:14:20
Not really. Since everyone is on withdrawal hold due to the password change that THEY requested. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:18:48
Addition. If you ALONE don't hold the keys, ts not your Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:25:56
I don't see the open offer but yeah, prices have gone up. Worth noting that XCP is up 300% as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:19:55
So your point is that making block size larger does not provide more transaction capacity?
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:09:48
Yep. All accounted for already. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:04:14
Ha ha. Ok, goodnight Tether, it was fun while it lasted. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:13:43
As someone who lost 250 BTC cause I sent Bitcoin to Bitfinex a day earlier than you I am really trying to feel sorry. Can't do it.

@_date: 2016-08-03 13:24:25
Same as anyone else I guess. I was an active trader and picked the exchange I felt was the safest alternative. Hindsight is 20/20 of course. But Bitfinex wasn't a MtGox or Craptsy where there was months of warning signs. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:19:14
Maybe not comment if you don't understand what a convertible note is.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:08:36
Doesn't mean the hack didn't cause the drop though. Hackers cold easily have set shorts knowing that the hack would flash-crash price. 
Maybe cooperate with other exchanges in identifying address and trade patterns?
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:23:31
You had too much Bitcoin dude. Back of the line til they can realize the BFX and buy more crypto. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:09:06
Agreed. I am not one of them, though I personally feel that holding off for 2 years on hard fork for either larger or dynamic block size and soft forking segwit to that would have been a preferred route over segwit in 2017 and possible hard for in 2018. Time is literally money in Bitcoin, and we may have wasted 2 years.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:37:10
I wish. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 17:42:31
With keepkey and Trezor integration, soon you won't have to. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:41:13
Agreed. But many times before that we have hit peaks that caused massive block congestion for hours and sometimes days. Planning for averages isn't a game to play in in finance. Plan for peaks.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:14:38
Well, I'm open for a lawsuit. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:29:28
Same here. Goodnight sweet price. Now you can sue all you want. Have at it. Go nuts. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:26:34
Agreed. I have actually had fairly exhaustive and interesting discussions with and while I still believe that segwit may alone be a terrible idea if not paired with higher block size limit. I don't dislike him personally. Can't stand though, but thats been a thing since 2011, and I'm an old dog. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:27:05
It's not hard to save Bitfinex at all. Mostly because many of the largest losses are from maybe 15-20 whales that probably carry 50℅ of the loss and have all the motivation in the world to see Bitfinex not Chap 11. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:31:08
True. You do not. But if I were you I would post a "Want to buy" post as you might be able to buy the account of someone that is a US citizen with unverified account willing to sell the account. Way around the Bitfinex rule. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:15:49
That sucks 20℅ more.  Or well, probably 10℅ more since I was in a long margin position and am down prob 50 BTC on that. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:20:54
I don't think finding an investor would be hard at all. It's just hard to do with 4 days notice.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:10:43
They might not. Any investor obviously does. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 04:37:14
Yep. I haven't made any money at all on crypto. :)

No reason at all obviously. He should probably take it slow and not stress that his company lost $70 million. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:12:58
It is far from unlikely that they are holding back some assets that are required to cover things like salaries etc. If we want to have a chance at getting back the remaining 36%, we can't expect them to liquidate every single dollar and just be broke. 
I'd rather take a 36% haircut and equity in a functioning Bitfinex, than 25% and no chance of recovery. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:38:24
Ha ha, yeah $9 billion just rushing into a $170 million asset. How you figure that would work?

Price is always zero til you have the money in your hand. Technically finex can still declare insolvency and everyone holding USD will be out then as well. Just at a lower rate then before. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:59:12
No idea. And how is that relevant to Bitcoins functionality as per the Satoshi white paper? How would you pay for your hotel room with gold?
Or is your point that Bitcoin is exclusively a high value transaction protocol designated for circumventing currency and trade restrictions?
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:41:16
Of course it's possible. But is it probable? I would say no.
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:22:33
Technically not breaking laws doesn't mean running a legitimate or ethical business.
@_date: 2016-08-24 11:49:48
We already knew that since it's off-chain.
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:37:55
I'm not arguing company size. Small company in the eyes of the IRS has to do with their share status. Unlisted and private held falls into small company category. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:28:06
Why would you stop trading after a cataclysmic event. You can bet your ass that security, regulations, capital control and hot/cold wallet management will be better after the hack.
Bitstamp was hacked, and has become FAR more reliable after. Gatecoin is coming back, Kraken has been hacked, BTC-E got hacked early on, OKCoin bribed a hacker, Huibo socialized huge margin trading losses.
Where do you plan on trading?

@_date: 2016-08-03 20:38:13
And my point is that BitGo shouldn't ALLOW installations of their security solutions to be made in a way that makes this hack possible. 
They sell peace of mind, security and insurance against specifically hacks. 
If that model allows for their customers to buy their solution and negating the entire model that their business operates on. Then that falls heavily on them as well.
I can't sell you a car with 'top of the line security features' and then place a button on the dash boards that turns off all airbags and makes the seat-belts disappear. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:23:15
Not true. There will just be restrictions, like for any US shares. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:28:09
You wildly overestimate the flight. A huge hack (post hack) with wide community support and a clear post mortem might actually make them more attractive and transparent.

@_date: 2016-08-15 16:57:49
Not sure how my post was an accusation. Just a question really. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:32:41
I'd they would snitch for 5℅ over taking 10℅ from the hacker, they might be a moron. Bitfinex should raise the reward to a ℅ that makes it painful for the hacker to part with it. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:04:48
Well that sucks. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:43:24
My take: You guys should BUY Bitfinex. You can get it for cheap, take over some debt and issue IOU's for the lost coin. The community trusts you, and you would be WILDLY profitable. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:27:15

I think you might be surprised. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:17:13
Yep. Sold at 0.38, straight into BTC and I'm out of that clusterfuck. It's a negative interest token as far as I'm concerned. Cause after this week there will be no more fee income for Finex when customers abandon ship. And your BFX tokens gets to pay for salaries and an eventual Chap 11. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:02:49

I am.fully aware that there are thing that segwit does that are great. But alone I just think it's too little too late. At the very least segwit should be followed by an "immediate" block size increase. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:02:48
You obviously have no insight into what drives margin trading at all. If you did, you would see that the interest rates the short positions are paying at the points of interest are ones NO trader without insider information would pay. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:08:45
Yeah. I see now bring strange about an anonymous insider mailing a random person sensitive news withoit corroborating any of it. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:42:55
There is no 'segregated', as proven by the fact that the 'segregated' bitcoin funds were stolen. The fact that some crypto currency holders got lucky holding one currency doesn't change that.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:11:48
Absolutely it's a lot of money. But you have to remember that $300,000 USD represents only $10k in the Ethereum crowdfunding. There are many 100s of people that made and far more that in the last 7 months alone. 
Bitfinex was before the hack the largest non-chibese exchange by volume and the largest margin trading exchange in the world. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:55:21
Over a long enough horizon I definitely think it's a good idea. Turbulent few days, and weeks ahead though. I would buy 5-10℅ of what BTC you want over 10-20 days. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 07:07:35
How is the apparent block size issue a personal attack?

@_date: 2016-08-05 16:54:07
That's the point. They learned their lesson, it's also not $70 million in liabilities. Maybe $40 after Bitfinex assets in USD/BTC are liquidated. The customer base of the largest volume non-chinese bitcoin exchange in the world is worth prob close to that number.  
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:09:17
I have to say that for such a massive clusterfuck and amount of BTC lost I expected an outcome far worse. 
Not saying they aren't to blame, or that it isn't bad. But avoiding a 2+ year goxx situation and a 90℅ loss is more than I was hoping for. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:13:09
18.00 UTC is what I meant. And I hope you don't mean that customers with open positions just get to sit and see their position get liquidated while your trading engine is closed. Cause you getting hacked is pretty damn 'directly affected'.
@_date: 2016-08-15 02:11:07

@_date: 2016-08-12 15:52:32
Problem. Blocks are full enough that escalating transaction fees are threatening to make smaller (not micro, just under say $10) to be competitive time/price wise with even credit cards. Risks: Since Bitcoin has already forked to larger block size, not a lot of risks and definitely something that could be solved if focus was on block size increase instead of segwit etc. Solutions: Hard fork to dynamic or at least 4 MB block size. Faster progress to segwit etc. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:16:30
That would be my BTC skipping across the pond I gather. Later boys! :(
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:17:05
I'm not grasping at anything. I don't own Bitfinex. I'm just hypothesizing. Users aren't code. And while I don't know how many they have, I doubt that at the end of the day they have more than $20-$30 million in actual liabilities. 
That's still a fuckton of money of course. But not as bad as $70
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:19:18
Really? That needs an explanation? Ok. If they hacked his finex acct. They could use his email and possibly shared password to script attempts at 1000s of financial services in the hopes of getting in somewhere. That's why he would be getting 2fa notifications. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:53:18
So I am wrong. Or are you just an idiot that thoigh the project you listed were good examples?
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:39:03
Again, don't care. 64℅ asap and I can forget about it and move on. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:03:28
Yep. Any form of data showing thay we need larger blocks is no doubt faulty. The fact that fees are up to $0.30+ is in no way an indicator of block congestion.

Yes, cause every project you listed is a possibly world changing payment system. 
I also absolitely understand that HTML is a venture capital funded project just like the high profitable Wikipedia. I also hear the Linux foundation post massive profits every year. 
If you are going to make cocky comparisons, maybe not make research them a little so you don't look like an idiot since almost every listen project is ran by a foundation and not privately venture capital funded for profits.

@_date: 2016-08-11 14:55:47
They are finished. The only reason they have any coin left is intentional or unibtebtiobal delays. 
Look at the order depth for all their currencies. bitcon has a $25 USD spread, Litecoin fell 90℅ at home point due to no buyers and can't be withdrawn, buy side in BFX tokens was $25k total at one point. 
Their current hot wallet balance is ZERO!
I have one remaining small withdraw that I hope they can afford. Thats it.

On other news. I offer to buy any Bitcoin, tainted or not. Any amount up to 120,000 at 6℅ of market price. PM me. 
Aka. if you want a chance to actually have the hacker turn over the coin, don't insult him with 5℅. Nut up and offer 25℅+ or dont bother. 
If you think anyone figuring out how to recover them or name the hacker won't just take thay info to the hacker for 10℅+ you don't understand how money works, and I'm glad I got out. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:29:39
You would think service providers would have learned their lesson. There will always be a need for trading, for the simple reason that if there isn't your bitcoin has no value. Blaming the user is good and well but you don't see people blaming the customer when a bank gets robbed. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:31:24
Sure, but show me an exchange that hasn't. If you have to get home, you choose the least shitty road, you don't just sit down. 
Blaming the user, sure. But without services that can secure their shit, bitcoin will never take off.

What is "effective block size" in this context? Cause I'm pretty sure blocks have been at 1 MB for quite a while. If you are talking about mempool handling etc. Then sure, but not to the point that its even keeping up with volume, and that's in a climate where people are using altcoins to transfer value because they fear long wait times and high fees in Bitcoin.
I guarantee that a larger block size would bring more growth to Bitcoin than it is currently experiencing.

Well, for ME it's like the valet stealing my car. But it's not my insurance that we are taking about. It's the hotel's in that analogy. And in this case it's like the valet just gave the key to a random person, and the hotel wanted it back using their insurance.

36% is most likely out of total available funds and assets in the company. There is no way they survive or find any investor if they don't throw it all in. 
Literally their only chance is to go 'ALL IN' and hope future profits can cover it.

They currently have motivation to pay back as much as possible to remain solvent, using all available funds at their disposal. 
In a forced chapter 11 that motivation disappears, and they can easily use only funds they are legally obliged to contribute. 
Also, a team of lawyers could easily eat up $10 million or more over the course of a bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:25:40
Yeah, cause the thing to choose to complain about in this mess is having to pick a new password. Jezus, get a life.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:15:19
How can you request a password change and then put a withdrawal hold on accounts when the password is changed. I sent a support ticket and want my bitcoin released NOW. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:14:23
So they are socializing losses by letting short positions take massive profits, and longs get liquidated while they shut down? Ok. Well I for one am suing.

There is no "silver and gold" in crypto for the obvious reason that they aren't metals.

That's such adorable hyperbole. Satoshi cards sell all the time for 1 BTC each. Yes, that's a nice price as well but I haven't seen a single one sell for over 2 BTC in months. 
I would argue that it's probably a promotional gimmick. And I own 2 of them from the crowdsale so I have no reason to want to make them cheap.

I know, but it doesn't have to do with whether the funds were 'segregated' or not. The hacker just chose to go after BTC instead of ETH etc. Those accounts were equally insecure.

Fanboy? You must have some form of social issue. My point is that coinbase has had at least a post a day here for 7-10 months and they all come down to people being too dumb to realize that they are understaffed, overworked, and dealing with bank KYL/AML. You get the service you can expect. and by now, people shouldn't expect too much.

@_date: 2016-08-02 21:40:43

Most likely explanation right here: Your "unique" email was vacuumed from a cookie in your browser. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:19:01
Doesn't necessarily matter though since it seems the hacker got a hold of client account private keys and drained through them. Hot wallet will just keep serving what it believes is legitimate withdrawal requests from client private keys. 
Or at least that's my theory.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:26:43
1. Unknown (to me).
2. Socialized losses in 2015
3. No crypto track record as far as I know, and no declaration of Bitcoin security. 
But give it a shot. Just withdraw after your position is closed. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:32:15
The risk of detection is close to zero, especially if the hacker spends a few weeks sideways trading to establish his account. There are also several Chinese (mainly) exchanges that require zero identification for any order size if you use crypto-crypto only. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:27:15
119,000 BTC is a good start. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:30:51
This is the obvious way of guaranteeing profit from a hack and obviously what the hacker did. It also guarantees huge profits, independently if he actually keeps all the stolen coin.
There is a large enough margin market to make 100k BTC on a 25% drop with only 10k BTC in assets if you spread it over 2-3 exchanges. And room to hide the trades in the daily volume.
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:34:01
Crude joke based on the Bitfinex 36℅ haircut from the hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:56:56

From what I can tell. You will most likely have your position closed at market price as of 6.00 UTC (pre-hack) so you definitely won't lose any money. If they stay solvent that is.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:39:27
It's a lot. But not all my BTC. Why? I had some decent profit and Bitfinex had a good reputation. If you trade a lot you really don't have a choice. You can move it back and forth but it always has to be on a platform at some point.

@_date: 2016-08-03 22:18:28
So if you deposit money into a bank, and some people use USD and some use Euro and that bank goes bankrupt you think that the different balances will be treated differently? 
No separate customers got hacked. Bitfinex for hacked, and the loss targeted separate accounts. 
That has no correlation to who holds responsibility or who's assets they represent. 
You assume the same risk whether you deposit crypto or Fiat. The fact that you held a certain asset makes no difference. 
My opinion though. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:22:38
They will still be given the tokens, possibly not transferable off Bitfinex or traded according to US regulations etc.

BitGo insures against breaches so if that's the failing link, they actually are. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:35:18
And if you don't understand that resting funds can be lent out to provide liquidity for margin trading you should probably not speak like you grasp 8th grade finance. 
If Bitcoin value was based off of current services and goods provided we would be in single digit value still. 
The only reason it's traded at significant value is its properties as a value carrier and that is shouldered by the internal Bitcoin finance market. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:13:38
Not to worry. You still have a 2 day withdrawal hold even though Bitfinex themselves requested the password change. You cant make this shit up. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:13:38

@_date: 2016-08-08 13:03:39
Battered wife or not. I'll take 64℅ right now and just gtfo rather than 2 years of lawyers and a 90℅ haircut. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:14:48
Not so much arguing as saying that the need for capacity is immediate and not a surprise to anyone as it has been a steady increase for 2+ years. If you can't as a developer team for see this in 20 months you are simply bad. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:04:42
No. It didnt. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 06:12:10
You can view that point from two sides. There is definitely an argument to be made that exchanges without trading fees are not equal to ones with. You drive a LOT of traffic allowing fee less trading. 
That said, I think most exchanges even in China now do charge fees. In which case they should be counted. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 13:54:43
The BTC only haircut is massively illegal in every possible way since it's proven without a shadow of a doubt that the coin was not lost due to any form of customer negligence. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:33:40
Fingers crossed all over here. But I don't have much hope.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:49:36
I'm fine with going back to the $25 use case. In my opinion Bitcoin should be usable as an alternative at least at the same fee as credit cards for transactions of "pizza size" to reach mass market adoption. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:04:52
Bitfinex isn't MtGox. You are thinking about a time when 90% of all trades happened through a single exchange and they lost ALL fund access for 1+ year. Doubt that is the case here. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:34:53
True. But if he risks something that can be solved, theoretically a larger percentage is a larger incentive. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:02:00
I believe you. IF you send me a bunch of BTC and I can trace the origin to the hacked coins. Pm me. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:08:45
Says you. I don't give a shit if I can withdraw my 64℅ 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:16:36
I'm not talking about US exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:45:03
Almost all drugs have that potential, so.. not too far off. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:03:33
I'm not saying that you are wrong. Just reporting my experience. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:16:27
And so practical, with Fiat options and margin trading. Right? 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:03:53
Two options. Either you did and you are the single dumbest person on the planet and will get doxed and robbed. Or you are just a troll, and will get doxed and beaten. Have a fine day. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:47:23
My guess is that they rushed pre-alpha out the door to be able to sell some Maid for BTC because their dev fund is empty. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:24:40
And if you do, you definitely will lose your money since it will drive bitfinex into liquidation and the lawyers will take whats left. If you think bringing regulators into a hack has ever been a bad idea, then you must be pretty new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-24 13:46:20
Yeah, they probably spent $120 million on raspberry PI's, good thing you explained that. No possible way that the PI was just a reference hardware platform for their software suite. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 20:59:33
I could probably point you at 10 people that control 100k BTC each. But most of them would require a hefty premium on selling, and some wouldn't sell at all so 1 million. That's a tall order. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:09:44
Small potatoes in the grand scheme. Maybe 5k BTC. Mostly went bankrupt because the CEO made cash withdrawals and left it to die. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:12:47
You shouldn't be so bad at trading I guess. /S
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:02:59
they have ownership in several startups, at least $10 million cash and a significant amount of BTC and altcoins. I think their assets are $30 million+
Also the multiples that compares pay for verified users on trading sites are insane. A user can be worth up to $500 
@_date: 2016-08-15 01:24:31
No. Send them to me and I'll make sure they get into the hands of a rightful owner. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:29:11
Please explain more. I have never gotten a remote palmreading from someone that took half a semester in criminal justice and really knows how people work. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:35:19
Yeah, it's not like people have been complaining about the lack of block size increase since 2013, so it's pretty much just FUD.
It's absolutely ridiculous that developers have known about the issue for over 2 years (as an urgent matter) and we are still waiting for a slight increase via a solution that doesn't actually increase blocksize. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:21:13
Not on a scale different from any other exchange. I'm not saying they were perfect, but as good as any other alternative available for trading. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 20:07:23
So they will release what.. 190 bytes of data.. sweetest!
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:07:20
So they should advertise themselves as "Almost secure" and expect customers?
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:17:47
So you are saying that a scam currency now has scam scam accounts? :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:47:49
I won't miss it either. But I can honestly say that I didn't see a hack of this magnitude coming in 2016. Just seems like such a vast amount of incompetence that it borders on criminal. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:26:53
You worried you are going to lose them twice?
@_date: 2016-08-17 20:57:10
And be the first on the market to... Oh there are 900 already?
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:24:42
I'm not saying there is evidence. I am saying that IF his Bitfinex account is to blame. The reason he would get a 2fa is that his Bitfinex account info matched his mutual fund login, hence promoting the 2factor to send him a login request. 
He obviously wouldn't be contacted by services here he holds no account as his emails and password would he silently rejected. 
It has happened to many people, and it's a technical explanstion. Not proof that Bitfinex is to blame. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:50:49
Ah. You must refer to my posts that BFX coin is worthless and that I'm out with all my crypto. 
Oh no, it's my comment on how I think Bitfinex will be insolvent within days. Thays probably it. 
Yeah I can see how that is shilling for Bitfinex. 
Damn child. You dumb. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 02:03:43
Measured? You do realize that you are a child online. You just might be overestimating your importance to me, and well everyone. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 11:45:13
Oh sweet child. Either you really are too dumb to understand when someone is making fun of you, or... Honestly, not sure what the alternative is. 
Also. English, despite not being my native tongue seems to be something I master quite a bit better than you. Grammar master.

That's a lot of eBay gift cards. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:01:00
And they won't get it back since in a chapter 11 all the crypto will be liquidated and USD pooled, then lawyers take 50% over several years and Bitfinex management has no incentive to do their best to pay back. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:33:43
No. They aren't thorough. They just move from town to town with an army of coked up car salesmen scamming people.

Dude, I'm not supposed to have this much knowledge...
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:22:49
No I was specifically talking about holding BFX to repayment or withdrawing USD from Bitfinex. Or I assume hold BFX over the fiscal year if it is considered a debt asset in the eyes of the US authorities. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:08:27
What a fucking joke this is turning into. 2+ years of stalling something that a 5 year old could extrapolate would be an issue.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:03:58
Sure. But I have multiple Bitcoin wallets, and god knows when my first and only deposit to Bitfinex was. Over a year ago, from one of the wallets. With 100s of transactions.

Aww, of course you do kid. Of course you do.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:55:50
Where are these lawsuits OP? And how would waiting a few months and forcing customers to accept unsolicited shares have solved anything?
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:38:50
36% is honestly somewhat lower than I would have expected. It's fucking terrible, but lower.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:28:16
Socialized losses aren't exactly looked upon very well by financial oversight. If I am unaffected, and you close the trading engine with my position open you carry liability for my position.

@_date: 2016-08-14 03:06:32
You do realize that their "volume" to a large extent right now is their own BFX shares and people just buying crypto to move out of their systen. Remind me in a month to check their by then nonexistent volume.

@_date: 2016-08-03 16:31:38
See previous answer. I'm an active trader and the money just happened to be in BTC at the time of the hack. If you are going to trade you have to at some point have funds on an exchange. Just happened to be a bad time, at the wrong exchange.

If they want it all on trezor yeah. Obviously what they mean is to segregate Wallers only hot/cold on trezor but it's still not a viable optimal solution.
@_date: 2016-08-16 11:56:02

@_date: 2016-08-02 19:16:44
Their statement is that positions that are closed will be so at UTC 6.00 price. That's 1 pm central time. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:46:44
They have already stated that law enfrocement is involved. That being said. Pretty much everyone agrees that black listing funds is a terrible idea that threatens bitcoin more than it helps anyone.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:45:01
They lower the fee, and relieved block congestion so that the chance if at least one confirmation within an evarage of statistically lower than 10 min is ensured. Now that might now solve the problem but it allows payment providers to trust their systen and fee schedule.
@_date: 2016-08-14 02:43:52
Yes. I have $70 million and/or 200.000 combined Bitcoin from 2009 I can leverage to steer development based on my own vision and private motives 
I'm not arguing they are inherently evil. I'm just saying thar a high concentration of power in a private company developing an open source community project isn't necessarily a good thing. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:32:15
If you believe Bitfinex stole the Bitcoin I would have to argue that it's most certainly wrong. No sane person would steal from their own rapidly growing and profitable startup. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:46:28
I doubt it. But progress has been delayed by at least 1-2 years and held the door open for competing projects.

There is no country in the world where you lose $60 million and don't involve the federal authorities. That in itself would constitute a crime and they aren't complete idiots. 
The fact that they aren't stating who it is is more likely to be due to legal advice than anything.

You are either kind of a social misfit or plain dumb. Oh well. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:00:19
No..this is what happens when fees increase so fast that payment applications standard fee structure can't keep up. This isn't a user issue, it's a Blockchain scaling issue period.

Yep. Oh well, buy the ticket, take the ride I guess. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:24:02

Of course. But the black marker Bolivar hasn't increased linear with volume.
@_date: 2016-08-26 17:48:11
Not true. Unless you truly day trade or margin trade you can use Bitstamp with Trezor, or shapeshift with KeepKey integration and stay safe. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:32:28
Buy a $99 Keepkey, follow the instructions. Literally no easier way. I own 2 of them and sleep like a baby.. when I'm not trading and losing 250 BTC through a fucking hack that is.

@_date: 2016-08-12 17:03:31
... that's not how blocksize effects transaction fees. It's not a 1:1 relationship or even close. As evident by the increase that rise exponentially with full blocks. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:42:30
Yeah, i feel just terrible about picking up 200k at 0.0021x and selling at 0.0047x. Obviously, now I'm back in BTC

What makes it FUD or illegitimate? Nothing. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:59:01
Cause it's exactly how bitcoin is intended to work maybe?
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:03:37
I doubt that throwing up a few thousand nodes will be a huge issue for a group that has $100s of Millions invested in bitcoin mining. I also don't think node owners will want to kill bitcoin through a civil war between miners and nodes.
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:01:41
They absolutely can. That's the point. The people that have the most stake in the survival of bitcoin are supposed to be able to vote on changes. It's a self governing system that the value of  what you produce is controlled by the people producing it.
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:33:35
BIP75 is its own system since it's not core protocol. Jezus these things seem hard to grasp for some people. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:56:01
They can easily take over a majority of nodes. With nodes and hash power they will be on the only chain of value. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:49:24
Bitcoin price up $45 already. Not so sure it's just a 'rumor'..
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:13:09
Setting up a few thousand nodes is trivial for a group that has $500 million invested in mining equipment.
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:44:30
People also need to understand that unless we want an Ethereum situation where a few developers and spokespeople decide direction for the rest, this is exactly how bitcoin is supposed to work. The miners, the ones that have most stake in the success vote on proposed changes with their hash power. If they have majority, that's what goes. It's the very intent of the network to function this way. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:47:37
So does the average cost of manned space missions, and the GDP of Spain. What's his point?
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:02:56
Doesn't matter. If the network forks, and some people choose to stay on the old chain, they will be on a network of near zero value as the hash power of the network represents the value of the integrity. You can start  your own Bitcoin today, and just call it bitcoin, your own fork and your own network. Nothing is stopping you.
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:34:33
There should be one for "I've known about Bitcoin for 2 years and that makes me an expert" as well. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:15:33
Nodes are a footnote. Do you think that 1. Current node owners would go to war with 90% of the hash power? 2. It's anything but trivial for a group that controls 90% of hash power to setup a few thousand nodes? 
Think McFly.
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:45:04
There is no 'allowed'. It's open source, if you have majority hash power you can vote through changes. Period.
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:56:24
Amen. If the developers come out against a majority vote through hash power it literally means that they are coming out against the very core of bitcoin (irony much?). 
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:30:44
What value? The value they hold is in Bitcoin. If their coon end up on a chain that isn't secured their value is gone. The majority hash power chain will by default be the real Bitcoin chain, and the forked chain will be essentially worthless. With 10 day confirmation times and completely open to 51% attacks from a dussin miners. All services will accept the strongest chain as relevant. How is this hard to understand? The ecosystem has already proven that it moves to strongest fork several times when Bitcoin forked.

@_date: 2016-06-30 13:34:51
Thank you. Amazing that core devs don't understand this. Also, since majority rules they are now forced to support the 2 MB limit, since it is supported by a majority of the hash power.

@_date: 2016-09-13 05:07:15
Sorry but your arguments are the same lame bs that Lukejr keeps spouting. If the bitcoin network isn't allowed to expand to the technical limits it will get replaced. You can't take into consideration that some people want to rub a node on a 0.5 Mbit connection and a toaster. 
Considering how centralized mining and nodes already are it doesn't matter if the client requires 10 Mbit and 10 TB drive space. Bitcoin hasn't been perfectly decentralized node or mining wise in years and it will never be again. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:36:10
Yeah, full blocks are probably coinbase fault. Lets just put out a PSA recommending people not to use Bitcoin when blocks are full that should solve the problem indefinitely. Thank you for your constructive input and deep understanding of crypto and finance. 
Everything will be fine when private sidechain launch in 2 years. Until then, let's just go easy on the whole "sending transactions" thing. Pretty sure that's not core functionality anyway.

@_date: 2016-09-15 15:51:35
The fact that Bitcoin core has grown to a majority position well before their stance on block size was clear is unfortunate in my opinion. But yes you definitely have a point. 
I would like to argue that the community is quite a bit bigger than just nodes, and that miners are overwhelmingly on the side of block size increase thoigh. 
I don't think it's a stretch to say that core are abusing their dominant position.

"Haven't even reached block capacity yet" Yes, we have. Looking at the blocks and saying 'we haven't reached capacity' at this point is plain dumb. What is happening is that people aren't using bitcoin for small transactions because of the fees, and blocks are still full.

If they weren't, we would have larger block size already. Sorry to burst your bubble. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:11:45
Absolutely not what I mean. My point is just that the amount of information that core makes public is minimal, which leads to a very 'just trust us' attitude. Needless to say, no one should 'just trust' anyone when it comes to development of a open source technology.
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:31:19
What? You seem like you might be off your meds kid. My main argument is that Core should communicate better, not sure how that translates into a cry for authority. 
And as far as my gripe with LukeJR, that is simply based on the fact that I wildly disagree that we should hamper adoption and technical strides based on the notion that we can't expect node owners to run hardware from the last 5 years.

Oh nevermind. . . 
@_date: 2016-10-12 14:07:41
1. Wrong. Bitcoin has not had 1 MB block size limit since inception.
2. Absolutely, but is it likely? Definitely not. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:00:58
No. Seriously I don't understand how people don't get this. Miners are on the side of bigger bitcoin blocks for a very simple reason. Viability of mining. Period. 
If you want a secure Bitcoin blockchain you need miners. If miners don't make enough money to cover their investment they will NOT MINE. 
Over time, if Bitcoin is to be viable (have miners propagating transactions) the fees included in a block have to cover the investment required to mine.
At 1 MB blocks, this would require fees to be a magnitude higher than they are today once mining reward halves once or twice more. 
Lightning etc. as a function of their construction will siphon transaction fees from miners income as those fees are not disbursed to miners. 
TLDR: If blocks remain small, and SegWit/Lightning diverts enough fees mining will become unprofitable. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:58:15
Ok, apparently I need to do more research because I am being told two completely different things by two well versed developers. It does seem like your explanation would be correct and that depending on scenario I was either wrong, or at least ill informed on the dynamic of the available space. 
Thank you for taking the time.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:07:20
A weekly digest? A newsletter, assigning a single member to communicate etc. 
Almost anything is better than letting the community dig for information and answers on their own. 
The fact that so many people are confused about their stance on hard-fork (do they want one? When? How?), Hong Kong accord (did it exist? Who signed it? Why) and many other issues shows that there is an information need that is clearly not being met. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:30:25

@_date: 2016-10-24 17:18:45
And who will pay for these contracts? The entire point of block rewards and fees is that it is something that is built into the network. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:15:32
Why? He, as apparently no one else speaks for core?! Apparently 'core' is the only community of programmers that commit large scale changes to what they call a 'reference installation' without having a single person be able to speak on behalf of them.
@_date: 2016-10-21 18:28:01
So maybe not keep 1 MB block size and make mining unprofitable after next halving due to Lightning siphoning fees off to a separate channel? 
The fact that people seem to not understand that miners need bigger blocks in the future because they will be on-chain fee reliant for their income is astounding. 
And for the record. Most developers recognize that this is an issue, not just 'tinfoil hat fuel' or conspiracy. 
If 1 MB blocks hit a fee-pain threshold that is lower than what cost of mining is once block reward halves once or twice more we are endangering the network. 
For the record: I am for SegWit, Lightning, Blockstream and all other nifty things. I just prefer we let them live together with larger blocks so that miners are motivated to mine as well. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:37:32
Good luck at next halving when miners drop out like rats because 1MB blocks can't sustain fees high enough for miners to pay for power. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:28:27

That's a very naive way of looking at it. There is absolutely no guarantee that miners will handle millions of transactions unless we accommodate scaling of Block size.

@_date: 2016-10-12 18:37:39
I agree. My main criticism has always been that a hard fork could have been done literally years ago, instead of stalling for SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:11:26
But it's impossible to extrapolate acceptance rate based on innovation. Since we do not know the underlying reasons or tail-end implementation. 
My point is mainly that the last 25% to install can be years out in time, while first 10% can be within hours.

Oh dear, that's not how it works. Jezus how is this not understood. What 'you' use isn't the issue. The issue is that until nodes and miners upgrade to support it in an overwhelming majority it won't work as intended it will only cause network issues and confusion. 
Pretending that SegWit somehow will solve scaling on implementation day or even months into activation is just bad practice, cause it won't.

No it doesn't. At 75% acceptance set for unlimited hard fork the proposal is less controversial than SegWit. Either it reaches 75% or it doesn't. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:40:20
You must be new here. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 18:46:17
And since miners have zero reason to destroy the blockchain, or create blocks so large that fees amount to zero this is the best proposal. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:07:38

@_date: 2016-10-20 18:46:12
I'd like for everyone to read the white paper and stop pretending that miners are some form of irrelevant flange of Bitcoin and realize that between nodes and miners lies ALL the power in the bitcoin network. 
The current situation where a small group (Yes, core is a relatively small group of influential contributors measured by recent commits) developers that should have zero influence on the bitcoin network basically dictate development due to having 'inherited' a majority solution is a bastardization of bitcoin in every form.
An no, I'm not a tinfoil hat that thinks that Core works for the NSA, CIA, or is purely driven by some masters and overlords in Blockstream, but they also were NEVER supposed to just choose a track for bitcoin development and disregard all other voices. 
This is why having a privately funded company, with a stake in a specific developmental direction paying the salaries of bitcoin developers is a terrible idea. 
The fact that they broke the HK accord, and now seem to have dedicated themselves to total radio silence over the block of SegWit is nothing if not proof that the ecosystem is in a sad state. 
I would also point out that in the history of Bitcoin, at no point has a majority of miners (discounting unintentional 51% limit passed by  a pool once or twice with no adverse effects) colluded to anything detrimental to the ecosystem. 
And if we do have to trust someone, I trust a community with over $500 million invested over a group of fairly politicized programmers every day of the week. 
But the most depressing part is that we wouldn't even be having this conversation, if the core group were willing to communicate as one would expect from a group of developers playing a major role in a $10 BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT, but apparently that's too much to ask for. 
So instead we get snippets, opinion pieces, chat logs, and the odd Reddit comment from scaring us with the 'death of decentralization' if we don't take into account all the 'people out there' that apparently has to be able to run a full node on a Laptop from 1997 and a AOL modem connection.
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:30:21
I understand your point, but the core of my argument is that if feels like a group that is more or less responsible for the future of a very large ecosystem could at least make an attempt at communicating in a less convoluted way than currently. 
Yes I agree that I could take on the task of digesting the core group work, opinions, chatter etc. into some form of condensed 'report' but coming from someone outside the group what value would it hold?
It just sort of feels like they (Core) would have everything to gain by being more forthcoming and informative with the community. If nothing else, I believe it would disspell a lot of the 'conspiracy theories' if they simply made an effort at being less 'secretive'. 
Their choice obviously, I am just surprised at what I consider a lack of understanding of their audience. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:52:08
1. I know it's not 'strictly true' but for the purpose of technical progress it has to be 'mostly true' since we can't measure consensus by asking the general public or users with no in depth-knowledge of how bitcoin works. 
2. Absolutely, but that is a very poor measurement of the 'core of core' (pardon the pun), which is nowhere near 100 people. Lots of commits are fixes, updates etc. and have almost no impact on the 'direction' of bitcoin
3. This if true is a huge problem in itself but does nothing to dis-spell the idea of there being a a 'ruling group' within core that apparently does not represent everyone involved. Rather it creates more problems than it solves. 
4. If no one is in charge, how the hell do they decide what to commit? Of course someone or a group of people are in charge of what gets pushed to the core client, and that person or persons have a huge responsibility of not only informing the public but receiving feedback and relaying information. 
If Bitcoin was a mature project where a group of volunteer programmers as a community coded to patch issues, bugs or do general maintenance it would likely be fine, but it's not. 
Bitcoin currently is at a (pun warning again) fork in the road, and having direction being decided by a loosely put together group or programmers seemingly not led by anyone and unwilling to communicate or accept public input on proposed solutions isn't reassuring at all. It's scary as hell since the same group controls the reference installation of the client software. 
My point is that Bitcoin is a $10 billion dollar ecosystem, with a single reference installation that make up 80% or so of the install base, and apparently they don't feel the need to have any public facing communication channels at all, all while committing code that solves an issue in a single way, even though several solutions exist. And it doesn't seem like they are at all ashamed of fighting for 'their' solution, despite not having leadership. 
Just sort of sounds like a mess doesn't it?
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:41:31
No, what is meant by that? SegWit is currently not even in voting, and is already blocked by ViaBtc. There is literally nothing that even hint's at a solution to the congestion within the next 6-12 months.
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:42:23
'makes virtually everything it does public' then why is there so much confusion and so little answers to almost all important questions? Why do they not respond to any community request? Why did it take months for the 'HK accord' to be outed as basically just a few developers signing a document, and not 'the core group'?
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:39:29
Sure. The 'pain threshold' for a transaction in a 1MB block will if bitcoin succeeds be met quicker than for a 4MB block. I think that's pretty obvious. Hence, miners stand to make less from a 1MB block than a 4MB block. This can endanger their profitability when reward drops, possibly making the network less secure.
@_date: 2016-10-18 18:45:30

Since the lottery is based on a wide spread of possible prizes this is only true on theory. You are far more likely to win a small sum or break even then winning $8000. So technically yes, but winning a larger sum is still disproportionally unlikely. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:34:49
My personal 'beliefs' can be summed up fairly easily. 
1. I feel that the core group have done themselves a real disservice by stonewalling large parts of the community and a lot of miners. Being unwilling to compromise, or even listen to a statistically relevant group with serious concerns about their motivation and technical solution has created a rift in the bitcoin community that will be hard to bridge. 
2. I understand that miners are concerned about SegWit/Lightning for the main reason that over time it threatens their very existence. Looking ahead even just past next halving there may arise a situation where mining feel are unable to make up for the shortfall of mining reward due to lightning network siphoning fees away from the bitcoin main chain. 
3. I do recognize that many members of the core group are entirely reasonable people, and I believe in large they have bitcoin's best at heart. That does however not mean that anyone opposed to their proposed solutions are 'terrorists' or irrelevant. That's not how the community should work, it's not how the Satoshi white paper was written or intended and it's detrimental to bitcoin. 
4. I believe that ViaBTC primary motivation for blocking SegWit isn't to 'disrupt the network', 'kill bitcoin' or some other tinfoil theory. I believe it is a stunt to bring core to the table, bring the issue of SegWit vs. other possible solution to the public attention and bring about some discussion. Miners aren't idiots. No one benefits from a status quo in performance/capacity.
5. The only thing I really don't 'get' is why core decided to mothball the idea of 2-4MB blocks combined with SegWit. I realize it may not be a 'right now' fix, but I would have expected them to realize that they can put an end to the entire debate by conceding that even with SegWit bitcoin will need a block-size upgrade in the next 12-24 months just to support base-transactions even if Lightning becomes the de-facto 'consumer chain' for smaller transfers. We need miners, and possibly creating an ecosystem where mining becomes a non-profitable venture is clearly detrimental to the bitcoin network security and viability. 
My 2.5 cents. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:49:35
Oh dear.. Because extra space for certain transaction types only, and a hard cap at 3.7 MB while payment channels siphon off 90% of fees isn't going to help miners one bit.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:14:16
That's news to pretty much everyone. Cause it has always been cheap transactions.

No, and apparently you are too dumb to understand variance. Here you go:

What 'case'? How does that affect Bitcoin? That's like claiming that Luke's personal hygiene is a blockchain issue.

Exit scam. The new buyer only paid 70 BTC total. EV+ this is why we need Augur to go live. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 18:35:14
This is why we can't have nice things. Total silence from the people involved. And these are people that want to be just taken at their word. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:40:55
Noooo really? You think that a project that has been forced to fork twice due to shitty code should not be trading close to ATH :)
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:04:23
It's entirely possible that I was indeed provided false information. But that's sort of my issue. 
The information that is available isn't easily digestible at all, and if they had some form of 'official channel' where the community didn't have to read chat logs, email excerpts, tweets and reddit posts to piece together information it would only benefit the 'core group'. 
I guess I just don't understand how in the community where people actually vote on changes and updates, providing information seems to be of such low priority. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:00:15
Support for SegWit doesn't mean activation. Viabtc alone can block activation and have already proven it. Aka. no segwit. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:46:16
I would say that if you have issues with libertarian views on trade, Bitcoin might not be for you to begin with.
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:43:55


This almost perfectly describes the issue. If you are a group that is responsible for $10 billion in value and have grandfathered yourself a client that holds 80% of the usage how do you not make information available in a way that someone can digest outside of spending all your free time keeping up with what they are doing and why?
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:18:49
No, I don't want cliffnotes from developer meetings, and looking at the community's confusion neither are most people. 
I am not arguing that the developers can't code, I am arguing that without knowing their roadmap or vision the code is irrelevant.
This tells me literally nothing about their motivation, future vision, and opinions: 
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:40:25
So.. it's a good thing?
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:28:27
So being mistaken about something is worse than actively trying to destroy the community vision for 3+ years?
@_date: 2016-10-21 18:33:47
They would have not been around anymore. At all.
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:10:47
The comparison to Linux falls on the fact that for years Linux had a rather centralized development cycle where virtually all major changes were approved and committed by Linux himself, while the crowd team mostly sent code for review and worked on security and updates. 
The fact that you think IOTA Token is a 'scammy altcoin' only shows that you are willing to speak out on topics you have zero insight or understanding regarding so I guess that says something.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:54:09
Comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin isn't a thing. Ethereum has to dance around due to being insecure and finding security flaws that require them to constantly patch issues. Bitcoin has matured over 7 years, or are you implying that it's likely that a hard fork to 2 or 4MB will be followed by another fork to lower it to 500k?
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:21:36
1/56k for $8000 win @ $40 is still FAR better odds than buying a lottery ticket. Just saying.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:24:58
It's not a fucking personal opinion when you are part of the team that implements changes to the client that has 80% of the market, and claim 'Dead and buried' is the status of literally the only issue the community cares about. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:04:09
How could anyone have predicted that (sorry, would turn this discussion into another shitfest ala-4chan
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:59:27
That's not how lotteries work. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:55:23
Ok, well let's make it simple. Yes, blocks can be 4 MB BUT the useable size for transaction data is still only 0.7 MB larger. So it's not the same as scaling to 4 MB
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:52:20
They make most of their money in exchange rate arbitrage. The fees wouldn't even keep the lights on.

@_date: 2016-10-26 14:37:09
Says what? At least LukeJr has said the discussion of larger blocks is dead and buried. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:46:56
No. This is actually a worst case scenario in an environment where the code base determines implementation. In a perfect world we would have 3-4 separate clients sharing code on a user-opt-in basis instead of code basically being able to do whatever they want being the reference client.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:14:17
Listen to and lower the block size. Perhaps at 128k we can get this thing going. (I am not joking, he really does think 1MB is too much)
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:51:32
Fraud based on YOU handling your Bitcoin in a way that is unsafe yes. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:36:55
Agreed. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:02:20
OK, let me qualify. I don't mean that the information is 'impossible to find', my point is that the 'core group' could make it so much easier by informing the public/community instead of what is the current situation.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:17:16
Don't worry, MySpace will make a comeback any year now. Just give it time.

@_date: 2016-10-26 13:16:18
It already isn't. There is zero reason to use Bitcoin right now. It's not private, it's slow, and fees are higher than bank transfers.

Probably the reason Bluetooth never reached market.

There is a very easy way to prove it. Just allow all onescam holders to sell any amount via an exchange at the price 'claimed' to be market price. 
Shouldn't be an issue if Onescam is truly worth so much right :)
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:29:01
The amount of people that run a full node at home on metered internet is already almost irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:10:09
No. Bitcoin exchanges can however very much experience a 'bank run' if they provide margin positions without appropriate coverage or trade using marginal bitcoin holdings. 
Bitcoin, no. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:37:23
Nothing to see here. No need for larger blocks. All is fine.
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:57:05
OK, so then (and I honestly don't know the answer) doesn't LN pose a risk to the bitcoin network in that it siphons off fees otherwise benefiting miners possibly weakening the security of the main bitcoin chain? 
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:39:10
That's not how acceptance work. Just because 10% upgraded day-1 doesn't mean 100% will have upgraded by day 10 or even 20, or 30.
@_date: 2016-10-04 17:02:53
There was 48 hours of 99% full blocks just last week. It's not an uncommon occurrence and not spam induced.

Again, how does this affect bitcoin? You seem a little mentally slow if you can't follow an argument. Is Roger a reference client developer? 
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:17:47
I like that you are so autistic that you take two words from a conversation and draw conclusions. 'core should' was actually preceded and followed by something. 
I'm not sure you understand how arguments work. Arguing that more information makes the situation worse for core is about as dumb of an argument you can make, unless you are implying that it's a good idea to withhold information from the community. And I sure hope that's not the case. 
And where is this good enough communication? Cause so they haven't even as much as responded to 100s of requests from the community regarding their position on block size, Viabtc.com segwit blocking etc. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:50:22
They aren't. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:40:42
How is 51% attack relevant a relevant concept in acceptance voting? I'm pretty sure neither 'side' has any interest in disrupting the process of consensus votes, unless they prefer to just break bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-10-26 13:47:50
No reason to panic sell, bitcoin won't die in a day. It will be a slow decline as it is passed by other technical solutions that actually can scale.
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:13:28
And is 1 MB a meaningful blocksize limit? Claiming that smaller blocks somehow creates higher rewards for miners is an old and dumb argument since in a future where bitcoin is widely adopted, 1 MB would lead to prohibitively high fees while larger blocks = more transactions = more miner income. 100 transactions @ $100 is less than 10,000 @ $10
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:48:08
Uh huh, just orphan blocks until 75% becomes 95%, that will surely work. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:15:02
But core is great isn't it? Nothing to see here. Everything will be fine in 2018 when lightning takes over. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:17:42
If you believe that miners are fighting for larger blocks so that they can make less money then you might be misunderstanding how money works.
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:36:51

@_date: 2016-10-20 20:26:22
Why in the world would anyone trust to propose a hard fork for larger block size. He's on record for over a year arguing for SMALLER blocks, and that he will never support larger block size since it would 'break decentralization' (?). 
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:21:05
Yeah, they are probably faking the numbers because no one would ever find out. You selling those tinfoil hats or are they for private consumption?

Except that was considered a priority fee a few days ago.

Too bad the 'Trump Train' consists mainly of inbreds, high school dropouts and unemployed white supremacists. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:03:00
Doesn't fuck 13 year old's though so it beats Trumpcoin :)
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:45:26
The entire community couldn't even raise enough funds to pay the core developers. What makes you think we could 'just fund' contracts to keep miners running?
I'm sorry but the bitcoin community is in no way altruistic enough to make this happen. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:54:36
No, and you are wrong. Segwit and it's components has a place but it's not instead of hard fork. To guarantee miners a chance to stay relevant blocks need to be bigger to provide fees when block reward decreases. It blows my mind that so many people don't understand how Bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:46:57
Wow, you are not the brightest even in your home school class are you. Go ahead and boot up your 'segwit wallet' and enjoy. You also just missed my massive typo since it adds a max of 0.7 MB not 1.7 so obviously you are just crazy well informed.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:47:36
That's an inherent risk in Bitcoin. If you propose that we should not move technology forward due to the possibility of bad actors or technical risk Bitcoin is already doomed.
@_date: 2016-10-12 19:30:50
I had this discussion with core developers less than a month ago, must be something quite new for it to change. Unless you mean that 4 MB blocks can be paired with SegWit, not SegWit is a capacity increase to 4 MB
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:49:30
"All evidence" Looks like around 20%+ right now, and that's taking into account that core is the 'default' client for many that simply use it unaware or not caring what happens development wise. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 20:27:27
There will be no HF proposal if SegWit is passed. No chance in hell, no matter what they have signed or said. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:31:24
SegWit will take 2 years to reach acceptance widely enough to reach the 1.7MB+ capacity dream on.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:09:58
No there aren't. And you also completely miss the point that is that as value increases, so will the need for the network to be secured by increasing hashrate. If diff drops 80% it becomes financially beneficial to attack Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:57:56
Uh-huh, with 1 MB blocks. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:48:42
In no hurry, takes quite a while for a project to die. Bitcoin is becoming the MySpace of crypto, and I guess that's fine.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:09:51
I wonder how Poloniex explains where they received the market making amount and motivation to list ETC, while being the market place where the hacker shorted ETH the days before the hack. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:08:15
That's heavily up for discussion. I would argue that once you deposit for example BTC into an exchange, your BTC is no longer the coin you desposited, but rather a representation of the value they hold. If Bitcoin forks, you only technically own the Bitcoin value, not any unintended code that was once attached to them. 
Or at least, I am certain an exchange could legally argue this.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:39:04
"Piling on Coinbase today" Where have you been the last 8 months? Every day is 'Pile on Coinbase'-Day.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:52:10
Yep, OP is lost in semantics. A split chain with 5% hash power, 4 day block times, and 51% by anyone is a useless chain. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:10:52
Why? Ethereum's fork has just proven that the sum of two competing forks is greater than a single one. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:17:56
I have had several good trades this year and don't really feel that crypto is a "oops I missed the bus" thing. I do however feel that listing ETC was premature, and the only reaaon it carries value is Poloniex listing. Which heavily calls into question why they would list the coins of a sidechain that could easily have been 51℅ attacked and still can. It's irresponsible as hell in my opinion and a clear power grab/greed move. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:50:23
TIL: 90% of the bitcoin community hasn't read or understood the Bitcoin whitepaper. We're fucked.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:20:53
I'll bet you whatever you want that they sell out. There are plenty of Casacius coins that run a 5 BTC premium, and are worth plenty less than 25 BTC

How the HELL do you get censored on ? I have LOUD opinions and am a general asshole and i have only been banned here. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:06:10
It's way worse than a stock split. But the market disagrees. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:13:56
Is it up to an exchange to handle a fork in any way they want to? Yes. Do people only care because some idiots think that two chains both carry value? Yes. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:42:25
Cause it has to, for obvious reasons. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:09:14
In this case, specifically their motivation to list certain coins over other. And specifically their decision to list an at least before their listing near valueless asset with a HUGE risk of a very quick death due to 51%.
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:16:10
Yeah, I'm sorry. There is no way that larger blocks leads to being able to include more transactions. My bad, that's not how data works right. 
See, I am aware that there are many solutions. But disregarding on chain scaling when there is no readily available solution elsewhere plain dumb.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:07:35
Could be because they are a bank. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:04:39
and saying that it's always wrong, is still not true.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:13:07
They have no reason to honor ETC at all. Why would they?
@_date: 2016-07-16 00:39:47
And segwit is NEW code. A block size update has happened before, and is exceptionally well understood. I mean I get that you aren't a programmer, but tell me it doesn't take you a week to figure out how to go from carrying one orange to two. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:09:55
Agreed. I would tip you, but the transaction fee would be larger than the tip if you wanted to collect it before the year 2080
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:42:19
Not sure you understand how any of this works. Payment size does not decide medium. If you want to use PayPal, go ahead. I want to use bitcoin proper, not some fly by night off-chain solution. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:48:56
They aren't yet. Saying that bitcoin is going to go up, doesn't mean RIGHT NOW! 
@_date: 2016-07-16 03:46:01
When you ask the question matters to what answer you get. Being wrong once doesn't mean you will continue being wrong. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:52:36
Oh dear sweet jesus. You do realize that going from 200k to 1 MB is the EXACT same thing as going from 1 MB to 2 MB, or 4 MB etc. The only change is bandwidth and storage (mempool).  Please tell me you understand that concept. 
Block size is FAR more well tested than any of the other solutions like Segwit, lightning, blockstream etc. that aren't even functional outside of pen and paper. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:55:48
Very true. But assuring uninterrupted access to some form of financial means is pretty high on the list as well.
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:36:46
You can mine altcoins with GPU and sell them for BTC. Actually often more profitable than mining bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:08:49

@_date: 2016-07-04 00:01:57
instamine-coin is still alive?
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:29:12
SegWit will add 0.7 MB to blocks over a possibly 2 year period. It's not solution at all.
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:11:23
and then lightning will make transactions super fast, sometime in 2024
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:17:41
In practice this is true. But in principle I believe that forcing certain transaction sizes to alternate solutions outside of the verifiable Bitcoin Blockchain is a terrible road to head down. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:56:28
Do about it? Eh, nothing. It doesn't affect me if people want to value an instance scam at whatever they want.
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:48:50
So, like bigger blocks. Or are you just making shit up based on your love for sidechains?
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:15:43
"Bigger blocks have not been tested.." I sincerely hope this is some kind of joke. Or are you really arguing that size increase of blocks hasn't happened? 
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:11:16
They should receive a lot of hate. Their motivation is shady as fuck, and there is a 90℅ chance in my opinion that they were "gifted" a lot of ETC from.. oh someone thay shorted a lot of ETH the days before the hack..
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:52:52
OP is 100% wrong, and this should be pointed out. Semantics has no place in this. Miners (hash power) are the ones that decide the fate of the network period.
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:21:36
I disagree. A hard fork isn't anything like a stock split. There are no intrinsic assets in a fork. At time of split, ETC were valueless. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 07:23:47
Nooo really? No shit sherlock. Every single post about larger blocks have been buried for over a year. I know 100 people that have been permabanned for discussing block size or disagreeing with mods. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:46:07
If you think nodes are going offline because of blockchain size, with no increase of block size in 3+ years. You are either too dumb to understand or simply ignoring reality. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:19:13
Yeah, fuck being able to send small sums with Bitcoin. Glad the white paper has no comment on upgrade path or the spirit of Bitcoin as something other than a settlement system for third party chains. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:06:55
Some shitty third rate WordPress site claiming 100.000s of users. Yeah no way thats a scam.
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:02:46
Says who? You don't own the coins as soon as you send them to an exchange. Its not "your coin" anymore, it's a value representation and a promise of sending x amount of an asset. Not the SAME asset you deposited. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:45:15
If you look at 99% full blocks, and 300% growth in transaction fee over 10 months and consider it to be no problem, then you are either an idiot or have an agenda. There is no middle road. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:14:35
Yeah. Clearly if you look at their coin listing practices they have never been involved in any form of pay-for-play listing of coins. /S
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:50:50
Yes, and that's why Hashing power = voting power and not the convoluted shit that OP tries to make it seem like. If you want to stay on a 'right chain' after it loses 90% of hash power and has 4 day block times you are welcome. But no one does.
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:39:03
In Crypto, long term is anything past 30 min.
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:47:32
I'm in for at least 10 as well. The reason I don't give a shit is that apparently there 'has been decided' that block size should just remain the same. No matter 99% full blocks and skyrocketing transaction fees. 
Start honoring the Satoshi white paper and I'll run nodes like a fucking crazy person.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:08:18
$200 million current market cap for a fork. That can't be ignored. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:01:10
Cause it's a tiny advantage, and risk destroying value if used.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:27:04
I doubt coinmarketcap.com gives a flying fuck about who advertises there. They rates are so high that essentially you have to be a scam to make any ROI on ads. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:47:59
When developers start honoring the Satoshi white paper and increase block size, I'll run all the nodes I can. Until then, fuck you.
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:13:51
Sure, but being ambushed by sudden value on a forked chain (which has never before been the case) cause Poloniex decides to list it for no apparent reason isn't normal practice. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:51:26
You are 100% wrong, and will always be. Discussing semantics is pointless, miners ARE the bitcoin network.
