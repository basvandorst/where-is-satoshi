It’s not really a fork. Updates to a codebase only count as a fork if the old codebase continues to be used. Likewise, a blockchain fork only occurs if people keep using the old chain.
A much more elegant way would be to speed up the block rate and wrap consecutive blocks of the standard 1MB size into a larger dynamic length chain. Still keeping a 10 minute ‘bookend/bookkeeping’ block be the block that accounts for fees and block reward payouts.  If done right then old wallets/etc could still understand the new blocks, still get transaction fees for mining the intermediate blocks, and it would leave the bookkeeping block to clean up FUD submitted as expected rewards by miners not up to date. Out of date miners would just fail the bookkeeping block submission. With the book-keeping block being the final say on fees and the block reward, divvying them up based on who solves each sub-block. 
The arbitrary 10-minute processing time on blocks has always drove me insane. Really blocks should be processed as soon as there are enough transactions to fill a block 100% or every 10 minutes, which ever happens first.  
The only reason bitcoin has stuck with such an asinine system is because miners want the fees and the block rewards to be high.  
It helps to think of the miners as individual banks, doing the accounting for the chain. They stand to benefit the most through higher fees at the expense of the users.

Not sure. I know the Pcap driver also triggers it separately.  
I’ll have to give the portable version a shot.  
On a related note, I really miss thinstall.

It’s a way an intruder could map your network easier.

Every time I put wireshark on one of my production infrastructure servers to troubleshoot something the networking team fucked up I get a nice(arguably deserved) nasty-gram from our security team.  
It only takes config management about 5 minutes to see the install, raise a compliance alert, open a ticket, and send out the automated email.  Followed by the angry personal email a few minutes later.  
Because I’ve set my stuff up correctly unlike the fucking networking team!

It’s not a crash until it drops bellow my lowest bitcoin purchase price of .30 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:56:21
Now just make it so that it doesn’t cost me $20 to send some bitcoin.

I see places like Kohl’s do this all the time. They mark shit up so they can run near continuous ‘sales’...

I’m buying a shit ton of litecoin right now actually.
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:17:23
I started the same thing. Then I realized there is millions of possible permutations in the key. It’s actually just as difficult to brute force the encryption.

Oh man. I had an idea for a dapp on eth a while back. But this seems like it would work a thousand times better for it. Now I need to learn how to write lightning apps I guess...
@_date: 2019-11-03 03:39:37
Oh damn, I can pick C or Java for my app instead of learning some goofy markup language?  This is gonna be easier than I thought.

Fuck, I bought the drop. History taught me that lesson with a paddle.

Find me actual laws that back that up. 
I can find laws and rulings that back up the idea that they can in fact purchase information from foreign politicians.

What is the sate your ass cheeks should be in if you ever have dealings with a member of the Clinton Foundation?
This is Jeopardy, right? And I'm not just talking about the state your life is in if you have dealings with a member of the Clinton Foundation.

Yeah, I've heard good things about Monero. I may pick some up and possibly spin up a node.  
I have 8kW of solar panels on my roof and they just changed our local regulations so that I'm not going to get my excess power back as a payout at the end of the year from my power company. So I'm just throwing money away right now and need to soak up more of my solar power.
I need to add battery storage to my solar panels and set it up so just my servers run off battery for the night and switch back and forth between battery, solar, and mains depending on battery capacity, solar output, utility rates and current mains usage.
I have more than just crypto stuff running at home so I'm hoping things like SIA and Golem can put any excess compute I have to good use, earn me money while they do so, and soak up some of my solar excess. I've also got 1gbps/1gbps fiber so I think I should be able to do well with them.

Pretty much. It's literally the most free-trade laissez-faire capitalistic thing currently in existence. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:22:10
Cryptocurrency is not anti-capitalist it's just anti-centralized banking.

Collusion is an anti-trust term and requires the cooperation for the commission of a crime. What crime do you propose they actually committed.

What's even more hilarious is how closely the Clinton's have worked with various Russian state owned enterprises in the past but suddenly she hated them come the election.  Kind of like how closely the Clintons continue to work with both companies from and the royal family of the United Arab Emirates known to fund terrorism and promote anti-female and anti-LGBT rhetoric world wide, but we pretend the big bad Russians are the real story.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:44:03
I hope so.

Deleting government property and declassifying data without permission of the data owner would be the two big ones. Can't prove she did without the emails to verify. Can't prove she didn't because she destroyed the evidence after it was subpoenaed. 
Either way a crime was committed and slick Willy worked out something with Lynch.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:46:21
Yup, those are the laws that back up my points.  Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:33:53
Me too. 
BTC, ETH, and LTC.  The three coins I see the most potential in.  I may try a few others as long term investments but those three are the ones I want to build new mining nodes for.
I'm running a GPU miner as a NiceHash node. I wish I could figure out the current ASICs to buy for BTC and LTC and a reputable source to pick them up from.  The last time I did mining was still in the CPU viable days for BTC.

Angry about hacked data about the possible criminal activities of the candidate, that's putting party over truth.
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:19:45
Nope. Just my guess. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:52:23
Solicitation of what? Again, this is another act that requires another crime to be committed.
I.e. Solicitation of prostitution; it's the prostitution that's illegal and you are soliciting an illegal service making the solicitation of it illegal.
Solicitation of information is legal. They could have legally purchased or traded for the information. The law only prevents donations of money, goods, or services to a campaign by a foreign national and not the purchase of goods and services.

That's biggest load of bullshit I've head all morning.  But my day is just getting started.
It's not illegal to be gay in Russia.  It's illegal to have media depicting gay people.  Huge difference from Islam's "throw the gays from the roof" approach.
Nice racism at the end there as well. No I'm not a "displaced white male."

Same here I spent way too many coin and sold way too many in the early days, when I could easily mine them myself. 
I actually lost 45 btc to mtgox as well. :-(
