It is ideally designed for the commonwealth of man. Grants power to the individual while forcing them to take responsibility for their finances. I believe this shift will flow into politics and we will see a more transparent government

If you own just one full bitcoin I believe

Sucks to be wrong huh! Market caps doubled since your vague comment 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:26:20
They could be waiting to dump post fork and then rise alts back up. People need to pay attn to BTC dominance because it's a good way to track the market effectively IMO

Holding is like learning how to be Jedi

Expect the market to dip, when it does buy more cheap coins!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:20:13
Easy money

Evading taxes. Just like in 1776 it's kinda the American way 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:25:17
Respectfully speaking the market could correct because people are fickle and will realize they don't get free coins. Or the confidence grows in BTC and it does indeed go to 8k. Guess we'll see ��

Entire crypto market has increased almost ten fold this year. At this rate, end of 2018 it could be almost 2 trillion. Just think of that

Don't be. Great answer

Bro they can't. They can just say they will. Then you'll see they can't. Along with everyone else. Moonshot proceeds

Not my opinion just a mathematical observation. Albeit an optimistic one

Someone told me bitcoin is stupid and a bubble. Then proceeded to tell me about peter Schiff and even said he has always been right about bitcoin. He also didn't know what a blockchain is. This kind of behavior is laughable, conformation bias on a national scale. I'm excited for when it flips the switch

Well his election was what made me buy. Best decision of mine and many others lives 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:30:14
Overall no doubt. Don't get burned on the "hot hand fallacy" like me. Big money wants small money

That sir, were the good ol' days... the trollbox was the shittiest thing man ever created. Now, move your coins somewhere else... Bittrex or Gemini

Once you get verified take all your crypto off poloniex. Find a wallet that's solid. They like to fleece traders so do it asap. After your good the coins are yours��
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:41:00
Also moving money through the exchanges constantly is a risk if your trading alts 
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:03:29
Polo has been compromised for a while now. They have new terms (utter shite) and they took 500$ of siacoin from me and lied that the transfer went through. Be careful. Not your private keys, not your coins.

I had this same thought �� literally days ago regarding bitcoin and the masses ��������
