A good reason for Mark to use Willy is to buy up BTC in order to make it possible for people to withdraw BTC, all while stalling fiat withdrawals.
He could blame banking and swamped support for fiat withdrawal delays, but had to keep sending out BTC withdrawals in order to appear solvent.

This is the really interesting part, in combination with:
    Resulting Random Number = (Server Random Number + Client Random Number) % (Random Number Max + 1)

The page basically explains it so that a 5 year old einstein can understand it:
1. The Game Client initiates a new game round by requesting a Server Hash from the Game Server.
2. The Game Server generates a Server Salt and a Server Random Number.
3. A SHA256 Hash of the combined Server Salt and Server Random Number is sent to the client.1
4. The Player can now choose to keep the pre-generated number that the Game Client provided for him or her. Or he or she types his or hers own Client Random Number in the Game Client. Whatever Random Number that is in the Client Random Number text box is sent to the Game Server.
5. The server now combines the Server Random and Client Random Number into a Resulting Random Number.2
6. The Resulting Random Number is used to determine the resulting Reel Positions.3
7. The Server Salt, Server Random Number and Reel Positions are sent to the client. The player can now confirm that the Server Salt and Server Random Number creates the same hash that was announced in step 3. The player can also verify that the Resulting Random Number generates the same Reel Position as was presented in the game round.
