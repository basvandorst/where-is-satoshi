Sure how much you want to give?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:15:16
Is that why BitPay had to disable their visa prepaid cards?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:02:16
Yeah and I have 20MW and my email is bigminer

A one night dream

That recipient would still only need a $5 wrench.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:35:45
I think we need futures to know the future
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:50:24
Some sloppy journalist made a lot of money shorting Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:38:31
The higher it gets the less stress I have
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:44:43
You didn't raise your hand?

If you can't decide. Hodl
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:45:48
Maybe the private key will only be delivered after 10 years
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:28:11
I am sure if you throw in a few billion there will be Chinese miners willing to switch to a banking blockchain...
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:06:01
We heard you Grumpy Smurf
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:56:06
It's probably just a small bite
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:53:52
I would do a strong password protected paper wallet. Give the wallet to receiver and let a notary release the password at some point
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:50:57
I wouldn't risk it having it stored digitally only
@_date: 2019-11-29 09:14:25
It used to be his password
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:04:19
Flash drives can die after a few years of not using them
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:35:53
But more channels to receive the chain is always good. Can't trust your internet if you can't trust the government
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:20:05
You get a lot of pussy for one bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:46:24
~~I stand corrected! Just so hard to believe :P~~
Ah Januari so that's like 2 1/2 years 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:51:17
North Korea tensions?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:29:47
Kim Jong-un is the real Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:51:58
HBO buying some bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:08:10
Well 100% is also possible. Think of a unrecoverable hack trough a security issue in the protocol
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:24:19
Well they would need to get trough your router first to get to your computer
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:25:15
Depends. Sometimes like bear sometimes bull
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:27:30
It's just a different kind of wet
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:41:13
2 years ago it was $230 so it is +/- 1500%
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:36:48
You made me look trough my email:
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:07:46
You bought a wife?
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:00:22
In 12 hours sounds pretty good
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:09:43
Unless "they" have access to your router too. Then nothing would show up
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:49:45
There's a slim chance it will be exactly 7k
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:30:02
Yeah that's were they refill the paper wallets
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:53:46
If it was an ico I would have suspected an exit scam.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:16:17
Like there is no other country in the world where people are awake?
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:19:37
You mean you're bullish?
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:54:43
He lost his hearing
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:49:36
Go back to sleep
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:45:34
Surprise while we're all distracted by Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:19:49
Well we do hodl
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:43:49
Want to touch my brisket?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:34:42
You can read the article here: 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:55:31
Neither can we exclude a 50% rise
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:53
Move to a country without capital gains tax
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:45:37
What's stop them? The Hodlers?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:21:24
If you don't manage to crack it and give up you should publish the wallet online and have fun at 1000s of people getting frustrated trying to hack it :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:57:21
Having a kid?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:19:45
Don't know a list but at least The Netherlands doesn't have it. They do however tax possession of Bitcoin based on the value on the 1st January.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:15:28
If no one sold we wouldn't have been able to buy
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:12:44
Possible on January 1st
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:25:45
204.51 USD
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:52:21
If every dog wants a Bitcoin I'm sure the price will go through the roof
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:39:36
Makes you wonder what other amazing hidden features exist
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:36:21
Get a mortgage /s
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:01:45
Now try to the API?
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:16:06
You do it yourself?
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:36:08
For real. A lot of banks use some sort of device over here. Normally small amounts or previously bookmarked accounts also work from mobile app without code. You can als prepare transactions on your phone and sign later.
I do always take it with me on holiday in case I need to transfer larger amounts.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:35:02
It is not 2fa. A transaction generates some sort of qr like code that we have to scan. Combined with pin and or chip card we can sign this transaction and get a code we have to type in again.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:04:39
Any info on that? It's just flash memory right? should have same problem
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:10:31
We are always halfway there
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:08:27
Everyone is here for the funeral
@_date: 2018-07-30 04:23:58
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:07:33
Their normal bank accounts use an external device with screen and camera that you use to sign transactions in combination with your chipcard. They would be smart if they protect this the same way
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:46:19
I received it too. Wonder where they got our mail address 
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:32:38
I get that prices go up and down but they show two different quotes..
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:31:44
Pretty sure Chinese internet has borders
@_date: 2015-10-10 00:36:22
Depends on your business model
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:42:54
That's not true. Almost 7 millionaire households: 
But yeah if enough people want one Bitcoin they won't get a whole one.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:05:32
Holding till $ 18750
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:56:18
Just buy 1 bitcoin. That will be your funeral fund
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:24:32
Are you telling me this is the Bitcoin echo chamber?
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:46:39
Hold on to your keys
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:20:46
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:39:52
And all I feel is fear. Now what?
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:07:30
I think he bought WordPress with Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:31:40
Chinese dont use dollars....
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:13:51
Me neither. Slowly peddling away from the moon?
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:23:54
Bits for tits
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:08:06
Is fodl the opposite of hodl?
