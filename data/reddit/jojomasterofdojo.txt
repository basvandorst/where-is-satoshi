Too young to acquire knowledge on economics? What specifically should I gain knowledge on with economics?

Thank you for your comment, it was actually pretty helpful. Acorns looks like a very interesting app, and really easy to use for basic investing, will definitely check it out.
What do you mean by using different indexes? I'm not entirely sure what an index for an exchange is.
I'll probably be playing with just a small amount of money from my portfolio to mess around with, but as you said I'm only going to do really obvious calls for these trades.

I'm ok, but thanks for the offer!

Oh, ok. As a completely newbie I'll probably start holding. Do you currently use coinbase or something similar to trade, and I don't mean to pry but could you live off of the amount your making(It's alright if you don't want to share)?

I see, thanks for the insight. Not entirely sure how to read charts and graphs of the crypto exchanges yet so I'm a little bit intimidated on trading (I'd probably lose most of it) but I guess right now is a better time than any to learn how to trade.

I was thinking I could do something like u/nismoman where they only use a small % of their portfolio. Do you think that something like this could work or not?

Oh wow, I never knew Electrum allowed a way I could accept bitcoin on a website. Once I have my web server up and running I'm definitely adding this to the site. It doesn't even look that hard to set up. Thank you for the link!
