Just read about it. Nick szabo’s work on the history of money is informative.

You forgot not talking/bragging about your bitcoin holdings (or else risking a good old fashioned gun being held to your head by some thug)

There are multiple reported cases of exactly that happening

Tribal societies used collectibles such as shells. Gold was a collectible originally. Any hard/non fiat money. Fiat is different because it was originally tied to a hard money (gold) and then after it became ubiquitous in society, governments went away from the gold standard and said it is instead backed by nothing more than the faith in the government.

We have not seen the evolution of a monetary good in our lifetimes. You need to look further back in human history.

“Used as money” doesn’t only mean used as a means of exchange. An emerging money, which is what bitcoin is, starts as a mere collectible. As it gains popularity, its price increases and volatility decreases, making it better suited as a store of value. As price plateaus and volatility continues to decline it becomes more viable to use in commerce as a means of exchange. Lastly it becomes a unit of account and people begin to think in bitcoin prices rather than fiat prices.

Right, that makes sense. Point is, we shouldn’t use mining difficulty as a rationale for why bitcoin confidence is growing or shrinking.

My stock investments are deflationary too, but sometimes I want to buy stuff for consumption now and so I sell my stocks and buy what I need.  Money doesn’t need to be inflationary in order to be good for means of exchange

Wences cesares tried to convince Buffett twice Unsuccessfully.  That douche from tron has no chance.

I think it actually hurts Bitcoin when proponents make charts that are intentionally manipulated to prove the point. If you like bitcoin then clearly you like transparency - So dont shill- just tell it like it is and the masses will come in time.

Doesn’t mining difficulty increase as the cost of processing power decreases? If so then why is this metric important?

News bulletin: bitcoin is volatile. Even when it’s not- just get used to these random pops up and down.
