You should've waited more
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:17
Wouldnt the smart thing to do is just lay down $4 worth in like 100 early stage cryptos?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:05:56
whats a nice chunk of BTC?
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:39:22
Please... You're ruining it
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:38:26
Really? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:32:05
Learning from the internet is okay if you have very good critical thinking skills. If not... you're going to end up extremely misguided.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:37:15
Except currency is supposed to be a stable unit for an exchange of services. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:40:58
How much are bitcoins now? Maybe I can afford some
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:41:43
Twas my case indeed
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:51:02
I can't say I disagree with the view in this video. Good points
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:55:05
Lol, are you 14?
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:40:50
Nope. Should be taxed 
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:23:24
I don't think you know what taxes are for
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:54:32
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:16:47
so is it a good time to buy now?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:34:06
I think someone would a bigger fool to get into the game now just because it's getting a lot of hype. When the hype goes down, might be a smarter move. I dunno really, what do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:20:18
I think I'd be part of the late fools. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:51:42
Dumb af comment. Not all cryptos use as much energy. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:57:07
Yes, Germany
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:22:02
Are you guys high or something?
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:01:16
The Bundespolizei are coming for you, sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:46:20
Actually... 
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:46:42
How do you deal with energy bill?
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:27:31
BUY THE DIP
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:30:35
Especially that a huge portion of late adopters joined in at 15k.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:05:31
Bitcoin expert = scientific wild ass guess
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:23:23
I've seen so many wanting to get in at 15k. It's just way too volatile to be sure.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:50:18
What is the current drop like in proportion to its highest peak compared to past ones? Given this pattern, how far would this current drop go?
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:45:10
I just called the police, they're coming for you
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:21:20
But it did redip a little
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:34:23
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:55:56
Ah right :). So could go down to 4k
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:20:13
I'm gonna wait for the reverse, but this could be the lowest.
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:32:08
It's so volatile though. It's closer to gambling than investing, and if someone can't acknowlegde that then they shouldnt be buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:08:55


This is why I'm not buying Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:35:30
I've been shorting bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:04:44
Tell me when and I'll probably buy my first bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:29:28
If only our IDs were actually using blockchain technology, we wouldn't need these annoying steps
