So, no worker protections then?

I don't know how you studied history and got that impression, but even if it were true, less regulation is not what's going to keep it from happening again (unless, of course, you have a massive army of skilled and unskilled workers willing to work for peanuts, which would technically reduce costs to the point where emerging competition could be possible).
Are you advocating removing worker protections too?

Yes it can.  Where do you get the idea that this won't happen?


Oh, there.  This isn't how it works though, because price isn't the driving force behind most non-essential buying decisions.
Edit: I suppose it could work in theory if you eliminated the minimum wage and literally all worker protections.  Then they would go to washington, take you out into the street, and shoot you in the back of the head.  Source:  I've lived in countries where this has happened.

Minimum wage, for example, required training, mandatory protections against sexual harassment, paid time off, pregnancy leave, sick leave, things like that.
See, your assumption is that "personal choice" is the determiner of people's actions, and "personal responsibility" determines the consequences, and when you make that assumption, you ignore things like human rights and fairness.  You're claiming that things like "cycles of poverty" don't exist, and that if the government took all the regulations off everything, then everyone's life would be better.  It wouldn't.  It would only be better for the people who hold all the capital.

By this definition of freedom, maximum freedom is achieved when my company is allowed to get big enough to create a set of circumstances where other companies aren't able to compete / break into the market.
How is that free?

It shouldn't even be legal to breed English Bulldogs.
