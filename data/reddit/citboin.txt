*Seignorage:* Profit made by a government by issuing currency, especially the difference between the face value of coins and their production costs. Historical: the Crown's right to a percentage on bullion brought to a mint for coining (and/or) a thing claimed by a sovereign or feudal superior as a prerogative.

That’s inevitable, but the US government will drag it out as long as possible. Cities need to start banning cars with IC engines, possibly California too. And ban cargo from the worst polluting cargo ships from harbors, so they’ll have to stop using them

Maybe it won't happen, but it's achievable. Cities with mass transit could do it easily and a state like CA could use the ban and higher taxes to fund new/improved mass transit and/or power grid improvements/subsidies.  It could be phased in quickly and methodically in NYC, over 12-15 years for example: Start by closing streets in parts of Manhattan to all vehicles and making them pedestrian/pedal only, then raise the tolls on all tunnels/bridges $20 each year for IC cars, gradually expand the ban to streets that run east/west or north/south in certain sections, then ban IC's altogether. I don't know anything about other parts of NYC but tolls could be useful for discouraging the use of IC cars.

Is that why it was downvoted? Personally I am stopping purchasing stocks and will be buying bitcoin, gold, and real estate exclusively. I am just going to cover my tracks as much as I can, now though
