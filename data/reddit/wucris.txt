That's lies sold to you buy greedy miners and people seeking to diminish the role of miners for their political agenda by branding them as centralized and big players only.
Truth is it's very profitable for consumers/individuals to mine so long as you pre-order your hardware from Canaan or Bitmain and these ASICs make faster ROI than GPU mining rigs with alts.

LIES you just don't want to share your slice of the pie. 
[An Antminer S9 currently produced $33.42 a day mining Bitcoin]( and costs about $1700 to buy if you pre-ordered it. By contrast a cheap RX 580 would cost you $250. Throw in say $500 for the frame, motherboard, psu, risers, cpu, ram you're left with $1200 which will buy you about 5 RX 580s [which mining the most profitable altcoin right now will produce a revenue of $20/day]( You'd be making 50% more with a Bitcoin ASIC and it'd make ROI much faster as a result.

And a hole lot of traders made nice gains on BCH that they then used to buy BTC with the profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:16:19
They're working on adding Segwit, and BCH is easier for them to add as it's pretty much compatible with what ever code they use for BTC. Implementing Segwit by contrast requires restructuring how witness data and address formats are handled.

With a [1080 the most profitable right now is Vertcoin.]( You can keep checking that page to see what's most profitable.
Ryzens are also very good at CPU mining Monero. So CPU mine Monero and GPU mine Vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:40:11


It should be noted that while BCH hashrate increased and BTC decreased while BCH was momentarily more profitable that NYA intent only dropped much slightly to about 87%.
[Currently in 24h period 88% are signaling NYA]( all the while currently [44% are mining BCH and 56% BTC.](
This is interesting because it shows that those miners who remained loyal to BTC rather than taking profits on BCH didn't have much affect on the amount remaining supporting the NYA on BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:56:38
* 44% mining BCash now
* Remaining 56% mining Bitcoin
* 88% signalling NYA 
So that means that of the total hashrate then 44% are mining BCash and 49% NYA (88% x 56% x 100).
Therefore 93% (100 - (44+49)) don't care for the current ruleset. 
Back when 10% only were mining BCash and 90% BTC there was still 90% signalling NYA. No matter how you look at it it's clear that the absolute majority of miners don't want to mine the current ruleset.

Only if you want to create an altcoin. If you hard fork to change POW it's no longer Bitcoin any more/less than BCash is.


Just wait for the market to kill BCH because of it's half ass broken difficulty algorithm. It's only a matter of time, the only thing keeping it's hashrate alive is that it's exploitable for inflation.

The main reason Garzik didn't add replay protection was for SPV wallets. With replay these users would need to upgrade their wallets. Without replay the client works just the same now so for most users (since few run their own nodes) then the transition would be smooth.
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:51:14


2 hours to wait for a confirmation isn't fast but admittedly that's a heck of a lot faster than I'd expect for only a $0.07 fee
Also notice how the last transaction before it was on 2015-01-20. Meaning there's over 2 years of Bitcoin days destroyed so that's why it didn't take half a week+ to confirm despite being only $0.07.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:06:15
It can't be a soft fork. It would cause  fork given the nature of it's change. You don't get to just choose if something is a hard fork or a soft fork. It either is a hard fork or it isn't.

It'd still exist but it'd stagnate. 
Blocks would take hours on end to solve on the legacy chain and difficulty months to readjust. The network is already congested too, with block times taking 10x what they do now (with only 10% of hashrate remaining) it'll also means 1/10th the transaction capacity of now. Fees will need to be high and since it'd be vulnerable to a 51% attack so users would need to wait for several confirmations and with each block taking an hour + they'll just stop using it. As a result most nodes will get upgraded to support Segwit2x.
Since most users use SPV wallets and Segwit2x has no replay protection then the transition will be seemless for them and they'll just spontaneously be using the sw2x chain.
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:47:27
So that you get it right away instead of having to wait 2 hours for the first confirmation.
Here's the TX Adam tweeted. [It took 132 minutes to confirm after broadcast]( which is actually much faster than I would of expected for a $0.06 fee.
Edit: If you look here you can see that [the transaction before this one]( to that address was done over 2 years ago. This means over 2 years of Bitcoin days destroyed (coins that have been held still rather than moved around more frequently have a higher priority). So that also may have helped speed this low transaction fee up.

You're assuming users want to  cling so hard to 1 MB blocks. isn't representative of entire the $70 billion network.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:22:54
Only if users also want the legacy chain. Otherwise sw2x becomes Bitcoin as users ignore 1x and so 2x becomes the profitable one.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:23:06
Actually it is since difficulty takes 2016 blocks to readjust.
Sw2x forks off 12,960 blocks after Segwit activates. This means that it forks 864 blocks after difficulty readjusts but 1152 blocks before retarget.
This means it has the same difficulty as when it was 100% of the miners but only 1/10th of that remains. As a result blocks will take about an hour and a half. 
This means that between blocks not only would you have to wait 1:30h for a confirmation but it'd take 2-3 months for difficulty to retarget, that in addition to higher fees (since now we're talking one block per 1:30h not every 10 min) and then need to wait for more than the 2-3 confirmations we're accustomed to (probably around 6-20) because of the risk of a 51% attack with a small hashrate (and these blocks take over an hour so that's a long time).
Then yeah in practice 90% hard fork kills legacy chain. If it was half and half both would survive however as block times would be bearable on both.

People deposit Bitcoin to trade. Some will take profits in Bitcoin also and then withdraw them. There's no point in trading if you don't take profits, of course not all profits will be withdrawn in Bitcoin but many are, people will trade alts and then buy BTC with those profits for example.
Also Bitfinex themselves needs to move around funds internally. They will use a different address to deposit each set of Bitcoin and that then needs to be moved to cold storage. Sometimes from cold storage they must move coins to a hot wallet. These internal transaction have lot of inputs and outputs. [You can view their cold wallet here](

1. There is an expiration time on when you must deposit BCH to the address requested by Bitmain. So withdrawing from Quadriga could take some time and not be instant. So it'd be a good idea to withdraw from Quadriga to your wallet then once you receive it in your wallet (you don't need to wait for any confirmations) you can then make the purchase on Bitmain's site and send the BCH there.
2. Yes you can send from your phone though that's not always the most secure means. Myself I'd suggest using Electron Cash on desktop (this is the BCH fork of Electrum).
3. Quadriga is good, Bitcoin.com is meh they don't exactly sound like the best business around but they should get the job done for you in this context.

You send USDT over the Bitcoin network. That's the whole purpose of it it makes sending the value of USD as easy as sending Bitcoin. USDT is basically just a color coin on Bitcoin. They take a few satoshis or some amount worth next to nothing and then print a digital finger print on top of it that says we color coat these BTC as USDT. So their value of BTC is worth pretty much nothing as it's so few BTC used to do this however since they have this label people value it not on the value of the BTC but based on the value of the label of USDT of which Tether redeems on a 1:1 basis for USD.

But when is the right time? I bet right now if Core put out a roadmap to increase block size the community would get right behind yet but we've been having these discussions for years and we still haven't fathomed a plan which has consensus.
If we don't plan this out in the near term does Bitcoin not stand to eventually become so decentralized that it'll be impossible for increase block size? Is it not better do address this issue in Bitcoin's infancy when the network is still relatively small allowing for such a  fork to take place far more easily?

It was canceled weeks ago so no it's not happening. Technically it would still fork if a large enough hashrate mined it to produce a block but they won't as it'd be worthless.
As for what actually happened here BTC1 said to fork `144 x 90` blocks after Segwit activated. The target time for Bitcoin of 10 minutes per block means 144 blocks a day so `144 * 90` as the code was written means 3 months after Segwit happens, or 12960 blocks after Segwit happened. That was the NYA agreement of 3 months after Segwit to hard fork.
Well Segwit activated at block height of 481,824 and 481824 + 12960 =  494784. The thing is the way the code was written it seem it mustn't of actually been adding 12960 to 48182**4** instead the way it calculated the fork height it added 12960 to 48182**2**. So the code inaccurately calculated the height Segwit was activated at.
So what happened here was the devs went off and told everyone that Segwit2x will fork at a block height of 494784 but in reality it forked at 494782. 
I'm not a dev so I could be wrong on the specifics but that's basically the gist if it as I understand it.

Of course you could also just buy a brand new ASIC that actually makes you a profit. No one is ever going to make a profit off a old KnC miner these days.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:02:18
If you want to stand to make any profit then you'll need to buy direct from the manufacture and often will need to pre-order two or three months in advance. I'd suggest buying ASICs from either Canaan or Bitmain. Once they arrive if market is good you stand to make ROI in about 3-4 months and then (depending on ASIC and market and electricity) $150-$800 a month thereafter with eventually diminishing returns. You can calculate this and factor in price and expected difficulty increases here 
As for the ones you find second hand, well eBay is where ASICs go to die. Everything on eBay is over priced it's where miners go to sell hardware that is A) no longer profitable for a high price to gullible people that will never make a profit but give miners enough money to place a pre-order to make them a profit off a new ASIC, or B) where people buy an ASIC direct from manufacture and try and sell it for 3x the price on eBay, if someone buys it instant ROI, if no one buys it that's okay because they get to mine with it and make an ROI that way.
If you just want to do it as a sort of hobbiest then I suppose you could get some real old miners second hand that will at best make you enough money to cover electricity. But at that point you may as well be buying one of those little USB gimics of a miner if you don't care about profits and just want to contribute to decentralization.

Yep. But you can still see if it's being moved around or if it's staying stagnant. Chances are if you see the address it's mined to transfer coins to an other address and they stay stagnant in that other address that it then means miners are holding it, they they transfer it out of that address then they're moving them around.

Offchain solutions like Lightning Network are decentralized. In deed there are means of scaling offchain that are centralized (like Coinbase users transacting between one and other through Coinbase).
That's why we need an appropriately sized block size. Bigger blocks lead to more centralization, however if blocks are too small it's reasonable to think they also lead to centralization. So we need to find an appropriate middle ground.

I just looked it up. At $0.10/kwh that makes you $15 a month currently in profit.

They wouldn't need to claim they were being hacked for that. They could just destroy some Tether and say it's no longer in circulation because it's been redeemed.
If they did this themselves and claimed it was a hack then it's for insider trading and nothing more. Sell Bitcoin and Tether and what ever on the open market, claim there was a hack. The market dips, buy back Tether and Bitcoin then release news (as they did today) that fiat withdrawals/deposits are once again open to individuals and that Euro deposits/withdrawals have been added then market recovers and they made a very profitable trade. Two very closely timed events, one to shatter confidence fallowed by one a day later to restore confidence.

From the[ Lightning Network whitepaper](


make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances**
(assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited,
and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in
the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard
fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to
participate in the network with the larger blocks.


micropayment channels, **to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks** (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

If you send 1 BTC to address X and that was sourced from address A then you have one input, the transaction takes up a small size on the blockchian.
If you have 1 BTC but it is spread out across address A, B, C, D, and F and then you send that 1 BTC to address X well now you have 5 inputs so it takes up a lot more space on the blockchain, you're fees as such are higher.

1 GB blocks doesn't scale adequately though. It leads to node centralization. With 1 GB blocks you need lots of disk space, you'll probably need an SSD cache drive, you'll need an ISP that can handle about 8x that (as nodes must downlaod that same block and propagate it among several peers), you'll need to handle the computational requirements of verifying all the millions of transaction in it every single signature and do all of this within 10 minutes, if it takes 11 minutes too do that on your hardware you can't run a node   because block times are 10 minutes, and every node in the network needs to do this. So if you have 1 GB blocks you can't have Joe shmo's laptop run a node, in fact you can't even have Joe shmo's VPS run a node instead you need dedicated hardware. So this means less nodes.
It's just more reasonable to only scale blocks minimally (somewhere between 2 - 128 MB probably depending on time span) and then find ways to most efficiently use that block size so that we can accommodate the transaction volume of 1 GB blocks but do so using only a few MB. Then we get far far more decentralization.

That'd meaning throwing money out the window that their competitors stand to earn as well.
Miners can far more effectively increase fees not by spamming but by limiting block size of which some are. Antpool, F2Pool, and 58Coin are cycling between blocks around 1 MB in size and blocks of under 100 kb. This is them driving up fees, no spamming required.

With gigabyte blocks expect you to need more than a typical gaming rig. You'll also need data center quality internet consumer broadband won't cut.
You shouldn't have to be able to turn a node on a raspberry pi, that's some crazy fantasy on that I'll never understand. 
The whole reason behind having LN is so that we can more efficiently utilize block size so as to permit higher transaction volume with smaller blocks that means more people can run a node. 
It's not about users,  no user has to nor should have to run a node. But the reality is the less resources you need to run a node the more decentralized and permissionless and censorship resistant Bitcoin is. If it costs you $300 to have a cheap computer/sever that can run a node those who want to will  be inclined to do it, be it a hobbiest or a small business or mid sized business. But if it costs you $20k to run a node and you need $500+/month internet to do it and that node makes you no revenue for doing so then you aren't going to see hobbiest, and individuals, or even small and mid sized business run it, instead they'll outsource that cost to large business. That comes at the cost of centralization. 
The whole idea behind Lightning (well one of them) is that it allows us to accomplish the scale and transaction capacity you are talking about with smaller block sizes. Think if we can scale to to likes of Visa and do so with 50 MB blocks or something like that with LN vs scaling to the likes of Visa without LN but needing 1 GB blocks then most certainly more people will run nodes in the 50 MB variant. 
We need blocks to be big enough so as to not cripple the base layer. We need to recognize that every block size increase comes at a cost to decentralization just like we need to recognize that there's no point to a super decentralized network if it can't be used. So we must find an appropriate balance between in regards to block is the smallest viable size that doesn't cripple the network.

What? You seriously think people are spamming the network at $5 transaction fees? They'd be throwing hundreds thousands of dollars out the window to do that. Bitcoin is the hardest blockchain to spam.
Let alone that what you said makes no sense. Even with entirely legit transactions (which I think is the case regardless) we'd see transaction capacity reach it's limits so long as demand for Bitcoin increase, if price does demand is.

Maybe that's okay? Maybe ETH, LTC, BCH are better suited for transactions and that's their place in the market and Bitcoin isn't?
That said fees aren't the issue with Bitcoin, transaction capacity is. The fees are a symptom of only the highest bidders being able to bid their way into limited block space. I'm fine with $5 fees ($8 EUR sounds above average) but I'm not fine with 7 transaction per second botttleneck on chain. That hurts adoption because it can't fulfill demand. I  want Bitcoin to increase in value to do that means increased demand. If we artificially limit demand then we can't accommodate increased demand and Bitcoin suffers.

Nope, that's not how this works. For starters no BT1 will ever trade above 1 BTC. That makes no sense.
Secondly it doesn't need to equal 1 BTC for it to be more profitable to mine than BT1. Rather the value of BT1 and BT2 will equal 1 BTC, in the event they don't then traders will take advantage of this to take profits, which will in return bring the combined value back in line with 1 BTC.
All that is needed is for the value of a BT2 token to be greater than a value of a BT1 token. This would mean that if BT2 is valued above 0.5 BTC then it is more profitable and therefore BT1 is valued lower than it.

Would it accept nfc though? For the success of bitcoin and merchant acceptance as well as ease of use to the customer it must be able to accommodate payments from mobile phones.

Not a noob so much but with bitcoins adoption by merchants this is an important question.
Unconfirmed transactions?
For sure merchants will want to accept unconfirmed transactions for small amounts of bitcoin. No one wants to use it if they need to wait 10 min to buy a coffee. So how easy or hard is it to fake a transaction that will later prove to be invalid? Is this something that requires lots of computer power? Is this something that some hacker could easily do on his cell phone to scam stores why buying junk food?
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:32:46

@_date: 2013-11-01 16:36:22
They took assets from mtgox because they didn't register as money transmitting service. 
And Ya seems some media outlets try to slander bitcoins. I read something today where the author straight out lied and tried to attribute the crash in April after reaching 266 $to a reddit users tipping bitcoins, and how it's an example of how bitcoin is so volatile when we all know it cuz it was inevitable for the bubble to burst and cuz of gox.  But also take note. Almost all people's in the mainstream don't understand anything about how it works. Some understand front end (low fees, quick transfers)  but none understand back end which is most important. That's the ideological parts. The whole p2p part is why bitcoin is important because if something like this ever goes mainstream it takes a lot of power away from a lot of people. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:46:47
The argument that bitcoin is bad because of drugs being sold with it and money laundering is simply invalid when you realize the preferred currency to sell drugs and launder money is the USD. 
Oh but wait. The government won't go after those people. Oh no. HSBC landers money and they get away with. But bitcoin. Oh that's bad?

Most anti virus should take care of any commonly found keylogger, unless the guy made his own which would put him above average in the computer world. Always do scans... Besides if the computer was Linux and used only by one guy for financial purposes and the drive is encrypted (with Linux u can easily encrypt the whole system) I don't understand how a key logger would be loaded by his room mate. Would need to be tricked into downloading it your self 
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:13:30
Passwords should be 12 or more characters, mixed case, include numbers and symbols. 
Obviously encrypt. Creating more than one bitcoin wallet with different passwords to spread out funds is a good choice. If one where compromised due to key loger other wouldn't be. Also back up back up back up. For added security even though bitcoin qt will encrypt the wallet.dat file for added security when making back ups u could also encrypt that file inside a zip that is password protected. This would hide what it is that your backing up. As well as changing the filename of that back up. I'm not sure but I think double encrypting may increase risk of corruption so make many back ups. 
Get good security software. Bit defender is top rated. Keep all software up to date and do not download sketchy seeming things. 
For fear of key loggers you can create the different wallets which you will disperse your funds across on different computers. I have also heard about using on screen keyboard to protect against Key loggers though I question the effectiveness of that my self. 
Store your well encrypted back ups in so so many placed. This is the most important thing. 
Make passwords you won't forget yet passwords you don't use elsewhere. If one password somewhere was compromised and you use if for your wallet it could be compromised as well.

How does this work out with confirmations? Obviously no one wants to wait even 10 min to buy their coffee. For people buying outside your network how is a merchant safe. How easy is it to fake an unconfirmed transaction anyways?

Then what about what happened to the liberty dollar? 
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:07:01
Currently 25 bitcoins are created when a block is minded. This amount haves every 4 years. Transaction fees also go to miners. The idea is that when all bitcoins are mined transaction fees will give miners enough profit and incentive needed to mine. Without numerous miners the network is unsecure, with 0 miners it is non existant. 
It is yet to be known if in the future (in about a 100 years) bitcoin will be popular enough that there will be enough transaction at a high enough fee to be able to maintain a network of miners. It is generally thought that miners would scale back due to a lack of incentive which would then make difficulty lower and incentive will remain for those who are left over. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:18:21
So I suppose a merchant can watch network to see if guy already sent bitcoins to him self and refuse a further transaction. But if that shady person buys first then send to him self monitoring the network would be useless no? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:47:04
True, but The merchant suffers draw backs from charge backs and that insurance is very limited for most people. My point is though. It's easier for someone to get hold of information and steel from you with a credit card. Think if PayPal servers where hacked credit card info would be stolen. If bit pay got hacked. The attacker would not be about to steel anything from my wallet. 
With bitcoins your security is your responsibility. With credit cards other people's lack of security can compromise you. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:09:11
So I'm under the assumption that this goes over the interac network used with the debit card and not interac online which would work over online banking all the while also being immediate and letting TD users use interac. And from my understanding there is no charge backs with interac online. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 23:27:10
I can't say for sure but I am under the impression that it is only USD that they have a problem with. There are still plenty of EUR and CAD that are traded and I am yet to hear of withdrawal problems with them. Not sure if it's the reason but lots of big us banks have no interest in dealing with bitcoin related business they have been closing accounts of companies that deal with bitcoin they don't want the competition, it's backlash.

My bank states it will only protect against 1 purchase that I claim fraud on. The point I was trying to get across though is. Someone get get your public key and it's all good. If a public key is stored on a server and is exposed. So what. But if name address and credit cards number are exposed someone can use that to make a charge to your credit card. With bitcoins no one is provided with info that can cause a charge to you without your approval first. Unless of course your private key is stolen.

As a canadian CaVirtex is a wonderful exchange. This is in fact the same exchange that the bitcoin ATM is hooked up to. What I love about them is the online bill payment feature. You get to use your normal online bill payment that any standard canadian bank provides to send the exchange money. This is much faster than doing a bank transfer (about 3 days) and only costs 6$ to deposite. This is insanely convenient as i can do it all online with ease.
They also now offer a debit card that you can withdraw your cad to instead of sending it to your bank account which then can also cut on fees a bit.

If they did that they could easily have the majority of the hashing power.  This means a less spread out network and therefore less security. People would then lose confidence in bitcoins and after all it is confidence that gives bitcoins their value. So if they used their hardware to ming the market could crash meaning no profits at all.

It's more a mater of no inflation at will buy a governing authority. It is instead a safe and predictable amount that you know won't be abused and when the block half's that amount will be even less.
