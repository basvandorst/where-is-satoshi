Top stuff!

Thanks! 
Bitcoin came out when I was studying economics at university, and given that I count myself as vaguely Austrian in my economics, Bitcoin resonated with me straight away. So when I started Canopy I was very keen to integrate it - helping the cause and whatnot. Had no idea how big a market there would be, just wanted to be part of the movement in a more active way than just owning a small amount of BTC.

Hey Madcotto - we're working on getting some new styles in the next few months. I'll drop you a PM when they arrive and if you like them you can have 30% off.

This is done on a CMS, but will try to figure out what that means haha.

Unfortunately that's a quirk of using BitPay. 
Currently I've got it triggered to send a Thank You email to the customer as soon as it generates an order in the system, which for non-BTC payments occurs when payment has been made. However for BitPay payments it generates it as soon as it gets to the payment page. I'm trying to figure that one out at the moment...

Sweet - thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:46:15
Ok thanks - I'll try to sort that out! Thanks for the order!

Current plan is to report BTC income as revenue, at conversion rate of the date of sale.
If we realise it in GBP, then any market movements will be taken into account under capital gains.

Thanks! Yep we are looking into getting listed right now. Unfortunately with a lot of them you have to pay...
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:19:46
Fixed!

I got reddit hugged to death, but now it's back up :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:21:57
Thanks a lot! Will go in the post tomorrow from the Mayfair post office in London :)

Hey Dooley - thanks! We're quite new so proper photos are on the way - planning a few shoots in the coming weeks! Once you receive the shades let me know if they're not a good size and we'll sort something out. Cheers.

Try again - should now be working!

Haha trousers are always useful. Although it seems like trouserless reflections are more prone to going viral so maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea...
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:07:39
An undeniable truth!

Oh - and integration with BitPay was really simple. I messed around with another plugin at first, that took 0% fees and put BTC straight to your wallet, but it was unstable - transactions fell through, the cart experience was jittery, and there was no support. Spent 30 minutes trying to get that to work smoothly to no avail, so went with BitPay, which all got sorted within about 10 minutes. Top stuff.

Nope! Just me and a business partner both in our mid-twenties trying to get a business off the ground! =D

Thanks! Yeah I'm a keen photographer, [link here]( if interested.
They are indeed one size fits all, as our glasses have spring hinges. My head is abnormally large, and they fit me fine. They also fit normal people, which we're glad for.
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:46:42
Haha glad to save you the trouble!

The wood is sealed so it will stay looking great without any special treatment :)
