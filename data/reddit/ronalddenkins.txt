No you can't. I've tried for a week after being verified. You can just buy and sell bitcoins but can't use them anywhere else. Someone please post proof of transferring bitcoins. I don't think you can rendering the service useless and scammy.

Yeah don't use this site. Haven't been able to withdraw bitcoin for over a week now. They are giving me the run around. I can buy bitcoin but you can't transfer it out. I've tried everything. They won't do it. Feel scammed. Avoid these idiots

I bought it at 230, 300, 450, 1000. Then sold at 16.4.  I think most people who had been long for a while sold a large percentage of their holdings between 15 and 20k.  I recently bought more at 6,900.  Granted i could get burnt this go around but I don't feel like I really have a choice.  Bitcoin has and will define my personal economy.

Same. Passed verification and cannot withdrawal. I've tried 4 times and all 4 times the transactions literally disappear from the ledger. Seems like a scam because their rates are always above market when buying and below market when selling. I wouldn't have issue with this if I actually had control of the coins I purchased...but I don't. Spread the word on these guys. I don't want this crap in the community. Last thing we need is another banking app to scam BTC buyers. These guys are absolute clowns. DO NOT USE!

I haven't been able to withdraw bitcoins for a week even after identity verification. Avoid this like the plague

I take back what I said.  For 5 days now I have not been able to withdraw my bitcoins to an external wallet.  2 of my transactions literally disappeared off my ledger.  So apparently I have some bitcoin I did buy from the SQUARE CASH APP but seemingly I have no control over it.  I think they do not know what the fuck they are doing.  I would stay clear if you have a better option.
