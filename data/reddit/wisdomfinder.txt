I dunno, I personally think it's a really bad idea. mBTC is confusing for people who aren't already invested in Bitcoin, and the fewer things there are to drive people away the better for Bitcoin's future. *At the same time* I do think it's a great idea if people decide on a name for mBTC that's easier to swallow.

Considering some of the BS that gets reported, I wouldn't rule that out

I sort of know what you mean, but I don't have enough to really feel that way yet &gt;&lt; Did you get a lot of BTC?
I was pretty bummed out for a while because I never bought a ton of bitcoins back when it was super cheap and the subreddit had that "magic internet money" wizard on the side.
I googled it but I couldn't find much info (back at the time). In the end I got really intimidated by all the talk about "paper wallets", "offline wallets", "private keys" and "electrum", how you could lose all your coins, etc. and didn't buy into it early.
Hopefully I'll be able to finish buying my first bitcoin soon, I've got a fraction xD

Everything I've read points to it being a scam :o Just google "onecoin" scam and check out the articles. It might be legit though, but I personally wouldn't risk my money on it.
