Well from my research, i discovered that they do not have physical office in Delaware and they operate from Estonia.
Their office in Delaware is a virtual office and calling their phone goes to voicemail.

There business location is not in USA i guess. They only have a virtual office. That makes it hard and make me think the site as a scam

It is illegal to withhold users funds without citing a clearcut reason why it is withheld. Vendors and traders are laying complainins daily on the biased and irregular way paxful moderates disputes, and illegal close their account. In the case of suspicious fraud, investigation should be carried on within two weeks and user reported to constituted legal authorities but paxful will not do so.
They will rather lock up your coins even without notice and wait for your to forget or get even tired of asking.
A well known trading and money exchange website like paxful does not even do appropriate verification  to all it users. Only users in specific countries are verified and they allow thousands of individual to from all over the world to trade and exchange money and digital currencies on their website.
Funds illegally withdrawn from individuals should be released, verification support should be enabled to users in all country otherwise limit their operational regions and should be regulated by government authorities

Which constituted authority can one report to?
Localbitcoin only bans users account but dont hold their funds. They release the wallet and allow users take out their funds.

There are lot of legitimate online companies where you can exchange your bitcoin for fiat. Peer to peer could involve a lot of risk and not 100% safe except you have a trusted escrow.
