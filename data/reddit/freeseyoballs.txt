What did you expect, Ellen to go into the technical details of it to people who don’t and won’t give a shit about it? She would lose that audience after about 30 seconds.  At least it got mainstream attention and it wasn’t anything negative.

Not associated with them even the littlest bit, just don’t think they are the devil like this sub seems to think. Mostly people who have never even used it, just like to be on everyone’s side and get that sweet karma.

It made people who probably would never look into bitcoin aware of it. You can’t expect someone like Ellen to spend her time trying to explain bitcoin technically to her viewer base. It would do nobody any good, now they at least know about it and don’t associate bitcoin with anything negative.

Double dip not their fault, Visa admitted to it. Sadly it will still be associated with coinbase because everyone loves to hate on them.

Not deep, just business. Every decision made at JP Morgan is based on cost and profit, despite any marketing they may put out to make you believe otherwise.

I’ve had no issues with coinbase. Been very easy to use and it’s also a big part of the widespread trading of crypto at this point. It’s done good things for the crypto world as well as made some mistakes. Most the people on here bitching about coinbase are people who’ve never used it but bash it because it fits with the groupthink and gets them upvotes.

I have, there’s a lot of over reaction. There’s horror stories too but that place is a circle jerk.

It’s pretty naive if you don’t think that happens.

What about linking an account with large sums of money to a website or app seems like a good idea at all? Link an account you use solely for shit like that, an account that you won’t lose a bunch of money if something goes wrong. Equifax was hacked, the fucking company that legally holds all of your personal records for other companies to buy. People need to start realizing nothing online or in your phone/computer is safe. Sure it’s fucked up and you shouldn’t have to worry about it, but the reality is you do. For all those stories at r/coinbase there are all millions of coinbase success stories as well.

Maybe they understand it’s how business works, but think it’s wrong or don’t like it. Just because “that’s just how something works”, doesn’t mean you have to sit back and be OK with it. Was the stalking and all that shit overboard, absolutely. However, people also have the right to be upset by the tactic they used.
