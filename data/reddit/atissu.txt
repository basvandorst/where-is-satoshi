An entire country shifting its entire trading system to a currency that cant handle more than 3 txs per second is literally impossible.

No. Iran adopting bitcoin is hundreds of time more unlikely lol

What a stupid comment. The internet was created in 1989. There were ways to exchange data before that (like the DARPANET, which is what you are referring to), but it wasn't the internet. The internet has it's own protocols, switches, etc. It would be like saying that the blockchain exists since  cryptography was invented. 
But again, I'm not surprised that people here would be this clueless lol

Sorry about that, I'm used to post on subreddits that are a little more... rude. I  admit that I came off as a douche, but it wasn't my intention here. again, my apologies

That's simply not true. Low, predictable inflation is what the FED is aiming for and usually achieves. When you can predict what inflation is going to be (as it's always the case with the USD), the free market absolutely can and does properly prices it in. EVERYBODY includes inflation in their forecasts growth, expenditure, interest.

Exactly my point. You can't just say that the internet (the WWW would be more appropriate here, my mistake) exists since the creation of it's core protocols. That would be like saying that you could say that the blockchain exists since the invention of the multiple cryptographic elements behind it. You can't just say that it exists since the 1970s just because some elements of it did at the time.

And why is that? What's that game theory?

What's so revolutionary about the blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:18:48
Moving the goalposts. Everybody compares the blockchain to the internet, yet the internet was extremely morr widespread and was actually useful 10 years after it's creation
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:00:30
Just like the blockchain uses protocols that were around for a long time. Does that means that its fair to say that the blockchain exists since hashes exist? since public/private keys? But yes, my mistake, I should've said WWW, I just think that when people talk about the internet they usually refer to the WWW. I'm sorry for being rude, it wasn't necessary in this conversation.

Wtf? So you are against buyer protection? 
You know that without refunds and with permanent non reversible transactions, the buyer will most likely ALWAYS get scammed? Even DNM markets have some sort of escrow/buyer protection ffs. If you use a truly decentralized crypto market, nobody is ever going to use it. Remember how great OpenBazaar was? Oh wait, no it's not.
 It turns out that if a customer doesn't feel safe buying online, he just won't.
 And that's way more damaging for sellers than the few chargeback/return scams
