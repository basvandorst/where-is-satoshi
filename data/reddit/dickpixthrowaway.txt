You can't just look at a chart and few previous trends and say "we're undervalued by 10x and should be at $3000+ right now".

People who are so blindly against every alt-coin are very ignorant and could very well end up getting left behind if there is ever a paradigm shift in the space. 
BTC is king and I only have about 10% of my portfolio in a select few alts but the the idea that every crypto other than Bitcoin is instantly trash is so unbelievably short sighted and circle-jerky it's mind blowing.

What was your issue with Coinbase?
I see everyone on here shit on Coinbase all the time but I have used them for a while now and made well over 100 transactions/purchases/sales and I've never had a single issue with CB.  
Circle on the other hand never verified me after I submitted my info, and since I like using Coinbase I never bothered to contact support about it so haven't actually used Circle yet.  What makes Circle so much better than Coinbase in your opinion?
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:30:27
I use both
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:50:55
I see.  I always thought it was pretty clear that you have to wait for the ACH to clear to get your coins, but I do dislike the amount of information Coinbase requires you give them (however this is pretty much becoming the new norm for larger US-regulated exchanges).. 
Also just so you know, if you add a credit card to your Coinbase account you get your BTC instantly.
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:43:56
Your response sounds sarcastic.. All I was trying to say is that because there are probably literally only a handful of people in the entire would paying for their Dish service with BTC every additional person who makes the switch might actually be noticed.
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:22:08
Too bad you didn't make the switch.
Most people aren't using BTC in this type of situation yet so everyone who does is actually making a real difference.

He is innocent of any violent crime, therefore he is innocent in my eyes.
Regardless of how you look at it though, he got fucked over by a system wanting to make an example of him.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:47:41
Apparently you're ignorant AND unable to read.  I said directly harm someone.
If you commit  a property crime that is obviously an act of aggression and directly harms the individual.  Same goes for fraud, ect.  How is animal abuse not an act of violence?  -  Your list makes no sense whatsoever in the context of proving my points wrong.
It appears you are low IQ though and I do not wish to continue attempting to interact with an illiterate. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:39:55
hahahahaha wtf... yes.
If someone doesn't harm another person, there is no crime.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:09:46
Property crime = violence
Animal abuse = violence
Intellectual property crimes = Non-crime, should be 100% civil matter
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:08:51
He was setup to be made an example of, simple as that.

@_date: 2015-10-17 16:22:43
I bet a lot of these new users are at least somewhat due to a referral program Coinbase ran for a while, and then changed mid-way through it and refused to pay people the money they originally promised to everyone who qualified for their program.
I will make a more detailed post about my personal situation this weekend and post on but I am hardly the only one Coinbase lied to and basically scammed during this promotion.

@_date: 2013-07-06 00:38:00
He was the  seller on SR, and had built up a lot of trust with the entire community.
Before 4/20 he started sending out invitations to a "private store" for "special customers only" that offered lower prices (and no escrow protection), and for everyone still making orders on SR he required that everyone finalize early (which bypasses SR's escrow system) for his 4/20 sale.
In the end, he offered big discounts on 4/20 and of course never sent out any drugs.  Making away with an estimated 20,000 BTC in just 2 weeks.
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:17:28
Thanks for the response.. According to their website CampBX --&gt; Dwolla should still be instant even for new accounts which is why I don't understand this "pending" status.
This is the last straw for me with CampBX, fuck them.. I'm sticking to BlueSkyTraders and LocalBitcoins.com until a decent exchange opens up.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:35:11

@_date: 2013-02-28 02:43:18
Sorry in advance for the potentially dumb questions but...
Is there likely to be a big correction coming soon, or are these high prices sustainable? 
Also, didn't BTC get up to about $30 in early 2011? What caused the rise and fall of BTC price back then? And is it possible we will see a similar drop in price again?
I know there is no way to predict these things with certainty, but as a total n00b I am just wondering what some of you more knowledgeable people think about this record high price, and what you think the future might hold for the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:27:54
I dont have ACH setup yet and have USD in my account, any advice on what I should do?  Should I just buy BTC at market price and move it to a wallet? 
I don't really want to buy at $90/BTC but its better than losing all my money. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  
***EDIT: After asking Bitfloor what to do with my USD, I got this reply about leaving USD in Bitfloor after 6pm:*** 
"The money will not be taken. We will have more details on how to obtain your USD soon."
***EDIT 2:  After asking "Is this the end of Bitfloor?" I got this response from support:***
"Don't have an answer to that yet. There will be more information soon."
Things don't look good for the future of my favorite BTC exchange :(
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:53:53

Finally some good news..
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:29:49
Yeah Bitfloor really was in a class of its own when it comes to ease of use.
I also made my all-time largest USD deposit about 45 minutes before they put up the notice they were stopping all trading and never got to make any trades or get my USD out of my account.. Talk about terrible timing eh? 
With the closing of Bitfloor it really is apparent the weak link of BTC are the exchanges... I hope someone steps in and takes Bitfloor's place in the exchange market sometime soon.
@_date: 2013-06-15 23:46:45
At best Bitinstant seems like a disorganized, completely half-ass company..

@_date: 2013-04-20 07:44:06
I put in my application for ACH a few hours after the original notice was put up, I wonder how long verification will take on top of the actual withdrawal.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:37:43
Yeah thats why I loved the cash-deposit option Bitfloor offered..  No risk for them, no waiting for me.  Bitfloor really was the best of both worlds.  I'm scrambling to find an exchange that is even close to as quick or easy to use as Bitfloor but it seems like it just doesn't exist.  
Thanks for the info about Coinbase though, I am thinking CoinBase to Mt.Gox is my best option.  My only fear is Coinbase could cancel my order if there happens to be a large price increase for BTC during the "waiting period" and then I would be shit out of luck.  With this sort of volatility in the market, time is money.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:36:05
I don't really understand how a 1-time waiting period protects CampBX, wouldn't there need to be a 31-day waiting period on EVERY deposit to protect CampBX from chargeback fraud?
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:26:58
Oh I totally agree, I was just correcting your statement about SR being down..
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:31:35
I'm pretty ignorant to how this whole "GPU mining" thing works. 
But as a computer geek, I think its awesome people build mult-GPU systems to mine for virtual currency 24/7/365. (at least I think thats what is happening). Either way, bad ass system dude. Keep on keepin on doing whatever the hell it is you're doing.

Although I agree with your sentiment, this is one of those situations where I would definitely get this guy arrested.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:36:42
If it makes you feel any better, I couldnt bring myself to panic buy and now I have about 1/4 of all my spare cash stuck in there too.  I'm hoping Bitfloor makes good on their promise to allow USD withdraws at some point...  And to think I was planning on setting up ACH tonight when I got home from work :/
I guess all we can do now is wait and see.

@_date: 2013-04-18 02:24:27
Yeah I also feared this day would come after they were hacked. 
Although, it wouldn't surprise me if this has more to do with rules/regulations conflicting with how they allowed for deposits in the US than the fact that they were operating while being insolvent.  Who the hell knows with all these questionable BTC exchanges.

Seems like this happens all the time with bitinstant. I would think they are definitely a company to avoid, I'm surprised so many people still use them.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:16:48
So the wait period is only for withdrawing to Dwolla?  
When I read their statement I thought they meant I could not move my BTC anywhere for 30 days, including an outside wallet.  For me, that would a deal breaker.
@_date: 2013-06-11 02:46:25
Thanks for everything man.. I have absolutely no idea why BitFloor decided not to do their own PR work, but I am thankful you stepped in and did it for them.
I think we all learned a valuable lesson throughout this ordeal: Never go near anything Roman Shtylman is involved with. ever. again.
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:16:27
Why do you say I shouldn't use Coinbase as a market? Also, what do you mean when you say you've had to wait anywhere from 3-6 days to get your BTC?
Sorry for not fully understanding your post, but as but as a former Bitfloor user I never realized how difficult and confusing buying BTC was on other exchanges and the idea of waiting 3-6 days for anything is a bit foreign to me.
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:34:12
I've had nothing but good experiences with Coinbase.. 
If you don't mind the wait, I'd say they are the best option for buying small amounts of BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:49:34
Degenerate gambler here:  Thank you for posting this so I didn't have to.

Not really.. BlueSkyTraders works for cash deposits, localbitcoins.com, or any of the usual exchanges.
I don't see any reason to use a company that can't keep their promises to customers.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:34:18
I tried depositing and it looks like they reinstated the waiting period. 
Pretty shitty communication on the part of CampBX if you ask me; I would have just bought my coins on Coinbase instead of depositing into Dwolla had I known they changed their policy yet again.

Buying BTC from Bitfloor was as easy as going to your local Bank of America, making a cash deposit into a Bitfloor account, and waiting 1-3 minutes for you account to be funded.
