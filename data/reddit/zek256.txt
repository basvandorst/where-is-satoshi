This is an interesting point that I hadn't thought about. Wouldn't BCH's difficulty scale with the supply and demand of miners leading back to an equilibrium?

I'm by no means defending cloud mining because I think it is terrible as well, but I will explain the logic behind it:
A cloud mining operation sells their future profit to you, for an immediate investment from a consumer in order to immediately buy more mining equipment to make more future profit.

Hmm interesting. So when you spoke about the difficulty related to the block amount, the difficulty increases with less blocks enqueued to balance it out?

I'm not really concerned with how bitcoin is measured. Whether the financial system falls or not, I will still have my bitcoin in my wallet and I'll be able to use any intermediary methods of payment, maybe even some cryptos with a larger block size, but I wouldn't trust them as a long term store of value. Bitcoin would be my savings account, and a cheaper transaction crypto would be my checking account, if that makes sense.
Yes I do think hyperinflation is a possibility, but I'm not betting on it happening or not, I just prefer bitcoin for my store of value.
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:15:02
Yes given the fees associated with transacting.

Bitcoin does not rely on fiat money for it to be a store of value. Just as gold does not rely on the dollar to have value. Just because we measure bitcoin in dollars today, doesn't mean we can't measure it in other ways.
We don't measure how much a slice of bread costs by comparing the dollar to the Chinese yuan. We say, well people are willing to pay 5 dollars so if I charge 5 dollars then the bread will sell, it's supply and demand 101. In this same respect, if cryptocurrencies were the only currencies and there were no fiat paper money, everything would work fine according to the laws of supply and demand.

The FDIC insures banks that go under. So if I put 1,000 dollars into Yeet Bank and the bank goes bankrupt, the FDIC will pay me 1,000 dollars since the bank cannot. The FDIC has delivered in the past many times. I am like you in that I would prefer to stay away from institutions and fiat in general, but pretending like the existence of the FDIC is arbitrary and is no different than it not existing, is not good logic.

Increasing block size is a security risk as it can more easily lead to a 51% attack. You can read more about it online, but that is the primary reason for the 1mb hardcap on block size.

I agree with that statement, but you were arguing for something else earlier. Yes it is ideal to have your own keys but if in the case that you don't have your own keys FDIC is infinitely better than non-FDIC backed. So we shouldn't tell people they are equally good.

Oh no, I think you misunderstand my intention, sorry I should have been more clear. I don't need to use bitcoin for those things, bitcoin just protects my savings by hedging it against dollar inflation and dollar market fluctuations, and keeps it in my hands instead of the bank.
But if bitcoin does get their off the chain technology improved, I would use it for regular day to day transactions. It's just not the primary reason why I hold bitcoin.

True, I agree
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:55:02
Sure, I think the logic goes something like this: you need more processing power and electricity to verify an 8mb block. Also, there will be less blocks right? If you have 800mb of transaction data, that is 800 blocks of BTC but only 100 blocks of BCH. The miners with giant server farms will be able to blow through those 100 blocks, not leaving any for the regular day to day miners who only run a fee computers. The regular day to day miners can probably mine 1mb before the server farm gets to it, but has less of a chance of mining an 8mb block before the server farm gets to it. This leads to less miners overall and favors miners with giant server farms, causing a more centralized coinscape.
I am also still a student to the block chain, so if anyone can contribute / correct anything I said above that would be appreciated.
I would love to hear your thought experiments too.

It's normal for humans to be more self critical than critical of others and when we feel inherently flawed we assume that we are the odd one out and that everyone else has their stuff together and is normal. That's the normal functioning of the human ego. Fortunately we don't have to be completely fused and identified with it. We can see that it exists but not feel compelled to 100% trust it's logic. 
Being human is a universal experience for us all, we are far more alike than different. We all feel inferior in the self critical view, this is ego's mechanism to propel us forward in evolution, always doing better always becoming more. But for us to strive to do better it must first convince us that we are not yet good enough.

The most valuable thing in life is human connection as we are social creatures. Now that you are free from working and financial obligation you can begin to focus on the non-material aspects of life. Maybe buddhism / meditation in order to understand yourself better. What are you without material wealth? And if you have a strong connection to your inner self, then is the wealth necessary, does it add anything to your being? You can now be free to spend time with the people you love, or find people who you can love.
Community is extremely important. For a very long time humans have been evolving in a tribal setting, we are wired to be involved in communities of some form, to be a part of a tribe. It's also nice to understand our independence and we might even spend a season being a hermit where we can spend vast amounts of time alone to find peace within ourselves, then we can move out of our cave to share that peace with others. This is a strong tradition in humanity - the hermit in the cave - so much so that it has become a popular archetype. Usually there is some truth in archetypes.
There is so much stillness, quietness, and meditation within us if we will only give it the time and the space to reveal itself to us, but most of the time we are drowning it out by stuffing our brains with content whether it be music, youtube, we just keep running keep searching. The inner self is trying to get us to be still and pay attention to it, but we continue running, seeking, grasping, and clinging. But if we stop, sit outside, become aware of the quietness, the wind, and focus on nature more than we focus on thought, and focus on our body, really feel our bodies, internally, externally, we find a stillness and a satiation, a brief freedom from seeking. There is joy \[lasting peace, not excitation\] inherent in life underneath the grasping and the clinging.
There is so much to life, you will find the beauty, the peace, and the joy inherent to it.

I think in his hypothetical situation he was referring to the federal reserve printing so much money and inflating the dollar to the point where bitcoin is worth $1B in which case $10 would no big deal for a transaction fee because minimum wage would be probably a thousand times higher than it is today due to the inflationary environment.

Higher accuracy:
using cryptocurrency as an everyday payment mechanism has proved impractical because of crypto’s volatility—a wallet with $100 worth of Bitcoin at the start of the week may be worth $1000 by week’s end.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:45:45
I guess it depends on how you define value. You could look at it that way and say that every currency is either overvalued or undervalued. I see the term value to be more practical in the sense that if 5 dollars can buy me a good hamburger, but say it takes 10 euros for me to buy that same hamburger, then I can safely say that 1 dollar has more value than 1 euro. But it's all a matter of perspective.

It's probably different for each person, I feel better when I have little stimulation now days, I think its because I used to listen to music at every possible opportunity, like when driving, walking to and from class etc. I never gave my brain space without stimulation to just process and open up.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:40:15
You are right in that  it's a good idea to separate the theoretical from the practical, we should be okay with increasing the risk for efficiency so long as the risk is still far from becoming a reality. But in terms of BCH we are actually seeing that risk come close to being a reality as is described in the linked article below. This is unfortunate because I do indeed like the price per transaction of BCH, but for me personally, I prefer to have a coin with longterm security and stability over having a coin for the sole purpose of regular day to day transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:53:37
Yes you are correct but it doesnt add anything substantial to your argument. I think you were trying to argue that FDIC backed companies were just as bad as non-FDIC backed companies.
Which would be like saying putting your money into TD Ameritrade and losing it permanently is equally bad as putting your money into TD Ameritrade and having tax-based insurance return your money if something bad were to happen to TD Ameritrade.
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:56:11

Is there a way to get 51% consensus to add more? I'm not too familiar with the types of things that can be altered with consensus. It would take up more space per transaction but might be worth it in the long run as tehnogy improves.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:07:11
Just because bitcoin seems to appreciate in value due to the dollar being devalued, doesn't mean bitcoin doesn't actually appreciate in value independently from all other assets due to the increasing demand of it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:25:56
I don't quite understand this illustration, but I can say that there is nothing that can destroy a cryptocurrencya ability to be a store of value. The price may drop and it may not be a wise investment, but it still retains value and, since there is a 21 million hardcap for the quantity of bitcoin in the market, will never experience inflation after that point.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:12:35

As long as there is a static limits of coins, and the demand continues to increase, then the price will just continue to increase.
Just as we see inflation in our fiat currencies, when we print more money, the price of the dollar goes down, so it requires us to spend more dollars in order to get the same thing that was previous priced lower before the inflation.
Basically there will no longer be price fluctuations due to the amount of coins in circulation, there won't be inflationary pressure to decrease the price. Price fluctuation will entirely depend on supply (willingness to sell) and demand (willingness to buy). Right now we still see inflationary pressure, but the pressure of demand far outweighs the inflationary pressure, therefore the price continues to rise, but the price would rise that much more if the demand would stay consistent and the inflationary pressure would be removed from the system.
Assuming 21 mil limit is reached: If there are 10 million people that hold bitcoin,  and there's another 10 million people that also want to buy,  theoretically the price will double, because now you have twice as many people that want the same thing, and that thing has a limited amount. This is a huge generalization that assumes everyone owns the same quantity of bitcoin.

1. the human population continues to grow as we reach farther and farther out into space and have multiple colonies
