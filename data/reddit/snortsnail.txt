Can someone help me understand how r/btc has so many followers and how everyone is convinced of the polar opposite of what we believe. Do they really think BCH is the true bitcoin ? How did this happen to such an extent? I haven't read the white paper myself but that seems to be their main argument

That's how arbitrage works.. how else do you expect them to make money ?

What? How is a limited supply subjected to inflation the same way that printing out more paper money is ?

You are implying that you, with a 100% certainty know it will crash post fork... no one knows, you can speculate and make educated guesses based on market movements and public adoption. You can attribute this recent hyper bullish trend to various things including the fork as well as futures and surge of new traders but at the end of the day you never know how things will turn out after this fork. It's true that it could crash, but similarly as 2x gets dumped maybe bitcoin will spike more since we will see that it stands firm

There's no such thing as a late investor.. you make an educated prediction of where the market is heading and buy some financial instrument to back up your beliefs. What is this absurd expectation of 10000% returns.. why is 20% upsetting to you

It's an interesting time right now leading up to the fork because wider acceptance, news from financial institutions and the fork itself are all adding on to this move.
What were he conditions like when the last bull rise saw such a drastic drop? All I did back then was complain about how poor a my roi would be on a $700 mining rig. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:57
So less than 70 million? I think even less

I feel like if anything, Russia will be the one to integrate it into day to day usage, either to show how they are more progressive than the west in this manner or to gain a potential advantage if there is global adoption

Don't judge the present based on performance 4 years ago. There are just so many factors that go into the current stage of bitcoin and how it's perception in the general public is shifting.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:58:13
No one has concrete answers, just speculations and semi educated guesses that are as good as your own research. Don't mean to sound rude but 2x could be dumped, could be widely accepted and pumped, although less likely, it's impossible to say. Personally I think if there is a crash in BTC it won't take too long to recover given how quickly and drastically post china recovery happened.

Very informative

What bank? I had issues with my local credit union debit card, direct bank account transfers and credit card ones were fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:59:55
That's what I said when I bought at 4800
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:44:06
It's all about calculated risks, you couldn't afford to lose that money at the time, just like I couldn't allow myself to spend $700 on a mining rig as a high school kid in 2013

Smarter? This man is a billionaire with the capacity to push through during times like 2008... he is also invested in blockchain, it's just that he felt that based on his knowledge of the existing markets bitcoin is a bubble. It's just his opinion and he can easily be wrong but as much as I believe in bitcoin a correction is coming 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:23:23
Depending on what the "I went to purchase" statement means. Of course if you don't click buy you don't buy..

Nothing wrong with someone giving you realistic advice about risk management, but good for you. High risk, high reward.

Coming from the guy who 48 days ago said "Sell now"
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:55:28
Yea that's weird really don't see an issue here, maybe they blacklisted it for some reason. I'd imagine they're swamped with tons of support tickets with higher level priority given how many new people opened up accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:59:27
You are locked into that price, it just won't get to your account because of how slow bank deposits are.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:03:10
Bought at all time highs of 5400 6500 and 7100

I do 3% in 401k and 6% in crypto. That's all I can risk because I have cc debt and student loans
