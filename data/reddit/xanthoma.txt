There is a huge difference between Jews and Zionists. I didnt mention the Jews.
Judaism is a religion, like Islam and Christianity. 
Zionism is a nationalist/racist movement that wiped Palestine off the map and replaced it with something called Israel.

There is a huge concentration of Zionists in New York so this makes complete sense that they are trying to make bitcoin mainstream since it reduces credit card charges.

Israelis are Zionists. There is a huge difference between Zionism (a racist and national movement) and Judaism (a religion like Christianity and Islam).

[Yes it was all called Palestine back then](
You're welcome to call it Israel on that piece of stolen land, but other have the right to call it [Palestine]( . Israel to me doesnt exist.

The world has to unite against the racism of Zionism.

Zionists dont have to be Jews, you could be an atheist Zionist or a Christian Zionist. Zionism is a racist and nationalist idea it has nothing to do with religion.
No people should have a "homeland" based on a 3000 year old religious text, if you oppose that then you are anti-Zionist. The land is still called Palestine in my opinion.
