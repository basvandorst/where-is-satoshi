Couldn't agree more.  His talks have probably pushed me towards this 'hobby' further than anyone else in the crypto space.  Vitamin is up there in my book too.

Honest question: if the segwit wallets continue to increase in adoption, what will happen to all of the standard wallets out there?  Will they need to migrate their coins over to  segwit wallet?  Is it the same for litecoin as it is bitcoin?

Any evidence to support the claim?  Ive traded stocks a couple years with them.  They have lived up to every aspect of their promotions and claims.

I think youre missing the point.  Op was talking about being emotionally detached from your investment, not clinging on to every hype post and bull thesis you can find.  Give me a bull thesis and I can find you 2 on the bear side.  I am longterm bullish, but I think he's right in the near term.  There will be much pain before a true rise.  Historically most crypto gains happen in around 10 days out of the year. I think that's enough to support responsible dollar cost averaging into whatever position you see fit.
