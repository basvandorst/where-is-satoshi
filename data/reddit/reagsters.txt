The policy of taking children from their parents was started by [Trump and Sessions]( not Obama, but it was a nice try, thanks for playing “Am I a dumb NeoNazi Supporter”!
@_date: 2018-09-07 01:05:42
Man, you're trying really hard here. I'm not swallowing the propaganda you did, however.
Sessions and Trump implemented the zero tolerance policy that separated children. That is a fact. The article you posted shows that, under the Obama administration, children that were unaccompanied by parents were put in these detention centers. Just like they were under Bush. They weren't ripped from their parents beginning at the age of two months until Trump and Sessions implemented the NEW policy of 'zero tolerance'.
You support trump, trump supports nazis, you're a nazi supporter. Pretty fuckin' easy to figure that out.
Just because you only research things that support your ignorance doesn't make you correct.
Also, the fact that you're more concerned about being right (even though you're ludicrously incorrect) instead about being concerned about the concentration camps your god-emperor created speaks volumes about your pro-nazi character, you obviously pro-nazi troll.
"fuck off"

Yeah, see, but hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and purging/releasing their files online for the purpose of swaying the election is NOT COMPARABLE to releasing an idiot VP candidate’s emails in 2008. It’s just simply not the same. One is an attack on democracy, one is an attack on Sarah Palin. You can disagree with me on that but you’d be fundamentally wrong.
Sorry, but Assange had his OWN SHOW on Russian State Television in 2012 that ran for 12 episodes called “World Tomorrow”. He partnered with Russian State Television and got paid for it. If “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” that *literally* means he considers the Russian Oligarchy a friend and the United States an enemy. Makes him the bad guy, straight up. One government murders gay people and political dissidents, the other was a pinnacle of freedom prior to Assange helping elect an idiot baboon. Also he was accused of rape, so I’d say he’s a pretty solid bad guy. 
I like to think that if your organization hacks the DNC, takes and publishes their files, [also hacks the RNC but doesn’t post any of those files]( and somehow claims to *not* be working with the GOP to overthrow our democracy by supporting the man who [openly said he wants to be a dictator]( - you are a bad guy working with bad guys to overthrow good guys. 
Assange claimed he’d release trump’s returns. That was always a lie and he backtracked in it because he was always going to. You think WL can get their hands on CIA files and leak them but somehow cannot get Trump’s returns? C’mon. 
Democracy good, Oligarchy bad. Surely you can at least agree with that.

We have a *representative* democracy, which is by definition less democratic than a direct democracy. The people *directly* elected Hillary, and the *representatives* we have in place (those that file the electoral college votes) were what gave Trump the election. [That’s why Bernie, Kasich, Paul, Powell, and Faith Spotted Eagle got electoral college votes in 2016.]( Our democracy doesn’t create our laws either, our *representatives* do. My point being that blaming democracy for Trump’s slim victory is outright ignorant of the million other factors that corrupted the election. We need to focus on combating those threats to democracy, not supporting those threats (like Assange).
Again, the RNC was hacked by the Russian GRU the same time they hacked the DNC. [The RNC was also hacked in 2018 ]( and nobody leaked anything. WL is an arm of the Russian government and has been since they acquired Assange and hired him to do a TV show on their state propaganda television network. 
Because of this, WL no longer encourages whistleblowing, just information gathering. *THEY* choose what information gets leaked once they acquire it. Nobody’s leaked them info about the GOP? I’m calling BS because *everyone hates the GOP*. Two hacks on their main systems and *nothing*? I don’t buy it. Until WL proves they’re fighting for good, there’s no evidence they’re doing anything *but* holding out. *All* they have to do to convince me is leak something from those RNC hacks or Trump’s returns. Instead they’ve leaked CIA and DNC files to undermine trust in our institutions and promote blind faith to Trump.

Oh, sure, the leader of WikiLeaks is supported by Russia and had his own show on their propaganda network but they definitely didn’t, I dunno, [start becoming a pro-Trump organization ]( out of the blue afterwards. The Kremlin just had his show on their state run propaganda network and let him go on his way afterwards. They just became pro-trump out of the blue. 
But if they did acquire WL I’m sure they’d announce it so you’d be able to google it. Surely they’d have the integrity to do that.
@_date: 2019-04-12 23:47:31
Back to good ‘ol name-calling, are we? I know it’s easy to get mad when you’re trying to argue against a fact, but the name-calling isn’t necessary. 
How do *you* not understand that China being able to listen to and record all of the President’s phone calls is far *far* more compromising and far *far* more likely to create a greater “paper trail”? Already nipped one criminal Republican President in the ass. 
I’d love to hear your source on the claim that illegal contributions happen all the time. Y’know, the one that you decided warranted calling me *retarded*?

GRU acquires WL &gt; Assange does State TV show &gt; GRU hacks DNC/RNC &gt; WL leaks DNC files
Something’s gone missing there. 
And it might explain why [Lindsey Graham]( and [Rand Paul]( (of the GOP) might have gone from adamantly hating to loving trump so rapidly. 
They have proven they’re against the Democrats and the CIA. Seems like one single thing against the most corrupt administration of all time wouldn’t be hard to find and leak. There’s another monumental scandal almost every day with the GOP. And WL hasn’t leaked a single one?
Come on. 
*Come on*.

*buzzer noise*
“Google it” doesn’t count. Give me a source, because everything I’ve heard and know up to this point tell me that your claim reeks of bullshit.
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:28:42
Lots of things elected Trump. Micro-targeted Russian propaganda on social media, Wikileaks attacking the DNC and RNC (as an arm of the GRU) and leaking ONLY DNC files, voter registration purges, the electoral college, uneducated voters, restricting voter ID laws, and Fox News propaganda to name a few. But the *one* thing that actually *didn’t* elect Trump was democracy. *Democracy* elected Hillary by 3 million votes. *Representative* democracy via electoral college elected Trump. 
NICE deflection of the softball question of whether or not you think the Russian Oligarchy is worse than United States Democracy, though. Definitely tells me which *you* prefer. Personally, I prefer democracy, especially when it’s under attack by foreign adversaries and WL aided in that attack. 
Until such time WL releases A N Y T H I N G about the slew of illegal things the GOP is doing/hiding, they’re *definitely* the bad guys. WL wants to be the good guys? That requires *fighting against the bad guys*, not just the institutions/people you don’t like.
EDIT: Your response also definitely didn’t even approach addressing what I initially said, much less my “final point” about how Assange and WL are bad guys working for Russia. It’s occurring to me that literally everything you just said was a deflection.
@_date: 2019-04-13 00:17:13
That’s my *exact* question for you. 
Thanks for the article - it does nothing to prove your point, as all that it says is that the FEC found that $1.9 million worth of donations over $1,000 weren’t reported in time (20 days after the election) by the Obama campaign, but thanks. Out of $750 million collected they failed to report $2 million within 20 days of the election. I’m seeing incorrect filing dates and missed deadlines (which were eventually met) with fines (that were paid off) but nothing illegal.
This, however, is distinctly *not* an illegal campaign contribution, and *nowhere near one*, which is what we were talking about. So, again, you got an actual source for me?
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:46:58
“Conspiracy theory” sure. All those articles are part of a conspiracy in your eyes as well, I take it. My only “conclusion” is that Assange is a hack and deserves no pity. 
What does Trump not using email have *anything to do with what we’re talking about at all*? 
Trump is the literal leader of the GOP. His personal lawyer was the chairman of the RNC, for God’s sake. You can’t separate the two. 
And “all major campaign[s] are fraught with coverups and illegal contributions” is 100% bullshit as well.
@_date: 2019-04-12 19:08:41
Silly me, he doesn’t use email! If only he did something absurdly stupider, like [continue to use his phone when he was told it was a national security risk.]( It’s possible the phone could’ve been hacked by a [foreign adversary.]( 
It’s funny to me that I’m a conspiracy theorist all of a sudden given that I’ve linked articles this whole time, and you’ve relied only on an argument that centers around attacking my integrity, yet you support those who have no integrity.
WL can leak *literally anything* against the GOP yet hasn’t done it once since Assange had his show. They don’t have to leak his tax returns after they [begged for it on social media.]( but we know for a fact that [Russia funneled millions into GOP campaigns]( and [this is the third article I’ve posted about the RNC being hacked]( You’re welcome to read [this article]( that goes into detail about Assange, WikiLeaks, etc. 
But, again, multiple confirmed hacks on the RNC, but no leaks. Hacks at CIA and DNC confirmed and WL leaked them. ALL WL has to do is leak something about the GOP. They’re absolutely ridden with scandals. This administration has had 420 people resign with scandals, and you think WL hasn’t gotten a single heads up? [Multiple]( people in the [GOP and Trump campaign members]( coordinated with WikiLeaks to [cover up]( the pussy grabbing video on the same day. *Half an hour later*. No documents from the RNC hacks despite being done by the same people as the DNC hacks, but you support WL and Assange. And *i’m* the conspiracy theorist. 
Again, if WL releases *anything* hacked from the RNC or Trump or his campaign or even *Russia* for that matter, you can make me eat my words. 
But i’ll hold my breath.
Edit: if nobody leaked anything about the GOP to WL then that means I have a lot more trust in our institutions and continue to know for a fact that this “deep state” nonsense is just that; nonsense.
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:40:45
Didn’t say that, but sure thing buddy. 
Weird how 2008 isn’t 2016 so NO he didn’t do anything to harm Republicans, and how hacking the DNC for the intention of swaying the 2016 election is different from releasing one idiot’s email in 2008, and how Assange had his own show on Russian state television starting in 2012, and how Assange refused/refuses to release Trump’s tax returns or anything else related to the onslaught of laws he’s broken and things he’s covered up but has later has come out to the public. Crazy. Its almost like everything you said *isn’t true at all*.

I’m not inclined to read a Murdoch-owned news source that has [mixed factual reporting]( and consider it truth. 
Actually, I’m having trouble finding *any other* news source that doesn’t have a right-wing bias and mixed factual reporting confirming what you’re saying. I’m also not seeing original sources for the numbers on those sites for the outlandish claims they’re making. Just outlandish claims with nothing to back it up. The Federalist, Fox News, and Investor’s Business Daily are all I’m finding and they’re all thoroughly unreliable. 
I’m calling bullshit.
