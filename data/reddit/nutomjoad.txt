As I mentioned in my first post, "nothing at stake" is a non-issue and it's clear you haven't spent much time bothering to learn about it. I'm interested in hearing your technical breakdown of why these analyses and solutions are still a problem for you:
Bitcoin would benefit greatly from introducing PoS instead of PoW. It's too bad the incentives of the users securing the network (miners) are completely opposed to the incentives of actual Bitcoin users.

ITT: Hand-waving rationalization about the shameful environmental waste of Proof-of-Work.
Proof-of-Stake has been proven to be an energy-efficient alternative, and there's a reason just about every new project is using it: it works beautifully. The unsupported arguments against PoS like "nothing at stake" and "the rich get richer" have been debunked, disproved, and completely rebutted over and over and over. At this point if you still believe those myths, you aren't paying attention. Proof-of-Work is already obsolete and that will be proven in the coming years. 
The deluded rationalization in other posts here is incredible. If I said "it's not a problem that my 1970 Camaro gets 5 MPG since the gasoline is powering useful movement", I'd be rightly abused if I pretended that electric cars weren't coming. Better innovation is being ignored because it runs contrary to the financial interests of Bitcoiners to acknowledge it.
In regards to deflation: use a cryptocurrency with a variable supply. NuBits, Tether, BitUSD all have mechanisms in place to try and achieve price stability at $1.00, and all have been successful to different degrees. There will be many more stable-value cryptocurrencies arriving soon. Bitcoin will never achieve less volatility than occurs with stocks as long as one unit tries to be both speculative and transactional in nature.
Downvote away.

This will be downvoted, but NuBits has closely held a $1.00 peg since Sept 2014. It's a stable cryptocurrency that is flying under the radar right now. Bitcoin's volatility is a critical flaw for a currency.

That's true. Decentralized fiat exchanges don't exist yet and there will be large barriers to implementing them.
B&amp;C Exchange and Mercury both have expressed interest in using stable-value digital currencies like NuBits though. While it won't allow USD withdrawals, it will at least simulate USD trading.

The problem of cryptocurrency volatility has already been solved. It's just a matter of when people begin to take notice.
NuBits are the world's first stable digital currency. They have been worth $1.00 US since they were released on September 23, 2014. 
NuBits are based on a fork of Peercoin's code, which is in itself a fork of Bitcoin's code. There are no complicated hedges, contracts, or confusing financial instruments at play. People who hold a separate instrument called NuShares vote to expand (through grants) or contract (through planned future developments like variable transaction fees and currency burning) the supply of NuBits so that a peg of $1.00 US is maintained. You can use and hold NuBits on their own (so you don't need to know anything about NuShares if you don't want to).
The design of NuBits has worked remarkably well so far. NBT trading is almost always in the top 10 of daily volume on

I'm not even sure how to respond to this. You either misunderstand what "volatility due to the fixed supply" means, or are willfully ignoring it.
21M (or 2.1 x 10^15 as you suggest) units means that the price may be $300 one day, $500 the next, and $100 the day after. Real currencies (like USD) expand and contract in different economic conditions. Future digital currencies will need to be able to utilize this same flexibility as well.
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:43:07
Just wanted to point out that the Nu design is capable of switching pegs to a different currency, basket of goods, or nothing at all. The ability to alter this peg through shareholder consensus is detailed in our white paper:

@_date: 2014-12-10 00:08:00


Somewhat the same principle as Bitcoin: over 50% of shareholder consensus in the protocol is required to make a custodial grant. It's unlikely the majority of shareholders would willfully attack the integrity of the peg, as the value of NuShares largely rely on NuBits remaining stable. It's the same reason why a majority of Bitcoin miners aren't attempting double-spends, because it would hurt the value of their own Bitcoin if they were caught.


Transaction fees would grind away someone's holdings if they attempted that. I'm not sure what benefit there would be to faking transaction volume numbers though.

@_date: 2014-12-14 00:51:03
As clear a statement as you'll get that Bitcoin is not a currency, and is absolutely a commodity. Stable value is a necessity in useful money, and a deflationary supply will never allow it.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:23:40
You're right, volatility is lower on a percentage basis than it was four years ago. I'd be interested to see your critique of a section of our white paper. It suggests that Bitcoin volatility may continue to reduce, but that it will never reach the levels required by a true functional currency:




@_date: 2014-12-09 20:36:25


Sure you can. Our design allows users who hold NuShares to adjust the supply through mechanisms like custodial grants (expansion) and variable transaction fees/currency burning (contraction). There are currently dozens if not hundreds of people who hold NuShares, and this decentralized design has worked well for the 2.5 months we've been in existence.
Our design is not perfect and is constantly being challenged to improve too. We take the approach that well-articulated problems tend to lead to creative solutions. I think this is somewhat in contrast to the Bitcoin community's insistence that the initial approach to digital currency is flawless.

Volatility due to the fixed supply is a problem right now, and is unlikely to ever decrease to the point where Bitcoin will be a stable currency. There are no solutions to this unless the Bitcoin community decides to eliminate Satoshi's "sacred" 21M supply decree.
Projects like NuBits - which offer a stable digital currency at $1.00 US - are trying to capitalize on this market opportunity.

That was the basic idea, yes. In these early stages of our network we're well-aware that demand can fluctuate suddenly. For example, if a major news source dropped our name casually into an article, demand could spike very quickly (quicker than new NBT could be brought to market). We want NBT to be $1.00 US reliably.


USD reserves held by custodians are a temporary way to provide additional peg support. They are not part of our permanent system design, as economists have rightfully pointed out that USD reserves are meaningless if no law or regulation compels a custodian to use them to support the peg.

It won't though. Several major problems have been identified that will limit its use as a true currency that is effective and stable:
Problem  Bitcoin has a fixed supply. 
Solution: Requires consensus among a group of individuals who have invested a fortune in maintaining the scarcity of their "investment" to change things. Problem is unlikely to ever be fixed.
Problem  Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work mining.
Solution: Requires recognition that PoW is environmentally wasteful and likely to lead to centralization as established providers drop out of the arms race. Other alternatives like Proof-of-Stake have already proven themselves to be superior and just as secure. Miners unfortunately have an incentive to hold on to PoW until the bitter end to protect their capital expenditures in mining equipment. This is at odds with what is healthiest for the network.
The existing incentives among Bitcoin market participants don't suggest any sort of meaningful change soon. Sure, you might see "band-aid" solutions that try and limit volatility in the short-term, but none of these address the core structural flaws of Bitcoin.
Like I started off as a fan in 2013. The delusional fan base that refuses to discuss Bitcoin's critical flaws tired me out, and I moved on to different communities. There are many, many others like us.

There hasn't been any controversy, aside from a handful of BitShares community members posting inflammatory threads on Reddit and other forums to try and harm the price of NuShares. NuShares and BitShares are primary competitors.
NuBits have been $1.00 US since its release about 100 days ago. It is still "working reasonably well in practice".
We encourage everyone to do their research. Here are the NuBits and BitShares websites:

Definitely. Nu has a [disclaimer on the front page of its website saying the same thing.](
The good news is that the network has already handled a significant demand collapse (due to exchanges like BTER and Exco.in getting hacked in February) with no change in the value of the $1.00 peg. The network introduced "NBT burning" (using the backing value of NuShares) to help support the peg too. It's all experimental at this stage, but the pegging mechanisms have been robust to date.

@_date: 2015-02-03 23:59:07
Coinapult, BitReserve and Tether are all centralized businesses. That centralization may enhance the stability of the peg (if real assets are backing the digital currency), but introduces a single point of failure. Government regulation, theft, technical error, or even a natural disaster hitting the wrong server rooms could collapse their operations. That's what we mean by "counterparty risk" being present.
BitUSD is decentralized, but it's not really an independent option. It's a [repackaged exposure to BitShares]( If you use BitUSD, you're basically using BitShares with a different name.
NuBits is decentralized as well, but uses a different economic model to maintain stability. It is not perfect yet either. If you are looking to use a decentralized stable digital currency, there are risks involved with both NuBits and BitUSD; the choice of which one to use ultimately comes down to a user's individual preferences for stability, liquidity, and security.
