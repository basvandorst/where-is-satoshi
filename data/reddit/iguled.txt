Same problem here.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:57:03
My name's on there. Matched with my email. So yes, it's real.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:59:46
It's my primary email address. I use it pretty much everywhere. So yeah it's used on quite a few bitcoin related sites too.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:57:50
yeah, read it earlier
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:57:20
Thing is with AML/KYC, you should only ever have to upload documentation IF you fail or refer a check. As an example, GB Group gives a result based off the usual information and drivers licence or passport number. ONLY if you don't pass the initial check, should you need to provide documentation.

Did you even read it?
"Here is a partial list of Coinbase user emails and their full names. Full list much bigger."

I have two accounts and both are listed :/
Edit: Actually only one of them is. But still...

I've never been registered on gox, and an email address of mine is there.

This is possibly the best bitcoin scam ever pulled. Or at least, the funniest.

Yeh bit of a bug in the script. There isn't a miner fee if you use a coinbase address. I'll need to try and fix the bug, or make it more evident to people that they should use a coinbase address

It’ll take longer than a day to drop from the mempool. Just be patient

A more elegant solution for subscription payments.

Inspiration of the name taken from BitchX by any chance?

Aw nice! Wish they'd open a pub in Manchester :(

Same bloke that runs MemoryDealers right?

Quite an impressive foot-warmer you've got there!

ASIC's the only way forward now really. FPGA ROI will be dire now.

If it makes you feel any better I can set you up with 1 month free hosting? To compensate for the loss.

UKIP lol. The most right-wing political party excluding the BNP.
@_date: 2013-07-04 21:51:29
Some nice security features :)
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:18:35
I'd be interested to know about the security concerns with using Chrome Extensions or Firefox add-ons. Surely I could code a chrome extension to grab addresses from html5's history api?

Nice, glad to see another company in the arena :)
If anyone else is looking for another alternative (although we don't offer domains or SSL certs), try  
Also accepting litecoin (although it hasn't proven to be very popular at all!)

Won't work. AML checks will likely either refer or reject.
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:15:54
Way too unoriginal in present form
@_date: 2013-09-05 07:45:47
Curious as to how you deal with recurring payments?
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:50:26
It's a basic form of compression. Reduce filesize = quicker downloads + less bandwidth.

Easier than I initially thought. Managed to write a Chrome extension to search my browsing history for "rushwallet.com" and console.log the results. All that's missing now is a POST request to a script on my server to store the results, or email them.
I would HIGHLY recommend that you advise all your users to disable browser add-ons when using rushwallet.
Edit: see

Sad thing is, it was running smoothly for months with happy customers. If he'd just continued with what he was doing, he'd have a pretty nice little business going. Real shame.

thank you kindly

Looks awesome mate :)

Noted. I've updated the maximum to 3000, and cashout is down to 50k. At least temporarily until I move to microwallet and eliminate transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:31:45
Nice idea. Although you should consider minifying the js and css.

Technology centric VCs believe in absolutely anything though. They will throw money at almost anything.

Hey. Sorry only seen this thread today. I operate CleverPuffin and I'm always up for giving users a free trial of our services to see if it fits their needs. But yes as you've alluded, we can't offer SSH access.

I used bitstamp for two large transfers to my natwest account. All went smoothly and I'm pretty sure the charge was only like 7quid each time. I'd highly recommend them.
Edit: I clearly didn't read your post at all, just ignore me. Never bought btc from anywhere so have no idea where's best. But for withdrawals, Bitstamp gets my vote.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:32:36
Sadly the faucet isn't unlimited. If it's getting low I have to decrease dispenses until the faucet has a sustainable balance. Will probably end up porting it over to use microwallet.org instead.
For the very modest amount of traffic the faucet gets, it has sent 0.02238 BTC out to people over varying cashout levels. So it's not as unrealistic as you think.
And yes I removed the rewards list from the left hand side of the page. Fail to see how this is such a big deal.

"I also learned that keeping everything denominated in Bitcoin is risky. When the price of Bitcoin fell, and I didn’t update my pricing quick enough, we had sales that resulted in a net los"
I feel you brother!
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:48:43
They froze my account with about $3000 in it, and won't let me withdraw for 180 days. First they required ID and proof of address which I GAVE THEM. Then froze the account anyway! How can that even be legal?
@_date: 2013-05-30 14:00:11
Absolutely NEED to accept fiat payments for these. Otherwise what's the point?
@_date: 2013-08-22 09:33:06
Why are people still buying? Seriously?! Is anyone in the least bit surprised that they're pulling this shit again?
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:58:16
I've managed to implement something so that all my pricing is in USD and an API call gets the average BTC price. Not perfect, but definitely better than when I was updating pricing manually!
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:52:40
Brilliant effort!
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:41:14
Sorry! Also I'm pretty sure he's just robbed off with your coins.
