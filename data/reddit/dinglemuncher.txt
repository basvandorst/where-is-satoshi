Alright since everyone here clearly got the tinfoil hat memo when they woke up this morning, there's nothing fake or dubious about the piece. It's a proprietary research report that's only available to clients of JPM (hence why you won't find it publicly...yet) just like the thousands of reports they publish on various sectors of the global markets / econ &amp; rates strategy / quant factors / a million other topics. All midsize &amp; up banks have private research sites and quite a few have published similar 'Crypto overview' reports just like this one. 
Keep in mind the research function of a bank is not necessarily a product of the CEO's personal views, rather it's a sales tool for generating trading business with a client. J.D. could bash NFLX's business model into oblivion, but if the analyst who covers NFLX is really accurate/ puts out great ideas, clients may be more willing to trade w/ them rather than Goldman/BofA etc.. the next time they want to execute a large NFLX trade. 
There's really nothing in it that most well-informed bitcoin enthusiasts wouldn't already know - it's basically a ~60pg 'intro to blockchain &amp; crypto' piece for those that aren't really up to speed on the space. 
Here are screenshots of the ToC and Exec summary portions:

The JPM piece is not 'fake' - it's published on their dedicated research portal, which is generally only available for institutional investors. I would share here but unfortunately every report has personal identifying info/DRM to prevent this.
