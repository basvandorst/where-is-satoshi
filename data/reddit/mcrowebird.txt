Your trezor is aware that you have the amount you expect correct?
Remember that your wallet/seed can have many many addresses.  Every time you send bitcoin, the return amount will be to a new address.
You should be able to see the addresses used on the trezor dash, or look at the transaction to see what the return address is.
Edit: seed not private key

When you move bitcoin, you don’t just move the exact amount you want, you move amounts based on your input amounts, and overage is returned to you, but usually to a new address.
If you received 3 bitcoin as 1, 1 and 1 and wanted to move 2.5, in order to satisfy your move you have to combine your 3 input transactions to get a value that lets you move 2.5, then you move the remaining .5 back to yourself.
In general you don’t return the overage to the original address.

Stop limit orders are executed at market price.  The stop being the price when the sale of the chosen quantity starts and the limit will determine the low point at which you are willing to sell (at market) to account for slippage.

The limit accounts for slippage, say in the example given, you set your stop buy at 152 and a limit of 155 for 3.
- The book is able to fulfill 1 at 152
- Then the price rises to 154 where it is able to fill another .6
- Then it rises again to 155 where it is able to fill another 1
So far we have filled 2.6 out of a total 3, but the price has now risen again to 156, your limit at 155 has stopped any more fulfillment of your order (even though you have said you still want to buy .4 more).
