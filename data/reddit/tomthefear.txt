Hey mate. I'm no expert but if you want to pm me I'll chat through how I'm doing it. It's not scary :)
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:04:15
I don't really have any savings or anything I can invest, so this seems like a good way to get started at least.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:12:48
Thanks for the advice. I think I'll stick with a couple of the big names until I'm comfortable and more clued up.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:41:44
Giving to family is a great idea. I might give some to my young niece and nephew for their birthdays. Sure it will be meaningless to a 7-8 year old but they might thank me when they're older

I'm wanting to only out in what I'm willing to lose a month, so £50 a month seems like a good amount.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:09:43
Obviously should have used /s
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:15:37
Currenty have this open trying to have a read. Bloody inconvenient work getting in the way. 
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:24:26
Discovered gdax yesterday, will read up on it more. Thanks
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:29:25
A lot of that you said went straight over my head, but it gives me some things to dig into.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:13:03
Shotgun approach, I like it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:59:36
I'm new to bitcoin and to this subreddit but I'm loving it. 
However: Is this a pro bitcoin echo chamber?
I'm interested to hear some of your honest worries, concerns, doubts and anything else on the negative side.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:27:45
Slow and steady, and all that :)
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:23:42
Thanks, will check it out 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:01:12
I've honestly just enjoyed watching the balance change everytime I check it. I'm sure the novelty of checking everytime I pick up my phone will wear off, but for now its a bit of fun. 
Cheers for the tips. I was worried I was wasting my time with low purchases. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:23:33
This makes perfect sense, thanks for the response. 
Hadn't really thought about buying bitcoin to spend, but you're right. 
I'm still unsure on how a business would price services using BTC as the currency as it varies in value so much at the moment.
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:24:40
Didn't mean to repeat exactly what you said, I've just had a few beers as you do.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:38:10
Glad to hear it's going well for you :) you've given me the idea to give BTC for my young niece and nephews bdays. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:10:14
Thanks, will have a look.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:21:44
proost :) 
Is the "fun" trading other coins, it is there more to it?
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:03:03
Glad to hear I'm not alone. Would be interested into what wallet/exchange you've started with?
I've just used Coinbase to purchase the bitcoin, and I'm planning on transferring to Binance if I want to go for any alts. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:41:01
Nice idea. I'll maybe put 1/3 deposits into fiat so I have some ready to throw at the next crash.
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:10:56
Already set up 2FA :) also inspired me to go and reset all my pws to something stronger, and use a manager with a complex master pw
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:30:52
Thanks will take a look later
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:06:10
I do love the overall optimism of people in this sub. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:30:46
My initial thinking is that if I put in a small amount each month which I can afford to live without, I won't need as much counseling if it all goes south. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:56:40
I do believe there is a good future for Bitcoin. 
I started looking into mining briefly 5\-8 years ago while I was bored at my previous job but never really followed it up (doh). I don't want to regret not diving in again. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:56:40
This also confuses me. I've not read all the comments, but a lot of them correctly mention that debit payments take time to process but are widely accepted. The difference here is that if my BTC fails the store has no means of knowing who I am whereas the banks have all my details.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:14:13
Many thanks 
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:09:01
Awesome, thanks for this.
Any tips on the best way to avoid Fees? I used coinbase to purchase, and there was a fair fee for using debit card. It doesn't look like we can set up a direct bank transfer in the UK there yet. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:58:46
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:57:44
I'll keep doing what I'm doing for now then :) Here's hoping.
I'm not doing this to make a fortune. It's more a hobby/investment for the time being at least.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:20:41
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:24:25
Yeah I always like to fully understand what I'm getting into, even if it takes me a long time to learn. 
I'm fairly tech savy, and really enjoy playing around and learning new things, so I'm excited to get more involved.
Some great things to look into there, cheers mate. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:48:03
But where's the bottom? I don't feel I have enough experience yet to judge what is considered low. Aren't we in a bit of a dip at the moment? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:11:43
I've not read much about decentralised exchanges yet. Only had the big centralised ones come up. Will have to look into it 
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:42:30
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:43:50
Do you mean with other coins?
 
If so, how many alts do you usually play with? Do you stick to a few or spread the love far and wide?
Also any advice on ways to learn which coins are worth my money?
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:13:47
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:15:27
Care to expand on what you mean?
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:23:57
I see, good point.
With the erratic value, how do places which accept bitcoin handle pricing? Is it just based on the value at the moment of purchase?
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:06:26


Interested as to why you think this is a good idea. I'm not suggesting it's not, would just like to hear the reasoning behind it
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:26:28
I get you can't help everyone with queries, but as I understand it helping others get into and understand crypto will help boost it for everyone. I'm trying to help my family get into it as well. The more people using it, the better.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:55:54
Rather then calling other less experienced people "stupid, stupid people", why not give some advice for alternative, better exchanges. I for one would like to know other options, and why they are better.
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:14:34
As I understand it (I may be totally wrong) the halvening will make the reward from mining half as much which in turn could cause there to be less miners. Less miners will make it more beneficial to mine due to either more chance of getting a reward, or more reward. 
So chances are it should always balance itself out naturally.
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:27:53
Excuse my ignorance, bit what is proof of keys?
