You OK there bud?

That's the same hand isn't it?: Wanting to increase blocksize to handle the increase in use currently happening.
Increasing the blocksize doesn't stop there being a need to create second layer solutions. Pressure is good, but breaking Bitcoin (high fees are putting off a lot of businesses from using it right now) to push second layer "solutions" seems silly.
Push up the blocksize now, make fees usable for everyday use to help with adoption, and at the same time make a viable and usable second layer solution that's not insanely convoluted.

Shortsighted? How so? Bitcoin needs to keep up. It's been obvious for years that if it's going to be useful for being a world wide currency and being useful for the world's un-banked, then it needs to do something about it's TPS. Second layer solutions seems like a ridiculous way to solve this as it involves so much convoluted nonsense just to do a simple transaction. A slow increase in block size will fix the TPS issue and the block fee issue.

You raise a fair point: comparing multilayered internet connection to Bitcoin tech.
However I think that as for nodes, a small slow increase in block size will be fine, for the time being, to keep block fees down and network clearing mempool quickly. It will allow for faster adoption of Bitcoin.
I'm starting to see that second layer solutions may be needed in the future and do need to be developed now, but can we fix the primary layer first. Especially with the crypto craze going on in the last few years. It's bringing a lot of people to crypto and currently BTC just isn't that enticing. I want to see BTC succeed.
Edit: Also, the second layer solutions need to be SIMPLE. So lightning needs to get a shit load slicker, or someone else needs to build an alternative.

That's the lie, the incorrect line currently being pedaled by people who want to see high fees. Bitcoin WAS created as a means for commerce - P2P commerce with no banks, no middle men. Miners were originally users with their PCs, interested in making a viable decentralized payment system. These days miners are corporate entities aiming to make make money. Who do you think is pushing the idea "Bitcoin is a store of value"?

Can't we just use Bitcoin like we were supposed to. Why all the bullshit around second layer solutions? Fix the damn blocksize so I can use Bitcoin.

That, actually makes sense

What have you become Bitcoin? Tsk tsk
