How much have you been investing?

I've been really interested in altcoins. I was actually going to make a post seeking the most promising ones. Any advise as far as that goes?

I'll take your advice. I plan on getting a leger, but I want to invest immediately. I have a MacBook, hahaha would that be any safer than my iPhone? If so what's a good wallet?

Yeah very misleading to use words like "collapsed".

Hahaha I appreciate the help. I agree. Best to keep things simple

I knew nothing about bitcoin yesterday, since then I have dedicated just about all of my time to understanding it and am seriously considering making an investment. I showed three friends a video on bitcoin and how much the price has gone up and now all of them are interested, watching videos, downloading Coinbase, etc.

What do you mean hammered? Is it hard to set up an account?

What's the difference?

I appreciate all of your comments. However a lot of mixed reviews. I should clarify that my $500 is money I have saved. All of my bills are paid, there's food in the fridge and I get paid this Friday. I'm willing to take the risk and I'm not expecting a huge return from investing $500(I'm not expecting to get rich). Am I better off keeping the money in the bank or investing it in bitcoin? Also how easy is it to sell your bitcoin?

Any advice on a wallet I should download to my iPhone?
