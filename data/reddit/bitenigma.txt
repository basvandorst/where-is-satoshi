This is going to be big. If I had any spare cash I would buy more coins

I don't think women in general are a big market for bitcoin. Women are not technically minded and it can be difficult to understand if your not smart. The best way to use the resources is to target the BFs and husbands - it is usually the mans money that the woman spends anyway

But they buy those things because they only care about appearance. They like credit cards because they look flashy. They can't show off bitcoins. Sure you can try to market to them but as long as you understand they are shallow and have short attention. I think we could get them in more if we had a bitcoin credit card. Is anyone working on that?

It will be good if Greece economy collapses to show then the benefits of bitcoin. No pains no gains

You shouldn't invest more than you will loose. Probably a small loan is ok as it's pretty sure the price will be a lot bigger than the interest.

Now that we have bill gates on board the rest of the world will follow fairly quickly and the price will start to move very fast. I am buying as much as I can at this point I think we will see a 10,000 dollar coin by September

Another one is disableds. Some of them have millions from insurance. A fiends brother broke his neck in car accident ang got over 5 million. He could easy buy 1,000 btc and not even notice. All he does all day is listen to music and watch movies.

Simply, regulations have no place in the bitcoin sphere. We must ignore any state who tries to control the technology
