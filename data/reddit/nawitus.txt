Do you really need to pay taxes on bitcoin you haven't 'cashed out' in the U.S.?
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:35:25
You can use the blockchain for end-to-end audible voting systems, since you can use the blockchain for messaging in general.

Okay, thanks for the clarification. I'd still rate Stellar as more centralized than Bitcoin.

Journalists often do misquote people. It's plausible that the journalist didn't have a recording running at the doorsteps.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:26:36
That's normally true, but when you think about it, there's nothing preventing one to do the hashing on the client-side. I wonder if anyone has tried that?
Quick Google search later, it has already been [tried](

From the comments:

According to comments on Hacker News, it's not completely decentralized. Gateway nodes require trust, for example.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:23:22
Ah, so the real rule is "you're not allowed to distribute copies of the modified source code".
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:58:40
And they will support .NET on Linux and Mac. And they're moving development to GitHub. And tons of other stuff, like TypeScript which has been free &amp; open source from the beginning.
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:44:34
It's a gray area, because one could claim that distributing a pull request is simply distributing an exact copy of the non-modified source code plus a patch. If that is illegal, then it should also be illegal to distribute a .zip of the non-modified source code and a .patch file.
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:57:47
How can a license disallow modifying the code locally?
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:02:49
Because in most jurisdictions licenses are not enforceable kinda like EULAs are not.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:35:52
Sure, the license can say that, but a rule which is not legally binding is irrelevant. I should've said "the legally binding rule is".
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:22:40
It matters when the context is whether or not a license can legally disallow modifying code. I wasn't talking about fixing TREZOR code.
Although there are quite a few interesting legal cases here. Can you submit a patch which simply says "add line x to line number y"? How complex can the patch be until it is considered to infringe on the copyright of the original code?
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:30:59
Using a pull request is legal gray area at least to my understanding. However, you could always simply email a patch to the maintainer - the old way of submitting patches.
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:03:18
The modification is not relevant as that's not legally binding. The way licenses typically work is that if you distribute the code but break the license, you can be sued for copyright infringement. A license which is not based on copyright doesn't really work.

It's easy if you have millions of dollars to start the bank. Usually there's regulation which dictates what's the minimum amount of money the bank needs to be created. This of course depends on the country you live in.

And that's the restaurants problem. If someone wants to offer me a service which costs them money, then either take that loss or stop said possibility (e.g. by raising the prices). The customer has no responsibility to make calculations to ensure some company is not losing money.
I also disagree with the notion that not tipping is ripping off. Ripping off means that you're not following some contract. If there's no contact to enforce tipping, then it's wholly voluntary.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:48:52
His problem is not buying bitcoins per se, the problem is buying bitcoins with cash (possible obtained through shady means). Or he just wants to do it anonymously. I don't understand how having $300k suddenly makes one a bitcoin specialist.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:56:08
I think a better solution is to limit the number of trades per hour per account. They should increase this limit over time when they get better and faster servers and trading software.
@_date: 2013-04-24 07:52:07
This seems to suggest to stay away from the blockchain.info app until this is resolved. Storing the primary password in plain text is not a very good idea, though that's what browsers typically do.

Eh? If buttercoin can create the exchange software, then individual entrepreneurs can start companies using buttercoin software all around the world. Software is really the first thing that is required.
You don't need hundrers of thousands of dollars in legal fees in many countries. I think you don't need to spend any real money in legal fees in my country (as there's already an exchange in my country, but it's really a meta-exchange for other exchanges).
Maybe you need a lot of legal fees in United States, but bitcoin is global.

Using [this]( service you can buy pretty much anything using bitcoins, but I guess it can be considered "cheating".

Not really. Flattr doesn't actually function like normal microdonations. You can't donate a certain amount of money by clicking on something you like. The way it works is that after the end of each month a sum is equally distributed among all the Flattr accounts that you clicked Flattr. Therefore you still need a software/service that Flattr the company provides. 
Of course you could make a similar system work locally and for free, but a centralized service like Flattr can easily compete with that (for the same reason that so many other centralized services can compete with free alternatives). Like Gmail vs local email clients.

You can have prostitution and still criminalize "pimping". However, that's not really necessary either. Prostitution works and is better for the sex workers in countries where it's legal and regulated, like Germany. Bordels make working more safe for the prostitutes.

Perhaps they use Cloudfare for their website, but not the trade engine.

By the way, shouldn't insurance be the perfect economic model to gain security to use these kind of services? In fact, the website/service could automatically insure their clients' money from a third-party bitcoin insurance company, and the fees would be paid through the website's own fees. Of course, individuals can make that decision themselves if the service doesn't provide something like this.

1. Host your blog offsite on a different domain so you can communicate during attacks or high load (the press release is not even opening for me).
2. Use twitter et. al. to communicate in real time if there's any problems

The flash crash is slightly different, as it's based on algorithms that trade automatically. Spamming Mt. Gox can change the trading price merely because it causes large amounts of lag, and therefore panic.

They can add all the orders from the previous day together (as they seem to do the orders once a day), and that number can be secret.

What does that even mean? If the trade engine is not the bottleneck, what's the "volume related to new accounts"?
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:26:07


I misinterpreted "losing them money" to mean the company, because you mentioned "tip out of % of sales". I thought it would be illegal to have a policy which would force the server to pay the staff tips out of their own wages. Anyway, that's the company's problem, really, not mine as the customer.
The real solution is of course policy change, not guilting customers into tipping.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:02:43
I think you mean "major".

Security through obscurity? Pretty non-professional way to go about it, and even that is failing.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:43:53


Actually I disagree, more security should be preferred to slight decrease in practicality. My mobile bank apps ask the password if you want to do a transaction.

What was incorrect? I didn't say which password *authorizes* transactions. I think *both* passwords (not passcodes?) are required to authorize them. Apparently the OP said he used 18 character main password, 8 character Google password, and in addition to those there's a 6 digit code to be entered?

The main password was 18 characters, which is unfeasible to crack. The second password was for (edit) the Google account, which probably limits the password attemps to make it impossible to brute force.

Eh. The point of money (or borrowing in this specific case) should be to increase wellbeing, not to increase money or "efficiency". It makes a lot sense to discount a high cost over a longer period of time, because you can start to enjoy higher utility by purchasing the commodity immediately. The perfect example is saving 20 years to buy a house or buying it now and living 20 more years in your own house, while paying somewhat for it in interest.
Bitcoin is not anti-borrowing either.
