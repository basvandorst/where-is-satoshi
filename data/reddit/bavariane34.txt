You were going to college and sweating it out to get into business school.

So you guys just gave your SSN to them? Im very hesitant to do that. I haven't used Coinbase for a few days now since they started asking me for my SSN. They're tripping if they think they're gonna get that.

If you pay with bitcoin at a store, do you have to wait however long it takes for the transaction to be confirmed? If it takes 5 - 10 minutes would you have to stand there and wait with the shop owners for the transaction to complete?

Yeah that makes sense, it wouldn't be feasible to buy stuff in person and have to wait for confirmations. I don't know what lightning is, but I will do my homework and find out more about it,  because it sounds like it's the solution.

I'm just curious though, don't you have to use fiat in order to purchase bitcoin? WE can only move from fiat when our employers start paying us in bitcoin, otherwise all we are doing is converting fiat in crypto, and topping it up again when the juice is low if we're spending it. This taxi driver, he's giving change in BTC but he's paying a transfer fee, and he has to report it on his taxes, and the recipient has to report it too right? So isn't this costing him and the passenger more in the long run instead of just giving cash back at no charge?  I'm all for crypto, hell I want both crypto and fiat to coexist, but like I said, employers need to implement paying our checks with an option of either Bitcoin or FIAT.  At this point, paying rent, and day to day "things" isn't worth spending bitcoin, at the moment I'm just treating it like a stock/investment.  My attitude will change towards it when receiving and option BTC as a paycheck become implemented. Just my $0.02...im not looking for an argument.

its amateurs with fucked up credit that say stupid shit about paying fees on credit cards. They don't know how a credit card works and think its free money or that they can just "pay it off the next month". There are so many advantages to come from credit cards, cash back is awesome too.
