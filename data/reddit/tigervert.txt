Someone who bought ~$4m worth of bitcoin last year sold it for ~$9m last week.

You look a little chilled strutting around in your undies.

Hey man, fuck the credit card processors! But wait there's more...
Guess what? I bought gift cards using cash and avoided the bitcoin exchange fees! Fuck the money changers!

The article doesn't disclose a fundamental flaw in chip and pin. Chip and pin is significantly more secure than what is currently used. Attacks on chip and pin are based on man-in-the-middle transaction generation. The article discusses a bug in a particular protocol or terminal which could easily have been fixed in the interim.

Central banks are nothing like central planning. Regardless of whether you slobber a 'bona fide' on your assertions that's retarded out of the gate. Congrats, I bet you often impress idiots.

Hell, you might even find an AutoCAD file of designs for a time machine that hasn't been invented...

Oh, I see... you think that because "central planning" and "centralized banking" both contain the word "central" they are identical. You're not smart.

The reason you can't do that with an existing coin is because everyone with coins gets to spend on both forks. There's only a small window where both forks can survive before collapsing into a winning fork. Essentially, as soon as an existing coin is forked, economically what has happened is that the coin supply is immediately doubled as are everyone's existing balances.
What's better than having Satoshi's millions of BTC? Being able to liquidate them on one fork and *still* have them on your preferred fork. If there isn't a clear winner, the economy reacts by devaluing both. Changing the mining reward shouldn't affect coins that were "premined" before the fork. (Although, depending on the nature of the hardfork, miners would be able to easily incorporate the same transactions into both forks--so it would take a little effort to make it work).

You are actually correct, but you are somehow coming across as a concern troll.
Any wallet that can scan all the addresses it contains to load all transactions extremely quickly is obviously open to traffic analysis to discover a list of addresses contained in the wallet. 
In PGP-land there is a similar attack for the keyservers to discover the addresses contained in your keyring when performing keyring updates which can leak information about your communication partners. In PGP we use parsimonie to update keyrings which uses Tor and randomly updates each individual key slowly and at random intervals.
Anyway, you are entirely correct that the servers can discover your public addresses contained in your wallet if it updates as a burst or worse with a client ID (either identifying the trezor device or the client accessing the trezor).

You clearly have no clue about central planning if you're being that flippant.
