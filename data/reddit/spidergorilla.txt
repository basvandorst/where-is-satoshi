Yeah some miners will switch to Bitcoin Cash, that causes hash power to increase which will eventually cause the difficulty level to rise, which in turn decreases the profitability. They would then go back to mining Bitcoin, and then back and forth a few times until an equilibrium is met. We don't know where the equilibrium is though, as the profitability depends not only on the difficulty but the price as well.

Ah... the good ole days when Charlie Shrem, Gavin Andresen, Erik Voorhees, and Roger Ver were all on the same side collaborating...

Bitcoin Cash became more profitable to mine than Bitcoin, for now.

Don't do this unless you want to turn your 0.945 BTC into 0.5 BTC

Yes you still need to make two on-chain transactions, one when opening a channel, and one when closing it.

If a war breaks out, would you rather flee with a USB stick that contains your private key or gold bars/debit cards?

It's not just the Koreans but also Chinese people using Korean exchanges. (Exchanges are temporarily shut down in China, so many Chinese moved their coins to Korean exchanges)

This sub is infiltrated by so many Litecoin shills. 
Luke Jr's (Bitcoin Core) position on LiteCoin is that it's a pump-and-dump scam coin.
I don't know about you, but I'd rather listen to a real dev like LukeJr than some idiot who just copied code, tweaked a few parameters and calls himself "SatoshiLite".

Because people buy bitcoins every day.
