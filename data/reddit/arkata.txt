Any interest in mining any other SHA coin like Maza or Myriad?  I had to pull the plug on my 30Gh/s miner this past week also :(.

Would really love to buy some of her artwork too!  Fascinating!
@_date: 2012-09-01 21:07:07
Yeah, tried ordering from them last weekend and also same thing.  I had flawless results in November when I last purchased though :/

Nice interview.  I'm glad the speaker spoke about that Bitcoin is just a P2P internet protocol, and all attempts at regulating "it" will be futile!  Thanks for posting :)

Let's say that SHA256 is compromised (or is it ECC that's the backbonr ?) Is there a current algorithm available that can be switched near instantly?  Is there a SHA-512 for example?  Or will one have to be rewritten from scratch?

Let's say the amount of hashing for the overall network decreases a large percentage in a fairly short time.  This would have a long delay in finding 2016 blocks and letting the difficulty decrease in a substantial amount of time (not to mention also transactions taking much longer.)  
My question is, is there a time dependent function in the code that will click on and reduce the difficulty before the required 2016 blocks have been found?

Made me laugh :)

I was their first BTC customer, and can vouch for the quality of their tee's.  Their designs are awesome, and the support was phenomenal =).  
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:35:03
Haha right!  Who knows in due time?  
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:45:55
How long did it take for you guys to get a confirm order?  I sent a couple hours ago and nothing.  Made sure to send a few extra bitcents just in case of exchange rate trickeries.  I used my android wallet and sent to their receiver address manually.

Hey Vocatus!  Oh absolutely.  We've had meetups before with Charlie, and some other btc fans around the valley! =D  There were about 7 or 8 out of us just from word of mouth and bitcointalk.org forums.  PM if you want extras =)

How is your initial private key created upon downloading the Bitcoin software?  I had a great discussion this weekend with a friend, but my lack of technical prowess to explain some of the more integral issues made it difficult.  He was concerned about certain backdoors that may send a private key to another location upon assigning it to you. I assured him that many competent programmers have looked at the code without issue.  Still a good question I believe.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:35:51
Apparently :P.  They also said BTC payments will take priority.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:18:46
I'll have to get you info but on bitcointalk.org and there's a fb link I'll have to get ya.  Don't usually use.  If you search for Arizona Bitcoin meetup on bitcointalk though, you'll find us. :)

That moment hit, when I was able to purchase real tangible goods with it!  Laptop, clothing, food.  It really changed my perspective and that of others when I was able to describe how Bitcoin, a virtual currency "from nothing", was able to provide for such complex goods as personal computing!
What started as an interest in value storage and economics helped me realize just what it means to be in control of your own finances and a true democratization of currency.  What a wonderful invention.

The finder of the block receives the block reward and all applicable fees.  If the miner is part of a mining pool, then the operator of that pool can make a choice whether the fees are distributed to the miners or kept.  You can find mining pool comparisons here.
