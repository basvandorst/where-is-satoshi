@_date: 2013-11-12 20:49:40
There has been multiple alternatives the whole time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:52:39
It says that but I've been able to buy at todays rates within my instant buy amount
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:49:48

@_date: 2013-11-19 01:01:10
Is that some sort of monopoly money? jk.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:28:15
to be honest you should get a paper wallet or bit coin QT with encryption
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:40:03

She can be paid by more than one group to advocate for them. She just happens to also get salary from wherever she said. She is a "shill" though
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:35:29
If you enjoy paying the commission and waiting hours I only used it before my coinbase got second level verified for instant buys. it was always very quick for me though.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:28:12
seems like it went well for a network with Fox in front of it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:14:21

@_date: 2013-11-14 01:55:55
you know what I would respond with see you in court then.
I'll bet their lawyers charge much more than appx. $1200 in fact I would guarantee it. although you have committed a crime called defrauding through fraudulent checks so you could do jail time.
I am not a lawyer do not take this advice
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:43:52
So the creator(s) , and the developers of QT technology are not "inside" I would disagree

@_date: 2013-11-15 23:54:16
No I think Infiniti makes the convertible 
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:29:15
