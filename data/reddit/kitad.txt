small local exchanges are sort of whack...
There is almost no liquidity in days of high volatility. A guy just put a buy order to what would be like 27K bitcoin price. Of course I had to sell...
Only because I will reinvest it tomorrow when the exchange gets reliquified.

Much obliged
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:56:00


That is factually wrong. This are basic economic terms and you are confusing them. If the stock market goes up and the prices stay the same, then we have not had inflation.
Hell the stock market could go up and there could be deflation!

I don't know if what you said is intended to counter-argue my point or just add to it, but nothing you said is contradictory to what I wrote.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:37:39
I'm going to go out of the limb here and offer a counter-argument.
More than a counter-argument, its a caveat. Because I don't disagree with anything you posted.
Buuuut... invest fully knowing the risks. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will hold forever. There is no guarantee that in 10 years, another crypto would have gained promince and everyone migrated, there is no guarantee that every government bans bitcoin making it unusable, there is no guarantee that the technology will not fail to scale, rendering it worthless.
Do not put more than you can afford to lose. Yes, it's been said before, but it bears repeating.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:24:00


What you have here is a leap of logic. Yes, I do believe that governments pollute. (Though not all equally). Duh. What I don't believe is that govt's are the only ones that pollute or that the answer is to ban regulations or taxes. :)


Let me ask you a question, and it is one of intellectual honesty. Are you able to accept that your position may be wrong? Some people can't, and will dismiss any evidence to the contrary. Therefore, I ask you: What sort of evidence would be sufficient to show you that governments taking action solved the ozone layer problem? And would that be enough to make you at least question your positions?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:58
What are your investment objectives? Do you want to day trade?
I would say that if you are in for the long term just save what you can, invest what you can lose and forget about it. Trust me, you don't want the toll of stress and focus that is required to seek just the right moment to put in your money. (Plus you never really know).
In the long run, if BTC continues growing you will do fine regardless. It's about the big picture.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:44:45
You have to remember that most folks on this forum are adept libertarians because they watched a video that sort of made sense.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:31:08
By making the analogy about how the government solving the ozone layers is equal to the mafia saving lives. That means that you think that government action was effective at this particular point.
Do you disagree? Do you think that the reversal of the ozone layer degradation had nothing to do with the Vienna convention?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:46
This is a good point but isn't it too extreme to be an example? I mean you have massive corruption, a government that won't service his debt, shortages of basic necessities, and hyper-inflation.
The 2008 crisis was the worst one in a century, but not even that had 4000% inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:49:26
The thing is that the volume of trade by BTC has sort of leveled out while the price has sky-rocketed which means that the majority of newcomers are using it as an investment opportunity.
Which is not sustainable because at some point the price is going to stop growing so fast and people will want to withdraw their gains.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:26:06
I don't think he meant that he literally made 1.5K every day, it could just be an average.

So I have my crypto-portfolio (which is already only a small percentage of my total investments, since its risky) and I want to turn around 15% into Alt-coins that convince me.
IOTA, XRP and ETH... That's what I'm liking.
What exchange is recommended for this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:30:56
Well do you think its true or not? Your answer to this will determine my next line of argument.

Hahahah oh wow
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:56:41
No, the private sector pollutes more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:48:50
Gee, I pointed out that his is a good point and I'm not saying his facts are wrong. What I'm saying is that the Venezuelan government is an outlier when it comes to fucking things-up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:17
Nobody knows the future. I think it's a safe bet that BTC will eventually go down at some point (lol). How much? At what point will it rebound? How fast will it recover (if even)? 
Nobody knows.
A good rule of thumb, though, is that the wildest the upswings makes it more likely that the downsing will be just as sudden. Winter is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:41:47
Because they work? Because if you fine pollution people will probably pollute less?
Do you honestly think that if all governments banished then we would stop pumping C02?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:02:05
I want regulations for companies that pollute and I want subsidies for emergenging technologies and I want public funding for the science that will help us avert the worst part of this crisis.
So yes, I trust a functioning state over an unregulated "free market".

[Citation needed] the reply
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:31:26


At least you admit the possibility that the Vienna convention was a success (it was), and you admit that you don't know. Which is good. It's shitty when people pretend to know things that they don't.
Now, regarding the two answers. We have to keep in mind that we were originally talking about climate change. Climate change is caused by known pollutants (mainly C02 and Methane). So if you agree that governments COULD, if acting together, ban and diminish the use of certain pollutants, wouldn't it follow that they could do so for C02 and Methane?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:24:16
Just because one government in the world is a big polluter does not mean that the public sector in general is the biggest polluter.
Moreover, if a government around the world is preventing emissions by capping them, or regulating industries, then they are contributing negative emissions.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:29:26
Wrong. Yes, all the wonderful advancements in our society are thanks to advancements in technology and productivity gains (isn't that a tautology anyways?). However, as pointed out in Why Nations Fail, technology does not occur in a vacuum. They need the institutions that ensure that if an entrepeneur invents something, someone else is not allowed to steal it. 
As described in the recent seminal book Why Nations Fail, the technology and conditions for the mechanized loom existed way before the industrial revolution, but when it was proposed in England, the elites blocked it because it threatened their interests.
In other words, a system of governance with clear institutions and laws (Ie. a state) is a basis for that tech you are describing.
Nobody is going to pump millions in R&amp;D if Genghis Khan can easily come and steal your shit.


Wrong, there has never been a more peaceful period in human history.


Considering we are no longer dealing with bayonets, this is great news

How is it a false dichotomy? Companies like Exxon Mobile clearly have the power and the inclination to influence climate policy...
By what fairy-tale mechanism do "the people" get to rein in Exxon Mobile and its billions of dollars when you get rid of the government?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:04:50
Look, when all hell breaks loose and the financial system crashes.
Do you think that people will keep faith in their internet currency when they need to actually buy stuff or pay for their debt?
Do you think that many stores will accept BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:48:38
The US government is in bed with Exxon. Why do you keep equating "US government" with "Every government around the world, at all times". Now THAT is a false dichotomy.


I'm all ears.

I find it incredibly ironic that people who support Bitcoin call nation's economies a Ponzi scheme. Its not necessarily a bad thing for a country to have debt if its sustainable with its future growth. Bitcoin, on the other hand, currently has no value more than it is speculative (people hold it because they believe more people will hold it in the future).


You are confusing two things. Just because we consume more does not mean that we are extracting more natural resources. In fact, most growth in advanced economies comes from intangible factors. 
Imagine a country that consumes 50 breads and 50 digital books. If consumption doubled because people now consume 150 books, is the planet less sustainable?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:38:00
Do you want Exxon Mobile to be in charge?

Although the 1.5K figure is high, he could be day-trading several coins at the same time (in fact that's what all the day traders I know do), he never said he only did BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:53:02
No offense but someone saying how/when the next world economy collapse will happen means as little to me as someone guessing when the next Bitcoin crash will be.
This is just my opinion and I'm no expert. This gentleman certainly knows a lot more than me.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:42:15
Yeah, I'm sure it will keep sustaining 100% growth/month /s
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:50:31
It's good that you accept that government action solved one particular problem (the ozone layer). 
But it's bad that you still can't see my point that just because (some more than others) government pollute does not make me concede that the answer is slashing regulation and taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:36
Newbie here. Is the discrepancy between GDAX/Coinbase normal? 
What can we make of it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:36:25


Another false contrast. It is China's entirety that is a big polluter and it is the chinese government which is reining that in by pushing for green energy and going heavy on the regulation.
The rest of your post is as shallow as it is naive, and is not worth addressing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:51

So you think that the inflation numbers are underreported and we are about to go into hyper-inflation soon. Never mind the fact that we haven't had high inflation numbers in the developed world for quite a while.
Also, wouldn't changing items from the CPI make sense considering consumer preferences also change over time?
What about places like Japan, that actually have economic issues because their inflation is not quite as high as they would like?
I don't want to be sound dickish but it seems to me like your theory has some falseability issues. No matter what happens, you will always believe we are headed for hyper-inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:51:07
How is asking for regulating getting in bed together? The private sector hates regulations.
Did you think they wholeheartedley accepted the Vienna convention, which made aerosol makers have to invest in much more expensive products to reduce the pollutants?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:16:11
He says, while totally ignoring the precise example of an international convention that sucessfully banned a pollutant, while providing nothing but generalities.
Are you saying that if I linked you to the Wikipedia page of the Vienna convention you would be convinced?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:35:28


If that is ALWAYS true as you seem to imply, wouldn't that mean that we should have seen massive inflation since 2008 because of the US's large stimulus package and the QE programs in the US and Europe?
Or we are still waiting for the lag to catch up? It's been 10 years
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:20:37
[Citation needed] the post, again.
Hey, remember when the world was worried about the Ozone Layer depletion and governments decided to get together in the Vienna convention and ban the chemicals that were causing the problem? Remember how it didn't work because reasons?
Oh wait, you don't because you are probably 12, and if you did remember this you would selectively forget it because it doesn't fit your narrow ideology. It did work, and the ozone layer is now recuperating.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:03:44
Failed how?
And have they recovered?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:34:12
I agree with this
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:38:08
Do you honestly think that all of current western developed nations are absolutely equal? Like do you not think that in some countries the corporations and rich people face higher taxes and higher constrains than in others?
I'm not saying that in some countries they have it all figured out, but lolbertarians see everything in such black and white terms.
Let me ask you another question, how do you tackle climate change if you don't have states. Because that's a commons problem: Everyone has incentives to keep pumping C02 but also loses if everyone else pumps C02
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:33:16
That's a ridiculous oversimplification. Do you think that is so everywhere? Even social-democratic countries such as Sweden?
What about laws and programs that have curtailed inequality? Are those made by corporations and lobbyists too?
And just because you feel that way does not mean it can't get worse.

Oh by all means continue believing in this techno-anarchist fantasy, a modern fairy-tale, except you have to be even more gullible to believe it.
Edit: After posting, I've realized that my comment may have come off as a bit dickish. You may simply not know any better so please allow me to explain.
Throughout human history, in the absence of a State, powerful elites have always taken advntage of their power to subdue the rest of the population. There is evidence of this even from 10.000 BC communities. During the last 200 years of democratic liberal capitalism that humans have seen the most increase in "freedom". The mere fact that we can enjoy a technology like the internet to discuss this topics is because a framework is needed to sustain innovations (so nobody can steal them) at the same time that we defend people rights (from prosecution, free speech).
That doesn't mean that our current system is perfect, or that it isn't beholden to particular interests. But trust me, liberty would be curtailed for 99% of the population if we were to give up on the state.
Fight me.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:34:41
Yeah, hate to break it to you but elites have been taking advantage of others long before the birth of the modern state. If anything, now there are more breaks so at least the worst abuses can be stopped.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:36:38
You know what's the problem with lolbertarians? Is that they believe that only formal laws can be used as ways to restrict freedoms. If we abolish the State and 0.1% of the population controls all the wealth and coercion power, do you really think that the 99% will be "free"?
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:17:18
Only one thing.


That amounts to a growth of 176% per year consistently.
So it does sound like quite a bit honestly
