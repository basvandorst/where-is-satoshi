Let me guess, you're an ancap?
While that may be the wet-dream you wish for, that's not how the world actually works outside borderline bartering with farmers down in a 3rd world shithole. If you pay with cash for example at **any** business they generally do not give you any discount compared to using a card. Ultra small businesses may tack on a fee for using a card if they're greedy and want more $, but this is counter-balanced by the rewards you get by using the card so it's irrelevant.
Where's the discount for using cash at Walmart? Or HEB? Or how about the apple store? Or verizon? Or what about Kroger? Academy? Basically nowhere gives you a discount. Stop being delusional.

It became a currency because a big boy told everyone else to use it "or else" and people followed. Why did he? Because he had lots of it and knew how to acquire it easily, and knew it wouldn't degrade in excess, and thus he could store it and control society for long periods of time and pass the wealth on effortlessly to his kind. 
Golds an incredibly shitty form of currency, just as some slop jumble of numbers that contributed nothing but pollution to society. If the calculations were of something meaningful or useful in some way, even just rights that says the token processed (X) it would be valuable in an abstract appreciative since. But that's not the case.

12000 is likely the true confirmation of a new uptrend unless we continue down (likely).
9000 is meaningless and signals nothing more than a good risk-reward to start looking at some shorts. All it signals is a short term bounce, before another leg down.
10950 is where longing becomes a reasonable but still questionable play where the Risk-reward is decent, however it is in no way a signal to hold past 11400.

Why bother? I don't care about having a memorable profile or identity on a site crowded in normies who post stupid photos just for upvotes. Every single person IRL that I know that uses reddit is absolute scum and a fake piece of trash online that acts super great, they're all great dads, they're all fun social people, but in reality they hate their kids, never play with them, sometimes hit them, yell at them and their wife, and are generally scumbuckets. But on reddit, facebook, and the rest they're good little angels.
Look at this reddit for example. I've shorted since we hit 16k and just kept adding. How did you do? How did most do here? The fucking "HODL" meme is on the front page right now. They got fucking demolished. That's how they did in the last few months. Why would I care to stick around for long or keep up an identity here? One reason.

Unless a global economic collapse occurs and bitcoin gets lucky to take the place of fiat in one major economy such as the US, yes, it can't have long-term viability, especially due to trader manipulation and liquidity problems (for a currency).

I purchase every goddamn thing I buy with credit cards and have **never** had any difficulty. 
Really? That's strange, but by how much? Or was it a backwards business that charges you a fee for use? If you manage your creditcards properly you can get 5-10% back on basically everything you buy. 
Entering in private info is hardly an issue seeing as it's not your problem if it's misused. It's easy when you use the same one frequently, I know my CVV's and expirery dates and remember a few card  by heart. 
Thing is, with bitcoin that retailer could be a shitbag and rip you off and you couldn't do anything about it. Your money would be in their hands and being a business, unless they're a conglomorate or large company, you'll have trouble getting it back if anything goes wrong, be it you simply finding it cheaper elsewhere, you not getting what you ordered or good service, or you simply changing your mind on the purchase or agreement meer moments after a purchase.
With a creditcard that's not an issue. You got lied to by the shop owner? Thrash their credit record and force your money back without ever speaking a word to the bastard if he causes trouble about you asking for a refund. Got a fake product, it's damaged, whatever, and the retailer doesn't fix it? Force your money back.
This is why I would **never** use bitcoin or any crypto for any payment to an individual or small business that does not provide the service entirely beforehand, and even then I'd be iffy about it. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:57:03
Unreasonably difficult and unreasonable to expect. I'd give it an 8.
Sounds ridiculous, as it's just downloading an app, buying some bitcoin and sending it to the wallet, and scanning a code, but you have to understand **that requires effort on the part of the user.**
Do you know how hard it is to get mobile payment systems going in the west? Every bank and their grandmother has started apps, gave tons of rewards for using them, etc, and they still get fuck-all adoption despite paying being literalmente' just opening the app and putting it near the card reader and then tapping "yes" or "no" on your phone.
That requires less effort as you don't need to buy or transfer anything nor secure anything yourself. That gives them rewards for using it and/or trying it. And **it still gets no adoption.**
Anyone saying otherwise has not studied the behavioral psychology of the average person with their money and spending habits. Most people are lazy, complacent, and don't give a fuck to change what they do. This same problem exists throughout all of the west.
In Asia it's different, but relatively problematic just in the same, as why the fuck am I downloading this shit and buying and transferring, etc, when I can just use alipay? That's why something like Omisego is the **only** chance at real world adoption for crypto payments. It needs to be universal, usable by existing mobile-payment platforms, and have a fiat onramp to even have a chance at any real world use outside some memer who buys and sells shitcoins online and acts like he knows about economics.

This is like saying you're going to put your boss out of business by working overtime. That's not how that works. You cannot beat the rich in capitalism. If they decide to move to the blockchain so be it, but it'll be no thanks to any one of us.


Yes, but that's not because they own crypto. Most don't. They lack retirement accounts because the last generation failed to educate them whatsoever and capitalism has beat them so far into the mud that they have no extra money to invest, nor any initiative. They'd rather spend that $10/week on a bottle of vodka to drown their misery than put it to a fund that'll allegedly make them wealthy. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:42:19
The bottom line is that's not a good argument. Just because you want to masturbate over the word "decentalized." A government, or public, cryptocurrency that does not require mining nor staking but rather has a minimal inflation fee to cover publicly hosted nodes, or have it a similar way as Iota theorizes it to be, where an individual is required to verify others tx's to use the network or have credits they purchased or the other party gives them to complete the tx. This would require nearly no computing power and thus energy due to the reality that a transaction is motherfucking bites, not terrabytes like bitcoins processing suggests. 
Comparing bitcoin's waste, which is far greater than others, to other stupid wasteless habits is not an argument. How about you and the idiots who do the other activities stop being stupid humans? It doesn't you to be stupid and wasteful because others are.

Anybody who uses robinhood knows about and can use coinbase, as old farts do not use some scummy platform to avoid a $5 trading fee. I seriously doubt it'll do anything positive at all, especially because robinhood's business model allows them to not actually hold the asset, meaning they do not actually have to buy what is purchased if they choose to take the other side of the trade, which at this point seems like the smarter thing to do.
At most it'll bring in a few dozen million, which wouldn't be enough to even move the price more than a couple hundred dollars, which would easily be soaked up by the downward pressure.

The funny thing about this is the majority of people on this subreddit are **so madly deluded** that they will miss the kicker: They listed actual uses for gold and there is none for bitcoin.

For free, no good ones, but it's asinine to care about a $5 fee per trade when crypto fees are way higher if you're trading any meaningful amount. Even binance, even using their token, the fees for a $10,000 trade is 3x higher than a broker transaction fee. 
For that $5 fee you usually get exceptional charting without advertisements, better interfaces, the ability to access it on any device, the ability to use leverage without paying for "gold status" and to nearly unlimited amounts, multiple rating agencies and screeners to help you weed out the ruff, superior market-executions, customer support and financial advisement for free in many cases, the ability to use LIFO methods of accounting which as a trader can save you hundreds or thousands in a year if you do any longer term investments, but still want to trade the stocks in the meantime, while keeping some in long term capital gains. There's also the superior tax accounting in general that allows you to simply plot it into the form, while robinhood often requires a bit of work.
But yes, there's a couple platforms like robinhood, but they're all even worse than robinhood. It's just that robinhood is hot-garbage for all the reasons above, not to mention it often has outages, especially during high-activity, which in the case of early January could have costed you multiple percent, likely hundreds of dollars if not thousands, because it simply would not work while proper brokers did.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:29:29
That's one industry that often does it, but the thing is the discount is usually meer cents. If you plopped it on a credit card you'd get 5-12.5% back, and thus have a discount of 2-6x what the gas station is providing.
Gas rewards are high on many cards and even without minimum spend optimizing you can easily get 2-3x what the station discounts you for.

It's a magical device that makes it more difficult to expose your private key to others or get keylogged.
It's safe so long as nobody physically has it, knows the key to restore it to another device, or you're storing billions and flaunting it, as there's always a way, and I mean always. Air-gapping is not even effective anymore.
Paper wallets are harder to access and can easily be screwed up if you're stupid, as well as when you use them and create them it requires far more work to stay relatively secure. A paper wallet could get keylogged, a HW wallet cannot be if used properly.

Other than those two Kraken is a safe bet, although the UI &amp; engine is suicide-tier imo.
Besides that you can always do something I consider more safe than tether, although questionable it's self, which is sign up to bitmex and sell your btc at 1x leverage to cash it out for fiat at the current market price.
You'll have to settle in BTC before you can truly cash out, however bitmex has a real business model and is likely solvent and extremely profitable so I'd assume they're safe.
Other than that I don't really have any good suggestions.

If you're going to buy crypto for the long-haul at least buy something that has a true potential in the long-term as it provides a service or business that can work within the current system (omisego) or a platform that enables people to build such things (ethereum).
Just the fact that you posted about it on reddit unprovoked in your own post  screams it's a bad investment decision. The smartest thing to do for your daughter's future is to sell the bitcoin and more than likely spend it now to give you or your wife a break as most parents are over-stressed because they didn't actually know what kids entail. Just spending it on time away from her to de-stress would far improve her future and the likelihood of her parents being happy together far more than some magical that likely will not even be a functioning blockchain when she grows up (due to electricity and difficulty).
At the very least just stick it in the bank and wait till some true sign of adoption happens, or wait till a certain industry is ready for a moonshot. She's fucking two. **TWO.** She has 16 years before college, which in all likelihood will be free by then due to the increasing socialist climate around the world. But even if not, that's going to be around 2035. Don't you realize how fucking big the space bubble is going to be? You can sit on cash, not even ever use it, or even put it in a savings account for interest, and likely shred any returns anyone else makes by just waiting for the space companies to go public and buying shitloads of them. Bubbles like bitcoin was just in (and likely still is in) come around every few years, and smaller versions every few months. There's no sense in jumping in now when things are uncertain. You're just throwing money away.

If you aren't building a farm just buy genesis-mining (shivers) contracts or buy crypto it's self. I have a contract with them and wouldn't recommend it (I can make better returns trading) however it's allegedly legit, and it has been profitable ever since a couple months into it.

You seriously aren't this deluded, are you?


It was and still **is** but that doesn't mean there isn't money to be funneled into your pocket. Bubbles are great for redistributing wealth. Why do you think we have had them so many times? They're intentional. You should identify them and be in the know and reap the profits.


I really hope you don't really think this was a good idea. If you SODL'd before you'd have had even more btc or whatever you like now, even buying in right now. **I sold and I'm fucking glad I sold when the normie-money clearly was drying up in the short-term.**
That was a bad decision. Learn from it.
**&gt;I should expect prices bellow 1k$ by the end of the month.**
You do realize that is the definition of FUD, right? It's a tactic shorts/bears use over and over. The same applies to the initial huge sell-off. It happened in btc two weeks before it genuinely crashed and it happened in stocks not too long ago. It's when you're supposed to load your shorts up on the bounce, as some slimey cunt just sodl'd enough to wreck the market and ruin everyone's fun. And they'll do it again when it goes up a bit again and they loaded up their true shorts on the "return to normal" area.
The more you're fearful the more likely you are to SODL after I/we/bears have, and thus the cheaper we can buy in and close our margin trade, or accumulate to pump it up real quick. Nobody genuinely thinks this other than Warren buffet and that's because he's technologically illiterate.

The fact of the matter is there is no real bitcoin community anymore outside a couple dozen folks who meet up in person, as the goddamn shitty speculating fools that shill relentlessly have killed it and ruined the community. Now the BTC community is not about decentralization for purpose, but rather for memes and money. It's dead. There is no community anymore. If you want to contribute to it make a "hodl XD" thread and jerk your weenie to it, as that's what it is now and I can't see it coming back. It'll never return back to how it was many years ago.
Nobody will use it either and nobody who matters accepts it, so unless you're buying drugs from an FBI agent (as real drug dealers use monero, the true privacy coin) or making a annoying bragging post on reddit how you just bought a used car in bitcoin, showing your wallet and smiling in front of the piece of shit that you bought from your best friend, then nobody is going to use it.

Hope doesn't belong in investing as that's what it sounds like your reasoning for buying a bitcoin was. Look at the chart and ask yourself if you are buying more right now, or if you think it's likely to leg down again. If it's the latter sell it, if it's the former hold or buy some more. But don't just "hope" it does something in your favor. That's what caused people to get burned hoping it'd "just go back up to 18k."

They're both absurdly high so that you wouldn't need anymore, however there are huge advantages to sharding over a lightning-network type system.
Sharding can be applied to any blockchain relatively easily once the structure is achieved by one. Be that Neo, Cardano, or Bitcoin, sharding the blockchain would be relatively simple.
