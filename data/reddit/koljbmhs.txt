Thank you for exerting the magnitude more effort to refute that bullshit.

Huh, that's strange... I thought this was the Bitcoin sub, not the anti-bitcoin douchebag sub.

well in base 11 the quantity 12 is written '11', and in that same way '11' (12) times '11' (12) is '121' (144). So yes the digit stands for the quantity 1 in the ones place, but in the higher places it holds value for a much larger number.

Good Job!

Do you mean work it out and show my work? I can, but I think it would be much more interesting to see a breakdown from someone who didn't already know the solution. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:03:50
It's not, I found the example that would make you think so, but all of the number symbols are whole numbers.

I dumped the private key using BitcoinQT, its a segwit address if that affects it.

Are you using ring theory? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:22:21


Actually that is a typo, you wouldn't believe how hard it is to proofread a made up character set in MS paint. the character you think says 'n' that is in the word you think is 'users' is on the same key as the C shaped character in what you think is 'units'. They are bound to upper and lowercase on the same key, so that is my bad. 
I was hoping there wouldn't be any catastrophic mistakes. Not trying to troll.

Upon review what I thought was a lower case L was actually the number 1 in the private key.

I deeply apologize for all of the errors I made in the design of this puzzle. If I do this type of thing again I will be more patient and make sure all the clues are consistent and coherent.

If I understand this correctly, the major drawback would effectively be a reduction in fungibility.
If I have network 12 balance, and I want to make a 47 transaction, I need to perform this 3 operation technique, (which would probably require 6 confs) then the money in 12 is not immediately worth what it would be in 47. This time delay effect is relevant for real world applications, like buyout auctions. 
If the immediate value is not the same, and a fee has to be paid to make the swap, then the fungibility for the user is disrupted, even if it hasn't really for the recipient.

Well even when Bitcoin was brand new there was the 6 block rule. Don't credit anything until 6 blocks are built on it. If they make two chains which are each valid in their own right but have spent coins to two different addresses, then waiting 6 blocks would make them have to produce two 6 block chain additions to fool both parties into crediting them before they could pick a chain to keep.
Going 6 blocks ahead of the rest of the miners would require more than 51% to do with any reliability because each block has a 49% chance of being mined by an honorable actor, which would force the attacker to mine on top of them.

Just open multiple channels that sum to your desired balance. If you are trying to send a large sum all at once, it's actually better to do it directly on chain right now. Even though fees are low, you shouldn't incurr multiple instances just to make one transaction.

How is saving the drive going to protect the file that has been overwritten twice?
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:44:48
What I'm trying to say is that if there is some subtle detail that you need high science to detect, it won't be copied over to whatever new drive you use when you save the contents. Its like making a backup of a famous painting, you can't copy the important part.

1. That 10 second exchange is inconvenient and must be reported on your taxes in the US.
2. The price fluctuates, if the ratio changes before they notice, they may lose money.
3. If you wanted $1000 worth of gold and you received $1000 worth of iron pyrite, even if you could exchange it for money, and eventually into gold it would be obvious false advertising.
It's still a scam to waste your time and energy with the hopes you will just keep the BCH, or at least sell it at a loss.
