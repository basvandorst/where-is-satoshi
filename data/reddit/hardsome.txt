There are people who are predicting bitcoin price reaching to the levels what you are suggesting but honestly speaking I haven't seen any back ups behind putting so high targets. Having said that, I do believe that bitcoin will go up but not sure how much. Is there any bitcoin price projection provided by some consultancy firms which would have done some research on it?

Could be but today it came down by 8% (in a single day)

Even I am optimistic about bitcoin price for long term but not so much what some people are suggesting. Secondly as i suggested in the topic that keeping aside some part of mined bitcoins to re invest in some other upcoming cryptos like dogecoin or XNF-NoFiatCoin makes a sense. Its like diversifying investment also there would be less impact if either bitcoin does not perform well or its price comes down.

Participating in various topics is based of interest. There are people who always talks about bitcoins does not make them anything but that shows their interest in the particular digital currency. I am interest in bitcoins and in some other alternate cryptos like dogecoin and XNF-NoFiatCoin. Any issues?

As per the website-  A request has to be submitted to redeem XNF but a couple of things I woule like to mention here is-
1.Only 1/3 rd of XNF is backed by bullion
2. XNF can be exchanged for XRP, BTC, USD as well as redeem it for bullion. 
looks pretty flexible as far as exchange/ redemption is concerned.
