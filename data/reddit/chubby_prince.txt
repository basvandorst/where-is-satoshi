Kin is up 9% - why?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:57
Blockchain tech: yes
Blockchain tech as embodied in Bitcoin: no

I agree 100%.  I never cared about Google Wallet until now.

Crazy.  I seriously had no idea Dogecoin was taking off.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:16:35
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:09:24
I've seen tons of companies accepting BTC and LTC - I've never seen Doge before.  I thought Doge was more of an inside Reddit joke.

What the hell just happened?
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:54:42


You are being pedantic to sound smart, but it's not working.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:05:52
This is the first I've ever seen Dogecoin accepted at a business.  Awesome.  Do you get many orders in Dogecoin?

They should just let you enter the number of bitcoins you hold, ping a reputable B-to-USD market value tracker, then show you your value of bitcoins on the site.  I suppose this is only useful if you hold bitcoins and want to continue to hold, but I would use it.

Wow!  In my face!  Thank you.

I'm not hatin'.  I really do love what you are doing - and selling hot sauce is your first priority, I get that.  
But good lord, you need to throw some of those crypto coins at a web developer to redo your website.  It's not good.  Just some constructive criticism.  Maybe use some crypto to pay a photographer to stage and take nice photos of all your sauces too.

Plus, if you were looking to come up with a pseudonym to work under for a project, I can see myself bastardizing someone else's name that I've seen in the past...it kind of adds legitimacy to it and helps with obfuscation.

The "TM" next to Bitcoin killed me.  Nicely done.

Courts look very unfavorably at big companies actively stifling competition.  The low level PayPal worker mentioning that "bitcoin is a competitor of PayPal so they aren't going to allow him to sell blades" isn't as big of a smoking gun as this guy thinks.  That can be played off to the judge as an non-decision-maker employee just shooting her mouth off.
If this guy has the money to go through discovery, now we are talking.  He can request any internal emails/memos/presentations, etc. relating to bitcoin and PayPal will have to hand those over.  There will be a protective order so we likely won't get to see those, but there could be very damning evidence that will get before the court.
My guess is that once PayPal figures out this guy has the money to go all the way (assuming he does) they will really start trying hard to settle.  This guy seems like (a) he doesn't need the money; and (b) he's spiteful against PayPal.  So he may be in the minority of people who will take the case all the way, just out of principle.
If the record shows there was a coordinated effort inside PayPal to stifle bitcoin-y stuff because PayPal believed it was a competitor - PayPal will get their ass handed to them in court.

Glad someone else noticed this.  So funny.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:05:26
You state that PayPal memos/emails regarding bitcoin are "not strictly relevant to the case."  You can't possibly know that.  We have no idea what jurisdiction this potential case would be filed in, whether it's in state or federal court, whether it would invoke antitrust/Sherman Act causes of action, etc.  You can't know what elements of a cause of action the memo would be used for, so how can you predetermine that it wouldn't be relevant?
Broadly speaking, if the attorneys for this plantiff bring in issues involving anti-comptitive practices at PayPal relating to Bitcoin, any internal document referencing bitcoin would likely be relevant in some way.

No they won't.  Reddit usernames with the term "bitcoin" in them are not using the term for "financial services, namely, providing a virtual currency for use by members of an on-line community via a global computer network".
Same reason I can say "I ate an apple for lunch" without fear of getting sued by Apple Computer for trademark infringement.  I'm not using the term "apple" in commerce and relating to computer systems.

IP attorney here - whoever owns the domain "bitcoin.org" should hire an attorney to oppose the registration of this mark.  The original paper was written in 2009 and used the term "bitcoin" to describe the concept.  That's a slam dunk, but the average joe off the street would not have sufficient standing to file an opposition.  However, the owners of the domain "bitcoin.org" *would* have sufficient standing.

"that just suck cash out of the economy"
Yea, because Visa/Mastercard does not employ anyone.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:39:21
I get that, but you could easily write a program to analyze the wallets, tree structure them all back up to the original wallet.  It's not rocket science, every wallet has to have an input if they have an output.  Just walk it back up the chain.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:44:49
Why are you downvoting historian1111?  He's very clearly showing you how bitcoin is not anonymous, it's psuedoanonymous.  You can "randomly" put money in all the wallets you want, you can still back up the chain to the original depositor if you have the time and resources.

What about the "useless" computations that are being done to mine coins?  He was totally incorrect with his characterization of that step.  You do realize those are not useless, right?  They are critical and provide security and authentication to each and every transaction.

That's a european registry.  Nobody owns the mark "bitcoins" in the U.S.  I just looked it up.  There are a few applied for marks, but they never registered.  Just like the Canadian filing will never survive the prosecution process.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:45:58
U.S. trademark lawyer ringing in.  No way in hell this registers or becomes enforceable.  I'm sure it's the same in Canada, but under U.S. trademark law, this "Neil V. K. Adams," committed fraud by filing this application.  In the U.S. application paperwork you must certify that you don't know of any conflicting use of your proposed mark.  He knows about bitcoins...that's why he's filing the trademark application.  If he would have come into my office asking me to apply for this mark, I would have kicked him out on his ass.

Hmmmm....tracking THOUSANDS of wallets???!!  If only we had some sort of device...that makes keeping track of data easier....some sort of device that stores data in a base structure....and then "computes" things from that base of data....
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:07:43
There will have to be fees once all the bit coins are mined. Why else would people perform the hashes?
