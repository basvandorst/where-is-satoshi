Yes, capital gains taxes confiscate wealth in those situations in which the inflation rate is greater than the capital gain. 
It is easier for tax authorities to levy taxes in this manner than to directly tax a percentage of held wealth, as in done in estate taxes or what are called intangibles taxes.
Unlike you, most taxpayers do not understand the nuances of inflation and taxes.

I too have given this subject some thought and agree with Rent to Own. The seller gets a payment income stream which deflates. After a certain number of payments the buyer gets title to the property. Cash Sellers would offer their property for a lump sum which is less than the present discounted value of the stream of payments.

Sidechains are genius I think - but the open source code has not yet been revealed although some Bitcoin Core developers are involved.
What I can add is that Bitcoin Core must be slightly changed to allow merged mining of one or more sidechains. As no coins can be generated on the sidechain, bitcoin pools must be somehow motivated to maintain various sidechains as well as the blockchain. Transaction fees or direct payments to pools would result in new revenue flowing down to bitcoin miners who would be creating new blocks for a sidechain as well as new blocks for the blockchain.
Because sidechain technology and the two-way peg is a clever extension of the already known technology of merged mining, an altcoin might just implement it before the usually conservatively moving Bitcoin Core. 
A promoter considering a new altcoin should have strong motivation to join an existing dominant altcoin network as a sidechain rather than go it alone.
Both the sidechain and main blockchain operators benefit as the sidechain operators offer branded innovation, and the main blockchain operators gain more demand and thus higher prices for their scarce coins.

I maintain a logistic model of bitcoin adoption by the population of all those entities which might possibly buy bitcoin. The logistic function is also known as the S-Curve, and has been used to model the adoption of technology.
[Bitcoin logistic model for 1 million USD maximum price](
In a logistic model, exponential growth slows gradually until the adoption half way point, after which growth slows dramatically. Typically the short period before the half way point on the linear S-Curve graph is the Knee. 
According to my model, if you believe that a maximum price of 1 million USD is achievable with full adoption, then the knee will occur in late 2015. If you believe that the maximum price will be 100K USD, then the knee occurs late this year. For a 10K USD maximum price, the knee is occurring now, with regard to the average trendline.

Satoshi called the process minting, and I do too. Satoshi did not want a single mint because it could be attacked, e.g. closed down by a government.
The idea came to me that a mining permit could be circulated around the network, such that peers took turns mining with no effort. In the USA we have the idiom of a floating crap game, in which the government cannot shut down a particular activity because it moves.
A month of researching the literature provided math-backed solutions to all the problems that this idea entailed - I think.

Unlike Satoshi's Bitcoin, this design requires the peer to identify itself by a unique controlled Bitcoin address. This is a start. Each message transmitted by a peer is signed by the associated private key, thus providing authentication as to who sent the message. The peer private key also signs the tamper-evident logs of its peers in a process academics dub timeline entanglement.
The Sybil attacks are resisted by the fact that the attacker must divide its available stake over the many puppet nodes which vote in the consensus-gathering quorum that bans malicious nodes. The voting is weighted by offered stake. A group of large-stake correct nodes can thus outvote a much larger number of small-stake puppet nodes. 
The math in a paper that I reference says that this design is OK if less than half the nodes are faulty. Without proof of math, I claim that this result extends to the stake-weighted majority, not simply a numerical majority.
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:02:54
Yes, as I understand the two way peg. When Bitcoin Core is modified to support sidechains I expect that few if any changes will be required for my code branch.
The notion that a single nomadic mint performs all mining should appeal to sidechain owners. There is only one entity, a software agent, to persuade to merge-mine. The reward policy, could for example, use a portion of the current daily $1.6 million Bitcoin block creation reward to pay for, or to subsidize, the merge-mining of certain otherwise uneconomical side chains. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:07:12
In my system there is a single mint that checks for duplicate transactions. There is no double spend problem. No Finney attack. No waiting for confirmations. The mint is a nomadic agent that moves around the paid-for distributed network - so it is decentralized for all practical purposes. Paid-for full nodes replicate the single non-forking blockchain. There are other attacks that this complicated system will face. I will find them when those functions get coded.

@_date: 2014-05-20 07:46:23
Could you elaborate? Is there a test case that you suggest I add?
This design solves many problems I think. You get paid to run a full node. You get dividends on your offered stake. The network is faster. Transactions are instantly accepted. Transaction fees are lower. Micro payments are possible. The waste of proof-of-work is eliminated. There is no threat of double spending. The wallet interface is unchanged. Blockchain unchanged. Fixed currency limit unchanged. Miners will be better off offering stake in return for assured dividends rather than receiving poor returns on obsolescing ASIC rigs or cloud mining contracts. This is not an altcoin. It is Bitcoin.

The process is actually just a bit more complicated. Because the economics of mining favor joining a pool of miners, what the network sees as a miner is actually the pool.
Pools generally use the stratum protocol, which is not part of the Bitcoin network protocol, to communicate with software clients such as cgminer which execute on special purpose ASIC computers. These pool clients do not have a copy of the blockchain.
The pool sends candidate blocks to cgminer for hashing, setting a difficulty low enough so that the miner sends found blocks rather often to the pool server. These candidate blocks count as shares when pool profits are distributed to poll clients. When one of the accepted shares solves the higher difficulty set by the network, then the pool creates the coinbase block and submits it to the network. Pool clients are told to drop their work in progress when ever the pool is notified by the network that a new block has been solved.
When the winning pool creates the coinbase transaction, an output address is provided by the pool to receive the mining reward.

Gresham's Law does not exactly apply, yet the logic that supports Gresham's Law also applies to how people spend or hold bitcoin with respect to fiat.
A deflating store of value is in the long term more desirable than an inflating store of value. The price of bitcoin has increased on average 10x annually because of this logic, as people choose to spend fiat to acquire bitcoin.
Gresham's Law says that bad money drives the good money out of circulation, which clearly does not apply to bitcoin because its transactions are growing at an average annual rate of 3.2x.

You might elaborate on that notion. It is not a term of art. 
The reward allocation policy is something that I would like tweaked by human representatives elected by a stake-weighted vote of the full nodes. Software agents are not sophisticated enough to make reward policy - but they can easily execute it. 
I leave the reward schedule alone because that is part Bitcoin that should never be changed if integrity in the system is to be maintained, e.g. the fixed limit on the amount of bitcoins every created.

Proof-of-work is what Satoshi called it.
I use proof-of-stake differently than PeerCoin or NXT because they have the same forking blockchain that legacy bitcoin has. The nomadic single mint agent in my design does not require proof of any sort to decide who gets to mine the next block.

When you get rid of proof-of-work, you need another way to achieve distributed consensus such that an adversary cannot simply create thousands of puppet nodes to out-vote the correct peers. 
There is only so much stake in the blockchain, and I think that dividend-seeking owners will pledge most of it to correct peers in this design.

DDoS works by overwhelming the socket which accepts the connections. Even if the socket refuses the connection, that takes work. Given enough inbound junk traffic, your node cannot communicate with its valid peers.

Yes the design is complex. Satoshi's design is simple really, and it looks better until one considers the waste of proof-of-work.
The complexity stems from a multi-agent architecture. Nick Szabo says that separation of duties in a distributed system makes it easier to trust. 
So I factored out  the required system behavior into simple roles that are easily verified by peers. For example, the mint agent creates new blocks but does not dole out the mining reward - another agent does that.

While I do not agree with legacy banks embracing Bitcoin, because doing so would ruin their existing businesses, I do agree that one way to control the amount of electric power consumed by mining would be to control it in the same manner as conventional pollution permits.
Namely, a free market would be established to trade divisible X.509 permits to mine bitcoin. An international treaty, signed by a sufficient number of developed counties could set this up with no change to the Bitcoin network protocol. Less than 10 mining pools control all bitcoin mining and the treaty would have them reject solved blocks not digitally signed by a mining permit.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:04:16
The best rebuttal for this notion is that miners have a strong self-interest to protect the integrity of the system.

The block creation rewards amount to $1.6 million every day. 
It should be easy to find 100 or so persons like you to run paid super peer nodes, and it should likewise be easy to pay 10,000 full node operators enough so that they can run server class hardware in a datacenter, or with symmetric business class Internet service, e.g static IP address, service level agreement.
It is amazing to think about what can be done with that amount of money to build the network Bitcoin needs to handle all the world's transactions. And the reward is growing at 10x per year on average, despite the four-year halving schedule.

Yes greed is half of it. We change Satoshi's bitcoin mining algorithm to allow mining by anyone with an ordinary computer so they receive the block rewards in direct proportion to the bitcoins they expose to the network.
The existing Bitcoin system of using Proof-of-Work to prevent double spending is wasteful, and growing so 10x worse each year. In about four more years at that rate, governments will take notice of the $100 billion worth of wasted electricity and perhaps ban bitcoin mining in some jurisdictions, using the incandescent light bulb ban as precedent.

Every peer runs the same code base. The tamper-evident logs contain the name of each operation the peer performed as well as the inputs and outputs of that operation.

I left the math out of my whitepaper, but there is plenty of math in the papers that I reference to justify each element of my design. The super peer network is the key to performance. I regard decentralization as something that can be influenced by the reward allocations too. If we need more super peers in Africa, then give them a greater reward portion. $1.6 million per day is a lot to allocate. I would have a Bitcoin non-profit with members elected by stake-offering node owners, tweak the reward settings to get the ideal amount of decentralization and performance.
Experience has shown that the legacy bitcoin network is very cooperative when it comes to dealing with serious issues such as faulty software releases. Node owners in my system will be better off if the system works. This is different than legacy bitcoin where mining pools or ASIC manufacturers have been accused of DDoSing each other.

Right. And the problem gets worse for large stake holders, or for wallet aggregators such as Coinbase or Blockchain.info. The proof-of-stake method of voting that I propose consists of a to-myself bitcoin transaction performed upon demand by the system.
I leave it others to design wallets that can secure a private key required for issuing the proof-of-stake transaction and also for digitally signing the tamper-evident logs of connected peers. Almost every modern server has a Trusted Platform Module that can be programmed to securely hold keys. Perhaps that is a start.
In my paper, I reference the Payment Card Industry standards for safeguarding customer card data. At a minimum the Bitcoin industry should follow similar standards with respect to safeguarding private keys.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:12:05
Yes I can win over the miners. Their current business model is awful. 
Every one of them has a budget for new hardware in 2015. If they simply ran their existing rigs in 2015 and used the hardware budget to offer stake, they would retain all that bitcoin plus receive dividends in 2016 that will likely be greater than 5%, depending upon how much stake is offered total.
Plus the datacenter scale mining farms are the sorts of facilities that should be super peer nodes in my design. They would get paid a good portion of the $1.6 million daily mining reward in return for providing their infrastructure. Not the mining gear of course, but the fail-safe power, the fault tolerant and well connected features that we expect from the cloud.

Suppose that Satoshi discarded the secret keys to the block rewards he generated while alpha testing the bitcoin network for a year. And suppose rather than create a new genesis block he merely deployed his test network into production as-is. 
Satoshi is believed to have spent only one 50 bitcoin block reward. If he did not sell during the great bubble of 2011 at $30, and if he did not sell at $266 in April 2013 bubble and did not sell at $1163 in the November 2013 bubble, then perhaps that is strong evidence that those secret keys are not available for spending by anyone.

Interesting comment because Multipools can mine where ever there are miners. Dogecoin and Litecoin both resulted from the large numbers of GPU miners leaving Bitcoin when SHA-256 ASICs drove up difficulty as Scrypt ASICs are beginning to now. GPU miners can often dispose of their old cards in the gaming market. There exists no such market for ASICs except the fools market and those who do not pay for power.
I suppose that Dogecoin and Litecoin will be superseded by Proof-of-Stake altcoins having similar branded appeal but no need for ASICs. The VertCoin and other anti-ASIC altcoins may draw the GPU miners. That is where I will go when my 3 leased Scrypt GPU rigs cannot pay for their power.

The reward payment reached $1.9 million daily. After paying 200 developers, after paying for say 100 worldwide super-servers as backbone, e.g. the current pool operators, after paying Coinbase, Blockchain, BitPay and such for order flow, I am sure that there would be plenty remaining to pay 10000 full nodes $1000 each month to operate full time with dedicated bandwidth.
There are currently only 7600 full nodes on legacy bitcoin, often running part time and with back-level versions. The legacy fork cannot compete with these payouts because miners must give almost all their income to the ASIC manufacturers and to the power company.
If the full nodes on the new fork outnumber the full nodes on the old fork then we win.
This will not happen of course unless there is wide approval gained during the planned year of system testing in 2015.

Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist, believes that the problem will take care of itself as the mining reward continues to halve every four years. He says that he does not care about mining. His problem with proof-of-stake is that the rich get richer. He overlooks the fact that bitcoin prices have been rising 10x annually and mining rewards have easily outpaced the four year halvings.

What happened to me was that given enough inbound connections and time, your full node eventually will become a source of old blocks for new nodes that are joining the network. Residential networks are commonly ADSL, in which the upload speed from your computer is much smaller than the download speed. When other nodes make their own copies of the 13 GB blockchain from yours, then the upload side of the ADSL connection gets swamped - and severely degrades all aspects of your network.
Unless you limit the bandwidth yourself, full nodes should be isolated on business-class symmetric internet connections, or otherwise your residential service can easily exceed bandwidth caps. The hosted nodes described in the comments are a good solution.

The hard fork would be conditioned on wide pre-approval. Notably, payment processors, exchanges, hosted wallets, wallet providers, and developers.
I do not need the approval of mining equipment manufactures, few if any are held in high regard by this community.
I think that 18 months is sufficent notice for bitcoin miners to retire their existing rigs. Those miners were always better off simply buying bitcoin anyway, and with paid dividends to stake-providers, this plan should win them over too.
There will be a year of public system testing in 2015 before the hard fork in early 2016. 
I envision that one or more multipools could mine the legacy fork and pay in new fork bitcoins. This would drive down the price of the bitcoins mined on the old fork and lift prices of bitcoins minted on the new fork.

Your point is the objection of the Bitcoin Chief Scientist, when frequently asked about proof-of-stake.
Yet Satoshi defended the great rewards given to early adopters by saying they deserved the 50 bitcoins, back then, for each mined block because they took the risks. I use the same argument today. Stakeholders risk their bitcoin by putting it in a hot wallet to support this system. 
In this design the reward allocation is not exactly specified. The intent is to well pay the infrastructure providers first, then distribute the remainder to stake-providers. 
The legacy financial system indeed flawed and is more likely to be swept away if this plan becomes reality.

The scaling part is the most certain to work from my viewpoint as a software engineer. The super peer design is very similar in network architecture to VisaNet and SwiftNet that handle most of the world'd credit card transactions and bank wire transfers. There is much more verification message traffice in my design vs Satoshi's, however the super peer network has fewer round trip hops to get anything done. The reallocation of the daily $1.6 million mining reward will pay for the required infrastructure to scale and to be fault-tolerant.

Ideally, the reward payments to infrastructure providers should be in proportion to their costs. Currently we have about $1.6 million rewards each day to allocate. I think that full node operators should be expected to have symmetric business-class Internet connections, and server class hardware. We want full time full-nodes, not laptops shut off in the evening. Likewise the backbone super-peer nodes should be located in geographically dispersed datacenters near carrier points-of-presence. The super peer hardware needs to be enterprise class redundant, monitored, clustered, etc. Left over rewards are paid as daily dividends to node owners proportionate to their offered stakes, which are to-myself transactions that prove they have the bitcoins. 
Misbehaving nodes are detected by remote attestation of their tamper-evident logs whose inputs and outputs can be matched to their connected peers' version. A stake-weighted quorum  of peers disconnects the misbehaving or faulting peer from the network. Proof-of-stake in this case prevents an attacker from creating thousands of controlled nodes to sway the vote.

Back in 2010 there was no difference - that is what Satoshi designed. But in 2011 the odds of a single computer solving a block were so difficult that mining pools were invented and flourished.
Miners today are not full nodes, they do not operate the bitcoind program unless they are node-running members of the small P2Pool. Miners operate hashing software such as cgminer which solves blocks on behalf of the pool. Todays miners are not directly on the Bitcoin network - they use the stratum protocol to communicate with their pool operator who runs a full node.
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:59:28
The complexity I believe is governed by the relative number of peer connections. The worst case is the blockchain replication by 10000 full nodes of the mint agent's activities. Each full node has three redundant connections to the super peer ring, and a certain number of random connections to other nodes whose actions it verifies.
The super peer network architecture should take care of the scaling issues. The code will succeed or fail on this issue, as well as certain other failure modes that I need to test for.
A practical contribution of this project in any case will be a large scale test harness in 2015 that proves the message traffic complexity is not a (big) problem.

Linguistically and semantically there is a case for both word forms.
First lets use bitcoins for the currency unit and Bitcoin for the network protocol. 
"bitcoin" is a currency unit similar to the dollar, euro, peso. As such it is object-like and cannot be subdivided. A dollar torn in half is not a dollar. This interpretation argues for 1 bitcoin, 2 bitcoins.
"bitcoin" is unlike the dollar in that it is divisible to 8 decimal places and because it is virtural, half a bitcoin, is still in some sense of the word bitcoin. This interpretation argues for "I want to buy some bitcoin", in which the listener understands that the amount may not be measured in  whole bitcoins.
To keep matters clear, I use the word coin in the sense of an indeterminate amount - I want to buy some coin.

Conventional wisdom in a rally is to buy on any dip, so that your position is likely to show an immediate gain.
That can be altered somewhat in bitcoin because it has increased 10x on average every year. There is no bad time to buy if you will just hold on for a few years at least after your purchase.
The worst time to buy - if any - is when prices are doubling every couple of weeks or less. Bitcoin rallies have always been super-exponential which as academics and traders both know, is unsustainable. I would buy anytime the price is less than half of the previous all time high - like it is now.

Sure. Each agent could be malicious. But if more than half the peers have correct behavior, then the math in a referenced paper says that the system will work after banning the offenders. Each peer is checked by its peers.
For example the mint agent aggregates all the transactions into blocks. Ten thousand full nodes perform the same operation in synchronization with the mint agent as it timestamps received transactions and sends the acknowledgements out. The mint is checked by all ten thousand full nodes who replicate the mint's canonical version of the blockchain.

Satoshi Nakamoto did not envision mining pools and left the scene shortly after after the first one appeared. His wisdom has been lost.
Mining pools encourage the centralization into trusted third parties because the best for hashers would be a single mining pool for everyone - the worst for hashers is solo mining where each hasher is effectively their own pool. Miners want steady returns, and the larger the pool, the steadier the return.
So why is not p2pPool the single most popular pool? Because you have to run a copy of bitcoind as well as the P2PPool client. Bitcoind requires more than 25GB of disk space and the initial bandwidth to download it. Furthermore, if the hasher configures bitcoind to accept incoming connections from other bitcoind instances on the network, then there is often a very high bandwidth upstream as other nodes on the network download their 25 GB of blockchain from others like you.
All in all, P2PPool is marginally more of a hassle than centralized pools. So in a winner-takes-all economy, P2PPool is not the winner.

The particular faults of prior proof-of-stake implementations do not apply here.
There are many possible new faults in this complicated design. There will be a year of public system testing, and one or more altcoin in-the-wild experiments, before hard-forking the Bitcoin blockchain in early 2016.

But its is easy to verify. I do [not] necessarily mean runs the same version of the same software, but rather I mean the software executed by a peer has the same behavior as the reference implementation.
In my design, full nodes are paid with some of the $1.6 million daily mining reward. You would think that if peer nodes banned them for being back-level, then they sure would have an incentive to be on the right version.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:31:34
Proof of work is spending money on electricity and mining equipment usually equal to your proportional share of the daily coin rewards, e.g. Bitcoin about $1.1 million every day.
Proof of stake is getting some or all of that same money without spending money on electricity and mining equipment.
Satoshi came up with the idea of PoW first. Sunny King made PeerCoin which was the first major PoS altcoin. About half of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap are  not PoW like Bitcoin, rather they are PoS or some other variant to secure their respective blockchains.

Josh Garza, last spring shipped Scrypt ASIC mining equipment from his dealer inventory stock. You paid and they shipped. This was a huge innovation in the wake of Butterfly Labs and numerous other manufacturers shipping late with customer funds tied up for many months in pre-orders.
Then on a roll, Josh leveraged that goodwill into cloud mining. He was not the first, but cloud mining saves miners the expense of buying, provisioning, configuring, tuning, operating, monitoring, choosing coins to mine, and ultimately disposing of obsolete mining rigs.
Josh then launched his own altcoin - Paycoin, XPY, which uses a big premine and proof-of-stake to allocate the coin rewards mostly to his company GAW Miners. Because there is no expense for electricity or mining equipment, Josh and GAW can, whenever they wish, dump tens of thousands of dollars worth of XPY into the daily transaction volume of $100K+. 
These funds and the funds of his investors, allow Josh to flood industry websites with Paycoin and Paybase advertising. Bitcoin has no response because all its new coins mostly get paid by independent hashers to electric utilities and Chinese ASIC manufacturers.
Perhaps because of inexperience, Josh talks about, hypes even, upcoming features of his altcoin and of his companies. Typical CEOs only hype what they are currently delivering to customers and try hard to keep clearly stated promises. Given Josh's swift rise to prominence, doubter's believe that his enterprise is possibly a ponzi scam in which early investors and customers profit, but ultimately the inflow of new cash and customers will dry up.
Time will tell.

High Frequency Trading, or more generally, algorithmic trading, could most easily be accomplished on an exchange that has an Application Programming Interface, i.e. API, that allows a computer program to automatically perform trades on behalf of a human trader.

I would be interested to know where you get stopped out. It very well may be that the first stop is just a dip before the really big run up, Elliot-wave style.  Some traders back in 2011 might have gotten stopped out at 3 after the run up from 0.50 - and entirely missed the subsequent run up to 32.

Sure, a mining pool could annotate, in a separate published database, those solved blocks by qualified miners.  Furthermore, a mining pool is free to set up any mechanism it wants regarding payouts to miners. For example, a mining pool could be established such that it consists only of sustainable miners.
But really to the point, sustainable electric energy is cheaper now for some users, and bitcoin mining operations will naturally migrate to those locations. To wit, on bitcointalk back in 2011 there was a post on the mining forum from a European who had a wind turbine on his property and as part of the lease arrangements, was entitled to a large amount of free power and wanted to learn about bitcoin mining. Likewise small scale hydro power is a good fit for bitcoin mining.

Ah. You sent from an exchange. When I sent bitcoin from MtGox to my Blockchain.info wallet, MtGox lists the destination address but not the transaction id. So if you are doing likewise, then your only means of do-it-yourself investigation is to look at the transactions at the receiving address. You need not log into to your blockchain.info wallet in order to use their blockchain explorer. Did you enter your wallet address into the search field on their home page to see what is happening.
If nothing there, then you must contact the sending exchange for transaction detail.

There are two aspects to the bitcoin economy: (1) bitcoin is a deflationary store of value, and indeed it is best to buy and hold, (2) bitcoin is a very low cost, irreversible, digital payment instrument.

The way I see it, a proper bitcoin bank would not have many bitcoins in its own wallets - hot or cold.

Bitcoin prices have recently been well correlated with rising transaction volume - both increasing. Doubtless, transaction volumes will continue to grow given the advantages of the digital crypto-currency, and the reality that the bitcoin economy is growing exponentially from a minuscule base.
Most participants conducting transactions to buy or sell something, do not really care about the absolute bitcoin price level, as merchants can easily price merchandise and services in native fiat currency behind the scenes and display realtime-adjusted bitcoin prices. This feature was worked out to accommodate the sorts of wild price fluctuation seen in 2011.
And on the other hand, the majority of bitcoins are simply held as a store of value, and naturally those hoarders pay attention to the price of bitcoins and may speculate. It would not take much more public interest to cause bitcoin prices, for a brief period, to rise far above the underlying growth in the bitcoin economy. Such is the nature of speculation.

I want the transaction effort to be less than a cash transaction, e.g. no change counting nor stuffing change bills into my wallet. I want the point of sale terminal to know me by my physical presence, and I simply confirm the transaction amount on a screen with one key press - no signature and no PIN. If my mobile wallet is lost, e.g. lost cellphone, I want to lose only the relatively small amount of bitcoins loaded into it. I want the wallet provider backing my mobile wallet to be trustworthy enough so that my point of sale transaction is immediate, not pending a confirmation.

While you are brainstorming for bitcoin economy startup ideas, its important to separate out the two roles of bitcoins, 1. an efficient credit token for exchange of goods and services, 2. a deflationary store of value.
Here are some ideas for (1) bitcoin used in financial transactions ...
* mobile payments at point of sale - I should be able to walk up to a POS terminal, and it should just recognize my mobile device, I should agree to the sale price and with only one click, completing the transaction. My mobile hot wallet should record the merchant and purchase details for subsequent personal budgeting or business expense categorization. Mobile bitcoin wallets should aspire to completely replace physical wallets for cash.
* The bitcoin economy needs the equivalent of credit reporting agencies, to avoid the need for escrow, such as practiced by Silk Road.
* The bitcointalk.org forum is the main way dynamic information about bitcoin gets passed around. Yet its forum operations are not state of the art, and there is need of an easy to access this dynamic information as well as the static bitcoin documentation accessed via the bitcoin wiki.
* A service should exist to send money anywhere, from bitcoins or from a bank account, using bitcoins as the exchange medium to undercut the existing bank wire transfer process where possible.
Here are some ideas for bitcoin as a store of value ...
* There needs to be a bitcoin bank with interest bearing bitcoin deposit accounts.
* The securities market for bitcoin security investments is growing but still immature, e.g. we need a bitcoin investment bank and rating agency.

The reason I quit mining was the same in 2010 and also 2011. Namely, the cost of electricity, the heat generated, the noise of the fans, and the capital cost of purpose-built mining rigs, is too much effort, annoyance, and cost compared to simply buying bitcoins with fiat currency once MtGox got running.

Did you set a non-zero transaction fee? If so, confirmation might take a long time. You can double-spend with a fee such as 0.001 BTC and that one should confirm much faster, then the network will drop the original transaction as a double spend. I think your funds are safe.

You are a great example of how spending still occurs when bitcoins dramatically deflate. Hoarders are simply using bitcoins as a deflating store of value. Why hold, say a dollar checking or savings account that has a maintenance fee, and inflates at 2-3% annually - when holding bitcoins deflates 400-500% annually.
The two roles for bitcoin: (1) no-recourse, low cost digital transactions, and (2) deflating store of value - support each other in the bitcoin economy.

* China could be the first nation to use bitcoin as a reserve. And there is a first mover advantage is acquiring a substantial portion of the limited number of circulating bitcoins.
* Using bitcoin as a reserve currency is a modern, technologically compelling concept that vividly demonstrates China's forward thinking leadership - a patriotic source of national pride
* Dethroning the dollar is in China's best interest, and perhaps too, speaking as an American - in the long run - in America's interest getting its federal finances back in order.
* Your research paper on just how China would go about this process should assure you a great job in the China financial sector if you want it.

Current price, at 10:15 CT USA, is 33.56 at MtGox. Volume looks more normal compared to yesterday's spike. Probably Coinbase is dealing with issues from yesterday.

Regarding "Coins traded vs coins transacted ratio" ...
I have been simply eyeballing this technical indicator - that you identified, by comparing log charts of the seven day averages published at blockchain.info. 
Do you have a definition or simple method to compute this? Seems to me that this is a very compelling indicator unique to the *fundamental* analysis of bitcoin pricing.

Try Bitfinex. And if one likes dollars instead, this exchange pays several hundred percent APR on dollars lent to bitcoin margin accounts.

"The central banks are already the largest holders of bitcoin."
No proof of that, but it will surely happen if bitcoin replaces the dollar as the consensus reserve currency. Likewise, eventually big commercial banks will need lots of bitcoin to offer bitcoin-denominated debit accounts.

This is a scam. The craigslist post, which I have flagged, calls for the unwary reader to send their bitcoins to a supplied wallet address for 'doubling'.

There are still new investors that previously committed to bitcoin who believe that $112 is a great value because just a couple of days ago we were at 266.
However, the pipeline of new investors has been shut off by the negative media attention due to the crash. This lack of good news facilitates further decline to retrace nearly all the advance of the bubble.

The wall is from the bitcoinity depth chart. The OP implies that there is at least one buyer at Mt Gox who is possibly thinking that prices will fall 17 USD rapidly so that this order will get filled.

At the core of the Singularity is recursive self improvement of a general artificial intelligence. Bitcoin does not have that property.
However, bitcoin is a manifestation of the continuing approach to the Singularity, in which technological changes occur more rapidly than before. According to Singularity theory, the adoption of bitcoin should occur more rapidly, and be more disruptive, than previous generations of non-digital payment systems.

Those with resources might consider running their own full bitcoin nodes on a dedicated internet connection, so as to not take bandwidth away from other applications.
I do this.

Be careful. Your advice is akin to recommending to a telcom that they get into VOIP because it is so much better than their voice minutes, or that they replace SMS with TCP/IP messaging.
Sure the new tech is better, but it will destroy the profitability model of the entrenched. E.g. your company may have to face competition from an easy-to-use mobile payment solution that is essentially free to the customer and to the merchant.

This analysis is conservative with regard to future bitcoin value.
There are two primary roles for bitcoins: (1) a credit token for buying and selling things, including fiat currencies, and (2) a deflating store of value.
The article addresses only the first role. Research on the blockchain has determined the great majority of bitcoins seldom participate in transactions - thus they serve their owners as a store of value. Other analysis of global monetary aggregates which could be disrupted by widespread bitcoin adoption suggest that ultimate bitcoin value is several orders of magnitude higher than $1000. For example, suppose that a majority of persons and entities worldwide held cash in bitcoin denominated accounts rather than accounts denominated in fiat currency. They don't have to continuously transact bitcoins in order to use them as a deflating store of value.
Just suppose, that Apple Corp decided to put its cash hoard of 137 billion USD into a bitcoin account to protect against the inflating dollar. Very roughly, that would expand the bitcoin market cap by 380x, to value each bitcoin at $12,768. This is just one large US company ...

Warren Buffet is a famous value investor who avoids technology investments. If and when he ever buys bitcoin, you can be sure that it will occur when everyone else is panic selling.
I for one, welcome the first trillionaire that will result when bitcoin is fully adopted.  I strongly value the greedy and absolute investment discussion back in 2010 that persuaded me to begin CPU mining.

Once bitcoin reaches a relatively stable value, the increase in that value will likely be strongly correlated to the overall growth of the economy. Bitcoin does not 'appreciate at the rate of inflation', rather, relative to an inflating fiat currency, bitcoin deflates as the economy grows.
Technically, the adoption of bitcoin as a payment mechanism is not difficult worldwide. This means that the bitcoin economy can continue logarithmic growth. Of course, price speculation gets ahead of the fundamentals.

Have you had a negative experience with mpex? 
Last spring I participated in their bond investment program via a bitfunder pass through. Although I lost 20% instead of gaining my hoped-for 10% return, mpex was complete legit in my experience.

Another bubble - yes. 
But I learned from trading both the June 2011 bubble, and from trading the April 2013  bubble that buy and hold prevents losses and gives the best return. 
As a mater of fact I am buying more today and don't care if the price drops by 66% - because I cannot time it.

Given that bitcoin's log 10 upward price trend over the years have been over half of one percent per day vs fiat, I believe that all petty cash should be swept into bitcoin when received and moved out to fiat only when fiat debits are needed.
Sort of the reverse of what you are saying. Hold all you can in bitcoin, whenever it is possible.
