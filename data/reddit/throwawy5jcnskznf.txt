Ohhh. Weird, I played portal 1 and 2 but I don’t remember cake being involved. God I loved that game though
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:06:27
I don’t know what you mean. Are you asking if I lost the game? I don’t think so, but it was so long ago. If you mean if I destroyed the physical game somehow, I definitely didn’t do that ��

Food and water also has a limited shelf life. Bitcoin fluctuates, it doesn’t ROT 
If I lived in Venezuela, a significant portion of my savings would be in BTC and dry food storage (if I could hide/protect the food well).

I’d say the girls are about equal. If we’re relating to what “makes sense”, then I’d say it depends what you’re appetite for risk is. Some people find speculation more attractive, while others find job stability more attractive. 
I don’t know why I’m writing this at 3am half awake lol XD

Holy crap! Interesting and very sad. That certainly sheds some light on things. I can’t imagine what people are going through
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:54:20
I agree! For me, I would just move abroad to a cheap/beautiful area, buy a small spot near the beach and live a simple life. If I felt like it, maybe I’d start a small B&amp;B or restaurant to make a little money and keep me busy. I don’t need anything fancy lol

The fact that it went from $250 to $18k in only 3-4 years means that a handful of unexpected holders got to retire super early. It’s quite incredible when you think about it. 
Money like that doesn’t really run out quickly unless the person is a complete idiot....which with all of the “Lambo” memes, it’s clear that some are ��

I hear you brother. I cannot imagine hyperinflation because I’ve never lived through it, but I know how I’d handle it...super-limited exposure to fiat. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:47:45
That, and international shipping is damn expensive. It’s nothing like shipping to the USA and other more developed countries. I live in a Latin Country, and shipping here (if offered at all) is like 20-30% more expensive, with chance of stolen items, and it takes months to arrive. I buy my important things when I visit my home country. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:23:36
I don’t really get how it’s possible to fake trading. If you buy bitcoin...you can transfer it to your wallet. If you’re using leverage/margin and you try to transfer the funds...you will pay market price, aka margin call. 
If anything is a hoax in BTC is even more of a hoax in USD/fiat. Banks fudge numbers with USD all the time, and cover-up in various ways. 
Maybe BTC volume can be fudged by the platforms/exchanges since they most often aren’t regulated, but people usually only give a shit about buy/sell price.

If enough people want some, I’ll fly down and get it, I’m only a couple of hours away in both directions (Venezuela/USA). PM me if interested. Don’t PM me for anything illegal and I’m serious about that.

The Fed doesn’t really lose money, unless it’s value goes down from competing currencies. Even if it “misplaces” money, the Fed still controls the value of that money. It’s probably the most secure business model...considering any threats are legally neutralized with military force.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:13:30
Definitely agree with that too, especially with the speculation side.
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:46:45
Isn’t that essentially how it’s always been? People have been hiding wealth for as long as wealth has existed. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 21:01:46
Ahhh the beauty of competition and market forces. Everything small is laughable until it becomes a dominant market force. 
All of the naysayers were calling it a fad. Of course, those same people will claim that they knew all along that it was going to be successful to save face. Only trust in facts, not rumors.

Anyone that’s solely motivated by making money will eventually get burned and “dislike” crypto. They’re missing all of the other parts...what makes money valuable, the history of money, how crypto works and it’s advantages, the possible future of money...
...those are the things that keeps people in it through the ups and downs.
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:59:43
This is an excellent point. I’ve never thought about that before. Thanks!
Have you seen the movie “In Time”...it definitely demonstrates what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:48:20
Probably not. He’s way too much of a tech dude to not be in something with as much potential as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 05:24:05
Great point!
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:17:12
Yes, exactly. You can win and you can lose. I’ve made money and I’ve lost money. But I will always be involved because it’s a fascinating concept and I believe that crypto (or something related to it) is the future. I think so many people are just exhausted from all the BS that comes with centralized/government-controlled/manipulated money. The bailouts of 2008 are what really gave crypto it’s initial boost, and I imagine it will only continue gaining strength with time.
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:50:22
Exactly. Why do people complicate things? Just use LocalBitcoins the way that it was intended. Jeeze people. 
I feel for anyone that gets into a car crash, but how many signs do we need to tell people to wear their seatbelts? The world is a dangerous place, protect yourself please.
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:34:39
The IRS has been so bold to say that even drug dealers should pay taxes on their proceeds...and the IRS claims that they won’t prosecute based on where the income originated. 
So...ignoring taxes from illegal means is...illegal. Funny, but true.
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:54:49
I agree. It’s too easy for the powerful elite to create some form of atrocity, connect it to BTC and then blame it on BTC to increase the strength of their own currency (US Dollar, for example). 
So...no. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:13:23
Yes you are definitely right, but...


Nobody wants to see that chart because Bitcoin will not compare. In fact, bitcoin trading volume to fiat currencies will be so small relative to the USD, that it might even be nearly impossible to see. USD is the reserve currency/king of the world.
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:40:32
Oh, yes. It definitely is that.
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:45:54
Could be good. Could be nothing. At least it’s not bad...and that’s a good thing ��
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:30:31
I think what he means that pursing money from income earners is a cost-benefit ratio. It costs money/manpower to find people that aren’t paying taxes. It’s probably just not worth the effort.
It’s like trying to tax the proceeds of a garage sale. Maybe these wow-gold sellers are making decent money by there own standards, but hardly enough to chase them for scrap pennies.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:26:13
It depends which results we’re talking about. Obviously nobody is going to have an 8-pack made of bread, or they’re not human. There’s too much ambiguity here...”many people”, “results we’re talking about”, “being healthy”, “conventional sense”. Nobody can debate something without clearly defined parameters...so I’m not going to try. 
I just ate a delicious sandwich. I hope you’re having a good day.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:18:49
I’ve never really understood intrinsic value. It’s said that it ignores market value. But nothing has value if nobody will buy it now or in the future. So of course it’s based on the market...all value is based on market value. So I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:01:38
100% agree. Ive seen them pull some cheap shots on financial advice/analysis when I watched it. They’re totally scheming to offer only advice that lines their pockets in some way.
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:01:54
You’re forgetting the supply side, which is what he is talking about.
Increase supply, price drops. That’s why the govt got into selling paper gold...they can just sell a lot and the price goes down. That’s why man people that are into gold are angry at the govt. Also, people worry that this will happen to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:16:20
I haven’t seen something as funny as this for a while. Thanks for the laugh :)
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:07:30
Not if they own all the bitcoin and jack up the price.

Truth. People seem to think doing sit-ups makes your abs look like that. Nope. Doing sit-ups *and a lot of cardio* makes your abs look like that. 
People would rather lift weights...but the true magic comes from cardio.

Can you slow down on the angry dickish comments? I think most people are open for a debate, join us.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:35:41
No no, I’m not trying to be argumentative. I am trying to understand how intrinsic works. But no worries. Thanks for explaining what you have explained so far. In reality, I’m not getting into finance or anything - that’s a completely different world for me anyway lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:29:36
It’s interesting that he used “nip it in the bud” because that implies that Crypto is on the map, is a force to reckon with and has potential to grow into something very powerful/competitive with the USD...so much that he argues that it can *threaten* the stability of the USD.
I think humans should be proud that we accomplished creating/supporting a decentralized system of economic value/exchange that cannot be controlled by the worlds largest superpower. Sure, they can sign it into law to be illegal, which they won’t because they have no grounds to do so, but even it being illegal won’t stop it from being used, as the rest of the world will adopt it and the USA will be sitting alone with stacks of dollars that nobody wants.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:02:30
This was a brilliant explanation. Thank you for writing this out. I can definitely see that anyone would choose the producing assets over the non-producing assets, except for maybe to hold some for market volatility or as an emergency stash. Intrinsic value is clearly very different than what I had previously thought. I can see now that it’s more closely related to the future value. Thank you again. Interesting stuff :)
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:17:06
In other words...it’s investors with big $$$.
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:40:31
Depends what you’re in it for. If you’re a believer that it’ll become the money of the future, you’ll probably just never sell. 
If you’re in it for the money, which most are, then it’s easy to hodl...until prices start dipping again. Then the “sell” button looks really attractive. That’s exactly why Bitcoin tanks so hard when it starts to go down after a big upswing...people are afraid to lose their potential big gains. 
If people just held, Bitcoin would be into the stratosphere. But...greed and fear.
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:05:38
Not only shorting, also selling at key times to surpress the price
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:15:59
Which risk are you referring to? Physical involves transportation. Paper only carries market risk.
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:48:23
People believe that the real price has deviated a lot, but it’s difficult to really know because they keep dumping paper into the market. And getting physical off-market. And yes, you’re not wrong to say that it sounds like it’s fraud, many people believe that it’s exactly fraud that is happening. 
I’m not sure what you mean by peg the asset. If you mean control it at one price, then yes, they basically do that in a number of fashions. However, governments that have publicly pegged assets in the past (such as two currencies) have run into issues and paid the price. I think the USA would never do that because people would instantly challenge their peg price by submitting buy orders for physical. Eventually they would run out of supply, especially if supply was also publicly known.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:56:42
Cool thanks for explaining. I incorrectly thought that intrinsic meant something along the lines of “inherent”. But I see that it’s very different.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:41:01
You mean that Exxon has intrinsic value because of the production process? But don’t they claim that both things (also gold) has intrinsic value? I think the argument is that gold has intrinsic value because it’s rare (and in minor uses in electronics, but I think it’s best to leave that part out for learning sake). So, which is intrinsically valuable? If gold has no intrinsic value and the only things of intrinsic value are forms of production (businesses), then I guess that means that intrinsic value = production. If that’s the case, then nothing other than businesses have value.

Starvation diets don’t work and they’re unhealthy. But yeah, technically that would do it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:11:57
I think it’s because crypto is weakened if it’s diversified too much across different coins. For example, if everyone created their own version of the USDollar or (fill in any currency here) how would that work out?
Crypto is stronger when one stands in the spotlight. Of course, the others always have use-cases and are better in certain scenarios.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:19:34
Warren Buffett has reason to be against it for sure, but he is diversified across so many businesses that it would just be a transition for him. For one example, he owns Benjamin Moore paint which is a well known paint company. People still need to buy paint, whether they’re buying it in fiat or crypto. 
To Warren Buffett, whether he understands it or not, the current system is stable for him and working well for him. Crypto is just another flea to him, like a lawsuit that he probably experiences weekly, that he’d rather have nothing to do with. 
People generally oppose change, especially systemic change, when the current system is in their favor.
