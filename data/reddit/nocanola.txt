I sure hope so.

Don’t forget to ask for a security escort to your car if you transfer it to your bank and cash out.

Exactly, with all the hysteria you would think it is at $300.  It is still up 24% in the one month chart,  114% in 3 months.

Wait, so you mean to say “buy the dip” isn’t the best advice? ��
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:25:27
In 20 years it could be $9, in 20 years it could be $300,000.  Anyone who claims to know for sure is full of shit.  What is your point?  I never said hold on and you will eventually make out like a bandit.

People need to stop being so melodramatic about bitcoin.  It will rise, fall, rise and fall.  Did anyone think it was just going to go to $100,000 in a linear projection?  It isn’t a get rich quick scheme.

Where is the “buy the dip” person?
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:02:58
Because they don’t own it and refuse to admit they missed out, thus a silly justification.

Not sure who in their right mind would buy an opened ledger.

There is a fourth option that I would consider the most, sell half.

Are you trolling? You can’t actually be serious.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:02:32
Just stay away.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:43:12
Yes.  They are notorious for kicking people out for absolutely no reason, completely randomly.  It is a big hassle when this happens, trying to get your money out when you are no longer a client, and their customer service is non existent.  It’s a shady company that has a nice website to make you think its some legit bank.

HODL!  That’s all.
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:05:21
I don’t believe you are that stupid, but incase I’m wrong, you don’t even give your passwords or keys to anyone, not even your twin brother who is a fucking priest.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:50:53
So many ignorant haters. It is trending up regardless of what shade you try to throw.  Bunch of barking dogs while the caravan of success rolls by.  HODL!
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:12:15
And stocks aren’t manipulated? Be honest with yourself, that isn’t why you are being so negative.  You will miss every single opportunity with such a pessimistic attitude.
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:24:08
The caravan of wishful thinking....funny thing is it is up 54% in the last 3 months, but you wouldn’t know that because, well, ignorance and stupidity are blinding.
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:59:23
Well at least we agree that stocks are manipulated as well.  I don’t invest an amount I am unwilling to potentially lose, and am sure I’m not the only one.  Nothing wrong with seeing an opportunity and taking it, and nothing wrong avoiding risk, whatever that suits the persons situation.

As soon as I got their email, I purchased a ledger nano s, and was able to transfer everything over. It was a smooth transaction, but they refused to answer any of my questions as to why they booted me.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:20:35
Yeah, same exact thing happened to me.  No idea what their problem is in randomly kicking out their own customers but it was a blessing in disguise, Robinhood allows free trades and I own it there now.  Screw coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:11:13
That’s true, but on the plus side there are also no fees to store or access what you own.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:23:13
Except when you sell it, and have immediate access to your funds in fiat.  We aren’t there yet when you can completely forget about fiat, at the end of the day, thats what it will be converted to.
