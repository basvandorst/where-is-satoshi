I'm not referring to the OP's question or situation in any way shape or form.  I'm talking reality here.

Yes, that is correct.  The American government was established because the British government wasn't upholding these rights.  Perhaps my wording of '... have these rights established' is a bit of a misnomer.  It should be '... have these rights protected.'

Because they still have value in fiat form.  Bitcoin isn't stable or widespread enough to stand as a currency on its own.

I agree with you.  I'm not sure that I contradict this in my post (do I?), but perhaps my wording isn't as specific as yours.

I don't think that your first paragraph is a valid argument.  The writers of the Declaration of Independence felt that the rights were self-evident, meaning they should have been a given from the *British* government.  Since they weren't, they are forming a *new* government that does have these rights established.  
You're basically trying to shit on the American government, when the document you're citing is shitting on the British government and any governments like it.  It doesn't make sense.
If you don't believe me [go read the Declaration yourself](

Even still.  Cell phones are definitely more wide-spread, but not everyone has one.  In Africa (Kenya specifically, really), cell phones are shared between families and friends.  Something like 99% of people have access to phones, but it's around 30% that actually own one.  I feel like that would cause people to not want to use bitcoin, because the money is typically stored on the device.  mPesa is widely used in Kenya, but it works in a fundamentally different way in that the funds aren't actually stored on the device.  If someone loses their phone or if its stolen, then their bitcoins are also gone, regardless of whether or not someone can steal them or not.  Also, smartphones are not very ubiquitous.

Good point.  I guess my response was more to the end of the graphic's "Bitcoin, keeping your money safe with the laws of the universe."  I don't think any encryption can be without vulnerability.  It just depends on how long it takes to find those vulnerabilities.

This makes me really wish I had bought some when I found out about it in fall 2010..

The problem I see with that is that the fiat value of the bitcoin changes pretty rapidly still. OP would need a variable price of the bitcoin, or people could be paying $0.75 on one day and $1.25 on another.
Forgot to include the "on one day" and "on" parts of the last sentence, making it nonsensical.

Am I wrong to think that anything currency related should probably be kept out of specifications?  I mean, currencies can die at any time, and others will take their place. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:05:51
I suppose that could work, but then I feel there's a greater chance of losing bitcoins.  Unless I'm mistaken, if bitcoins are lost, there's no way to get them back, and bitcoins have a maximum number available.

AES256 is locked down tight for now.  That's not to say that it doesn't have some vulnerability that could be exploited in the future.  It could also stay secure for a long while to come.  It's really hard to say.

It's not a slippery slope argument.  I'm merely stating that if he applied that logic to the world today, nothing would ever change.

I'm not sure how that would help in this situation.  Said company would still have to interact with blockchain to get this figured out.

Western ones are currently the ones with the currency.  It's so far a digital only currency.  How do you expect it to expand to markets where almost no one has a computer?  There's a rather large % of the world that doesn't.

The thing is, brute force is only one method of breaking encryption.  I feel as though most breaches occur due to to vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithm(s).

It sounds like your argument is that long-standing rules shouldn't be changed or that new rules shouldn't be applied.  I'm not making an argument for or against the censoring of memes and emotional posts, but consider if your logic was used in the running of a country.  The USA would still have a monarch across the seas that we paid dues to (I use this example because I'm American and familiar with it).  My point is, it's not a very progressive mindset.
