Dude, seriously.  He seems like an intelligent guy and has a ridiculous amount of money.  I'm surprised he doesn't lose weight.

I remember playing on dial up and my mom would pick up the phone and totally screw up my death match.

We will have a multi sig wallet to fund road building cooperative.

Me too, and my first thought was "What a bad name for an exchange"

Satoshi Nakamoto, obviously.

That would not be anarchy.  The ruling class would quickly hire their own private security to protect their assets.  Building a society without rulers, is not just a destructive process.  We must build the framework for us to interact and hopefully cooperate economically as equals.

To me this is the most obvious reason this story is false.  Her evidence pretty much came down to the guy's name being Satoshi Nakamoto, which would actually be very unlikely.  I would expect him to be named Bob or Sarah, or pretty much anything but Satoshi Nakamoto.

Just because you look down on a certain profession doesn't mean its not work.  Being a crack whore isn't easy and I would think they work a lot harder and take greater risks than the CEO of coinbase.  If we had a more egalitarian society a lot fewer people would choose to become prostitutes.     Artificially equalizing wages wouldn't work .  We need to rebuild the economy around worker ownership and self management.
