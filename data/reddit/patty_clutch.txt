Actually their worth about $11,000....... but it’s ok you can join in now there’s still going to be a lot growth. You can’t be upset you missed the previous gains. Or you could try an Alt coin, but do your research because they might not be as safe and Bitcoin. 
There’s a lot of good places to start learning on reddit but take everything with a grain of salt on here and make sure you do some additional research.
Good luck!
Edit: they are backed by the faith in each individual project and that people are actively using them. Bitcoin has come away from being a currency and it’s more of a store of value at this point to get to other coins. Many of which are going to be used by the same companies you would “by stock in”..... and that’s the value
