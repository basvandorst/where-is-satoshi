Why don’t you then just keep ur thoughts to yourself. You felt the need to comment why, did get off on being a douche?  I don’t give a shit if it was asked 5000 times, I’d still ask if that’s what I want to do.

I like the youtube mixes under dubset, rap dubset, trap etc.. but my favorite genre is Classic Rock but I cant trade to that.. go figure.

Ok so what does it matter to you are u the fucking reddit custodian who has to clean up all the repetitive posts? If I wasn’t invested into crypto man I’d hope Trump does such a good job that crypto crashes to fairy dust bc the fucking attitudes and self entitlement of these communities most of you deserve to lose everything

Bill Cosby now accepts Bitcoin to put into his  commissary.....
I wonder if that type of catalyst would be all that’s needed if it were true
@_date: 2018-10-29 02:11:10
I’d offer to buy that in bitcoin but it’s not worth much these days

Clear bear flag on 4hr chart but I have a very loose SL bc I’m thinking the technicals don’t mean a thing right now and well who knows what the price will do.....
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:48:21
Now now who here wishes they sold at $19k and are still waiting with their profits to not just buy back in but are able to buy way more bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:36:59
At least their going green.....I fucking hope

@_date: 2017-11-02 21:29:37
LMAO that is epic!

You have me confused, do you trust the government? I sure as shit don’t. I follow him not bc I like him but I just do. I also voted for Trump too. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:46:51
Yeah I’ve warned them too but I am the weirdo 
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:14:42
Or he’s just dead 
@_date: 2018-11-05 10:00:51
Funny you commented that, I just start watching crypto traders tv on twitch 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:06:32
Who cares about this when there’s Vertcoin
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:29:16
Not at all,  I guess I’m blessed in the space and I figured since I’ve been trading/investing into crypto for a while now I’m at a point where I have a stash to now use for its sole purpose which is to be spent
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:52:49
Umm are you ok? Do u not realize what vertcoin will be?
