Avoid this exchange for all cost! Its CEO is a known 'wire'

Naah. Don't think so. That would make his own business unsustainable
@_date: 2019-01-31 10:39:22
I dont' think it will be more than over 3%

It's very easy to stop people from using this kind of services - it's enough with penalization when dirty btc hits an exchange or shop...

Dude... I use XMR as a cleaner all the time. Trust me it never costs me more than 3%. You can convert to XMR on binance or bisq and then get back to BTC with XMR.to. It surely wont be as high as over 300$ for BTC

My man!

You can put offer on bisq for how much you want to buy it(then you decide about the margin), besides you can use exchanges like binance
@_date: 2019-01-31 10:18:13
Just convert to XMR

You deserved it. Selling BTC is like to give up a free world

As far as I understand coinjoin is different technology than decoys in XMR. It doesn't matter how many splits and joins there will be - they will always end up being used somewhere - contrary to XMR where decoys can be false if I remember correct.

I was predicting it a while ago. This is going to be much bigger than most folks here think. I obviously donate!

Why hate?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:53:03
Over 50% tax? WTF!?
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:53:53
Yeah, but ppl just now realized he has btc address at all...

Just do it inside your mind. I already see it 1000000th time and don't care. It's called habituation. Lack of it is actually considered a disorder.

That's sick! U guys must take example from the French
