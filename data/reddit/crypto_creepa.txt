A debit card doesn't have a limit. I think you're referring to a credit card.

Nice app.

That would be huge. Excuse me while I write myself a letter...
Dear Future Self,
How's the lambo?

Only those who invested all their money have the chance at losing all of it.
Those of us who are bright enough to simply invest what we can afford to lose will be fine.
But you, you'll still be broke.

If it's still doing this next year at this time, I'll worry.

"Life is beautiful during that high."
Powerful words. I wonder what you mean. I've done ecstasy before. Made everything feel great. Shrooms made me see shit that wasn't there. Meth made me talk for 8 straight hours. Never thought there was a 'life is beautiful' drug. 
Sounds dangerously addictive.

What's LSD like? Can you compare it to something? Never heard of Vyvanze. 
I smoke a little of the devil's lettuce every now and again.

You just sold your last .1 BTC for drugs??? Seriously? 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:37:59
What drug?
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:00:39
That's my point exactly. 
Bitcoin shouldn't be considered as an insurance policy. It should be considered a smart investment.
Insurance isn't in investment. Because as you stated, how would you make money? You don't make money with insurance, you protect money with it.
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:18:44
Neat numbers, but it's 100% not in any way, shape or form an "insurance plan".
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:31:31
You're completely disregarding the fact that Bitcoin is a volatile asset with no guarantees of returns. 
Would you buy car insurance if you didn't know 100% that it would pay in the event you got in an accident? 
Would you buy Life Insurance if you didn't know 100% for sure it was going to pay when you died?
See what I'm saying? It's not insurance because it's not guaranteed.
I'm down with the concepts. And it 100% is a solid investment in my opinion. But insurance, it is not.
@_date: 2018-06-18 02:27:16
Insurance isn't a return. Insurance is based on a safeguard against failure or disaster. And unless you go with a Cut Rate Insurance company or an insurance company that doesn't have any history on long-term function in the market then yes, insurance benefits, claims and payouts are guaranteed. 
The insurance industry is the most financially sound industry in the world. They have more money than Banks. Banks pay insurance companies to insure their money. Just think about that. So when it comes to guarantees, there's really nothing more sound then an insurance policy.

Take my upvote.

Oh good another psychopath shilling Bitcoin to the world.
This guy supporting crypto makes me second guess my decision to invest. 
Just do a little research on the type of literature this guy puts out. Real end of the world, dystopian countries waging war against one another type of stuff.
He's not something this community should rally around. If anything, his presence hurts crypto more than helps.

To answer the question in the title, I'd say it's the same percentage as the cash market.
The United States dollar has been used to buy more illegal drugs than any currency in the history of mankind.

Well we have NEO trading right now on exchanges.
Morpheus.Network pre-sale launching at the end of the month.
Now we have Matrix...
Wonder when Trinity's going to join the party.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:07:00
Which coin dip in particular?

I heard the boogie man lives under your bed.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:25:10
What's the point of sharing this? We all know crypto is here to stay. So what's the point of wasting everyone's time with articles like this?
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:04:34
The lack of line breaks and paragraphs in these crypto subs is appalling.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:45:02
Uh game started 10 minutes before you posted this.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:40:03
Exactly correct. 
This is the crypto community. Not the anti-crypto community.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:10:42
Oh my bad, I forgot this is the Bitcoin sub.
I'll probably get banned for telling you I bought Neo at $69 during the dip. :)
