The situation has dramatically worsened since this thread was started. 600-&gt;500eur and dropping is quite alarming, it seems like the miners going out of business are liquidating their assets due to a lack of faith in Bitcoin's long-term feasibility.
We need latest-gen mining hardware available to the end-user at no premium to make the situation manageable in the long-term. Having a couple of entities maintaining a monopoly on efficinet hardware is toxic.

He is not a friend if he does not listen to you. With the experience you have you should be able to logically explain your viewpoint and point out where the flaw in his reasoning is.
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:48:56
Notice i don't talk about opinions. Just about correcting the factual misinformation his friend has ingested. I fully agree it is no use to argue about preferences/opinions, but facts are facts and untruths should not be tolerated.
All that you presented are differences in opinions and only an idiot would argue which tastes better. A sane person would dig up studies and argue whic one is healtheir for you or something other based on facts.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:55:34

There are only a finite amount of exchanges. If you load your account with thousands of small addresses of tainted coins they may react. I you use just one with a satoshi of tainted they might not.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:39:05
An exchange knows that one user uses one identity. If said identity gets one tainted satoshi, they don't care. If said identity get millions, they start to care.
This is a very simple way to filter random taintment from a user trying to load his account with his loot.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:28:56
WTF are you talking about? Only thing you describe is to make a 75% immediate cut compared to what is actually needed and which would be implemented immediately after this rush when they need more money?
Who would think everyone would not withdraw 75% of their funds as soon as it is possible?
 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:51:23
The fact that he burned 10BTC gives him more credibility in this claim than most empty talk on the internet.
If nothing else, that burn increased the value of all existing coins, so i approve.

No-one has to agree with opinions. Everyone must agree with facts. Denying reality/truth is not sane.
I can tell you must be popular since you apparently consider anyone who tolerates your presence your friend.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:59:52
I literally don't care about his motives and possible gains in manipulating the market. I care about the hard fact that now there is 10 less BTC in circulation, my savings are worth more. So i am ready to waste 1minute of my time to 'enter a probably bogus lottery' because he has done something verifiably real that is beneficial to all hodlers.
Of course this all depends on the question is that bitcoin eater truly an eater, or does someone have access to those coins after all? Is it proven to be a burn address?

It is not a vault alpha that is launched on the date you mention, it is the continuation of test networks. These are separate from the client alpha network currently running on maidsafe's servers.
They did not release maidsafe alpha, it is client alpha. Another way to say this is that the network/vault aspect is still not alpha release ready, and won't be for at least 1,5 months. In fact it looks like it will never happen, it will be test networks and once that works they will do beta release. This will be the proper first public launch of maidsafe/safenet.
@_date: 2016-08-17 09:48:24
Safenet already runs on it's own protocol. The DNS trick is temporary until browser support via plugin is ready.

I don't know what you call a friend if not a person who listens to your argument, what you argue, and respects what you say. Possibly they challenge you with their own facts, or just with targeted questions. But they won't challenge you with opinions.
I don't know much about all the examples you mentioned, but if i consider you my friend i am more than willing to listen to any one of those subjects if you argue something important to you concerning them.
Reading this discussion i get the feeling we have a different definition of what a friend is, you menaing a friend to be what i consider an acquaintance or similar. Much less than a friend. Are you sure you have not succumbed to the facebook definition of a friend?

He is an engineer and inventor, not a manager. Due to his shortcomings in project management and planning they have probably wasted at least a couple of man-years worth of effort.
I have for years been skeptical about the project, but recently with the introduction of the data chains concept i see a possible bright future. Not only because it simplifies the implementation of the original concept, but also due to the additional features it makes possible.

Transaction time is 10 minute, as it always has been.

Seriously you don't understand? It costs the company to accept CC payments. Somewhere around 2% of the money transferred.
Who do you think pays it? The customer. How? The product is more expensive than it would otherwise be. A company that does not subsidize CC payments would advertise something like 1% discount for cash payments or extra cost for paying with CC.

You can fill up your lightning balance without making on-chain tx. You can purchase your Bitcoin from a friend, exchange etc. and have them send it to you using lightning.
In theory you only need to open a channel once, and can keep using it (whole lightning network) for years without doing another on-chain tx.

@_date: 2018-01-01 01:09:47
Normal in what sense? Beta should be released in about a month. At that time anyone can join as long as they understand it is still beta so don't put millions on the line.
If you are completely tech illiterate and look for mass-adoption, also by services/companies, then 6 months is more realistic and at that point it should be as bulletproof as Bitcoin is today.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:45:57
Depending on where you live the line can be fairly priced or ridiculously expensive. It is usually decided by the legislation, how much the company is allowed to fleece from customers since they are by definition a monopoly.
Selling can be a good idea if the line does not cost much. Otherwise battery + selling mined Bitcoin will make you much more, and make you much more self-sufficient.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:05:33
lightning is 100% decentralized, does not cost anything to join and start making money. Does not need any trust.

Hopefully they can raise the standard a bit in customer service. If they do they should be able to capture a good majority of the market since the standard currently seems to be atrocious.

Comments like this should really lead to a ban. Why do you come here if your only mission is to pump alts?

How incompetent can NIST be? Or maybe it is not incompetence, maybe they are part sponsor of the bcash push?
They got everything backwards. Bcash is the result of a hard fork and segwit is what Bitcoin collectively decided to go forward with. No-one is using Bitcoin without segwit.

None of those really matter for someone that has own software that interfaces with bitcoind. And that is all exchanges. I highly doubt any person sits and manages exchange funds via bitcoin-qt.

Those are other alternatives, yes. I just mentioned the most well-known method. Also raid 0 is without "waste" but less well-known than raid 5 so i did not say it, either.

As long as the inflation is as high as it currently is there should not be this high fees. But ultimately, this level of fees must exist to keep the tech safe.

You are properly brainwashed if you believe anyone of them has provided something new. Lightning network will be the first step forward since Bitcoin was released, the alts are just a playground for traders like you. Gambling.
I'm in this to make Bitcoin better. Not to try and game markets.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:54:21
Generally you first make the bank payment, then Bitcoin. Once you have 1 confirmation you can be reasonably sure it is final.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:24:56
Then they need to hire ten or hundred cutomer service persons instead of stuffing all the profit millions in the founder's pockets.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:30:58
Because more people have made losses in dabbling into altcoin than have made profits. This is literally how you make your profits, playing in a more volatile market allows for potentially larger gains with the downside of larger chance of making a loss.

Of course you do, because that ignorant shit is going to stay on your record forever.

No blockchain can handle it. Only 2nd&amp;3rd layer can.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:06:57
Because in most places the grid connection is owned by a monopoly, so the cost to have a line is insane even if energy per kwh would be competitive due to there actually existing a free market. Much cheaper to go off grid.

Well my strategy is to buy low and sell high. This is why i urge people to not listen to FUD and get in at the bottom, not the ATH.
Trolls and manipulators say the bottom makes you a bag holder while ATH investment gets you parts of the boom. I believe the opposite. I bought the dip and more than doubled the coins i sold a month ago.

@_date: 2018-01-10 13:28:04
DoS by itself does nothing. The cheat attempt must be combined for it to have effect. When you attempt at cheating by broadcasting old state, you lose all the money (the amount you tried to cheat to yourself) nothing changes this.
I have no clue what you mean by tx poisoning but i'm sure it is some highly theoretical attack like "controlling all bitcoin nodes the victim connects to"

@_date: 2018-01-10 15:13:59
Because then your channel is out of funds and normal people cannot use it if a spammer has emptied it - it is of no use.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:04:58
It is. That CC cost does not magically appear. Even if it is not advertised in the price it is there.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:10:59
It is. The targeted speed is a block per 10 min on average, with variability according to how the hashrate develops between adjustment points.
So the speed cannot be anything but as defined, unless a bug is found.

Same is possible on every coin. Only migration to lightning like solutions can fix it.

Where did you predict this?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:53:31
Anyone that cares about Bitcoin understands that it is not sustainable to store an unlimited amount of &lt;10 cent fee transactions on a blockchain. And unless that is done, then the fees can be spammed to 2 dollars easily.

You load your Bitcoin into lightning network when the fees are low, then transact there for as long as you want with constantly virtually nonexistent fees.
No crypto can scale on-chain, it is simply mathematically impossible.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:02:23
Not nearly as expensive as those relics. And works in the whole world.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:59:29
Nothing NEEDS to happen, it is usable today. Only thing that we are waiting for is for some developer team to feel brave enough to release end-user software and not lose their reputation if some critical bug happens.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:33:07
No, since such coins don't exist.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:27:10
Bitcoin was never fast in comparison to lightning. on average 10 minutes for confirmation does not compete with on average of 1 second. And lightning is secure instantly, on-chain you need 30-60 min for good security.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:08:12
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:19:56
Yes, if an attacker controls 99% of hashing power they can stop Bitcoin. Now come back to earth and try say something sane.
All anyone needs to be able to do is to download the blockchain's current state, and send a dispute tx. if they detect scam attempt, then they can prevent any such attack you talk about. If their home line somehow would be found out they can connect via their 3G using the phone, take their laptop to the local library, use the neighbor's wifi, visit a friend and use their internet etc. Or just outsource the watching to a service like what wallet providers will probably be offering, to automate it all away.
And even after all this you forget that almost no-one will even attempt scamming, since the attempt will make them lose it all.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:55:57
Yes, after the price has reached a plateau and held it for a month or two, then you can start thinking about buying in. Buying at ATH is almost by definition a risky bet that the price will keep on rising.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:28:45
Yes, the grudge will be solidified when the price goes to new ATH soon, and they realize that with a little bit of patience they would have made a profit instead of 40% loss.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:07:51
When you need 10 drive/year raid 5 arrays to host the chain you understand it is completely centralized and in control of a few entities.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:27:01
Sending transactions you don't need to worry about such. Receiving transactions you need to have some way to monitor for the absurdly-improbable fraud attempt (attempt makes them lose all money, so almost no-one will even try).
This monitoring will most probably be free in many wallet services, you can do it yourself, or setup an external monitoring contract/community monitoring etc.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:27:19
Since all you do is mainnet transaction promises that both parties need to agree on, you need to find an actual mainnet Bitcoin bug to exploit it.
edit: or find a way to send such a malformed transaction that makes the UI tell the user one thing, while actually signing another thing. EXTREMELY hard to achieve.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:48:36


This will be easy peasy, since the penalty transaction gets all the funds the fucker tried to steal, you can pay huge tx. cost and still make a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:40:56
Segwit adoption is stalling because people are waiting on the reference implementation to release official full support. It was delayed due to the threats of sw2x hostile takeover, and protecting against it needed all development effort for some time.

@_date: 2018-01-10 10:45:44
I know all this. But the video moved from talking about 1000 blocks to talking about date. This indicates they specifically means date and not approximate date due to average block speed.

There is no impatience nor rudeness. What i see is overly cautious developers, to such degree that none want to take the "responsibility" for releasing software that has a bug.
Somehow Bitcoin Beta has come to mean more mature software than most AAA titles at release day.

Because people don't mind the current fee level.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:35:03
the reward is to be in control of your transactions. It just has to be kept affordable enough to keep Bitcoin decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:02:54
So what is your argument for us being in Alpha rather than Beta? Since additional features can come with lightning 2.0
If a functional product exists that has seen testing to a degree that no easily reproducible bugs exist, it should be called beta.
Show me one serious bug report for lightning that has steps to reproduce, and i STFU.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:52:32
You would need to prevent the other party from reaching the internet during that time. And prevent any possible watcher service from reaching the internet. Kinda impossible.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:07:44
Yes, indeed. Having unencrypted funds on a hot wallet is risky. I would NOT expect the exploit come through a sanely designed lightning software.
Unless special protection mechanisms are invented, this cannot be mitigated. So not an argument against starting lightning mainnet testing.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:04:52

In such a situation only miners would run nodes since it would be prohibitevily expensive for anyone that does not get compnsated. And then it would gravitate towards the largest miners, since only they can subsidize the HDD cost in addition to the electricity.

That post was not void of arguments. All following sentences demonstrated why it is impossible to lose everything like you said. Due to your blatant brainwashing attempt such language was warranted, since you only presented FUD without even trying to argue why what you say would be true.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:37:59

No, i have a solid strategy of "do what's best for Bitcoin, and Bitcoin will reward you"
Some others look at the stars aka. technical analysis, some look into game theory etc.
But the most certain way to lose your money is to be in it for the profit, and then make sound decisions like sell the dip and buy the high "to get part of the gains", and curiously this is what you recommended, sell the dip to not become a "bagholder"
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:00:27

KYC should come with extremely hard privacy regulations, like 10k dollars fine per leaked personal document. Since such level of security is not trivially done it cannot be trivially required. If you trade millions OK, you can demand KYC. If you trade mere hundreds of grands you absolutely should not need KYC.

@_date: 2018-01-18 08:31:27
Yes, because if those features are wanted they can easily be added to Bitcoin in a/the future hardfork, ethereum an bitcoin are so close design-wise.
The only crypto that is not an altcoin is safecoin, and it is currently still a research project, much further away from release than mainnet lightning etc.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:51:19
Please link me where he is concerned about this? I would believe his (and my) concern is the need to have unencrypted constant access available on the node, so _any_ remote expoit makes you lose all funds on the node.
Seeing how software and operating systems are built it is exceedingly improbable the exploit would come through lightning software, and instead be through remote access to your OS.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:29:18
Same is true if you had traded inside Bitcoin with same frequency as between coins.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:05:05
Of course it will. If they switched over the fee pressure would drop dramatically and also legacy transactions would cost under a dollar.

It has already ended. It ended when bcash forked and sw2x was canned. People took their sides, and what you see left is market manipulation attempts. The roadmap should be known to everyone, so complaining or FUD:ing are quite literally an admission of ignorance or an attempt at manipulation.

@_date: 2018-01-18 23:12:07
Many do. At least Litecoin devs are helping in the development. But shitcoins like bcash decided not to implement segwit, so they are incompatible, and first need to fix tx malleability before they can even begin to develop lightning-like systems.

You need to define "bad ending" otherwise you cannot be proven right or wrong. Even if Bitcoin dropped 50% tomorrow and stayed there the next decade, it would not be a bad ending.
Only thing i can take away from his comment is that he believes that Bitcoin will crash so hard that miners stop mining, no more blocks are found and Bitcoin dies.
I am almost 100% certain that won't happen.
And even then it would only be the end of original Bitcoin, Bitcoin 2.0 would be resurrected from the ashes with fixed difficulty adjustment, and continue on.

One addition: you can top-up your lightning channel without hitting the blockchain at all! This way you use FIAT with some service provider (or friend/acquaintance etc.) and the cost will be less since at no moment does an on-chain tx. need to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:51:34
What a fucking retard, this is easily achievable by using 2-of-3 multisig and having the third party being a reputable arbitrator.
Send money using your signature, the receiver sees the attempted send, contacts arbitrator and verifies it is according to what you agreed, then arbitrator contacts you, you verify, and arbitrator signs tx. making it final.

As i said, current moderate fee level is desirable, only way to pay miners to make the network secure. Everyone that does not manage to sustain such fees is subsidizing retards to jump on the ship and start charging them later. No-one is going to mine on a substantial loss.

LOL, the retard has no grasp on reality.
Lift the block size limit, and a miner can suddenly mine a terabyte sized block and force everyone to store it. Holy shit they should try lifting the limit and see what results. Only the largest miners can handle it. What happens when every tenth block is such? It does not take much to have 10% of BCH hashing power.
With insane proposals like that it almost seems like the proposer is a mole.

99% of the debate around this issue misses the point. This current situation is only temporary. As surely as the inflation of Bitcoin will go down the mining will ultimately be done with free energy.
What is this free energy? Mining that uses the heat to offset another cost. Usually electric heating. You still only pay your heating bill, but now you also have 60TH of hashing power being produced.
The only reason this is not true yet is that the risk of investing into Bitcoin mining is seen so great that there are so few miners that it is still profitable to just "waste" energy.

All modern computers contain an embedded operating system that runs behind the main CPU. On intel this is called the management engine (ME).
ME could be configured in such a way that it stores the Bitcoin private keys/seeds that have been in RAM. Then no amount of changing or formatting harddrives nor live USB tinfoil operatingsystems help anything, and they can leak out immediately when internet connectivity is restored.

They can try with their games all they want. In the end Bitcoin is a different kind of animal than they have tried to game previously. So now they are using large amounts of speculative money to push price down. They have gone rekt doing so, liquidated time and time again, but they keep doing it in the hopes that hodler hope is lost and they capitulate. But not everyone will, and soon the halvening happens and the manipulation becomes too costly to continue.
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:49:30
You missed the most important point: Ultimately most of the mining will be done using free energy. AKA the heat is utilized making the mining a side-effect and free.
The only reason this does not happen yet is that mining is seen as a too risky investment for those that have demand for electric heating.

Bitcoin has been reliable for 10 years. Only like a couple months have it been possible to lose a bit of money (unreliable). During that same time you have lost about 35% of the fiat you held to inflation. I see 35% loss extremely unreliable in such a relatively short amount of time.

Yes, they will sell at the top of the bull run (hoping to cause panic and down trend) of this rate cut and go long just before the next rate cut. Everyone expected this rate cut, it is priced in. But only they know that another one is needed and when it will come.
@_date: 2019-07-01 11:04:57
As i said, it is a feature. One aspect being able to anticipate the demand and forerun it.
For instance: when everyone wants to open a lightning channel it can be expensive. If you open 10k of them during 1sat fees you can suddenly 100-1000x ROI by selling them when fees are &gt;100sat
The foremost consideration here is decentralization and how to be functional when going forward. ETH has demonstrated that linear onchain scaling cannot work and therefore exponential scaling like lightning is essential.
@_date: 2019-07-16 05:58:49
As long as 1sat tx. goes through there is not enough demand for current design.

Once you successfully send the Bitcoin to the device it should be impossible to get hacked. It needs physical access.

You certainly did not do your research if you did not from the get-go calculate to what level blockchain can scale.
Only solution is to use blockchain as long-term storage and aggregation/settlement (like bank-to-bank functions currently) and 2nd and 3rd layers as payment network.

Anyone can set up their own node to take advantage of such a situation. These tx. cannot be spammed for free, a mempool cannot be filled. Either you consume a channel and pay for it, or you don't and leave that route open for other users.
Once you consume one channel and give tx fees to owner, he can send more funds to it and be online again.

Yes, Bitcoin grew faster than anyone anticipated, and lightning got delayed due to miners first stalling segwit, then threatening hostile takeover. Such is life in crypto, and all it managed was to delay lightning introduction to Q1 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:51:59
Don't spread BS. AFAIK 2MB block is best-case scenario with segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:31:37
Yes, you can do an international Bitcoin tx. for 1/4:th the price of a national us bank wire. Sending a bank wire from US to india will cost you ~50 dollars, or 5 when using Bitcoin, currently.
On top of that the Bitcoin tx. cost is constantly going down, soon to normalize at &lt;1 dollar.

Yes, an all-time high if you forget 95% of the time Bitcoin has existed. How is propaganda like this upvoted? Hello r/btc?
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:29:57
You do that once and have access to the whole network. The channel can stay open forever, topped up with funds when Bitcoin blockchain tx. cost is low. Checkings account vs. savings account.
How significant is that cost if you pay say 5 euros and do 1000 transactions with it before closing?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:08:06
Depends entirely on their service.
If they had segwit, batched transactions, and actually hired enough customer service people to cover the amount of users they see, then they would easily be the best in town and i would use them.

@_date: 2017-12-01 09:54:15
Bitcoin exists today, and any change that is not accepted by the nodes of today is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:22:08
Define large.
If you talk hundreds of millions then yes, even a 10 dollar tx. fee is ridiculously insignificant. Large as in millions or hundreds of thousands, then Lightning can certainly accommodate that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:23:11
What's funny is that eventually the difficulty would adjust and every hash would find a new block.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:13:45

Stop asking retarded questions and present some argument.
Bitcoin has a scripting language. Ethereum has a more advanced language. It is Bitcoin-like.

Staff and Board Enrichment 	$          90,593
When you add the others that can be seen as benefits, you arrive at ~9 million. Just imagine what 9 million could do if everyone donated to an EFF alternative where people work on an voluntary or modest sallary basis?

So said many shills at 8000, and now they have lost out on 100% gains.
You need to study S curve adoption and understand we are going to 100k before major correction.

It can handle an unlimited amount of tx/s.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:10:34
Nope, it is very temporary hiccup due to unexpected popularity, will be fixed with lightning network and as segwit adoption grows.

Weird version number jump. Why not just call it 1.0 ?

Never was. &lt;2 seconds is another universe than "on average 10 min"
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:31:26
But once segwit is enabled it can call itself 1.0, even if we have 1.1 1.2 etc. after that. Segwit is what enables these other soft forks and feature additions.
At some point 2.0 is needed but before we get there will take some time.
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:07:38

Bcash thinks disruptive changes can be made with next to no testing, Bitcoin supporters realize widespread adoption without months and months of hardening  is irresponsible.
You should always make a transaction RBF, that way if the transaction costs go up after you try to send using minimal fee, you can increase the fee later.

While the article is a rare breath of sane journalism, even it missed the point completely.
Bitcoin could do all it's mining for free. If just 1% of the buildings that are heated using electricity installed a Bitcoin miner then the network could remain secure while consuming zero energy.
This could already be happening, if there was asics readily available. It would simply not be profitable to run mines where the heat cannot be used to offset another cost.

Someone said coinbase does not batch transactions... Is this true? Because it would have even more effect on tx. size they create.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:03:06
No, the transaction is either seqwit wrapped in a p2sh tx. or a native bech32 segwit tx.
Native wallet support is something different, and i have not seen it expressed like that before.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:24:55
8mb blocks are no silver bullet. We would need gigabyte sized blocks for even moderate adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:29:04

The 08 market crash left many "sensible investors" down 30-50% and the risk takers much more. Such moves have not happened in crypto very often, and always due to the immaturity of the market. They are getting more mature by the day and another Gox cannot happen any more.
So you could argue that Bitcoin is the safest investment alternative after bonds.

@_date: 2017-12-27 16:31:11
It is a payment network. You send a bitcoin tx. to it, and then can use the amount to transact with everyone else on the network. Then you send the final balance back to your bitcoin blockchain address when you want.
Since everyone can reach everyone else with no more than 5-6 hops, you can essentially transact with anyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem by opening one channel with one person that is already connected.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:06:54

Try to understand that as much of the transactions move to lightning and go segwit, the fees on the blockchain will go down to &lt;1 euro. Then you can go back to the good old days of on-chain cheap tx. or use next-level tech like lightning, as you wish.

Nothing wrong with custodians as long as they are from the same country as the user, and have insurance. This way you are not hurt when they fuck up. Othrerwise it is better to just store it yourself, and if your amount is starting to approach 1BTC then secure it using a hardware wallet.

I don't believe anyone is hyping it too much. We pretty much know what it can do in the beginning, and the features we gain as the development continues and the network matures are almost not even mentioned anywhere.
It is a broad consensus that we should first deploy known sof-fork scaling solutions AND THEN, if needed, do a block size increase (hard fork) bundled with all the other desired upgrades that require a hard fork. Hard forking should be the very last measure due to how disruptive it is.

Customers of big services are not annoyed enough at the fees that they would request halving of them using segwit. Simple as that. Most criticism is here in this echo chamber where 50% are altcoin shills magnifying the whine.

This should be clear by now, you can literally find hundreds of reddit users cautioning for a coming crash since 7000-8000. Those "experts" lost out more than 100% gains by "being clever".

Stop the concern trolling. Bitcoin made it's decision, now we see how it will play out. There is no way to rush a block size increase before LN is operational.
But i bet you know this, and are just spreading FUD. We already have lightning transaction alpha testing on Bitcoin mainnet, and you talk 1-4 years... WTF?!
Simply take your money out, invest in the competing coins if you believe the market will make Bitcoin obsolete while the last touches are put in place on LN, and stop the concern trolling when there simply is no choice to be had any longer.
Bitcoin decided to scale by: segwit capacity doubling. 2nd and 3rd layer, schnorr sig antispam. And then, when we see the impact of these, then we start planning block size increasing methods.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:06:30
The price went down because several million's worth of Bitcoin was donated to different organizations via pineapplefund and others, and these are not in the business of promoting Bitcoin, so they cashed out. This put a large amounts of Bitcoin on the market.

They can go to terabyte sized blocks and the user experience is still ancient compared to instant tx. with lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:08:33
As long as there exists nodes that follow the current ruleset and miners that generate new blocks for it then Bitcoin cannot hard fork. A hard fork is by definition something else, like Bitcoin 2.0 or something.
The ethereum hard fork is a good case-study of such. They got only one thing wrong, the names are backward. The non-forked version is ethereum and the fork something else.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:57:27

The thing is that the spec. is already final. What normally constitutes the main part of the work is already done. When you have a design/spec ready-made and only need to implement it, the job is quite straight-forward. And that is what we see today with the alpha-software. It just works.

You are essentially advocating for the death of Bitcoin. Everyone that could run a node when the project started needs at least a year of forward notice to exit it due to a decision to ridiculously increase the node requirement. Anything else is just reckless.
When you are BCH you can go out and get wasted as you want. When you are BTC people actually expect something from you, and you must behave. This among other things means 6+ months of notice before hard forking etc.

Conclusion: layer 2&amp;3 scaling is the only answer, making a disruptive hard fork just to upgrade block size would be an amateurish hack job.

STFU, satoshi was the first one to describe lightning network as a way to scale.
Sure, block size increase is a very real option, after we have other soft fork scaling solutions in place and know how much and what kind of capacity increase is needed.

What you mark on the claim is only a vote. They count the votes and act accordingly. The amount of money+bitcoin you had there will be converted to yen, to determine the weight your vote has.
It is highly doubtful anything else would happen than getting the money back by bank and the bitcoin as fraction of bitcoin.

This is what i have been told. I have verified that it at least works with the most common implementations of payment channels (it is right in the wiki) but i have not verified that it works in the specific implementation that LN uses.

No, it won't. Only during peak congestion before segwit is implemented are such costs observed.

I don't think there should be any limits on the instruments. BAKKT bitcoin is not bitcoin. Let the lamers and big money play how they want, sooner or later their scheme will collapse unless it is legit, and at least at that point investors learn the difference of holding Bitcoin to holding IOU.

Anyone really can spam the blockchain and not pay. Just make thousands of tx. that are ~50% from the currently confirming fee, then if mempool goes down and there is risk they start become fulfilled, make one high fee tx. that use them as input, making them unminable.
Such an attack makes people think "i guess i must pay this high fee since thousands upon thousands of tx. won't confirm in a timely manner" when in reality there might only be 500 tx. that are intended to be mined. If the manipulator mines and happens to find a block he can cancel the spam for free.
In lightning land anyone can set up a node, and spamming the nodes always costs. So there will be a route for your tx. to go through since anyone can benefit from it just by offering one if the others are spammed and currently unable to route.

You live with the common misconception that banks are still under some % reserve requirement. This has been false for at least a decade.
Nowadays you go to a bank, the bank gives you a loan by issuing you credit. This is created money, typed into your account. Once you repay the credit the created money is eliminated.
At no point do they lend out their own money.
This is the definition of usury.

They wait for Bitcoin to develop Lightnin network and then pick it up. Everyone knows that their larger blocksize would have exactly the same problem Bitcoin is facing if they were popular, and real scaling comes from 2nd and 3rd layer.

Chain reorganizations are a known feature of Bitcoin. Depending on the responsiveness of the large miners such a reorganization could be almost unnoticeable (1 block rollback).

Banks create money, as you said. They should not be allowed to (as per the topic of this conversation).
In a fair world banks would lend out their own money, not create new money to be lent out.
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:54:30
It would not have broken anything. Probably all large miners spread out their mining on several implementations, so if one is bugged it is A) immediately noticed B) gets only a fraction of hashing power behind it so gets reorganized out very soon. You still remember to wait 6 conf for large transactions, right?
@_date: 2018-09-27 11:00:18
Bitcoin works exactly as intended. A bug in a few versions of one implementation is almost not noteworthy.

Andreas has made a couple excellent talks about this, how we would need gigabyte-sized blocks in the short run and 100 gig blocks later to scale on-chain.

@_date: 2018-05-29 09:14:01
altcoins are opportunistic moneygrabs. None of them has demonstrated anything that Bitcoin could not acquire in it's first hard fork.
They are cool experimentation and prototyping, but that is akin to a testnet, not worth money.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:11:31
I think it is the other way because there are so many gullible fools sitting on altcoin losses (as opposed to knowing traders). They want back to Bitcoin and wait for breaking even. As Bitcoin starts it's run alts will start to follow. But one after another these break-even points are reached and end result is that the alt is lagging on the way up, and more volatile on the way down. This eliminates the utility of them for trading since they need to be more volatile on the upside too.
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:38:28

If you look at the graph altcoins follow bitcoin very closely with close correlation and much larger volatility. They are a method to create a speculative market on bitcoin's price.
This is a fact since speculation on the project's actual value seems to be nonexistent due to how closely correlated they are to Bitcoin.

If you had any actual experience in the military you would realize that the 556 can just penetrate you without causing big enough impact to stop you. The 762 with a much larger diameter WILL stop the threat due to significantly harder impact, even when it penetrates.
The caliber has little to do with rate of fire. It is a feature of the implementation.
Please stop referring to cod since it only demonstrates what you have experience in.

You have, the government does not. The government should responsibly try and maintain a common value pool for the well being of the nation. This is traditionally done by a gold reserve. Making the money pool into an additional taxation mechanism is the exact opposite of this, and should be seen as treason.

Are you fucking retarded? Don't miss-quote me. I clearly said that once someone has fired both the small round and either of the serious rounds, they will know.
556 &amp; 792/762 is this easier for you to comprehend, "soldier"?
Secondly, the reason they moved over is purely economical and convenience. As long as you are not in combat the smaller round is certainly better. Cheaper, easier to carry. Once you are trying to kill an enemy, you would give anything to have serious stopping power.

LOL. Did you even read the article? All it says is that if his assumption is right, then there exists a maximum amount of time people are willing to sit in congestion.
In Bitcoin we are trying to design it so that the capacity is so big no-one has to sit in congestion (build so many roads that even if the roadbuilding draws more people on the roads, there would not exist so many people as to fill them up to congestion level).
After the first blocksize increase "spamming" the network full would create a revenue to the miners of at least 0.014 bitcoins per second from transaction costs, so attacking the network that way would not be financially viable.

So slowly and surely all that is worth owning is owned by the insiders who got the money cheap.

Wrong. Lightning transactions did happen, and you don't need to touch the blockchain unless someone tries to scam (a gamble which leads to losing it all if the counterpart responds in time).
There is no need to keep money in normal Bitcoin except cold storage. All in-use funds can be on lightning since you can use lightning to make on-chain transaction if needed.
Network capacity is simply the amount of Bitcoin in the channels that can be used to transfer payments. If more liquidity is needed people will certainly provide it because it provides interest through tx fees with no risk.

As long as Bitcoin mining is done through wasting energy the mining reward has not reached equilibrium and gives unnecessary "bonus". It should be done using excess electricity, thus being free. So either you produce more energy than you can profitably sell and mine using that for free, or use the produced heat to offset some other cost like heating your house again making it free.
Since wasting the heat is still profitable in many situations we are still very much in the boom phase of mining.

Fact is that credit card payments are very expensive and final only after many months and people get constantly scammed out of money. Lightning payments are virtually free and immediately usable and secure. Even with contactless payment.
edit: on top of it all Bitcoin and lightning can offer 3rd pary arbitration (escrow) if wanted, so the "consumer protection" aspect can be excactly as good as with credit card, bank, paypal etc payments. Except you can choose the judge and not settle hoping for some unknown department at a payment giant making the right decision.

Sure, some new feature could be added in a fork. But you are not forking lightning, you are updating Bitcoin. One such feature already is known (relative timelock) that would make lightning channels last an infinite time hugely reducing need to settle on chain or lock coins for ridiculous durations.

I feel what he means is the (core) consensus. Once Bitcoin use grows to 100x current level, then even with segwit, schnorr, lightning etc. the blocksize must be increased. When we reach 8mb blocks that constantly get filled, it is out of reach for normal users to run a node.

Blocksize is increased or block time is reduced.

The attack surface is only a fraction in hardware wallets so it is infinitely more probable that the computer you use is controlled by an adversary than it is that the firmware in your hw wallet manages to steal keys from you.
The problem with a linux usb is that once you boot up the computer you are vulnerable if connected to the net. So it works as a safe offline signing device, but not as a safe computer to make payments with. Only offline signing offers reasonable guarantee of security, to such a level that a rogue government agent is unable to steal your funds.

Once the minimum fee has been at 2-3 dollars for a few months THEN it is time for a block size increase to say 2MB. But we are VERY far from it, and there are several scaling technologies "almost ready" to extend the 1MB size to contain more transactions and make spamming more expensive.
So there absolutely is no hurry just because Bitcoin has endured one spam attack that raised the fees temporarily.
What should be TOP priority is to find a way to make it impossible for large miners to spam for free with a high probability. If this is not done then the miners can continue spamming 2MB blocks, and start demanding 8MB etc. It won't stop as long as a cartel can spam for free 80% of the time. If a pool of 80% hashing power spams 5MB blocks the cost is the same as a non-miner spamming 1MB blocks.

A few sw2x supporters are making much noise, and it will continue and increase in volume as the fork day approaches. You can see this clearly as it is most often fairly freshly created accounts (shills and bots) that push for it and defend the fork.

See what i wrote? If a small number of high hashrate owners decide to try and capture control, then Bitcoin can upgrade to gpu mining as easily as to the NYA. Essentially users fire the asic miners and take back control. The only way it won't be a war is if hashrate is removed responsibly (blocks are found slowly until difficulty readjusts) and the markets decide the valuation of original Bitcoin vs NYAcoin.

There needs to be some measure to disincentivize miners from opportunistically attacking Bitcoin. My solution would be to implement every other block as GPU mining if the block time becomes so slow so Bitcoin cannot be used practically. This would mean that if the mining cartels attack Bitcoin then the profit when they come back after the fork has failed is 50% of the original.
This POW change would as an additional bonus make it much harder to attack Bitcoin.

The vision was that scaling comes as needed. It is not currently needed. Come again once price is 10k per BTC, then the capacity increase of segwit might start to show it's limits.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:49:35
No. I'm saying that abruptly removing large amounts of hashing power while knowing the limitation of the current Bitcoin rules is an attack. I'm completely OK with jihad &amp; co migrating their hashing power at a rate that allows for one block per hour or similar.
A POW change would require an attacker to invest in both GPU and ASIC instead of only ASIC. And investing in GPU is much more expensive in comparison because every gamer on the planet already has a GPU that can compete against you for free. It would bring back Bitcoin to a partial people's crypto. Ultimately ASICs should be phased out completely but that is not realistic in the short run.

The price of the coin divided by the ratio of total hashing power decides what chain is more profitable to mine. Last stat i heard is that bch has 1% of the hashing power, so as long as the coin is worth one hundreth of BTC then it is more profitable to mine there. Once the difficulty adjusts.

ASICs are not an eventuality, it is possible to quite easily run ahead of the curve. For instance changing some tunable aspect of the algo every n blocks by random, changing whole algo randomly inside a pool of algos. Etc.
When an asic is intorduced that can handle this, it is virtually indistinguishable from a GPU and offers no advantage. And at that point every person in the world is as privileged to the hardware as every other, since the GPU martket is so big that it is impossible to strategically favour customers.

Humor me this: if north korea suddenly opens a national asic factory and makes enough hardware to control 80% of hashrate and puts out an agreement that says that every block reward is split 50% with the government, would you be cheering for it since now a 80% majority of miners have agreed?

There is only one way to spam the network: by making unnecessary transactions while controlling a majority of the hashing power. This allows to drive up the tx cost for free as long as you end up finding the block. This is a technological failure of the design of Bitcoin and no solution has been found.
Not counting this one very specific situation, transactions are not spam.

You are really bad at trolling. Similarly as the Bitcoin we use today is not the same Bitcoin that was launched back in the day, it will also evolve going forward. In a way that makes all other altcoins stay as irrelevant as they are today. What matters is where the value is, and it will stay in Bitcoin as it evolves according to need.
Lightning will most probably be completely free, since the incentive to offer transactions inside it for free comes from the added value it gives Bitcoin, and therefore more value to the companies operating on it.

While i fully expect most people to support Bitcoin, an attack can make it nearly impossible to use it for 100 days.

Technology should drive Bitcoin forward, not fee/market desires/adoption prospects.
segwit is already a real blocksize increase, we need to wait and see how it affects things before starting to plan the next step. I would go as far as argue to wait until schnorr is implemented before even mentioning block size increase, since it is also a soft fork, and it makes spam more expensive so after it we have a more honest view of the capacity requirement.

You pay normal blockchain transaction cost when you send the coin to lightning. Then you pay fee according to what channels you send it to. Some may charge a fee, some allow it for free. These channels are services provided by private entities (you can provide one easily, utilizing lightning between you and a friend), no mining. So transactions confirm instantly, and can support as many transactions per second as their server can handle. Think VISA scale.

If those miners are honest and don't attack then there is no problem and the markets will decide.

So they probably use all methods available to force users to switch over.

You said miners should make the decision if segwit is activated or not.
If the people using Bitcoin would not have wanted segwit, rest assured they would not have used the software that is trying to activate it since one year. Segwit is a soft fork so it would not even fork if they simply ran the older version or a competing implementation that simply does not contain segwit. UASF would have no effect if a clear majority would not be running it so no-one can force anything except supermajorities.
There were a few people who did not want segwit, they went to bcash since they were such a small minority they could not keep it from activating. Bcash's popularity shows you how many they were in the end. If i did not want segwit i would be using it. Same way as i will not be using SW2X since i do not want it.

I only assume the current flag rate for sw2x will switch over. We don't know how many Bitcoins the largest miners have promised as compensation to next largest ones for their mining power. Such sponsoring very cheaply makes it more profitable to mine on that chain. In fact it is safe to assume such sponsoring is already in place waging the propaganda war. Since there is no downside for the others to participate. They get the coins, and even if attack fails they can just resume mining on Bitcoin. If it succeeds, they continue mining on sw2x coin.

The 1.0 version of the lightning spec is being prepared as we speak, will probably be ready before segwit is active.
Several lightning implementations already exist. I bet at least one will be ready for CLI use immediately when segwit activates. Perhaps even a GUI version.
So no, lightning will be ready for use pretty much immediately. Then it is only up to people start using it if the tx fees on blockchain seem too large.

Since the value of the forked coin is so small it costs much to withdraw hashing power from Bitcoin. And this is before disincentive measures are announced, which i hope will be before the fork date.

If a house uses electric heating currently, it can instead use miner heating. Homeowner pays normal rate for electricity = you (miner) has free mining.

not important at all since the software routes automatically. It is completely hidden from normal use cases and is only needed as a basic detail once you not merely try to use it but try to understand the theory behind it.

So if myanmar manufactured enough miners to control 90% of hashpower, and decided to hardfork to a coin that implements their glorious leader's outlook of the future, giving 10% of every block reward to the state no matter who mines it, you would call that Bitcoin? Get help.

My solution would be to constantly have a market position open for when the price drops. Start with 10% drop, if it does not happen keep reducing the discount until you get. Then bump it up again, and start reducing again when you think the urgency increases. This way you take advantage of pullbacks to lock in a discount over direct investment, while also ensuring you won't be waiting for forever. Basically letting the markets decide the frequency while still averaging in by doing many small transactions.

If 90% of miners stop mining the original chain then the coin is essentially paused for 100 days. There is no downside to attempt capture (except lost revenue while attempting) so an attacker only needs to sponsor the lost mining fees + a little bonus to make it profitable to join the attack.

Bullshit. Enslavement by debt was the reason to stop using gold. A population that owns gold cannot be enslaved, but one that loans their currency is enslaved by design.
The history of gold vs. fiat was always the people vs. the ruling class.

This is not possible with honest banking using honest money.

Bitcoin mining has become centralized, so the big mining cartels have a lot of power as long as upgrades are done by miner voting. This experience has made sure that future upgrades are not done in that way, as it was never intended that miners should have any decision making power (except what coin they mine). The voting that was used was meant to indicate readiness to upgrade, not decide if to upgrade or not.
The reason why the mining cartels from china were against segwit is that it fixes a mining exploit (asicboost) that they used to gain 20% advantage in mining.

I really think the "bitcoin uses so much energy" debate is a trojan horse.
Once any clever person hears it  they realize all energy that goes to mining can be used to things like heating buildings, water, etc. they realize the mining consumes no energy if the free market is allowed to work. Which makes it a simply ingenious technology.
An attacker would need to buy or produce the energy to power their attack, and the hardware. While the honest miners mine for free with only initial hardware cost. It is simply not possible to win in such an asymmetric war.

The "the 1 euro burger is back" campaign for some reason also brought the cheeseburger price down to one euro. They reversed from 1.10 for burger 1.20 cheeseburger.
I almost never eat fast food, but sometimes if i happen to drive past a mcd and see the drive-in is not full i will take the 2 minutes and 1 euro to catch a cheeseburger on the go. It really is unbeatable value at 1 euro.

You must be very retarded to go on television while understanding nothing of what you talk about. Bitcoin does not need any extra energy consumption, all mining can be done in places where electric heating is used anyway.

Dude don't focus on the irrelevant. Over here a mcd hamburger has been 1 euro for over a decade. At one point they raised it to 1.10 euro and quickly reverted because it hurt their sales so much. They had to buy an advertising campaign saying "the 1 euro burger is back"

Lightning network is the first crypto technology that has the theoretical possibility to scale. On-chain scaling is impossible unless we want to limit running a node to datacenters and supercomputers. This would kill crypto.
Ethereum demonstrated what happens when you try to scale on chain. It is almost impossible to run a full node from home, the price per tx. is same as BTC has and it chokes on usage peaks just like BTC. Even they are building their own lightning network called plasma for the exact same rason as BTC did it, because it is the only scaling that we know of how to do yet.

If you are at that level, you should sell when everyone is legit freaking out. And buy when everyone has moons in their eyes and seem euphoric. So you would be buying now, when "i'm not selling" panic posts start appearing. Not when some clown tells you that "we reached bottom" or "moon soon"

Because you soon have terabytes of transactions to keep track of, and it becomes unmanageable.

I don't get how you can be so blind. Schiff would have been right as the crash would have happened already unless we went into never before seen territory and changed the rules of the game. If you change the rules as you go on to suit yourself then nothing can cause a crash. Ultimately you are in a situation like socialist paradise Japan where the central bank owns 50% of the top 150 publicly traded companies due to them creating money to prop up the stock prices.
Take from the many and give to the few.
The only question is how heavy handed will the measures be to delay the crash? Will the FED soon start the new QE program and bail out the stock market for a fifth time? Or will they employ negative interest rates? Or confiscate all gold from the people? Or come up with something new that has not yet been tried?

Because traders don't make decisions based on feelings, they follow a strategy. "Normal" people make decisions on feelings and lose some value to the traders.
This is why hodling is the way to go. It is very hard to have the balls to drop money into an asset that is freefalling, and that is a requirement to succeed at trading.
Exactly the same is true in stock markets. When something is rising in value normal people start buying it, when in reality they should be unloading it. When a stock has gone down for some time normal people sell it to not take more losses, when in fact they should be buying it.

When in Bitcoin lightning it is free to send to friend and unimaginably cheap to others on the network. You are comparing the same, you cannot send to any bank for reasonable or free fee, it must be a bank in same network.
And since it costs nothing to join the lightning network there is no reason not to.

This is absolutely amazing, and what people have been kinda envisioning from the beginning.
When people say "with Bitcoin you don't have customer protection like paypal" it is only a question of there not being a straightforward way to have 2-of-3 option when paying.
The fact hodl employs this strategy in allowing the bets of a betting service to run completely p2p as long as a dispute does not happen, is revolutionary. Even when dispute happens it could be considered p2p since they never have custody or access, only the right to express their opinion to the blockchain judge.

I believe they are it's neurotransmitters. There exists a theory which goes something like: neurotransmitters are poisonous to basic biological processes which serves to ensure that sending such signals is very costly and thus if such signal is received we can be reasonably sure it comes from a legit source and not some foreign mimicker like bacteria.
transaction fees serve to ensure the right messages get through.

No large Bitcoin company is going to use a gui to send and receive tx:s.
There exists several wallets with GUI that support segwit.
Implementing segwit does not rely on the reference implementation, whose devs have been busy protecting Bitcoin from attacks.

The best thing you can do is altruistically sell when it is rising and buy when it is tanking. This stabilizes the price. This is the strategy i have been using since the beginning because greed will ultimately wipe your position.

Same thing happened with Bitcoin scaling debate. Uninformed people only saw "possibly smaller transaction fees" not realizing the downside, and that fees are high due to manipulation and exceptional circumstances.

All other cryptos (blockchain based) have the same problem. As soon as any reasonable amount of people start using them there must be a fee market or the blockchain balloons to unsustainable levels.
Lightning as seen on litecoin and Bitcoin fixes this, but the fees are currently so low that there is not really a demand so no-one is risking and pushing a little-tested product to mass market.

Bitcoin works wonders for day to day tx. 20cent tx cost (40c when congested) is cheap for the protection Bitcoin offers. Bcash has much less hashing power making it secure.

If you want, you can take LN today and deploy it as a payment alternative.
Simply fork the repo, change code from testnet to mainnet, and let your customers use it with a "beta test" disclaimer. Basic payment channels have been ready for a long time, what is still slightly WIP is cross-implementation compatibility and routing.

Exactly that, being international. There already are numerous such small playgrounds of "immediate internal transactions". Use those when suited, use Bitcoin when it is more suitable.

The attack only needs to send the price to that of the cheapest Bitcoin fee to prove their method to scale has failed.
The only reason it has not happened yet is that the large miners are the ones who promote bch, and they are also the ones that can spam for free with a large probability.

@_date: 2019-02-14 09:32:45
The biggest problem with LN that i have heard is that malicious actors can stall the normal operation too easily. This is no problem if you only connect to trusted nodes, but using autopilot can quickly become costly if half of the nodes you connect to advertises capacity but fails to relay transactions. If only trusted nodes are worth connecting to it will cause centralization.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:55:22
Nodes are simply users that agree to make an off-chain contract that can be settled on-chain in the case of a dispute. Worst-case scenario with a hostile node is that you need to wait for the timelock period before you can reclaim your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:44:30
Then you have a very good deal. Rest assured most of the world don't enjoy such privilege.
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:02:30
By that time schnorr will be implemented which decreases the size of batched transactions significantly. Say 100 people want to open a lightning channel then only one aggregate signature is needed in the opening tx.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:58:41
That's what every person does in the US who sends a bank tx.
If Bitcoin at it's worst is equal to the world's most powerful banking system at normal operation i would call it insanely successful.

Does he not have a plan to prune old data to allow for infinite scaling?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:58:42
Of course i want, because i know that when Bitcoin gets it's first hard fork all known attack vectors will be addressed. Even before that the adoption of segwit, lightning and schnorr will make it an order of magnitude harder than currently.
And what did this attack achieve? Significant costs with next to no effect, only minor annoyances.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:06:14
Exactly. That's why we now have electronic money, Bitcoin. So we can dump the FIAT cash.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:29:00
The rocket has been designed and fuelled until now. 10k was liftoff and we are currently in the most dangerous phase of the journey because whales may start to become anxious of cashing out. Launch of lightning network will be max Q and from there on out it is only a matter of time before we arrive at the moon (100k).
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:57:28


Miners can spam transactions to rise the price floor and it does not cost anything if they end up finding the block. With current miner centralization this is a real problem since the largest miner is one of the main separatists.

@_date: 2017-11-13 10:37:14
If there was no plan to support cheap transactions and infinite scaling then you would be right to be concerned. But as things stand the plan is clear, the implementation is nearly done, the standardization is done, only last-minute corner case bug fixing is left before lightning is in everyday use.
Without SW2X being handled like a coordinated attack we would already have segwit in reference implementation. And maybe lightning would have been released. But fear not, in a week or two we should have segwit, and lightning before year's end.

It was never meant to run on sub 1 dollar tx fees. That is just for the inflationary period. As the inflation ramps down the fees should ramp up to pay for the miners.
Notice how bch has ridiculous inflation, that is how they maintain low fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:57:27
With low fees and low price per coin you need many more blocks per 10 minute to pay the miners for their electricity. Now as  the ridiculous inflation stopped and the pump got cashed out, their chain is almost standing still with no miners left.
The new difficulty change algorithm is direly needed for them, since it can keep the coin on life support forever.

Taking right now as an example is like saying banks are incapable of sending money when they happen to be down for maintenance. Bitcoin is in an unprecedented bull rush which bloats the mempool, current high fee level is "maintenance" fee level due to every trader moving money around simultaneously.
Just a few days ago i sent a tx. with less than 20c fee, took few hours to confirm. And it was a retail mainstream purchase.

Bitcoin cash makes it just worse for miners. Since blocks are so big the users don't need to pay to be included, and the miners get no profit while incurring the rapidly increasing cost of dealing with the ridiculouws amount of transactions. Additionally there is no way to stop artificial spamming, since spamming don't cost anything when there are minimal tx fees.
US banks charge 20 dollars for a domestic transaction. If Bitcoin charges 5 for international tx. is it really expensive?

If you cannot make money in these moves you never will. Someone is investing large sums in pumping and dumping and you should be able to capitalize in their wake.

That has nothing to do with things. All that suffices and is needed is that one good merchant accepts bitcoin, who transfers the cost savings to you.
Then you get the cheapest price while product stays the same. And soon no other competitor stays in business unless they adapt and offer same price through same payment method.

Basic engineering. No currently existing project can scale on-chain simply due to the space requirements. On-chain scales linearly, off-chain exponentially.
So yes, technically there is litecoin etc. with lightning support, and eth is also working on 2nd layer stuff. But ONLY lightning network is relevant and used widely.

People sold Bitcoin to pump BCH, then dumped BCH and bought back their Bitcoins. They made a profit on BCH so they bought back more BTC -&gt; price rises.
The BCH pumping has been extremely serious the last few days, and has leaked to reddit at large, subs like conspiracy, joe rogan and a couple days ago even cst (of the few subs i subscribe to). Cst FUD was especially effective since the rules forbid people from disagreeing with the OP, so everyone trying to state the facts was deleted.
I tried to warn people they are going to lose money if they fall for it, and as of writing this they have lost 500-1000 euros per BTC that followed the pumper's recommendation, depending on how quickly after the topic was created they bought in.

Additionally, in a few days segwit will become mainstream as next bitcoin core is released and companies start migrating to SW en masse.

There is no such thing as a stable annual yield. Last time people around me were extatic about banks offering 8% interest was 6 months before the financial crisis and those that took the "offer" lost 30%

You made the claims based on nothing, i merely answered.
If 2 billion people make 1 transaction per day you would need to add a new SSD drive every week just to support the blockchain growth if scaling on-chain. Lightning does not need any changes to the current protocol to allow for it.
No-one has lost any coins on lightning unless they personally fucked up. This is comparable to you forgetting your bitcoin wallet password and blaming bitcoin for your loss. And anyhow, the case you refer to was recovered, so even after severe user error lightning still kept their coins safe.

Yes i can set up a shitcoin and boast i have free transactions... until people actually start using it. But that is no problem because when the costs of running it start to matter i am already a billionaire.
Bitcoin takes the inverse approach. They provide a quality service that is unparallelled and it costs what the real cost is for the amount of security it provides (mining). All others are quite frankly jokes compared to Bitcoin. I repsect them for what they are, experiments, proofs of concept how to upgrade bitocin in the future etc.
But i loathe the insincere marketers that sell these coins to people that don't know better and fall for the marketing speak. They are testnets. They should be free.

Absolutely! The difference to FIAT banking is that anyone has same capability to receive the created coins. Not only the inner circle of bankers.

@_date: 2018-11-09 14:38:58
Any kind of manipulation is fair game in Bitcoin. What it comes down to essentially is do you trust the exchanges that set the market value? The value of a bitcoin and the value on the exchanges can be two wildly different things even if many think of them as being one and the same.
Who knows, maybe all exchanges are selling imaginary bitcoins and buying bitcoins using imaginary money to force the market in such a way to outsmart the other traders?
P2P rate is a much better indication of the value since there the price quoted is for actual bitcoin, not custodial bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:47:40
Other way around. Credit card companies say that retailers are not allowed to charge extra for cc or give discount to cash. But this anticompetitive behaviour is now being fixed with some states already banning them from making such requirements.

LN provides that, credit cards etc. don't. For them it takes months.
blockchain 0-conf is equal to CC transaction except it finalizes faster.

of course it is. You can take a custodial wallet, get the bitcoin in your wallet app after paying with your debit card or cash and spend by clicking a button and pointing the phone at QR
debit&amp;credit cards are in fact much more complicated to use online, and even at the register because you need to enter a code. With bitcoin you don't have to, it is optional.

Successful trading means buying low and selling high. The more you risk when selling high the more your possible upside is to restock low since the price drops, people panic, it's a feedback loop.
As long as there exists useful idiots in the market that capitulate and sell at the bottom, as long you can make great gains. But you also need to buy back in to continue being in the game. If the market consisted of only sane participants would mean you make a loss since you sell high and all coins are swept up and the price shoots to new highs before you can buy them back.

Yes. You get 2% cash back because the seller pays 3% in CC fees. Soon it is illegal to force sellers to subsidize CC fees on all customers no matter what payment method they use, so then you can also in US get 3% discount when paying with Bitcoin. Fees during a desperate spam attack are as unusual as service outage of CC, bad example to use. Currently fee is 1cent and with lightning it is even less.
You can pay arbitrator a small fee, like .1% and they have a lucrative business that pays to stay honest and in perfect reputation. Unlike paypal and CC companies that are notorious for their unfair decisions.

It very well might allow the whale trader(s) to grab one or two coins more at the bottom by manipulating noobs. It might not influence the price much at all, but it can have significant effect on the trader's profit in that round of manipulation.

Yes, and now we have created a new base of resentful idiots that sold at the bottom. Along with very profitable traders that bought at the bottom and are ready to dump even more at the next top.
The only way to end this destructive spiral is to educate every last one that dabbles in Bitcoin. But it might be impossible since a similar distribution is true in all markets. How many large traders got caught by the 08 market crashe? It was mostly ignorant traders, 401k holders etc. that transferred their wealth to those that make the market.
JUST FUCKING HOLD IF YOU DECIDE TO GET IN. And think long and hard before getting in.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:55:39
Yes, the stock market crashed in 08. Now Bitcoin retracted. Both go up again to new records.
Try to understand the difference of crash and retraction. If you don't have time to exit then it is crash. The current Bitcoin price is a slow retraction, not a crash. Much fairer market and gave the opportunity to every investor to exit at the top. So it was the perfect store/gain of value.

No, it's just that retard merchants subsidize the cost on everyone, honest merchants only include it in the price paid by those that use said payment method.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:30:02
The largest problem with Bitcoin is the lack of capacity of understanding for most normal people vs. the traders.
Someone buys one Bitcoin, and it tanks 20% they sell it to some whale who will make the profit on their loss. One Bitcoin is not much for almost any western person with a job. If 10 million people realized this, there would not be many Bitcoin in circulation. The price would actually go to the moon. All that was needed was to not milk every last penny out immediately, but to make a risk investment that does not pay out before you actually need it.
Instead we see traders successfully manipulating the markets, When price rises from 4000-&gt;5000 they dump, making the price go to 3500 due to weak hands, then they rebuy and have even more BTC to use to manipulate in the next round. Rinse&amp;repeat until all weak hands are burned, or the early adopters get wiser and not panic sell making the manipulators lose money, and they stop the dump&amp;pump.

Yes, the end game is that mining won't cost a thing to the miner. Either they offset the cost by utilizing the heat (like i do, electric heating for the house), or they have deals to mine on excess power. It is not uncommon that power producers pay customers to use electricity at low-demand times since they need to get rid of since they cannot ramp down the production process quickly.

Fees are currently very low. And they stay that way as long as the protocol vulnerability is not exploited. If it was made impossible for miners to inflate fees for free according to their hashrate % we would not see any congestion.

Yes? That is absolute worst case if an attack has been prepared for a very long time by some of the largest miners, and if it had it would be obvious from the previous blocks.
The plausible version of the attack only requires 12gb ram for you to be immune. And this version would cost millions in tx fees to set up.
edit: and please keep in mind RAM is extended by swap space. Finding 150gb free HDD space to define as swap partition and /swapon should be an option for almost any server.

Too bad your whole FUD argument relies on something that is simple to demonstrate as false bullshit.


It is vital for a currency to have enough valuation that trades worth millions can be done without significant slippage in price. A 0.1 dollar Bitcoin would allow for only 2 million to be transmitted even if all coins were used to do the tx. A 1 million dollar bitcoin would only need 2 coins, causing unmeasurably small slippage.
Exactly this is what i'm sick off, people investing the effort to write 50 line FUD hoping that the reader swallows the bait because it was presented in a more lengthy manner than what low-effort manipulators normally do.

Some laugh when people talk about 100k per bitcoin in the future, but it comes extremely quickly if the adoption rate continues as it has been going for the last months. I actually think the rate will only increase once the network effect really gets going and the mainstream learn about this new technology.

Only reason for that is the 500 year head-start. Bitcoin will get there and beyond. Once the markets mature the value will stabilize. This has been the trend for the whole of Bitcoin's history.
The fact they use violence to force people in their country to support their currency does not mean anything if international relations are not factored in.
At least 2 national fiat currencies have died during Bitcoin's regime. As time goes on that number will approach 100%

After these experiences (first firmware update i had to go through) i would not hesitate to recommend trezor over ledger, it cannot be as nerve-wrecking as this process.
Ledger has either a serious design flaw in the hardware, or they released an update without any QA. And their servers are STILL overloaded causing additional errors. Incredible since the server problems started months ago, and they are not fixed yet.

You cannot just simplistically 1:1 compare two similar but completely different concepts, you must compare equivalence.
And yes, i can know exactly how many Bitcoins there are mined. Main difference comes from lost Bitcoins vs. lost certificates, as the second does not tend to happen. But it is not impossible. Lost Bitcoins are almost identical in that aspect to lost cash, however.

Lending money is not why banks are immoral and will die. It is that they create money out of thin air, and lend it to you for profit. One of the most insane arrangements ever made.
With Bitcoin a bank resumes being a respectable business because in this paradigm the banks lend you what they own. Let me repeat: Only FIAT banking is immoral, Bitcoin, gold etc. banking is a normal honest business.
Stop mixing in irrelevant concepts like capitalism.

No amount of increase would bring a solution to the issue trying to be fixed: prices. Ethereum with it's huge throughput still suffered same fee inflation as Bitcoin when popularity spikes happen.
See, the tx. cost is the only antispam measure we have. So the cost will always rise to a "fair cost" because "too cheap" just means you end up with gigabytes, terabyte, petabytes of spam.
Ethereum is abandoning their blockchain since it is so large it is extremely hard to operate. They are moving over to a ledger model in ethereum 3.0 where only the state is saved (kinda like Bitcoin would only store UTXO set, and not block history), making the size requirement constant. If this ever meterializes, and if it actually works, it might be the first real competitor to lightning network.

Hard to believe you work in finance with such an immature view. You lose the same money you have in fiat when Bitcoin surges. Or better to say you lost the opportunity to hold it in Bitcoin and experience growth. Exactly like when you have it in Bitcoin and buy goods using Bitcoin: now you have converted it to goods and lose out on the opportunity to experience growth in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is special since it is both an investment and a currency. There is way more friction when you have your investment in stocks or bonds or you name it, before you can liquidate it and use the currency you gained to buy something.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:10:50
Real inflation is at least double that. Official value since 70:s is 6.6x yet the price of things has gone up 10-15x depending on what type of product is in question.
The price should have gone down significantly due to technological advances, productivity increases, and larger customer base. So the real real inflation is probably closer to 3x the official numbers.

The most puzzling part is how you did support sw2x in the first place, when it was an agreement made by very few people and corporations behind closed doors? This is the only argument anyone should ever need to consider NYA dead on arrival. If a small behind-closed-doors meeting really could decide the direction of Bitcoin then Bitcoin has most certainly failed.
The only way a change in direction should happen is by a clean fork, with miners responsibly withdrawing hashing power, and letting the free market decide where the money flows. A hostile coup attempt like sw2x is despicable. If your vision has merit then you don't need to use dirty tricks and force to realize it.

Cash refers specifically to a form of fiat money that is in the control of the consumer.
In a Bitcoin system this would be the casascius coins etc. And even the lightning network.
Cashless society in fiat terms is bad because EVERYTHING is under the control of the banks then making insane things like negative interest possible. A Bitcoin society has the control with no-one and no-one would be printing money. The government would fund it's actions via taxes, no hidden inflation taxation which punishes individuals and benefits megacorporations.

It had to do with freedom, which also meant no economic slavery under central banking. As long as banks control the money supply the age of prosperity will not return.
For a glimpse of who will become poor just look at the value of these two competing paradigms over the last decade.

You are either misinformed or arguing about nuances like definition of money vs. currency vs. circulating paper currency etc.
Most certainly the banks create money you loan in your bank account from thin air, and if you cannot pay back more than they gave you they will confiscate your things. Because you could not give back more than that which was created. Insane design, like musical game of chairs but with your money!

How can logic be so hard?
First you collect taxes. Then you spend the collected taxes. You should not manipulate currency because then you only end up with corruption, business cycles, booms and busts. And the ones that suffer the most are the common folk that don't understand inflation. Everyone understands taxation. And that is exactly the reason we use inflation not taxation, the people would revolt if they understood how they are being milked dry. The criminal banking class certainly knows how to try and save most of their purchasing power. But less than 1% of the general public does.

The fall down in prices is expected since the cryptos are currently inflationary, if nothing new enters the market then the price will keep falling.
New in this context means something like lightning network that enables a completely new mode of operation. Once people realize what lightning network means, we will have another similar speculative run that brought us to 20k last time. But this time we start 10x higher so look out for 100k bitcoin this year. And this time the altcoins won't take part in the run.

Or maybe it is 2? We don't know. All we know is that not one exists for any modern gpu resistant algorithm. Nor for two (non)resistant algorithms.
So making the PoW a moving target with the intent of always changing it before an asic enters production, it would most certainly work and guarantee decentralization. Often an algorithm change is not even necessary, simply parameter change for the same algo.
If the threat of changing is credible enough, no-one will even try. Only way to succeed would be to privately manufacture them and not have the info leak out.

I think both BCC and 2X are minorities with loud mouths, and they will find out the hard way what a silent majority means. I believe and hope the NY "agreement" is merely a method to get SW finally activated. The only problem BTC can end up having is not finding blocks if enough hashing power dumps it at once (which is an attack). But i believe the devs will have a sufficient deterrent in place to make miners think twice. My suggestion is to make every other block mined by GPU which would cut ASIC barons income in half if they try to fork and then regret and want to come back, making it safer to just stay with BTC or gradually shift their mining power,  allowing BTC to continue functioning without a POW fork.
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:12:21

First argument of luke-jr i disagree with.
If every round uses a different algo (say a pool of 2-5) then it is impossible to make an asic for it, but GPU can adapt easily. We have many battle-tested algos in production already, so it is mainly a question of adopting what has proven good. Very little risk.

It's because there is so small gains to be made over GPU that it ends up more expensive. If it was efficient and profitable, there are enough such coins to mine that people would have done it. A FPGA implementation would not even risk the cost of fabrication since the hardware has value outside of mining.

This is what CPU:s and GPU:s do. They implement a specific set of algorithms that sum to turing completeness.
Now take these 5 mining algos that are designed in such a way that solving them requires in total such operations that the hardware implementing them becomes turing complete. Now you have a requirement for a GPU.
We have not even seen one PoC asic for one asic resistant algo. And yet you are advocating how economically viable it is to make asics that can tackle n asic resistant algos. Incredible.

There was mainly one chinese cartel blocking it. I think others agreed to NYA since it achieves the goal of activating SW.
Since most probably there will be enough asic power left so blocks will be found, the threat of POW change would mainly be a deterrent to not attack bitcoin by removing their hashing power too quickly.
If most asic miners leave bitcoin for 2x (say chinese gov't sponsors a minimum value for their chain's coins) which stalls block finding then there really is no significant asic miners left that get pissed. And at that point the sane solution is to re-brand as the people's coin and transition towards GPU mining.

Yes, that is used to go around the fact that one algorithm can be implemented effectively in ASIC.

If you do nothing while you are under attack you die. The only thing that can kill Bitcoin is killing it, centralization.

Perhaps a third manufacturer can actually enter the market with the help of such pow change since as a smaller firm they would be more agile, and could sustain themselves by focusing on selling to Bitcoin miners, perhaps directly without the retail step raising the price. Perhaps designing the hardware mainly with gpgpu efficiency in mind and not opengl framerate.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:21:12
You have half an argument when only comparing electricity cost. If it makes the hardware 100 times more expensive it is still prohibitive.
Additionally, you completely leave out the fact that an algo change could happen at any point in the future. So that 100 times larger hardware investment cost would be in even larger danger of being obsoleted. As i said somewhere in the beginning of this debate, if pow change happens once it is more probable to happen again. And again. All it takes is a policy of always changing it so it is one step ahead of asics.
ps. i never meant to say i have decades of experience. What i listed as arguments were the experience of the existing gpu industry vs. a newcomer asic manufacturer.

If there is no  specific algo then there is no application specific implementation possible. By choosing the algos to be as different as possible, you by definition need a general purpose parallel processor. A GPU.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:29:04
Yes, i have facts like economies of scale, decades of engineering experience, largest chip fabs on my side. You have "muh asic will handle everything and be better at it than the established GPU manufacturers"
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:41:34
I agree with everything except


We need POW change so that every other round is ASIC and every other is GPU mining. This makes Bitcoin more secure, and prevents ASIC centralization's abuse without obsoleting all the investments people have made in those hardware.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:29:50
And then you have n asics in one, and the cost to produce it is larger than a GPU of similar performance.
Many algos are very asic resistant, to such a degree that no-one has even attempted to produce one. Even if someone managed to make one, the efficiency compared to GPU would not be nearly as good as in bitcoin.
And since a change has already happened at that point, no-one would probably even try to produce one since another change can happen much easier with the precedent set. All it takes is a policy declaration of the dev team to keep the algo ahead of any possible asics that emerge.

You are essentially arguing that GPU:s are good at nothing and they should be replaced by asics in PC:s.
Please understand that if one algo needs one kind of asic. And there are 5 algos. Then you need 5 asics. Or one GPU. Since the problem space has gone from a specific algo to general computing. Asics are not general computing specific integrated circuits. We call those GPU:s.

Not if the algorithm(s) is such that a GPU ends up being the most cost&amp;power-efficient implementation.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:21:53
Only because the algorithm is so simple.
Hypothetically, if Bitcoin moved to use every other round scrypt every other round sha, do you still think it would be cheaper to implement it in silicon, or maybe GPU would be the better choice since the algorithms are so different you would essentially be packaging two asics in one box.
Now expand this idea to n algorithms that each are much more asic resistant than sha or scrypt. It makes asics impossible.

Every investment you make makes Bitcoin better through increased market cap and higher price for others. Of course this carries a risk, but i have been from the beginning with the attitude of maximizing the utility of Bitcoin, not trying to extract maximum profit from it. As things have played out HODL has also been the best investment strategy with a miniscule amount of daytraders beating the returns.
So just hodl, or if you want to trade don't go for greed. Sell when it is pumping and buy when it is dumping, always believing things will continue as they have. This is a losing strategy only if Bitcoin dies.

It will simply be impossible as long as there is a difference in standard of living/cost of doing business between the countries. And the cost of electricity.
So in short: It is not the world that needs to change around Bitcoin, it is Bitcoin that needs to gradually migrate towards GPU mining to make the playing field level. GPU market is so big it is impossible to ration the hardware that ends up for mining without hurting your non-mining customer base. Then the only restriction is electricity price, which can be overcome when electricity heating of homes is replaced by miners, making it free.

The fact no-one seems to realize is that how is it possible for some companies to be so much more effective than others? If NSA wanted to have an all-inclusive access to the harddrives manufactured, how much would it cost to sponsor cooperating hardware makers to lower the costs until the competitors are driven out of the market, leaving only the compromised manufacturers around? I bet we are talking billions not even a trillion. So this is an entirely plausible scenario and very cheap to have some sort of backdoor access to all data of the world.
I find this scenario very plausible if you take a look at how the amount of manufacturers has fallen sharply in the last decade or two. And this is not limited to only harddrives. The amount of news/media source consolidation is perhaps the most worrying metric.

Segwit allows for nearly unlimited scaling on a second layer if people choose to transact on it rather than paying higher fees on the blockchain. But we don't know how lightning will work out since there is no experience in using it.
All we know (from litecoin) is that as long as fees are small, people prefer the blockchain.
If we find a technical way to make very cheap spamming for the largest miners impossible, i think the effective blocksize increase of segwit should be enough for at least a year. Depending on the growth it might be enough forever.

Also no other coin has solved the scalability issue. Lightning is the only technology currently in existence that can scale to the whole world using it.

I am talking about somebody setting up a special address in conjunction to a vote on some webpage or similar. Sending to this address would return them to sender. And anyone could see how many bitcoins got bounced via it. (only additional logic i can see needed is to restrict voting voins to those that have not been moved during the voting period).
This would allow to arrange POS votes without risk to voters.

Bitcoin will scale when it is needed. 6 months of sustained no 1sat transactions included on blockchain is grounds for blocksize increase. Before that schnorr soft fork and all other soft forks must be deployed before planning a hard fork. As they are deployed, the effective capacity in the "1mb" block stretches further and further, eg. as with segwit.
ETH has shown what a disaster a coin becomes when the floodgates are opened and the chain is allowed to grow at ridiculous rate. And even that nor any other crypto would scale to serve a million simultaneous users. So it is clear only second layer solutions can truly scale. And guess what? Bitcoin has the only such network, and it is working great.

Bitmain's strategy is that of a sponsored actor. They have a contract with someone who has insured bitmain's mining profit in exchange for them doing all they can to prevent Bitcoin from upgrading. If UASF gains traction bitmain attacks it, and if the attack fails they have lost some amount of mining profit. They can abandon the attack chain and come back mining BTC so the insurance amount is very small compared to the damage threat.
The only way to mount a credible response is to have a hard-fork ready if UASF fails. A hard-fork that changes the POW. This way the cost of attacking would be to potentially lose all money put into miners. The hardfork should also include invalidation of all coins mined by bitmain that have not moved yet.
What golden age would Bitcoin enter into if it was once again the users who got the mining profit? The users who had the control of future development direction.

Because from day one everyone has known the ultimate number and everything has worked according to that. In the banking system only insiders know how much will be created tomorrow, and only insiders decide who gets that money. If Bitcoin had started with continuous inflation via mining no-one would have started using it because such a system is guaranteed to bleed money. As designed, it only bleeds money in the beginning while being bootstrapped.

Bitcoin's problems stem from one simple fact: the failure to keep it decentralized.
As soon as GPU hardware was dethroned as the most efficient alternative for mining, a POW change should have happened. Since it did not happen, we are now stuck with huge hardware investments that prevent Bitcoin from upgrading, the resistance grows stronger with every new miner bought.

When ever something is made illegal, the value is often catapulting upwards.
If you own a barrel of whisky when it was legal, you were glad. When prohibition came into effect, you were suddenly a wealthy person. A criminal perhaps in some psychopathic governemnt eyes, but morally you are just someone owning something with much more value than before.
Exactly the same thing will happen with Bitcoin if it is cracked down upon. Probaby it will just be heavily regualted so that millions/billions is not laundered so easily which will not influnce real usage much.
If it is outlawed, then prepare for a sharp increase in value. It just proves it is so effective it needs nation wide crackdown.

Absolutely true. Bitcoin should never (in the foreseable future) scale via blocksize increase. Instead if a capacity increase is needed and has large consensus, then it should be introduced via reducing block times. It would actually fix problems and make Bitcoin more user-friendly.

Numerous altcoins have proven that even ridiculously fast block times won't cause a problem with that. So certainly cutting Bitcoin block times by 25 or even 50% would be a tried and true approach.
Actually i would believe a larger block size would increase orphan rate more since it takes longer for the block to transfer, and so nodes risk working longer on invalid blocks.

No, you just have to install a version that has been verifiably compiled from the publicly available source. Verified compiling is becoming the standard in projects like this, eg. the official Bitcoin client implements it.

50 BTC = 6000 USD
-&gt;6000USD / 13 GH
7950 = 250 USD
-&gt;5000USD / 10 GH
So they are essentially at the same price as the 7 series cards at retail prices. If i were to buy 20 cards i would surely score quite a bit better price in bulk.

I see something similar to paypal being around the corner in the Bitcoin land. Load coins into your "bitpal" account, then use it like you use paypal, with some buyer protction/escrow features and so on. They would take a fee, half of paypal perhaps, and it would be a killer deal for both the customer and the company since paypal &amp; credit card companies have INSANE margins.

It's only a matter of time the money printing that has sustained the stock market must be reigned in to thwart inflation. Before this happens smart money will exit the market into saner assets. It might be what we are experiencing just now.
When the zero percent loans come due the assets will be sold to pay them back, and new ones cannot be taken if the interest is even close to normal.
So my prediction is that the stock market exiters pay back their loan and invest their profit into gold, bitcoin and realestate.

You can use any company that sells Bitcoins. The main one in Finland is bittiraha.fi, and it is super simple to use their service.
You give them your details (only your Bitcoin address is important, no id proof or anything required.), then you get their bank information back. What you send to them via EU bank transfer will be used to buy Bitcoins at the current rate and sent to the address you specified.
In Finland we have some of the strictest business regulation so you can be confident in doing business with them.

Because this prevents anyone from spamming the network. If you send&amp;receive between 2 addresses and try to DDOS, then you pay a fee. If you send from an address which is a year old, we can assume you are not DDOSing since there is a very finite amount of addresses that are old.

Just remember that the nature of markets is like this: If you have enough money to spend, and manage to cause a price drop by liquidating a huge amount, then every panic sell caused by that will go directly in your pocket as you buy the coins back at lower prices.
The recent bubble and bust was a clear sign of buying a huge amount&amp;dumping them all very fast. If you sold out then you did exactly what they wanted. This is how big money washes out small invesators and gathers their investment as profit.

The value is irrelevant, the idea is what was important. If you should have 10 minute time but actually have 20, you should halve difficulty. Perhaps the target is 10-20 with variance, so if it got to 40min then difficulty would be halved.
No problem with syncing the clocks, since already the difficulty is calculated to match a 10 minute block time. This would just be a trigger to cut the diff. down if no-one can find a block in a timely manner.

You can do this already. Make sure to pay from an address that has only so much money as is needed to pay. If the tx takes too long, you can make another transaction with higher tx fee from same address. If it goes through your older TX will effectively be a doublespend attempt and it is ignored.

No. Bitpay puts USD immediately in your bank account.

There is no single entity that even to this day sells ASICs off the shelf. I don't count preordering something i get sometime in the future as an alternative to something i can have hashing immediately.
Sure, the first ones who invested in asicminer IPO have made mad ROI, but for us mere mortal ones GFX cards are still the only sane option.
I for one enjoy my 3 PC:s full of 7 series cards that have already made ROI, some of them over 2 times. All this after the consensus here was that GFX mining is obsolete.
You always have to follow the money. I have nothing to gain by telling you GFX mining is not obsolete. Anybody who tells you it is obsolete most probably is mining himself, and therefore has everything to lose if more people join the mining business.

This is kind of a letdown.

The current offering of avalon asic is the same price/mh as buying 7 series gfx cards. The benefit comes from one order of magnitude smaller power consumption. My power is however free, so that does not concern me a single bit.
FPGA:s are to my understanding even more expensive than ASICs.

Thank you for the link. I thought keiser was speaking metaphorically since it sound so absurd. I guess US politics never stops to amaze me with their level of absurdity.

Virgin galactic does not fly to the moon.


So it is essentially a really fast  high flying airplane, not a proper space vehicle capable of traveling in space.

FreeBSD is also perfectly fine. As long as it is open source, it is not such a black box i was refering to.
It does not help what macos was built on top of, the fact is that jobbs may very well have integrated a backdoor in there that he can use to steal you Bitcoins, and you will never know. Such is the nature of proprietary malware.

Why do you think they will always exist? When the dollar crashes maybe we finally decide that something that can be printed does simply not work.
Or we can try and get it right. This time will be different.

It will not be volatile once Bitcoin has reached mainstream adoption. Currently the volatility is mainly a factor of the small overall size of the Bitcoin economy.

The bitcoin exchange price is related to how secure bitcoin is. The higher one bitcoin is valued, the more people can profitably mine, thus securing the network.
To my understanding tx fees are very small per block as of today, so we NEED a high price to guarantee safety!

Just remember that the nature of markets is like this: If you have money to spend, and manage to cause a price drop by liquidating a huge amount, then every panic sell caused by that will go directly in your pocket as you buy the coins back at lower prices.
The recent bubble and bust was a clear sign of buying a huge amount&amp;dumping them all very fast. If you sold out then you did exactly what they wanted. This is how big money washes out small invesators and gathers their investment as profit.

I don't expect it to go there. But i can see it happen.
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:19:28
I'm sure there will be Bitcoin banks that provide exactly that option in the not so distant future.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:07:57
Buy as soon as the volatile feeling goes away, no matter if it crashes or just continues on.
I hope it would crash today by about 20$ so that i could buy in with better odds :)

This is almost absurd to watch. It sounds like the narrator was talking to a kindergarten class.

The same way most people can go on living their lives not caring about the countless atrocities happening in our society on a daily basis. They simply do not care, and blame others when their not caring comes back to bite them.

I would not. Wait a day or two so that this 40:s hype is through and we see how the price trend continues. Now feels very volatile.

Because it is not worthless. If he has a spare computer he should be running it. If Bitcoin goes to tens of thousands, even the miniscule btc reward it gives will be worth a lot.
