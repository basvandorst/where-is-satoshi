Exchanges are meant for buying and selling. You don't store Bitcoin there. You store in hard wallets like Ledger and Trezor.

You guys should use bittrex.com stop using Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:12:25

Anything Roger touches goes to ashes. He is corrupt and rotten. BCH is scam. Avoid it

BTC is not good for spending now. You are paying quadruple the value of the item.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:12:06

Well said - last generation was the internet and it made Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs etc. Bitcoin and Blockchain will create its billionaires but in more distributed manner than the internet revolution 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:44:07
Yes it is. Just another alt coin
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:41:09
Great news. This hard fork ain't good for the Bitcoin brand
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:16:32
When I advised so is that Bitcoin can appreciate to $200,000 it can also depreciate to $0.  At least in the case of later, u will gain your house.

Don't disclose all BTC to your wife. Disclose about 30 BTC only to her and convert it to fiat to pay up to 80% of the mortgage (you need a house).  Then keep 270 BTC to yourself. Don't disclose all bcos of love , women change, my dawg.

BCH and any other coin can go down to $0

I believe that SEC BTC ETF approval will give bitcoin viz a viz cryptocurrency legitimacy and foster their main stream adoption. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:38:36
You investing in bitcoin with the $50 is a step in the right direction. Over time u will be extremely proud u did. Familiarize yourself first with online wallet like Coinbase before moving to offline paper wallet. Whatever you do, don't forget your password or loose ur private keys (in the case of a paper wallet)
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:55:58
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:55:17
I believe it is time that Bitcoin ETF is approved.
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:15:03
