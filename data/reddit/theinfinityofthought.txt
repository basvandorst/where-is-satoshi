Modern supercars, including lambos, have the ability to raise the body of the car so speed bumps don’t create damage. Not wrong on the maintenance or insurance. The personal property tax would be insane too.

I bought at $6930 today. I’m quite happy with that.

I bought some this morning right before it shot up. You’re welcome, everyone.

I am one of that 90% but only because it was a surprise to me when Robinhood opened up crypto trading in my state so I just took what I had sitting in my account and invested. I plan on doing a lot more later in the year when I have the money to burn.

Are you feeling stressed, Jen?!

M-A-R-S, Mars bitches!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:43:09
Nah because I care about things other than myself.

....and just after I bought more yesterday.

If you actually believe this then you are not rational.

I was getting killed on this sub just a few days ago for buying at $4000.

I hate to break it to you but taking the bus to the moon is going to take you awhile.

Have no interest in buying newer Lambos but you can’t stop me from buying a Lamborghini Diablo.

I have actually seen a Huracan in hot pink around where I live so someone has already beat you to it.

You forgot the hashtag but I’m not sure you’re in the right sub for that.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:44:09
I’m right there with you but there seems to be a lot of folks on this sub who feel only a fool would be buying now.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:49:33
Tbf, a lot of this is people being prisoners of the moment. People on this sub were mocking me just a few months ago for buying in at $4K so everyone is guilty of it.
